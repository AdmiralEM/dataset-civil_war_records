Report of Col. Edward F. Jones, Sixth Massachusetts Militia.
Hdqrs. 6th Eegiment, 3d Brig., 2d Div., M. Y. M., Capitol, Washington, April 22,1861.
In accordance with Special Orders, No. 6, I proceeded with my command towards the city of Washington, leaving Boston on the evening of the 17th April, arrived in New York on the morning of the 18th, and proceeded to Philadelphia, reaching that place on the same evening.
On our way John Brady, of Company H, Lowell, was taken insane, and deeming it unsafe to have him accompany the regiment, 114ft him at Delanco, N. J., with J. C. Buck, with directions that he should telegraph Mayor Sargent, of Lowell, as • to the disposition of him, and we proceeded thence to Baltimore, reaching that place at noon on the 19th. After leaving Philadelphia I received intimation that our passage through the city of Baltimore would be resisted. I caused ammunition to be distributed and arms loaded, and went personally through the cars, and issued the following order, viz:
The regiment will march through Baltimore in column of sections, arms at will. You will undoubtedly be insulted, abused, and, perhaps, assaulted, to which you must pay no attention whatever, but march with your faces square to the front, and pay no attention to the mob, even if they throw stones, bricks, or other missiles; but if you are fired upon and any one of you is hit, your officers will order you to fire. Do not fire into any promiscuous crowds, but select any man whom you may see aiming at you, and be sure you drop him.
Reaching Baltimore, horses were attached the instant that the locomotive was detached, and the cars were driven at a rapid pace across the city. After the cars containing seven companies had reached the Washington depot the track behind them was barricaded, and the cars containing band and the following companies, viz: Company C, of Lowell, Captain Follansbee; Company D, of Lowell, Captain Hart; Company I, of Lawrence, Captain Pickering, and Company L, of Stone-ham, Captain Dike, were vacated, and they proceeded but a short distance before they were furiously attacked by a shower of missiles, which came faster as they advanced. They increased their steps to double-quick, which seemed to infuriate the mob, as it evidently impressed the mob with the idea that the soldiers dared not Are or had no ammunition, and pistol-shots were numerously fired into the ranks, and one soldier fell dead. The order “Fire” was given, and it was executed. In consequence, several of the mob fell, and the soldiers again advanced hastily. The mayor of Baltimore placed himself at the head of the column beside Captain Follansbee, and proceeded with them a short distance, assuring him that he would protect them, and begging him hot to let the men fire; but the mayor’s patience was soon exhausted, and he

seized a musket from the hands of one of the men and killed a man therewith, and a policeman, who was* in advance of the column, also shot a man with a revolver.
They at last reached the cars, and they started immediately for Washington. On going through the train I found there were about one hundred and thirty missing, including the band and field music. Our baggage was seized, and we have not as yet been able to recover any of it. 1 have found it very difficult to get reliable information in regard to the killed and wounded, but believe there were only three killed, viz:
James Keenan, Company L, Stoneham.
Daniel Stevens, Company D, Lowell.

Captain Dike is in the hands of some brother Masons, and to the Order he owes his life. The others are supposed to be at Baltimore Infirmary.

As the men went into the cars I caused the blinds to the cars to be closed, and took every precaution to prevent any shadow of offense to the people of Baltimore; but still the stones flew thick and fast into the train, and it was with the utmost difficulty that I could prevent the troops from leaving the cars and revenging the death of their comrades.
After a volley of stones some one of the soldiers fired and killed a Mr. Davis, who I have since ascertained by reliable witnesses threw a stone into Ihe car; yet that did not justify the firing at him, but the men were infuriated beyond control. On reaching Washington we were quartered at the Capitol, in the Senate Chamber, and are all in good health and spirits.
I have made every effort to get possession of the bodies of our comrades, but have not yet succeeded. Should I succeed I shall forward them to Boston, if practicable ; otherwise shall avail myself of a kind offer of George Woods, esq., who has offered me a prominent lot in the Congressional burying-ground for the purpose of interment.
We were this day mustered into the United States service, and will forward the rolls at first opportunity after verification.

Extracts from report of the Baltimore Police Commissioners.
Office Board of Police Commissioners,
Baltimore, May 3,1861.
To the honorable the General Assembly of Maryland:
The board of police of the city of Baltimore, created and appointed by your honorable body by the provisions of the fourth article of the Code of Public Local Laws, section 806, &c., deem it their duty respectfully to report:
#######
The board continued from the date of their above report to exercise their regular functions until Friday, the 19th April. On that day a large detachment of, it is understood, about 1,800 men of theMassachu-setts and Pennsylvania Militia arrived in the forenoon in the cfty via the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad. Ko member of the board of police had any information that these troops were expected on that day until from half an hour to one hour of the time at which they were to arrival The marshal of police was immediately notified, and called out at once a large portion of his force.to preserve order^dtirin g their transit through the city. When, they arrived^there were manifestations to interfere with their passage; and after some had been transported by cars through the streets to the Washington depot obstructions were placed on the track in the city which stopped the progress of the

remainder. These alighted to march to the depot, and to prevent any difficulty the mayor placed himself at their head, and they thus proceeded on their route. Missiles were, notwithstanding, thrown at the troops, and some of them were injured. Their assailants were fired upon, and in some instances with fatal effect. An intense and irrepressible feeling appeared to be at once aroused, and repeated conflicts between parties of citizens and the Massachusetts troops took place, several being killed on both sides.
The marshal, who had been on active duty at the Camden-street depot, and did not know that these troops were on their route or expected, hearing of this, hastened to meet them with a force of the police, and under their escort they reached the Washington depot, and after some delay the train finally started for Washington. Attempts were made to hinder it by placing obstructions on the track of the railroad, but by the interference of the police these were soon removed.
The city authorities were meanwhile informed that there had been another arrival of military, who were then at the Philadelphia depot. The marshal of police hastened to that point, and as it was impossible for them at that time to be taken through the streets without a general and bloody conflict, he protected them with a party of his police until they were sent back by the railroad company in the cars to Havre de Grace.
During the afternoon and night a large number of stragglers from some of the above detachments of troops sought the aid and protection of the police; they were safely cared for at the several station-houses, and were sent off in security by the earliest opportunity to Havre de Grace or Philadelphia in the cars.
The same night the board had a meeting, when the opinion was unanimously expressed that it was utterly impossible from the state of the public mind that any more forces from other States could, by any probability, then pass through the city to Washington without a fierce and bloody conflict at every step of their progress, and that whatever might be the result, great loss of life and imminent danger to the safety of the city would necessarily ensue. The board were equally unanimous in their judgment that, as good citizens, it was their duty to the city, and to the State of Maryland, to adopt any measures whatsoever that might be necessary at such a juncture to prevent the immediate arrival in the city of further bodies of troops from the Eastern or Northern States, though the object of the latter might be solely to pass through the city. It was suggested that the most feasible, if not the most practicable, mode of thus stopping for a time the approach of such troops would be to obstruct the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, and the Northern Central Railroads by disabling some of the bridges on both roads. His honor the mayor stated to the board that his excellency the governor, with whom he had a few minutes before been in consultation in the presence of several citizens, concurred in these views; they were likewise those of the board, and instructions were given for carrying them into effect. This was accordingly done. The injury thus done on the railroads amounted to but a few thousand dollars on each; subsequently, as has been stated, further and greater damage was done to other structures on the roads by parties in the country or others, but this was without the sanction or authority of the board, and they have no accurate ipfoaunartiontnit the subject.
The absolute necessity of the measures thus determined upon by the governor, mayor, and police board is fully illustrated by the fact that early on Sunday morning reliable information reached the city of the

presence of a large body of Pennsylvania troops, amounting to about twenty-four hundred men, [who] had reached Ashland, near Cockeys-ville, by the way of the Northern Central Eailroad, and were stopped in their progress toward Baltimore by the partial destruction of the Ashland Bridge. Every intelligent citizen at all acquainted with the state of feeling then existing must be satisfied that if these troops had attempted to march through the city an immense loss of life would have ensued in the conflict which would necessarily have taken place. The bitter feelings already engendered would have been intensely increased by such a conflict; all attempts at conciliation would have been vain, and terrible destruction would have been the consequence, if, as is certain, other bodies of troops had insisted upon forcing their way through the city.
The tone of the whole of the Northern press and of the mass of the population was violent in the extreme. Incursions upon our city were daily threatened, not only by troops in the service of the Federal Government, but by the vilest and most reckless desperadoes, acting independently, and, as they threatened, in despite of the Government, backed by well-known, influential citizens, and sworn to the commission of all kinds of excesses. In short, every possible effort was made to alarm this community. In this condition of things the board felt it to be their solemn duty to continue the organization which had already been commenced for the purpose of assuring the people of Baltimore that no effort would be spared to protect all within its borders to the full extent of their ability. All the means employed were devoted to this end, and with no view of producing a collision with the General Government, which the board were particularly anxious to avoid, and an arrangement was happily effected by the mayor with the General Govemmentthat no troops should be passed through the city. As an evidence of the determination of the board to prevent such collision, a sufficient guard was sent in the neighborhood of Fort McHenry several nights to arrest all parties who might be engaged in a threatened attack upon it, and a steam-tug was employed, jiroperly manned, to prevent any hostile demonstration upon the receiving-ship Allegheny, lying at anchor in the harbor, of all which the United States officers in command were duly notified.
Property of various descriptions, belonging to the Government and individuals, was taken possession of by the police force with a view to its security. The best care has been taken of it. Every effort has been made to discover the rightful owners, and a portion of it has already been forwarded to order. Arrangements have been made with the Government agents satisfactory to them for the portion belonging to it, and the balance is held subject to the order of its owners.
Amidst all the excitement and confusion which has since prevailed, the board take great pleasure in stating that the good order and peace of the city have been preserved to an extraordinary degree. Indeed, to judge from the accounts given by the press of other cities of what has been the state of things in their own communities, Baltimore, during the whole of the past week and up to this date, will compare favorably, as to the protection which persons and property have enjoyed, with any other large city in the United States.
^ All of which is respectfully submitted.	•
By order of the board:	ii ^	,	>

Report of Hon. George William Brown, Mayor of Baltimore.
[Baltimore, Afay 9 (?), 1861.]
2b the honorable the General Assembly of Maryland:
In the report recently made to your honorable body by the board of police commissioners of the city of Baltimore it is stated that, in the great emergency which existed in this city on the 19th ultimo, it was suggested that the most feasible, if not the only practicable, mode of stopping for a time the approach of troops to Baltimore was to obstruct the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore and the Northern Central Bailroads by disabling some of the bridges on both roads; and it is added that u his honor the mayor stated to the board that his excellency the governor, with whom he had a few minutes before been in consultation, in the presence of several citizens, concurred in these views.”
As this concurrence has since been explicitly denied by his Excellency Governor Hicks in an official communication addressed to the senate of Maryland on the 4th instant, which I have just seen, it is due to myself that I should lay before you the grounds on which the statement was made to the board of police, on which they, as well as myself, acted. I seriously regret that so grave a misunderstanding exists between the governor and myself on so important a subject.
On the evening of the 19th ultimo, and after the collision had taken place, I mentioned to Governor Hicks that I had begun to fear it might be necessary to burn the railroad bridges, but I did not then, in consequence of intelligence which had been received, think it would be; to which he replied that he had no authority to give such an order.
At about 11 o’clock p. m. of the same day, the Hon. H. Lenox Bond, George W. Dobbin and John C. Brown, esqs., were requested by Governor Hicks and myself to go to Washington in a special train, which was provided for the purpose, to explain in person the condition of things in Baltimore, and to bear the following communications from Governor Hicks and myself, which were addressed to the President:
Sir : This will be presented to you by the Hon. H. Lenox Bond, George W. Dobbin and John C. Brown, esqrs., who will proceed to Washington by an express train at my request in order to explain fully the fearful condition of affairs in this city. The people are exasperated to the highest degree by the passage of troops, and the citizens are universally decided in the opinion that no more should be ordered to come.
The authorities of the city did their best to-day to protect both strangers and citizens, and to prevent any collision, but in vain; and but for their great efforts a fearful slaughter would have occurred.
Under these circumstances it is my solemn duty to inform you that it is not possible for more soldiers to pass through Baltimore, unless they fight their way at every step.
I therefore hope and trust, and most earnestly request, that no more troops be permitted or ordered by the Government to pass through the city. If they should attempt it the responsibility for the blood shed will not rest upon me.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
GEO. WM. BROWN, Mayor.
The following, from Governor Hicks, was appended to my communication :
To his Excellency Abraham Lincoln,
President of the United States:
I have been iff Blaltilffomninee Tuesday evening last, and co-operated with Mayor G. W. Brown in his unjtirin^.effopto^tO' aUay and prevent the excitement and suppress the fearful outbreak as indicated above, and I fully concur in all that is said by him in the above communication.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
THOMAS II. HICKS, Governor of Maryland.

At about 12 o’clock p. m. the Hon. E. Louis Lowe and Marshal George P. Kane called at my house, where Governor Hicks was passing the night, and Marshal Kane informed me that a telegram had been received that other troops were to come to Baltimore over the Northern Central Railroad. There was also a report that troops were on their way who, it was thought, might even then be at Perryville, on their way to Baltimore. Mr. Lowe, Marshal Kane, my brother, John Gumming Brown, and myself went immediately to the chamber of Governor Hicks and laid the matter before him. The point was pressed that if troops were suddenly to come to Baltimore with a determination to pass through, a terrible collision and bloodshed would take place, and the consequences to Baltimore would be fearful, and that the only way to avert the calamity was to destroy the bridges. To this the governor replied, “It seems to be necessary,” or words to that effect.	*
He was then asked by me whether he gave his consent to the destruction of the bridges, and he distinctly, although apparently with great reluctance, replied in the affirmative. I do not assert that I have given the precise language used by Governor Hicks, but I am very clear that I have stated it with substantial correctness, and that his assent was unequivocal, and in answer to a question by me which elicited a distinct affirmative reply.
After this, but before the interview was over, two gentlemen came into the room, both of them strangers to me, but one was introduced as the brother of Governor Hicks, and I am confident that the assent of the governor to the burning of the bridges was repeated in the presence of those gentlemen.
I went immediately from the chamber of the governor to the office of the marshal of police, where Charles Howard, esq., the president of the board of police, was waiting, and reported to him the assent of the governor to the destruction of the bridges.
Mr. Howard, or some one else, made a further inquiry as to what had been said by the governor, whereupon Mr. Lowe, Marshal Kane, and my brother, John C. Brown, all declared that they were present at the interview and heard Governor Hicks give his assent.
The order to destroy the bridges was accordingly given, and carried out in the manner already reported to your honorable body.
I refer to the accompanying statements of Colonel Kane and Mr. J. C. Brown in confirmation of the correctness of my recollection of what occurred at the interview with Governor Hicks.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
GEO. WM. BROWN, Mayor.

Baltimore, May 9, 1861.
Near the hour of 12 p. m. on Friday, the 19th April, the day on which the collision with the Massachusetts troops occurred, I received intelligence that the president of the Pennsylvania Central Railroad Company had sent a dispatch to a gentleman here that additional troops would pass through Baltimore on their way to the capital.
I immediately sent to the president of the police board the intelligence referred to, and called at the residence of his honor Mayor Brown, to whom I also communicated the	had, received.
The mayor immediately had an interview with the governor, who was then staying at his (mayor’s) house, and afterwards invited me to accompany him to the chamber of his excellency, to whom I communicated the information of the purposed coming of the troops.

[Chap. IX.
A general conversation then ensued, in which it was agreed to by all X>resent that any attempt to pass troops through the city, in the then excited condition of the public mind, would lead to the most fearful consequences, and that any such passage must be prevented or delayed. The governor fully accorded in these views.
The conversation resulted in the governor’s distinctly and unequivocally consenting, in response to the direct question put to him by the mayor, that the bridges on the roads by which the troops were expected to come should be destroyed as the only means of averting the consequences referred to of their coming at that time.
GEO. P. KANE, Marshal.
Baltimore, May 9, 1861.
About 12 o’clock on the night of Friday, 19th April last, I was present when a conversation took place between Governor Hicks and my brother, the mayor of Baltimore, in reference to the best course to be pursued, by which a repetition of the troubles which had occurred on that day could be prevented. It was represented to them by Marshal Kane that troops from the North were on their way to Baltimore, and might by the following morning reach the city.
The destruction of the bridges on the Northern Central and the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroads was, in the opinion of my brother, the best and most effective method to obstruct their progress. In this opinion Governor Hicks fully concurred. When asked by my brother whether or not he gave his consent to the measure, the governor expressed a desire for time for reflection. Being reminded by those present of the lateness of the hour, and the necessity for prompt action, my brother again earnestly appealed to Governor Hicks and asked him for his consent. Governor Hicks’ answer was, in substance, although I may not use his exact words, u I see nothing else to be done.” “But, sir,” said my brother, “I cannot act without your consent; do you give it?” The governor’s reply was distinctly given in the affirmative.
J. CUMMING BROWN.
Frederick, Md., May 10 [f], 1861.
Hon. John C. Brown:
Dear Sir : As reference has been made by his honor the mayor of Baltimore City to my knowledge of the facts connected with the interview between him and the governor of Maryland on the night of the 19th ultimo, it gives me pleasure to furnish the desired statement.
I was present between 11 and 12 o’clock p. m. on Friday, the 19th of April, at the residence of a prominent citizen of Baltimore when Marshal Kane, who was one of the company, received information by one of his officers that a telegram had been sent by the president of the railroad company at Philadelphia, announcing the approach of troops to Baltimore. It was the spontaneous opinion of ajl present that, in the terribly excited condition of the public mind, an attempt to pass troops through the city would inevitably lead to a bloody collision, and perhaps to other very serious consequences. It was therefore proposed to Tepair at once to the office of the marshal of police, and to send immediately for the mayor and governor.
It was supposed at the time that Governor Hicks was stopping at the Fountain Hotel. Marshal Kane asked me to accompany him to Mayor Brown’s house, and the other gentlemen proceeded to the marshal’s office. Marshal Kane and I accordingly went to the mayor’s residence,

and were admitted by his brother, who said that the mayor had retired. In a few moments the mayor came down to the parlor, when Marshal Kane stated to him the substance of the information received, and reminded him of the excited condition of the city, which rendered it imperatively necessary to adopt some prompt and efficient measures to delay the advent of the troops, so as to give time for the Federal Government to be correctly apprised of the state of affairs, and to arrest the threatened danger. For that purpose the partial destruction of the bridges was suggested. Mayor Brown immediately assented to the suggestion as one of absolute necessity, but said that as rna^or of the city his jurisdiction terminated with its corporate limits, and that consequently he could not assume to exercise powers beyond those limits. The mayor added, u The governor, however, is here, and I will go up and see him.” In a few moments he returned and said that Governor Hicks was not well and would therefore receive us in his room. Immediately upon entering the room Mayor Brown and Marshal Kane gave to Governor Hicks a full statement of the matter and solicited his authority to destroy the bridges. Governor Hicks replied that it was a serious affair to undertake to destroy the bridges, and he expressed some doubt as to his authority to give such an order. It was urged in reply that it was a case of absolute self-preservation; that in three or four hours’ time a large body of troops would probably be in the city inflamed with passionate resentment against the people of Baltimore for the assault made on their comrades in the Pratt-street encounter, and that as the city was filled with hundreds of excited men, armed to the teeth, and determined to resist the passage of troops, a fearful slaughter must necessarily ensue, and the safety of the city itself be put in peril, unless by the destruction of the bridges time could be gained to avoid the difficulty by peaceable arrangement of some sort. Governor Hicks fully and most distinctly assented to all this, and said, u Well, I suppose it must be done,” or words of precisely that import, to which the mayor replied, substantially, u Governor, I have no authority to act beyond the city limits, and can do nothing in this matter except by your direction ; shall the bridges be destroyed 1 ” Governer Hicks emphatically and distinctly replied in the affirmative. It is absolutely impossible for any misapprehension to exist on this point.
The mayor, Marshal Kane, and I then proceeded to the marshal’s office, where we found several highly respectable citizens gathered, to whom the mayor and marshal gave a statement of their interview with the governor. The mayor then issued written orders for the destruction of the bridges. The next morning I learned by the newspaper extras that the orders had been carried into effect.
Respectfully, yours, &c.,

who were on their way to the city of Washington in pursuance of a call for 75,000 men made by the President of the United States.
On the day previous troops had been safely passed through the city under the escort of the police. In the afternoon of the same day (18th) the regiments from Massachusetts were expected, and provision was made by the police for their reception $ but they did not arrive, and the board of police could not ascertain when they would come, although two of the members of the board went in person to the station of the Philadelphia Railroad Company to obtain the necessary information.
On the morning of the 19th, about 10 o’clock, I was at my law office engaged in the performance of professional business, when three members of the city council came to me with a message from Marshal Kane, to the effect that he had just learned that the troops were about to arrive, and that he apprehended some disturbance. I immediately hastened to the board of police and gave notice. George M. Gill, esq., counselor of the city, and myself got into a carriage, and drove rapidly to the Camden station, and the police commissioners followed without delay. On reaching Camden station we found Marshal Kane in attendance, and the police coming in squads to the spot. The plan of the agents of the railroad companies was that the troops which were to arrive in the cars at the President-street station should in the same way be conveyed through the city, and be transferred to the cars for Washington at the Camden-street station. Accordingly, the police were requested by the agent of the road to be in attendance at the latter station. After considerable delay the troops began to arrive, and were transferred, under the direction of the police, to the Washington cars as rapidly as possible. There was a good deal of excitement, and a large and angry crowd assembled, but the transfer was safely effected. Ko one could tell whether more troops were expected or not. At this time an alarm was given that a mob was about to tear up the rails in advance of the train on the Washington road, and Marshal Kane ordered some of his men to go out on the road as far as the Relay House, if necessary, to protect the track.
Soon afterwards, and when I was about to leave the station, supposing all danger to be over, news was brought to Commissioner Davis and myself, who were standing together, that other troops were left at the President-street station, and that the mob was tearing up the track on Pratt street. Mr. Davis immediately ran to summon a body of police to be sent to Pratt street, while I hastened alone down Pratt street towards President-street station. On arriving at the head of Smith’s wharf I found that anchors had been piled on the track so as to obstruct it, and Sergeant McComas and a few policemen who were with him were not allowed by the mob to remove the obstruction. I at once ordered the anchors to be removed, and my authority was not resisted.
On approaching Pratt-street bridge I saw several companies of Massachusetts troops, who had left the cars, moving in column rapidly towards me. An attack on them had begun, and the noise and excitement were great. I ran at once to the head of the column, some persons in the crowd shouting, as I approached, u Here comes the mayor.” 1 shook hands with the officer in command, saying, as I did so, u I am the mayor of Baltimore.” I then placed myself by his side and marched with him as far as the head of Light street wharf, doing what I could by my presence and personal efforts to allay the tumult. The mob grew bolder and the attack became more violent. Various persons were killed and wounded on both sides. The troops had some time previously begun to fire in self-defense, and the firing, as the attack increased in violence, became more general. *

At last, when I found that my presence was of no use, either in preventing the contest or saving life, I left the head of the column, but immediately after I did so Marshal Kane, with about fifty policemen, from the direction of the Camden station, rushed to the rear of the troops, forming a line across the street and with drawn revolvers checking and keeping off the mob. The movement, which I saw myself, was perfectly successful and gallantly perforated. I submit herewith Marshal Kane’s account of the affair, published on the 4th of May last,* which substantially agrees with my own.
It is doing bare justice to say that the board of police, the marshal of police, and the men under his command, exerted themselves bravely, efficiently, skillfully, and in good faith to preserve the peace and protect life. If proper notice had been given of the arrival of the troops and of the number expected, the outbreak might have been prevented entirely; and but for the timely arrival of Marshal Kane with his force, as I have described, the bloodshed would have been great. The wounded among the troops received the care and medical attention at the expense of the city, and the bodies of the killed were carefully and respectfully returned to their friends.
The facts which I witnessed myself, and all that I have since heard, satisfy me that the attack was the result of a sudden impulse, and not of a premeditated scheme. But the effect on our citizens was for a time uncontrollable. In the intense excitement which ensued, which lasted for many days, and which was shared by men of all parties, and by our volunteer soldiers as well as citizens, it would have been impossible to convey more troops from the North through the city without a severe fight and bloodshed. Such an occurrence would have been fatal to the city, and accordingly to prevent it the bridges on the Northern Central Bailroad and on the .Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Bail-road were, with the consent of the governor and by my order, with the co-operation of the board of police (except Mr. Charles D. Hinks, who was absent from the city), partially disabled and burned, so as to prevent the immediate approach of troops to the city, but with no purpose of hostility to the Federal Government. This act, with the motive which prompted it, has been reported by the board of police to the legislature of the State and approved by that body, and was also immediately communicated by me in person to the President of the United States and his Cabinet. I inclose a copy of the report made by the board of police to the legislature on the 3d of May last, t
On the evening of the 19th of April, a portion of the military of the city were called out. On the 20th of April, your honorable body, by a unanimous vote, placed at myr disposal the sum of $500,000 for the defense of the city, and the banks, with great patriotism and unanimity, voluntarily offered to advance the money through a committee of their presidents, consisting of Messrs. Columbus O’Donnell, Johns Hopkins, and John Clark, who notified me, in person, of the fact, on the morning of the 20th of April, at the mayor’s office. A number of citizens in all the wards volunteered for the purpose of defense, and were enrolled under the direction of the board of police; and for their use arms were partially provided. The Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the United States, with the approbation of the President, in view of the condition of affairs then existing in the city, on the earnest application of the governor of the State, of prominent citizens, and myself, ordered that hereafter the troops should not be brought through Baltimore, and

they were accordingly transported to Washington by way of Annapolis. But great danger existed to Baltimore from large bodies of unauthorized men at the North, who threatened to cut their way through the city, and visit upon it terrible vengeance for the acts of the 10th of April.
As soon as this danger had passed away, and the excitement among our own citizens had sufficiently subsided, the military were dismissed, and the citizens who enrolled were disbanded by order of the board of police. The peace of the city had been preserved, and its safety and the persons and property of men, and men of all parties, protected under the circumstances of great peril and’the most intense excitement, and it was hoped that affairs would be allowed to return as nearly as possible to their previous condition. To this end my efforts and those of the board were devoted. Large bodies of troops from the North have ever since passed through the city without molestation, and every proper precaution to accomplish that object was taken by the board of police, and carried out by the force.
But civil war had begun on the immediate border of our State. A great division of opinion in regard to it existed among the people, and the events which had occurred in the city, and their consequences, seem to have made an indelible impression on the minds of the authorities at Washington that the police force of the city of Baltimore was prepared to engage in hostility against the General Government whenever an opportunity should occur.
The result has been very unfortunate. On the ground of military necessity, of the existence of which and of the measures required of it the Federal officers claim to be the sole judges, our city has been occupied by large bodies of troops in its central points ; picket guards have been stationed along many of our streets; the arms provided by the city for its defense and those left by private individuals with the authorities for safe-keeping, the station-houses and other property of the city have been seized; operators in the police and fire-alarm telegraph office have been displaced and others substituted in their stead; the marshal of police and the board of police, with the exception of myself, have been arrested and are now imprisoned in Fort McHenry, one only, who is in bad health, has been released on his parole; the writ of habeas corpus has been suspended; the police force, established under a law of the State, has been set aside by superseding the only power which could lawfully control it; a new police, without authority of law, has been established under the control of a marshal appointed by the commanding general, and all power to hold elections in the city has been for the present set aside by suspending the functions of the board under which alone elections can lawfully be held.
The grounds taken by Major-General Banks as a justification for these proceedings, and the position assumed by the board of police, respectively, will be found in the proclamations of the general and the protest of the board, which I inclose.*
The hidden deposits of arms and ammunition referred to in the proclamation of June 27 are, I suppose, those found in the city hall, in reference to which a few words of explanation may be made. The arms consisted in part of muskets which belonged to the old police, established under the administration of Mr. Swann; of revolvers procured for the police, and of some rifles, carbines, &c., lately procured in part for the use of the police and in part for the defense of the city. The board of police considered it proper that there should be a sufficient.

number of efficient weapons to arm the entire police force in case of an emergency. There were not enough in the city hall for that purpose. An allegation has been made that some of the arms and ammunition belonged to the Massachusetts troops; but I am informed that this is not the case, except as to two muskets which were taken by the police from the hands of the mob. The ammunition at the hall, which was purchased for the defense of the city, was more than was entirely safe. Of this I was well aware, and should have ordered it to be removed if the city had any proper place of deposit; but I apprehended that any attempt at removal at this time would only lead to a seizure on the part of the officers of the General Government and to unfounded rumors and suspicions; for all the rest of the arms and ammunition belonging to the city, and all the arms left with the city authorities for safe keeping, which were placed in depositories procured expressly for the purpose and in no way concealed, had been previously seized by the authorities of the United States under circumstances very mortifying to the pride of the people. That some of the arms and ammunition were concealed about the building is sufficiently explained by the fact that the officers in charge desired to secure them from seizure, but such concealment was made without my knowledge.
The proclamation charges the existence of unlawful combinations of men organized for the resistance to the laws, for accumulating hidden deposits of arms, and encouraging contraband trade.
Although I am only ex officio member of the board, and by reason of other engagements not able to be present at all their meetings, yet, from the free and full interchange of views among us, and the custom of the members to consult me on all important questions, and my knowledge of all their proceedings, I feel that I have a right to say, of my own personal knowledge, that the board had no notice or information of any such combination, if any such existed, which I have no reason to suspect.
Indeed, my experience of the fidelity of the board to its legal obligations during my whole official connection with it, and the common understanding between myself and my colleagues as to our course of duty since the present troubles began, justify me in saying that if any organization in this city for resistance to the laws could have been discovered by proper vigilance they would have been found out and suppressed to the extent of the powers conferred on the board by law.
After the board of police had been superseded, and its members arrested by the order of General Banks, I proposed, in order to relieve the serious complications which had arisen, to proceed, as the only member left free to act, to exercise the power of the board as far as an individual member could do so. Marshal Kane, while he objected to the propriety of this course, was prepared to place his resignation in my hands whenever I should request it; and the majority of the board interposed no objection to my pursuing such course as I might deem it right and proper to adopt in view of the existing circumstances, and upon my own responsibility, until the board should be enabled to resume the exercise of its functions.
If this arrangement could have been effected it would have continued in the exercise of their duties the police force, which is lawfully enrolled, and which has won the confidence and applause of all good citizens by its fidelity and impartiality at all times and under all circumstances. But the arrangement was not satisfactory to the Federal .authorities.
As the men of the police force, through no fault of theirs, are now

[Chap. IX.
prevented from discharging their duty, their pay constitutes a legal claim on the city, from which, in my opinion, it cannot be relieved.
The new force which has been enrolled is in direct violation of the law of the State; and no money can be appropriated by the city for its support without incurring the heavy penalties provided by the act of assembly. Officers in the fire-alarm and police telegraph department, who are appointed by the mayor and city council and not by the board of police, have been discharged, and others have been substituted in their place.
I mention these facts with profound sorrow, and with no purpose whatever of increasing the difficulties unfortunately existing in this city, but because it is your right to be acquainted with the true condition of affairs, and because I cannot help entertaining the hope that redress will yet be afforded by the authorities of the United States upon a proper representation made by you. I am entirely satisfied that the suspicion entertained of any meditated hostility on the part of the city authorities against the General Government is wholly unfounded, and, with the best means of knowledge, express the confident belief and conviction that there is no organization of any kind among the people for such a purpose. I have no doubt that the officers of the United States have acted on information, which they deemed reliable, obtained from our own citizens, some of whom may be deluded by their fears, while others are actuated by baser motives ; but suspicions thus derived can, in my judgment, form no sufficient justification for what I deem to be grave and alarming violations of the rights of individual citizens, of the city of Baltimore, and of the State of Maryland.
Very respectfully,
GEO. WM. BROWN, Mayor.
No. 5.
Statement of George M. Gill.
Baltimore, July 12,1861.
Hon. Geo. Wm. Brown, Mayor of the City of Baltimore:
In your communication to the city council of yesterday, which I did not see until after it was communicated to the council, you refer to the fact that I accompanied you on Friday, April 19, to the Camden station. There were some additional circumstances which I deem it proper to state. You desired me to accompany you, hoping that I might aid in preventing any violence on that day, or interruption to the troops then about to pass through, in case any should be attempted. Your impression was that no such attempt would be made, but nevertheless you thought every precaution should be taken, in case of any such attempt, to resist it. For the sole purpose of doing this I accompanied you.
After we reached the Camden station there were manifestations of excitement among the crowd there assembled, and the police commissioners (excepting Mr. Sinks, then absent from the city) gave directions to Marshal Kane, in my presence, to use his whole force in keeping order and protecting the troops from being interrupted. The reply of Marshal Kane then made was, that if he and his whole force lost their lives the troops should be protected.
After the first of the troops reached Camden station a rush of people, was made at the cars in which they then were, but the police interfered

NORFOLK NAVY-YARD, VA.
21
and drove them off. A cry was then raised to tear np the track outside of the Camden station, and a rush was made to accomplish this purpose; but the police again interfered, and prevented this from being done.
I supposed for some time that all the troops would pass in safety, and such was my anxious wish, and to the extent of my ability I united in the effort to produce this result.
While I was at Camden station the events on Pratt street took place, none of which did I see, and therefore cannot speak of them further than I saw at a distance, and heard the firing of the troops as they passed up Pratt street.
My impression on that day was and still is that the events arose from a sudden impulse which seized upon some of our people, and that after the firing commenced and blood was shed many persons took part under an impression that the troops were killing our people, and without knowing the circumstances of provocation which induced the troops to fire. Matters reached their height after Mr. Davis was killed, and the intense excitement resulting from this and other causes produced a state of feeling which for a time was beyond control on the part of the city authorities.
On Sunday, the 21st of April, whilst you were in Washington, where you had been summoned by the President, a regiment arrived from Pennsylvania, but were fortunately stopped at Coekeysville, about 14 miles off, by the disabled bridge at that point. Any rational man who witnessed the condition of things in Baltimore on that day can judge of the sad consequences which would have followed if the regiment had entered the city.
Yours, very respectfully,
GEO. M. GILL.
APRIL 20, 1861.—Expedition to the Norfolk navy-yard, Va,, and attempt to blow np the dry-dock.
Report of Capt. H. G. Wriglit, Z7. 8. Engineer Corps.
Washington, D. C., April 26,1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to report that, in obedience to the instructions [following] received from the headquarters of the Army on the 19th instant, I proceeded on the evening of the same day, on the United States steamer Pawnee, to Port Monroe, where we arrived the next day at about 2 o’clock p. m., and communicated with commanding officer, Colonel Dimiek. The object of the expedition was to secure to the United States, if possible, the navy-yard and property at Norfolk, with the ships of war then in that harbor; and, in furtherance of that object, my instructions authorized me to call upon the commanding officer at Port Monroe for such force, to the extent of one regiment, as he could spare from the garrison without jeopardizing the safety of the fort. He accordingly assigned to the expedition one of the two regiments which had that morning arrived. This regiment, about 370 strong, under Colonel Wardrop, was promptly marched on board, and late in the afternoon the steamer proceeded to Norfolk, where she arrived some time after dark the same evening, the 20th instant.
On reaching the yard it was found that all the ships afloat except the Cumberland had been scuttled, by order of Commodore McCauley, the commandant of the yard, to prevent their seizure by the Virginia forces,

[Chap. IX.
and that they were fast sinking. One of the objects of the expedition— that of removing those vessels and taking them to sea—was therefore frustrated.
On reporting to the commodore of the yard, I found him disposed to defend the yard and property to the last, and the troops were accordingly landed and some dispositions for defense taken. It was soon determined, however, by Commodore Paulding, who had come on the Pawnee from Washington, to finish the destruction of the scuttled ships, to burn and otherwise destroy, as far as practicable, the property in the yard, and withdraw with the frigate Cumberland, in tow of the Pawnee and a steam-tug which was lying at the yard.
To Commander John Rodgers, of the Navy, and myself was assigned the duty of blowing up the dry-dock, assisted by forty men of the volunteers and a few men from the crew of the Pawnee. The dock, which is a massive structure of granite masonry, has a pumping gallery running along the back of one of the side walls, entering from the level of the bottom near the entrance gate, and terminating, as is understood, in the pumping-house, near the farther end of the dock. Under the circumstances of want of time for preparation and the darkness of night this gallery offered the only means for the establishment of a mine. Had the dock been full of water this advantage could not have been availed of, but we found in it a depth of only about two feet. We accordingly proceeded to construct in this gallery a platform of such materials as could be collected to a height above the surface of the water, and on this we placed the powder (2,000 pounds) which we had brought from the ship, established a train from the gallery to the outside, and connected with it four separate slow matches.
Everything being arranged, all the men were sent to the ship, except one of the crew of the Pawnee, who was retained to watch for the signal from the commodore for lighting the matches and returning to the ship. On the signal, the matches were lighted by Captain Rodgers and myself, and we made the best of our way towards the landing, but before we could reach it the flames of the burning buildings had become so intense, that the boats had undoubtedly been driven oft*, and, indeed, we could not approach it. After some delay we succeeded in getting out of the yard through the burning gateway, and seized a boat, in the hope of making our escape by the river. We had proceeded but a short distance, however, when several shots were fired at us from the Portsmouth side, and as the armed force was rapidly accumulating against us at a point below, where the river was narrow, and where we should have had to pass within effective musket range, we concluded to land on the Norfolk side and deliver ourselves up to the commanding general of the Virginia forces. He received us very kindly and courteously, and on giving him our parole he provided us with comfortable quarters at the Atlantic Hotel. This was on Sunday morning, about 6 o’clock. On Monday, at noon, he sent us with an officer to Richmond, where we were most kindly treated by the governor and his family, and by the gentlemen there present from the various parts of Virginia. We remained as guests of the governor, on parole, till Wednesday, the 24th, when we were released, and on Thursday morning we left for Washington.
To Governor Letcher our especial thanks are due for the uniform kindness and consideration with which he treated us. Probably to protect us from any annoyance from the populace of Richmond he accompanied us to the cars at 6 o’clock in the morning, and to further shield us from possible annoyance along the road he detailed two officers of the Virginia forces to conduct us safe to Washington, where we arrived yesterday, between 4 and 5 o’clock p. m.

From what we could learn in Norfolk, I am of opinion that the attempt to destroy the dock did not succeed. We were told that the mine did explode and that it did not. Three separate explosions took place after we got clear of the yard, one of which I presumed at the time to have been the dock mine, yet after considering all the contradictory rumors it seems probable that the structure is uninjured.
In addition to this report, I desire to submit a rather more extended narrative, which may possess some interest hereafter.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Capt. H. G. Wright, Corps of Engineers, Washington;
Sir : You are selected as an engineer officer of high science and judgment, to repair promptly to the United States navy-yard at Gosport, Va., and to tender your professional services to the commodore there in command in designing and executing a plan of defense for the same.
You will find the commodore instructed by his Department to expect you in your professional capacity.
I think it best that you should first call at Fort Monroe and consult Colonel Dimick on sending a portion of its garrison to assist in the defense of the navy-yard.
If two volunteer regiments shall have joined him, he may spare one of them for that purpose perhaps, but this must depend on the threatening circumstances about him; and if but one volunteer regiment has joined, the colonel may, after consulting you, deem it safe to detach two or three companies of regulars for duty at the navy-yard. Show him this letter, and give him a copy of it for his warrant.
Both of you will bear in mind that, although the navy-yard and its contents are deemed to be of very great importance, Fort Monroe is still more so to the Union.
You will lose no opportunity of reporting to the Adjutant-General your progress in carrying out these instructions.

I report, in this connection, that I know the fact that Colonel Taylor received that letter of instruction upon the arrival of the messenger at Alexandria, on the 5th instant, by the regular train from this place on the morning of that day. Mr. F. G. Skinner, now hero, and who was on the 5th instant in Alexandria, is my authority for the above statement ; and Mr. Skinner tells me that he saw that letter of instruction in the hands of Colonel Taylor, and discussed with him the purport of it prior to the movement of the troops out of Alexandria on the afternoon or evening of that day (yesterday). I this day sent by telegraph to the commanding general-in-chief a full abstract of the only letter or communication I have received from Colonel Taylor alluding to or explaining the movement of the troops out of Alexandria. Nor have I been able, from any other source, except that furnished me by the arrival of Mr. Skiuner, direct from Alexandria, by the train of this morning, to learn the cause of that movement; and, so far as I am informed up to this moment, there was no proper or justifiable cause whatsoever for any such movement. After waiting for further intelligence and receiving none, and duly considering and weighing all the circumstances and bearing of that movement with the information before me, I have ordered the return of the troops, as communicated by telegram, a duplicate of which has just been transmitted to the general-in-chief.

You will use your cavalry and infantry in this connection, and, under these orders, which I have full authority from headquarters at Bich-mond for giving to you, keep up your communications with the various parts in your rear, so as to call every resource to your aid and support in making a gallant and fighting retreat, should you be forced to it, and can stand at all without danger of uselessly sacrificing your command.

Sir : After writing you last night, and having previously ascertained during the day and up to 10 o’clock p. m. last night that I could not communicate with the command of Colonel Taylor after Colonel Terrett left Alexandria, to go to him at Springfield, because, after several attempts, through the telegraph operator at Alexandria, to send a dispatch through various persons, none of whom could be found in Alexandria, and when the operator finally advised me that not one single man connected with the military had been left to speak to me through the wires, I immediately determined to send one of my aides, Giles B. Cooke, to put myself in communication with Colonels Taylor and Terrett; and, accordingly, Mr. Cooke left me at 2 o’clock last night, by an extra train, bearing copies of the telegrams which I had failed to put through to Colonel Terrett, because of his departure from Alexandria for Spring-field, no one having been left at Alexandria in whom I could confide and through whom 1 might have transmitted it; and bearing also a letter of instructions sent by me to Colonel Terrett, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. Mr. Cooke will proceed to Alexandria with dispatch, after having communicated with Colonel Terrett, and will once more enable me to have one person at least in Alexandria with whom I can converse through the wires. He is instructed to give me information upon which I can rely the moment of his arrival at Alexandria.
Yery respectfully,

Colonel Terrett,
Commanding Troops at or near Alexandria, Va.:
Sir : I have endeavored up to this moment to communicate with you by telegraph, through Alexandria, and learn through the operator there that not one single military man has been left at that end of the wire. I send Mr. Cooke, my second aide, by extra train, to put me in communication with you and your command, and to convey to you the substance of telegrams which have been stopped in Alexandria in the hands of the operator. By these you will find that I am not informed of any circumstance whatsoever that could have furnished just and sufficient cause, or any cause at all, for the movement of the troops out of Alexandria; and, as all my orders from headquarters, and all my own purposes in accordance therewith, and my late order to Colonel Taylor, enjoined the holding of the troops in Alexandria until absolutely driven out by force of arms, and even then to retire fighting, if possible without endangering the unneccessary destruction of your force, I must therefore now order that the troops return to Alexandria, if it be practicable, and if any movement of the enemy has taken place unknown to me, and which

would render that return impracticable and really dangerous, and if, as I believe, no such movement has taken place, return the troops to the position they occupied with as little delay as possible. If, however, there has been any new and threatening movement by the enemy unknown to me, and which in your judgment may render it impracticable or imprudent to return to Alexandria, communicate the fact to me, and, in the mean time, exercise a sound discretion as to' your acting.

Sir : I have just received your communication of this date, calling upon me, by order of the general-in-chief, to give in writing my “reasons 77 and u causes” why I retired from Alexandria with the troops under my command.
In the first place, because of the inefficient condition of a large proportion of the trpops and my exposed and indefensible position. Under my command there were two companies of raw Irish recruits, numbering about one hundred and twenty privates in both, armed with the altered flint-lock muskets of 1818, and without cartridges or caps; Captain Devaughn’s company (Mount Vernon Guards), eighty-six privates,

﻿Chap. IX.]
AFFAIR AT GLOUCESTER POINT, VA.
27
armed with the new musket—fifty-two men without accouterments and fifteen without arms, and very little ammunition ; Captain Simpson’s company of rifles, numbering in all fifty-three, and well armed with the minie rifle, and about nine rounds of ammunition complete; Captain Herbert’s company of rifles, numbering eighty-five, rank and file, armed with the minie rifle, and with an average of five rounds of cartridges and four of caps 5 Captain Ball’s company of cavalry, numbering forty privates, armed with carbines and sabers, and with a very limited amount of ammunition$ Captain Powell’s company of cavalry, numbering about thirty, and twenty-two horses, no arms or equipments of any kind except a few of Colt’s revolvers.
In the second place, the men were becoming almost useless from home influences. All but Captain Simpson’s company belonged to Alexandria (and were necessarily scattered over the city), and it would have been impossible to have assembled the command at any particular point in time to have defended itself with the slightest possibility of success, or even to have made anything but a disastrous and demoralizing retreat in the face of an enemy.
In the third place, I was possessed of, apparently, such reliable information that the Government at Washington would occupy Alexandria on the 6th or 7th instant, and knowing that a large force was being concentrated at Fort Washington and that two steamers were anchored off Mount Yernon, I was induced to suppose that from that point an attempt would be made, in concert with a force from Washington City, to hem in my small and inefficient command, and thereby the services of good material be lost to my State and our cause.
I inclose herewith an order,* which was obtained secretly by Mr. J. D. Hutton, who was formerly employed in the War Department, and which shows the intention of the Federal Government as to Alexandria. The foregoing are my reasons and the causes for retiring to Springfield, and, in addition to which, from that position I could the more successfully assist in breaking up and destroying the road.
Very respectfully,
A. S. TAYLOR,
Lieutenant-Colonel, Virginia Volunteers.

Colonel : I have been informed by Flag Officer Pendergrast that on the 7th instant a battery of three guns was discovered at Gloucester Point, on the York River, nearly opposite Yorktown. One of the small steamers attached to the Home Squadron (the Yankee) exchanged several shots with it yesterday, but as there was one 8-inch gun in the battery and those of the steamer were of much shorter range her commander hauled off.
With regard to the force necessary here, the portions of the surrounding country which should be occupied, and the defenses erected for the

protection of the fort, the commanding general and General Totten are much better able to judge than myself. It appears to me, however, that the sand hills, some two thousand yards from the fort, should be occupied and a battery built there. To do this will require a larger force than I have at my disposal. Colonel De Bussy suggests that a battery should be erected near the picket bridge, on the Hampton side. In the vicinity is a spring (apparently inexhaustible) of fine water, which may be of the highest importance, though with the present command I entertain no apprehension of a scarcity of water, as, in addition to the supply in the fort, there is a large quantity at the hotel.
The mail-boat from Baltimore was allowed to land the mails here yesterday, and the mail for Norfolk sent there in the steamer William Sel-den. She has not, however, returned, and I presume has been seized.
I inclose herewith a copy of a letter which was yesterday transmitted by mail, and will add that I cannot urge too strongly the necessity of immediately authorizing the repairing of the wharves and of sending the laborers asked for.

Report of Brig. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, Massachusetts Militia.
Headquarters Department of Annapolis,
Federal Hill, Baltimore, Afay 15, 1861.
I received your telegram this morning, and hasten to reply in detail.
In obedience to verbal directions, received from the War Department through Mr. Harriman at 1J o’clock on Monday [12th instant], at the Relay Station, I caused a portion of the force there situated—that is to say, 500 men of the Sixth Massachusetts Eegiment, under Colonel Jones; 450 men of the Eighth New York Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Waterbury; and a section of Cook’s battery, with Major Cook—to march for Baltimore at 6 o’clock.
We disembarked from the cars without difficulty, and took possession of Federal Hill amid the plaudits of many of the people and a violent thunder-storm. We were disturbed during the night by a report of a riot, in which the United States recruiting regiment was being attacked. This called us to arms about midnight, and the men so remained until morning in a drenching rain with the utmost patience. It turned out upon investigation that this was only a feint of the secessionists to cover a plundering of a quantity of arms between 1 and 2 o’clock from those stored by the city nearly opposite the custom-house.
Thus the carrying off of some four or five hundred stand of arms was accomplished by the police under the direction of the board of police. I found certain other arms being shipped, apparently for improper purposes, to a place called Snow Hill. I have sent out and brought in forty minie rifles. The remaining arms stored opposite the customhouse, amounting to twenty-seven hundred stand, I have caused to be seized and sent to Fort McHenry. I have caused Mr. Ross Winans to be arrested and sent to Annapolis; but for greater safety, as I have no place of confinement save a jail, I shall cause him* to be removed to Fort McHenry, there to await the action of the civil authorities, unless otherwise ordered. I have found several manufactories of arms, supplies, and munitions of war for the rebels, who are being constantly supplied from the city.
A specimen of an explosive minie rifle-ball, the experiments with which, under Crosby, at Woolwich, were so satisfactory, I herewith inclose for your inspection. This manufactory (carried on, I am ashamed to say, by a Massachusetts man) I shall cause to be stopped. I propose this morning to seize a quantity of powder stored in Greenmount Cemetery, of which I will report to you. I had an interview with the mayor and some other gentlemen. He informed me that he did not consider it the duty of the city authorities actively to co-operate in preventing the forwarding of arms and munitions of war to the rebels.
I have issued a proclamation, a copy of which I inclose [No. 3], and which I trust you will approve. It became necessary, in my judgment, in order to set right the thousand conflicting stories and rumors of the intentions of the Government as to Baltimore, which were taken advantage of by the mob to incite insubordination and encourage a spirit of insurrection, and which showed itself upon our taking possession of the Government arms, but was instantly suppressed upon a show of force.
I have not assumed to order re-enforcements from General Patterson. I have no need of either them or him, and can get. along very well without either, with accustomed deliberation. I have had no report of the arrival of his troops early this morning. I have received no letter from

the Lieutenant General for many days, and the first telegram this morning, to which I have replied with some degree of promptness. General Shriver, at Frederick, has telegraphed me frequently for aid to protect Monocacy Bridge. I sent his telegram to the Lieutenant-General, asking for instructions, and that is the telegram misunderstood. I have provided for the safety of my camp at the Belay. I have asked for and obtained the Eighth Massachusetts Begiment from General Mansfield, on the promise that he should receive in their stead the Eighth New York.
From some unexplained reason General Mansfield retained from the Eighth Massachusetts their camp equipage, which is the property of the State of Massachusetts, which retention has somewhat disordered my plans. But the Eighth Massachusetts are at the camp at the Belay House, and unless I have entirely mistaken my men, they, together with the balance of Jones’ Sixth Begiment and that part of the New York Eighth (consisting of about five hundred men) which I have left there, together with two sections of Cook’s battery, will be able to hold that point against all comers, if not in safety, with success. I should be deeply grieved if in any of my acts I should exceed propriety of action by going either too fast or too far. I shall await and obey instructions implicitly, and keep the General-in-Chief advised of every movement so far as possible, so that I may have the instructions and directions to which the country looks for control and safety in the peril of the hour.
I have the honor to announce further the completion of the railroad connection between Washington and tide-water at Annapolis. With the means of transportation now provided, we can move 5,000 troops daily between Washington and Annapolis. As soon as I receive further communication I will send a more detailed report. I have also the honor to communicate the capture of the steam gun, and the fact that I have found men in the Sixth Massachusetts Begiment who have been able to put it in operation, and it is now in full working order.

Department of Annapolis,
Federal Hill, Baltimore, May 14, 1861.
A detachment of the forces of the Federal Government under my command have occupied the city of Baltimore for the purpose, among other things, of enforcing respect and obedience to the laws, as well of the State—if requested thereto by the civil authorities—as of the United States laws, which are being violated within its limits by some malignant and traitorous men, and in order to testify the acceptance by the Federal Government of the fact that the city and all the well-intentioned portion of its inhabitants are loyal to the Union and the Constitution, and are to be so regarded and treated by all. To the end, therefore, that all misunderstanding of the purpose of the Government may be prevented, and to set at rest all unfounded, false, and seditious rumors; to relieve all apprehensions, if any are felt, by the well-disposed por-

tion of the community, and to make it thoroughly understood by all traitors, their aiders and abettors, that rebellious acts must cease, I hereby, by the authority vested in me as commander of the Department of Annapolis, of which Baltimore forms a part, do now command and make known that no loyal and well-disposed citizen will be disturbed in his lawful occupation or business; that private property will not be interfered with by the men under my command, or allowed to be interfered with by others, except in so far as it may be used to afford aid and comfort to those in rebellion against the Government, whether here or elsewhere, all of which property, munitions of war, and that fitted to aid and support the rebellion, will be seized and held subject to confiscation 5 and, therefore, all manufacturers of arms and munitions of war are hereby requested to report to me forthwith, so that the lawfulness of their occupation may be known and understood, and all misconstruction of their doings be avoided. No transportation from the city to the rebels of articles fitted to aid and support troops in the field will be permitted, and the fact of such transportation, after the publica-. tion of this proclamation, will be taken and received as proof of illegal intention on the part of the consignors, and will render the goods liable to seizure and confiscation.
The Government being ready to receive all such stores and supplies, arrangements will be made to contract for them immediately, and the owners and manufacturers of such articles of equipments and clothing and munitions of war and provisions are desired to keep themselves in communication with the Commissary-General, in order that their workshops may be employed for loyal purposes, and the artisans of the city resume and carry on their profitable occupations.
The acting assistant quartermaster and commissary of subsistence of the United States here stationed has been instructed to proceed and furnish at fair prices 40,000 rations for the use of the Army of the United States, and further supplies will be drawn from the city to the full extent ot its capacity, if the patriotic and loyal men choose so to furnish supplies.
All assemblages, except the ordinary police, of armed bodies of men, other than those regularly organized and commissioned by the State of Maryland, and acting under the orders of the governor thereof, for drill and other purposes, are forbidden within the department.
All officers of the militia of Maryland having command within the limits of the department are requested to report through their officers forthwith to the general in command, so that he may be able to know and distinguish the regularly commissioned and loyal troops of Maryland from armed bodies who may claim to be such.
The ordinary operations of the corporate government of the city of Baltimore and of the civil authorities will not be interfered with, but, on the contrary, will be aided by all the power at the command of the general, upon proper call being made, and all such authorities are cordially invited to co-operate with the general in command to carry out the purposes set forth in the proclamation, so that the city of Baltimore may be shown to the country to be, what she is in fact, patriotic and loyal to the Union, the Constitution, and the laws.
No flag, banner, ensign, or device of the so-called Confederate States, or any of them, will be permitted to be raised or shown in this department, and the exhibition of either of them by evil-disposed persons will be deemed and taken to be evidence of a design to afford aid and comfort to the enemies of the country. To make it more apparent that the Government of the United States by far more relies upon the loyalty, pa-

triotism, and zeal of the good citizens of Baltimore and vicinity than upon any exhibition of force calculated to intimidate them into that obedience to the laws which the Government doubts not will be paid from inherent respect and love of order, the commanding general has brought to the city with him, of the many thousand troops in the immediate neighborhood, which might be at once concentrated here, scarcely more than an ordinary guard, and until it fails him, he will continue to rely upon that loyalty and patriotism of the citizens of Maryland which have never yet been found wanting to the Government in time of need. The general in command desires to greet and treat in this part of his department all the citizens thereof as friends and brothers, having a common purpose, a common loyalty, and a common country. Any infractions of the law by the troops under his command, or any disorderly, unsoldierlike conduct, or any interference with private property, he desires to have immediately reported to him, and pledges himself that if any soldier so far forgets himself as to break those laws that he has sworn to defend and enforce, he shall be most rigorously punished.
The general believes that if the suggestions and requests contained in this proclamation are faithfully carried out by the co-operation of all good and Union-loving citizens, and peace and quiet and certainty of future peace and quiet are thus restored, business will resume its accustomed channels, trade take the place of dullness and inactivity, efficient labor displace idleness, and Baltimore will be in fact, what she is entitled to be, in the front rank of the commercial cities of the nation.

The enemy fired on the unfinished battery at SewelPs Point on the 18th, but did no damage. There were at that time no guns mounted or nearer than Norfolk. I sent forward three guns immediately and two of the rifled cannon. Got them in position at 5 p. m. on the 19th. Soon after the enemy opened fire, which was returned and kept up one and a half hours, when the vessel from which the guns were fired withdrew. A fuller report will be made to-morrow. Just returned from SewelPs Point. Reports in from the pickets at all points.
No immediate attack apprehended. Troops thrown forward and in position. Confident of making defense good. I am strengthening, to some extent, my position. Want six hundred laborers, and am reenforcing the batteries, which takes off so many men that additional troops are required.

R. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General Virginia Forces.

May 20, 1861.
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that, late in the evening of the 18th instant, I received intelligence of an attack, made by the enemy’s steamer Monticello, on the unfinished works at SewelPs Point. This battery was not sufficiently advanced at the time to receive its armament and garrison. The Monticello carried three guns, one of which was a heavy 10-inch Dahlgren. With these she kept up a constant fire with solid shot and shell for more than an hour, when a steam-tug, from Old Point, carrying one gun, came to her aid, and the two vessels continued the cannonade until the close of the day, without any serious injury to the works. The tug then returned to Old Point, and the Monticello moored, with broadside on, with the intention, apparently, of continuing the attack, in order to demolish the works or prevent their progress. Early on the morning of the 19th I hurried on the guns and equipment, and repaired to SewelPs Point, to expedite the works for their reception, and by 5 p. m. succeeded in getting three 32-pounders and two small rifled guns into position, while detachments of infantry and artillery, ordered from neighboring posts, occupied the battery and contiguous points. During all this time the Monticello, apparently not suspecting the operations going forward, was engaged in preparing for another effort, by calculating the range and distance and adjusting her guns to suit. With instructions to Captain Colquitt, of Georgia, to whom I gave the command of all the forces and guns at the post, to continue 3 R R—vul II

the preparations, reserving his fire until the enemy renewed the cannonade, I returned to Norfolk. At 5.30 o’clock the Monticello again opened fire from all her guns, and with much greater precision than on the preceding day. It was instantly returned, and with such effect that she was driven off and returned to Old Point. The engagement continued ior an hour and a half without intermission on either side, and, though the enemy’s fire was well directed, one shell bursting within an embrasure and several others directly over the battery, while solid shot repeatedly passed through the embrasures and struck the crest and sides of the merlons, hurling masses of earth from the outside among the gunners, I am happy to inform you that no casualty of moment occurred to the troops, nor was material injury done to the battery. What damage or loss was sustained by the enemy I was not able to discover, but his retreat indicated that our fire had become too warm for further endurance. As early as I received information of the second attack and repulse, I ordered forward more troops, and hastened, during the night, to Sewell’s Point, to make such other dispositions as might be necessary to deiend the post against any further and more formidable assaults which the enemy’s large naval and military forces at Old Point would enable him to make.
I cannot close this brief account of the engagement without expressing my admiration of the enthusiasm and bravery manifested by the troops. Where officers and men displayed so much merit it would be invidious to discriminate, and I therefore refer you to the accompanying report of Captain Colquitt for further particulars. His position, as commanding officer of the post, gave him an opportunity of displaying the qualities which adorn the soldier, and the general appreciation of his gallantry and merit by those under his command enable me to commend him most warmly to your consideration.
In conclusion, I would state that, in consequence of the want of a Virginia or Confederate flag for the occasion, the flag of Georgia, belonging to Captain Colquitt’s company, was planted on the ramparts during the engagement, and, while the hottest fire was prevailing, two members of his company, whose names I will forward you when reported to me as deserving particular notice, fearlessly passed to the outside of the battery, and deliberately removed the sand and other obstructions to the range of one of the guns while shot and shell were striking all about them.

in.which nobody was hurt on our side. The enemy fired with great accuracy, several balls passing through the embrasures of the fort, one striking a 32-pounder within the battery, and one shell bursting in the fort. From three to five shots from our battery took effect, we think,* others struck around the steamer. The troops acted with great bravery, and I had to restrain them in their enthusiasm. The flag of Georgia was hoisted over the fort in the absence of the Confederate flag. Our firing was less frequent than that of the enemy, as our ammunition was scarce; Only two rounds left after the engagement. Your aides, Maj. William E. Taylor, R. R. Collier, and Col.

Report of Maj. J. B. Cary, Virginia Artillery.
Hampton, Ya., May 23,1861.
Sin: I have the honor to inform you that quite a full regiment of the enemy, estimated, by count of companies, to contain eight hundred men, under command of Colonel Phelps, made a demonstration against this place this afternoon, between 4 and 5 o’clock, which seemed at first to wear a very ugly aspect, but which, happily, resulted in no damage, save the alarm of our women and children and the excitement of our citizens.
I had nearly perfected my arrangements for the defense indicated in your instructions, by making preparations for the destruction of all the bridges leading across the main tributary of Back River as well as the Hampton Bridge. Unfortunately, the absence during the day of the party chosen for the firing of the latter, and the consequent failure to have the combustibles on the spot, delayed operations so far that the enemy were in sight before the fire could be started, though it would have made sufficient progress, I think, to have arrested their entrance into the town. At this stage, meeting with Lieutenant Cutshaw, at his suggestion I sent him forward as my aid to demand of the colonel the intent of his approach with so large a body of men, and being assured that he came with no hostile purpose, but simply, as he said, by order of General Butler, to reconnoiter, and having received the subsequent assurance from him in person that he would make no attack upon our people nor injure their property in any way unless he himself was molested, and coinciding in your view that defense at this point was useless and hopeless, I aided him in extinguishing the fire, and gave tjie

## p. 36 (#52) ##############################################

﻿36	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
assurance that he should not be fired upon by the volunteer force under my command (which, by the way, had by that time nearly retreated to the line of defense which I intended to occupy and where I designed making the first resistance). I also urged our citizens to abstain from any attack, which counsel, I am pleased to say, prevailed with them. The entire body then marched into the town as far as the intersection of our main streets, halted for a short while, and then returned. I have since learned that this body was supported by about three hundred men, with a battery of six brass pieces, and that there was a still further reserve on the march. But this latter information I do not consider so reliable. I have only to add, in this connection, that the force at my command, as estimated by information since derived from the several captains, was only one hundred and thirty men on the approach of the enemy. This demonstration, in my judgment, indicates the propriety of removing the camp farther from Hampton than the point already agreed upon. Our people have responded very indifferently to the call for aid in erecting intrenchments at the points indicated by you, and the proposed location of the camp is distinctly visible from the dome of the Chesapeake Female College, if not from the ramparts of the fort, and I do not doubt but that the erection of the first tent would be the signal for another such demonstration. Under this conviction I shall delay operations on the camp until I receive your reply, though nearly all the timber is at hand, and operations would have commenced in the morning. The order directing the removal of the cannon had been carried into execution, and they were beyond the reach of seizure.
I make no comments, restricting myself to a brief statement, merely remarking that Lieutenant Cutshaw, who was present most of the time, will be at the Grove Wharf to-morrow, and can give detailed information on all points not sufficiently elucidated. As soon as they left I sent a dispatch to the battalion to return in order to the town for the discharge of their usual duties.

I have to request that two lighters, with three hands each, be sent to Jamestown Island as soon as possible, to establish communication with that place and the mainland. At present supplies for Williamsburg have to be carried eight miles, I believe at King’s Mills, and of course liable to be seized by the enemy. They can be furnished at once in Richmond and sent down by the daily steamers. I have earnestly to request that a portion of the cavalry already organized should be sent to me at Yorktown or Williamsburg. No reliable information can be attained without them. This steamer

can carry twenty-five liundred men per day, with smaller vessels sent to take their baggage. She can carry three troops of horse a day, fifty horses each. I shall need at least four companies of cavalry to operate against the advance of troops from Hampton, to cut off their parties, to harass them on the march, and to beat up their quarters at night $ and, to make these more effective, I know of no greater service the section of navy howitzers at Gloucester Point can do more than to operate with this cavalry. The advance could even be checked by this small force thus constituted. I should mount the artillery with the means of the country for this purpose. This can be done at once. I have no doubt they cannot be of much use anywhere as fixed batteries, and could at any time be recalled to Eichmond, if required there. Should it be deemed advisable to send cavalry immediately, as I earnestly hope may be the case, I have the honor to state that both Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell and Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram have stated to me their desire to command such a detachment under my command.

crossed the Potomac by the Long Bridge, on the morning of the 24th instant, assuming the command of the troops on the Virginia side. The troops took position as follows:
On the right, the Sixty-ninth Regiment N. Y. S. M., which crossed the Potomac Aqueduct, was posted near the canal culvert. The other two regiments of that wing (the Twenty-eighth N. Y. S. M. and the Fifth NT. Y. S. M.) were thrown forward on the road to Leesburg, about two miles from the river. In the center, the Seventh N. Y. S. M. was placed at the head of the Long Bridge. The Twenty-fifth N. Y. S. M. was posted at the toll-gate and Vose’s Hill, on the Columbia turnpike. Three regiments of the New Jersey Brigade, under Brigadier-General Kunyon, together with the Twelfth N. Y. S. M., occupied the Alexandria road as far as Four-Mile Run$ the pickets of the Twelfth extending as far as the point where the canal crosses the Alexandria road. The left wing, consisting of the Eleventh Regiment N. Y. Vols. and the First Regiment Michigan, occupied the city of Alexandria, supported by the IJ. S. steamer Pawnee.
Immediately after crossing the river, I proceeded to an inspection of the whole line, commencing on the right. I found the Sixty-ninth N. Y. S. M. halted in position, waiting for the arrival of the intrenching tools in order to commence the works of defense which had been projected by the U. S. Engineers. Thence, following up the Leesburg road, I found the Twenty-eighth and Fifth Regiments N. Y. S. M. about a mile and a half in advance of the Sixty-ninth. Alb this place I found that Lieutenant Tompkins, of the Second 17. S. Cavalry, supported by two companies of infantry of the Twenty-eighth, had advanced up the Leesburg road towards the Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad. I pushed forward with my staff, and found him at the point where the Leesburg road crosses the railroad. He had just intercepted a passenger train of cars on its way to Alexandria, and Lieutenant Houston, of the U. S. Engineers, had destroyed the track in front and rear ot the cars and had destroyed two bridges by fire. I examined the passengers, and after conversation with them and the examination of private papers voluntarily exhibited to me, I thought it proper, with one exception, to impose no further restraint upon them than to detain them there until 5 o’clock p. m. of that day. This I did in order to prevent their carrying information of our movements into the neighborhood. Among them was a sergeant of the Fairfax Rifles, whom I sent to General Mansfield at Washington. I took pains here, and everywhere else, in my intercourse with the citizens, .to impress upon their minds that the object and intention of the presence of the United States troops were to insure good order, and to afford protection to their persons and property in the pursuit of their ordinary avocations, and I am happy to say that I have been met everywhere by most of the people with expressions of kindness and cordial welcome.
Returning thence, past the positions of the Twenty-eighth and Fifth Regiments, I examined the cross-roads in the neighborhood of Arlington. Finding the mansion vacated by the family, 1 stated to some of the servants left there that had the family remained I would have established a guard for their security from annoyance; but, in consequence of their absence, that I would, by occupying it myself, be responsible for the perfect care and security of the house and everything in and about it. I then returned, by the head of the Long Bridge, where the troops were now engaged in throwing up intrenchjnents, under the direction of Capt. B. S. Alexander, of the U. S. Engineers.

Thence I proceeded down the Alexandria road, visiting the posts of the New Jersey Brigade, the Twelfth N. Y. S. M., the First Michigan Regiment, and the Eleventh Regiment N. Y. Vols. (Ellsworth’s) to Alexandria. I then received the confirmation of the morning’s report, which had reached me, of the fall of the gallant Ellsworth.
On the following day (the 25th) I repeated the inspection of the gr eater part of the lines, particularly the right wing, where intrench-ments were being thrown up by the Sixty-ninth Regiment, under the direction of Captain Woodbury, of the U. S. Engineers. On this day the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment took post between Four-Mile Run and Alexandria, thereby filling an interval between the Twelfth Regiment and the city of Alexandria, which I had reported to you on the previous evening as being too great for mutual support. On the 26th the Eighth N. Y. S. M., which at my request you directed to cross the Potomac, was encamped by me on Arlington Heights in rear of the mansion, and on the 27th the light battery of that regiment arrived, under the command of Caj)tain Yarian, and was posted in its camp, two of the guns, with sufficient protection, being thrown forward to cover our pickets. On the evening of the same day the First New Jersey Kegiment relieved the Seventh N. Y. S. M. in the trenches at the head of the Long Bridge, and the latter returned to its post at Camp Cameron.
During the 26th I completed my examination of the roads and woods in the vicinity of Arlington and near the position of the Fifth and Twenty-eighth Regiments, and upon consultation with Capt. W. H. Wood, of the Third U. S. Infantry, concluded to change the position of those regiments to a point more capable of support from the Eighth on the left and from the Sixty-ninth on the right, and to cut a road through the woods in a direct line from the outposts in rear of Arlington House to the new position on the Leesburg road. This road is now in the course of construction. The company of Second U. S. Cavalry, under the command of Captain Brackett, being insufficient to perform the extended guard and picket duty which devolved upon it, and being desirous to extend the patrols which Captain Brackett had sent forward, I authorized him to direct the lieutenant commanding Company G of the Second Cavalry to report his command for duty with Captain Brackett, who was thereby enabled to direct more efficient and extended patrols and pickets, by which I now think the whole of the central division of the country in front of the line is occupied. Sherman’s battery of light artillery rendered prompt and efficient service throughout the movement, and one of the sections captured the troop of Virginia Cavalry at Alexandria.
I have caused to be circulated extensively throughout the country the proclamation to the inhabitants, which was submitted to and approved by the President, the Cabinet, and yourself, and of which I transmit a copy.*
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISTo. 2.
Report of Maj. Gen. 8. P. Heintzelman, U. 8. Army.
Headquarters Department of Washington,
Washington, July 20, 1863.
General: I understand that no report has been made of the crossing of the Potomac at the Long Bridge and occupation of Arlington Heights and Alexandria on the morning of the 24th of May, 1861. I was at that time acting inspector-general to Brig. Gen. J. K. F. Mansfield, commanding the Department of Washington, and as the troops that crossed the bridge moved under my direction, I have the honor to make the following report:
On the afternoon of the 23d, I went with General Mansfield to the Engineer Department, and he there explained to me the plan of operations. This, I understood from him, did not include the occupation of Alexandria. Before the troops moved, however, this part of the plan was changed.
The troops which crossed, from the original manuscript now in my possession [were]:
By the Aqueduct.—Staff commanding Captain Wood, now Maj. W. H. Wood, Seventeenth U. S. Infantry. Engineers Woodbury, Blunt, and Houston. Forty-eight pioneers of Fourteenth Begiment New York, Colonel Wood; Sixty-ninth Begiment New York, Colonel Corcoran, and 250 workmen, unarmed; Fifth Begiment New York, Colonel Schwartz-walder; Twenty-eighth Begiment New York, Colonel Burns; one company cavalry; one section artillery.
By the Long Bridge.—Staff commanding Colonel Heintzelman. Engineers Alexander, Prime, and Bobert. Twelfth Begiment New York, Colonel Butterfield; Twenty-fifth Begiment New York, Colonel Bryan: Seventh Begiment New York, Colonel Lefferts; Third Begiment New Jersey, General Bunyon; one company cavalry; one section artillery.
By steamer.—First New York Zouaves, Colonel Ellsworth. This regiment was encamped on the Potomac below the Eastern Branch, and was landed on the wharves of Alexandria under the guns of the gunboat Pawnee.
Also by the Long Bridge.—First Michigan and Pioneers, Colonel Will-cox; one company cavalry; one section artillery.
Captain Brackett commanded the company of cavalry (I, Second Cavalry) that crossed the Long Bridge, and the artillery, I think, belonged to Maj. T. W. Sherman’s battery.
During the day I warned the regiments to be prepared to march at a moment’s notice, and at 9 p. m. officers were sent to the colonels, directing them to march their troops to the Washington end of the Long Bridge.
The orders were to enter on the bridge at 2 a. m. on the 24th of May. A few minutes before the hour the head of the column halted at the Washington end of the bridge, and precisely at the hour the troops advanced, the Twelfth New York, Colonel Butterfield, leading. Col. C. P. Stone, in command of the District Volunteers, had made such admirable arrangements that he was enabled to take possession of the Virginia end of the bridge before any alarm was given, and thus prevented the rebels from firing it. He immediately pushed forward on the different roads strong pickets. On the road towards Arlington they extended as far as the bridge across the canal.
Capt. S. Owen, who commanded some of the District Cavalry, aecom-

panied me, and had with him men well acquainted with the country. The morning was beautiful moonlight. At the forks of the road, where Fort Runyon has since been built, I turned the Twenty-fifth New York, Colonel Bryan, to the right.
I gave directions to Captain Owen to lead Colonel Butterfield’s regiment as far as the Four-Mile Run, and it to take post on the right of the road, and then to conduct Colonel Willcox, with the First Michigan, to Alexandria, there to unite with the First New York Zouaves, Colonel Eilsworth, and occupy Alexandria. This was done without opposition, capturing in the town a few rebel cavalry. Some 700 rebel infantry in the town had received notice of the approach of the troops, and were ready to take the cars. They escaped on the Orange and Alexandria Railway, burning the bridges behind them. Our troops pursued a short distance, also burning such bridges as they had spared.
Capt. H. Gr. Wright, U. S. Engineers, accompanied me. We advanced with the Twenty-fifth New York on the Columbia turnpike, and took post between. Roach’s and Dr. Antisell’s, where Fort Albany now stands. Captain Brackett’s company of cavalry was posted a short distance in the advance on the turnpike. The movement was made so quietly, that the troops had stacked arms an hour before the inhabitants were aware that we had crossed the river.
As far as I can learn, there were only a few men located at the Virginia end of the Long Bridge. The horses of two of them we captured to the right of the Arlington road where it leaves the Columbia turnpike, and a few hours later the men fell into our lines, and were also captured. Communication was immediately made to the right with Captain Wood and to the left with Colonel Willcox.
Thus was commenced the first operation against the rebels in front of Washington.
I have the honor to be, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

By all accounts, the enemy crossed the river last night in large force. They stopped the Leesburg train six miles from Alexandria, a reliable man informs me, who saw them. They may be moving on Leesburg; possibly on us. I have just heard from Hunton. He has taken necessary measures to prevent surprise by rail, but they will not move that way. If they attack us, we will defend the place to the last; but our troops are badly armed and deficient in ammunition. They have captured Ball’s dragoons. Send the ablest engineer to be had.

Colonel : Colonel Terrett, with as many of his troops as he could bring off with him, arrived at 11 o’clock, the enemy occupying Alexandria with one thousand troops, as is supposed by Colonel Terrett. If the enemy advance on this line it is manifest that a much larger force is necessary here. There are but six hundred infantry here, seven companies of Preston’s command having gone to Harper’s Ferry. We need artillery very much. There are four small pieces only here. I can order up the two companies of cavalry from Occoquan and Accotink. There is but one troop of cavalry here. With a good engineer I could get on better. Will do the best I can.
In haste, your obedient servant,

The information from trustworthy vedettes indicates the enemy at Falls Church and Ball’s Cross Boads not to exceed five or six hundred.

Leesburg safe at 4 o’clock this morning. The Alexandria (Va.) troops are here, without cooking utensils, and many without arms.

The Northern troops, six thousand strong, marched into Alexandria at 4.30 o’clock this morning. The Virginia forces, five hundred in number, retreated in good order, their rear guard in sight of and within two kindred yards of the advance guard of the enemy.

Sir : In obedience to instructions from headquarters, of this day’s date, in regard to the capture of Captain Ball and his troop, I have to report that, on the morning of the 24th instant, about 1.30 a. m., Captain Ball came to my quarters and reported that one of the vedettes, stationed at the Chain Bridge, about three miles west of Georgetown, D. C., had informed him that a squadron of cavalry had crossed over to the Virginia shore. I immediately ordered my command under arms, to await further orders. About 5.30 a. m. an officer was sent from the steamer Pawnee, Northern Navy, to inform me that an overwhelming force was about entering the city of Alexandria, and it would be madness to resist, and that I could have until 9 a. m. to evacuate or surrender. I then ordered the troops under my command to assemble at the place designated by me on assuming command in Alexandria, that I might either resist or fall back, as circumstances might require. As soon as the

troops were formed, which was promptly done, I repaired to the command, and then, ascertaining that the enemy were entering the city by Washington street, and that several steamers had been placed so that their guns could command many of the principal streets, I ordered the command to march, and proceeded out of the city by Duke street. Captain Ball accompanied me as far as his quarters, a little west of the railroad d;pot, where he halted, and I proceeded to the cars, which were about half a mile from the depot, where I had ordered them to be stopped, and, from orders given before marching out of the city, the cavalry was to follow in my rear, for the purpose of giving me information in regard to the movements of the enemy. Captain Powell followed my instructions, and why Captain Ball did not I am unable to report.

Colonel: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the General-in-Chief’s letter of the 21st, * together with telegram of the 24th and 26th. My time has been so much occupied, both by day and night, that I have been unable to reply to the General’s letter, nor can I at the present moment do more than acknowledge its receipt.
I was engaged in maturing plans to carry out the General’s telegraphic instructions, when I learned by telegram that two bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, near Farmington Station, had been burned on Saturday night. I received this information late yesterday afternoon at Camp Dennison. I at once returned to the city. Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Volunteers, with his own regiment and four companies of the Second, are ordered by telegraph to move without delay from Wheeling towards Fairmont, guarding the bridges as they proceed. Colonel Irvine, Sixteenth Ohio, at Bellaire, was ordered to support the movement. Colonel Steedman, Fourteenth Ohio, supported by the Eighteenth and two light guns, was ordered to occupy Parkersburg and the lines of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, towards Grafton. I should premise that I had received information that the rebels intended to destroy the rest of the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
* Letter not found. For telegrams see 1‘ Correspondence, etc.,’7 post.

I inclose copies of my telegraphic and written orders to these officers; also of a proclamation ordered to be distributed among the inhabitants as the troops advance, and of an address to be issued to the troops. These are very hurriedly prepared, but I hope they will meet the approval of the Lieutenant-General.
Colonel Kelley left Wheeling at about 7 a. m. to-day. Colonel Irvine crossed to Benwood at about 10 o’clock. Colonel Steedman moved to Parkersburg at about 10 o’clock. By telegraph this morning I directed the necessary supplies to re-establish the telegraphic communication, and to repair the bridges, &c., to be forwarded at once from Wheeling.
General Morris holds himself ready to move from Indianapolis, on receipt of telegraphic orders, with from two to live regiments, should it become necessary. The regiments at Camp Dennison are in the midst of the process of reorganization for three years’ service. By to-morrow night one fine regiment will be ready to move, and the others will soon be prepared. I hope, however, that the force already detailed towards Grafton will suffice for the end in view. I telegraphed this morning to Major Oakes, making him an acting aide-de-camp temporarily, that he might be able to interfere authoritatively should it prove necessary.
Hoping that my course will meet the approval of the General,
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. B. McCLELLAK,

Colonel: I have telegraphed you this evening, instructing you to make a forward movement on Fairmont. The principal reason for this order was the burning of the bridges, which caused me to anticipate, by some two or three days, the more carefully-prepared measures I had contemplated, with the intention of not only securing the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad, but also of driving all the armed secessionists out of Western Virginia.
In your present movement you will be careful to run no unnecessary risk, for it is absolutely necessary that we should not meet even with a

partial check at the outset. If you find yourself in front of any hostile force that, either by superiority of numbers, position, or artillery, is likely to render an attack doubtful, you will remain in observation, and at once send for assistance, which can be promptly rendered to any desirable extent. The chief object of your advance is to prevent any further destruction of the railroad. You will not move on Grafton without restoring the bridges in your rear, unless you receive positive information that Colonel Steedman’s command has actually reached Grafton, or a neighboring point, where you can without doubt unite with him.
Colonel Steedman occupies Parkersburg to morrow morning with two regiments, and will then proceed to take possession of the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as far towards Grafton as he can with safety.
You will exercise the utmost vigilance in preserving the discipline of your men, see that the property and rights of the inhabitants are in every respect carefully protected, and use every effort to conciliate the people and strengthen the Union feeling. You will at once make a requisition upon the chief quartermaster of this department for such supplies as may be necessary for your command. In the mean time, make the best use you can of the means now in your possession. Colonel Irvine will be under your orders.

Proclamation to the People of Western Virginia.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Cincinnati, May 26,1861.
To the Union Men of Western Virginia:
Virginians: The General Government has long enough endured the machinations of a few factious rebels in your midst. Armed traitors have in vain endeavored to deter you from expressing your loyalty at the polls. Having failed in this infamous attempt to deprive you of the exercise of your dearest rights, they now seek to inaugurate a reign of terror, and thus force you to yield to their schemes, and submit to the yoke of the traitorous conspiracy dignified by the name of Southern Confederacy.
They are destroying the property of citizens of your State and ruining your magnificent railways. The General Government has heretofore carefully abstained from sending troops across the Ohio, or even from posting them along its banks, although frequently urged by many of your prominent citizens to do so. I determined to await the result of the late election, desirous tltfit no one might be able to say that the slightest effort had been made from this side to influence the free expression of your opinion, although the many agencies brought to bear upon you by the rebels were well known.
You have now shown, under the most adverse circumstances, that the great mass of the people of Western Virginia are true and loyal to that beneficent Government under which we and our fathers have lived so long. As soon as the result of the election was known the traitors commenced their work of destruction. The General Government cannot close its ears to the demand you have made for assistance. I have ordered troops to cross the river. They come as your friends and brothers—as enemies only to the armed rebels who are preying upon you. Your homes, your families, and your property are safe under our protection. All your rights shall be religiously respected.
Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain

from all such interference, but we will, on the contrary, with an iron hand, crush any attempt at insurrection on their part. Now that we are in your midst, I call upon you to fly to arms and support the General Government.
Sever the connection that binds you to traitors. Proclaim to the world that the faith and loyalty so long boasted by the Old Dominion are still preserved in Western Virginia, and that you remain true to the Stars and Stripes.

Address to the Soldiers of the Expedition.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Cincinnati) May 26,1861.
Soldiers : You are ordered to cross the frontier and enter upon the soil of Virginia. Your mission is to restore peace and confidence, to protect the majesty of the law, and to rescue our brethren from the grasp of armed traitors. You are to act in concert with the Virginia troops, and to support their advance. I place under the safeguard of your honor the persons and property of the Virginians. I know that you will respect their feelings and all their rights. Preserve the strictest discipline; remember that each one of you holds in his keeping the honor of Ohio and of the Union.
If you are called upon to overcome armed opposition, I know that your courage is equal to the task; but remember that your only foes are the armed traitors, and show mercy even to them when they are in your power, for many of them are misguided. When under your protection the loyal men of Western Virginia have been enabled to organize and arm, they can protect themselves, and you can then return to your homes with the proud satisfaction of having preserved a gallant people from destruction.

Colonel : I have the honor to report the successful occupation of Grafton without the loss of a single life. My previous dispatches have informed you of the circumstances under which the movement was undertaken and the orders given for carrying it into effect. The movement was greatly delayed by the necessity of repairing the burned bridges. I constantly advised Colonel Kelley to use great caution, and I am happy to say that he has been able to combine it with unusual energy.
He promptly arrived at the burned bridge; at once set a working party at preparing timber for repairs, moved an advanced guard forward to the very important bridge over the Monongahela, at Fairmont, and seized all the secessionists he could find. At 11 o’clock this morning he moved forward, and reached Grafton at 2.30 p. m. The secessionists had evacuated the place before his arrival.
The colonel will pursue them on the Beverly road in the morning and endeavor to capture at least some arms that they sent away before they 4 R R—VOL II

retreated. I cannot commend too highly the prudence and energy displayed by Colonel Kelley in this movement. He has in every instance carried out his instructions, and has displayed very high military qualities. I beg to recommend to the General that he may be made a brigadier-general of the Virginia Volunteers.
It is a source of very great satisfaction to me that we have occupied Grafton without the sacrifice of a single life. Colonel Steedman’s advance from Parkersburg has not been so prompt as that of Colonel Kelley. He has met with many difficulties on his route.
I am happy to say that the movement has caused a very great increase of the Union feeling. I am now organizing a movement on the valley of the Great Kanawha; will go there in person, and endeavor to capture the occupants of the secession camp at Buffalo, then occupy the Gauley Bridge, and return in time to direct such movements on Kentucky and Tennessee as may become necessary.
I will make a more detailed report when I receive Colonel Kelley’s full report.

Sir : The threatening aspect of affairs in this quarter induces me to send Lieutenant-Colonel McCausland to explain in detail matters that could not be discussed by letter. He will inform you of the disaffection of this population and the difficulty of procuring reliable troops for the emergency. There can be no doubt now that it is the intention of the enemy to occupy as much of this country as he may find open to invasion, and your attention is specially called to the necessity of sending, as e&rly as practicable, a force at ieast sufficient to hold this valley in security. I have now under my command here three hundred and forty men, and when the companies now in process of formation in this valley shall have been completed it is probable their numbers will not exceed one thousand men. It is doubtful, in my mind, whether the militia will obey a call to the field. For these reasons it would seem proper that re-enforcements should be sent from such sources as you may deem proper. I beg leave, respectfully, to urge the importance of sending us rifles, with

The enemy has invaded your soil and threatens to overrun your country under the pretext of protection. You cannot serve two masters. You have not the right to repudiate allegiance to your own State. Be not seduced by his sophistry or intimidated by his threats. Rise and strike for your firesides and altars. Repel the aggressors and preserve your honor and your rights. Rally in every neighborhood with or without arms. Organize and unite with the sons of the soil to defend it. Report yourselves without delay to those nearest to you in military position. Come to the aid of your fathers, brothers, and comrades in arms at this place, who are here for the jirdtection of your mothers, wives, and sisters. Let every man who would uphold his rights turn out with such arms as he may get and drive the invader back.

Report of Col. George A. Porterfield, commanding Confederate forces at
Philippi.
Headquarters of Yirginia Forces,
Philippi, Fa., May 29, 1861.
Colonel: On the 27th instant I received reliable Information of a contemplated movement among those hostile to us, by which a large body of men were intended to be precipitated upon me in the rear, by the railroad, without notice, and in a few hours7 time. I was also assured that about fifteen hundred Federal troops had collected at Marietta, some at Bellaire, one thousand or fifteen hundred on the island opposite Wheeling; in fact, that there were considerable bodies of men everywhere on that border that could be easily collected and launched therefrom. In this state of things I ordered some of the bridges of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad northwest of Fairmont to be destroyed, which order was carried into effect by the destruction of two between Farmington and Manuington, about thirty-five miles northwest of Grafton.
I also sent out an expedition to destroy a bridge of the Northwestern Yirginia Railroad, fifty or sixty miles west of Grafton. The object of this expedition has, I am informed, been accomplished, although my party has not yet returned. I caused a small bridge of the same road, about fifteen miles west of Grafton, to be destroyed, but I learn that it has been repaired by the company, so that trains pass over it.
On the evening of the 27th I received information of the arrival, by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, of a body of troops, variously estimated at from one thousand to three thousand, at the burned bridge^

near Mannington. It was supposed that these men would be followed by others as soon as the house-cars which contained them could be returned to the Ohio River. In this state of things I inquired of General Johnston, by telegraph (the Grafton end of which only was under the control of our friends, so far as I know) if he could re-enforce me. For reply, I was informed that no men could be sent from his command at Harper’s Ferry.
On the 28th, learning from the most reliable persons that the invading force had reached Fairmont, twenty miles northwest of Grafton, and thinking that the latter point, from its topography and the character of its population (a good part of which would have united with our enemies upon their appearance) was not an eligible one for us, and considering our very inadequate supply of provisions and ammunition, particularly caps, and that our number of infantry was small (not more than about five hundred and fifty), and the want of any sort of training or military disclipine among our men, and being informed that other bodies of men besides those first spoken of had passed the burned bridges by means of temporary repairs of them, and approached Fairmont, I concluded to remove the State arms and stores to Philippi, about fifteen miles in our rear, there establish a depot, in a friendly country, to concentrate such volunteers as were on the way or could be easily and speedily attracted to that point, and there to organize and strengthen my command. I met on the way an unarmed company of volunteers from Upshur, and at Philippi I was joined by a well-armed company of horse from Rockbridge. I have been compelled to send home, for want of arms to supply them with, a company of horse from Pocahontas, and to dismiss to their homes for a short time a like company raised in Barbour.
As soon as I can organize my command, which I hope to do soon, I will return to some more eligible point in the neighborhood of Grafton, which will enable me to command both railroads, and in the mean time I hope to be able more effectually to cut off the railroad communications east and west of that place. The railroad is unquestionably used by the company against us, and I may be obliged, for the safety of the command at Harper’s Ferry, to make further destruction of it.

May 27,1861.
Sir: The expedition (of which I gave you information in my former dispatch) to Newport News got off in fine style this morning about 7 o’clock. I have added to the expedition the Eighth New York Regiment, 780 strong, which came here on board the Empire City on Sunday afternoon, and they proceeded without debarking. I also added two 6-pounder and two 12-pounder guns, with a detachment of twenty-five men from Colonel Dimick’s command, who are intended to act as drill-masters to the volunteers in the exercise of the guns. My purpose is to intrench

and hold that point, and ultimately to mount a few heavy guns, which will command that channel of approach to James River.
Since I wrote my last dispatch the question in regard to slave property is becoming one of very serious magnitude. The inhabitants of Virginia are using their negroes in the batteries, and are preparing to send their women and children South. The escapes from them are very numerous, and a squad has come in this morning to my pickets, bringing with them their women and children. Of course these cannot be dealt with upon the theory on which I designed to treat the services of able-bodied men and women who might come within my lines, and of which I gave you a detailed account in my last dispatch. I am in the utmost doubt what to do with this species of property. Up to this time I have had come within my lines men and women with their children—entire families—each family belonging to the same owner. I have therefore determined to employ, as I can do very profitably, the able-bodied persons in the party, issuing proper food fqr the support of all, and charging against their services the expense of care and sustenance of the non-laborers, keeping a strict and accurate account as well of the services as of the expenditures, having the worth of the services and the cost of the expenditures determined by a board of survey, hereafter to be detailed. I know of no other manner in which to dispose of this subject and the questions connected therewith. As a matter of property to the insurgents it will be of very great moment, the number I now have amounting, as I am informed, to what in good times would be of the value of $60,000. Twelve of these negroes, I am informed, have escaped from the erection of batteries on SewelPs Point, which this morning fired upon my expedition as it passed by out of range. As a means of offense, therefore, in the enemy’s hands, these negroes, when able-bodied, are of the last importance. Without them the batteries could not have been erected, at least for many weeks. As a military question, it would seem to be a measure of necessity to deprive their masters of their services. How can this be done? As a political question and a question of humanity, can I receive the services of the father and mother and not take the children? Of the humanitarian aspect I have no doubt. Of the political one I have no right to judge. I therefore submit all this to your better judgment; and as these questions have a political aspect, I have ventured—and I trust I am not wrong in so doing—to duplicate the parts of my dispatches relating to this subject, and forward them to the Secretary of War.
It was understood when I left Washington that the three Massachusetts regiments, two of which are at the Relay House, should be forwarded to me here, and also Cook’s light battery, of which I have the utmost need, if I am expected even to occupy an extended camp with safety. May I ask the attention of the Commanding General to this subject, and inquire if the exigencies of the service will permit these troops to be sent to me immediately? I have to report the arrival of no more troops except the New York Eighth since my last dispatch. The steamship Wabash, which was expected here to take the place of the Minnesota, has not yet reported herself. The Harriet Lane has reported herself here from Charleston, and is employed in convoying the Newport News expedition. I find myself extremely short of ammunition, having but a total in magazine of 85,000 rounds, of which 5,000 rounds only are for the smooth-bore musket, and the major part of my command are provided with that arm. May I desire the attention of the Lieutenant-General to this state of facts, and ask that a large amount of ammunition for that arm—I would suggestu buck and ball”—be ordered forward

from the Ordnance Department 1 The assistant adjutant-general has made a requisition for this purpose. I will endeavor to keep the Lieutenant-General informed daily of any occurrences of interest, provided I am not interfered with by tiie irregularity of the mails and modes of conveyance.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ; F. BUTLER, Major-General, Commanding.
Lieutenant-General Scott.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
May 29, 1801.
Sir: The expedition to Newport News, of which I spoke in my last, eight miles from this place, landed without opposition. I have caused an intrenched camp to be made there, which, when completed, will be able to hold itself against any force that may be brought against it, and afford even a better depot from which to advance than Fortress Monroe. The advantages of the News are these: There are two springs of very pure water there; the bluff is a fine, healthy location. It has two good, commodious wharves, to which steamers of any draught of water may come up at all stages of the tide; it is as near any point of operation as Fortress Monroe, where we are obliged to lighter all vessels of draught over ten feet, and have but one wharf. The News, upon which I propose to have a water battery of four 8-inch guns, commands the ship channel of James River, and a force there is a perpetual threat to Richmond.
My next point of operation I propose shall be Pig Point, which is exactly opposite the News, commanding Nansemond River. Once in command of that battery, which I believe may be easily turned, I can then advance along the Nansemond River and easily take Suffolk, and there either hold or destroy the railroad both between Richmond and Norfolk, and also between Norfolk and the South. With a perfect blockade of Elizabeth River, and taking and holding Suffolk and perhaps York, Norfolk will be so perfectly hemmed in, that starvation will cause the surrender, without risking an attack on the strongly-fortified intrenchments around Norfolk, with great loss and perhaps defeat.
If this plan of operations does not meet the approval of the Lieutenant-General I would be glad of his instructions specifically. If it is desirable to move on Richmond, James and York Rivers, both thus held, would seem to be the most eligible routes.
I have no co-operation substantially by the Navy, the only vessels here now being the Cumberland and Harriet Lane, the former too unwieldy to get near shore to use her heavy guns, the other so light in her battery as not to be able to cope with a single battery of the rebels.
I have yet need of surf-boats for sea-coast and river advances, and beg leave to suggest this matter again to you.
This evening the First New York Regiment, three years’ men, came in on board the State of Georgia. It is in a most shameful state as regards camp equipage, camp kettles, &c.
Another matter needs pressing attention. The bore of a majority of the muskets in my command is smooth, of the issue of ’48, and I have only 5,000 rounds of buck and ball and no other ammunition to fit this arm. Might I request immediate action upon this vital subject ?
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Department of Fredericksburg,
Fredericksburg, Va., May 30 [?], 1861.
Sir: I have the honor to report that two small steamers of the enemy attacked the Aquia Greek Eailroad battery last evening about sunset, and fired some fourteen shot and shell. Our battery returned the fire with twelve shot and shell. The contest terminated about 9 o’clock, when the enemy departed. One man was slightly wounded in the hand by the fragments of a shell. I prepared to cover our front with my whole force, comprising the Tennessee Eegiment and a battalion of volunteers, assembled at Camp Mercer, and proceeded, with some seven hundred men, to the point attacked, having in view sending back the train for the remaining five hundred. The conflict having terminated before we reached the scene of action, I returned with the forces above specified, reaching this town about 5 a. m. The spirit and conduct of the troops have been admirable in connection with this little affair. Much agitation prevails along the Potomac coast from apprehension that the enemy will land, in large and small numbers, to devastate and plunder. I respectfully recommend that guns of heavy caliber be furnished (say 12s, 18s, and 32s), for use at various points on the coast for surprising and harassing the enemy.

Sir : The report has arrived this moment that five of the enemy’s steamers, with two transport ships, one of which is of considerable size, had appeared off Aquia Creek battery, with the evident intention of attacking it. When the train left (11 a. in.), soon after, heavy firing was heard from that point. I am in want of at least one thousand well-disciplined volunteers as soon as it is possible to send them. Twenty thousand musket-rifle caps are absolutely necessary for the use of troops with percussion arms. I go to the battery at once. Communicate with Major Barton, acting assistant adjutant general, to this office.

transports, not containing, however, many troops. They had some long boats or launches ; but, so far as observed, made no preparation for lauding. The fire on both sides was skillfully directed, and continued up to about 1 p. m., when the steamers hauled off, and, it is supposed, in a partially disabled condition. I took all the available forces, comprising the four companies of infantry and one of cavalry, from this vicinity, and Colonel Bate’s Tennessee (Walker) Legion with me, reaching the Potomac soon after the firing ceased. The conduct of the troops in the batteries—that of Captain Walker, with his 6-pounder rifle-guns, having been brought early into the action—is represented as having been admirable, including the covering and protecting force on the field. I have transferred the Tennessee (Walker) Legion to Brooke’s Station, where I have re-established Camp Jackson. From that point lateral movements may be easily made to cross the coasts, and forward movements to cover the batteries, with great facility.
The ladies are now making tents, cartridges, and belts, and I hope soon to have our forces sheltered and better equipped. I left Aquia Creek late last evening, and return there this morning.

Sir: I have the honor to state, for the information of the commanding general, that four of the enemy’s armed steamers commenced firing on our batteries at Aquia Creek yesterday morning, at about 9 o’clock, and continued until about 4 p. m. On our side nobody was hurt and no material damage was done to our batteries. The enemy gave no indications of an intention to land, but hauled off to the Maryland shore at the close of the action. This demonstration, thus persevered in, is made, I doubt not, in view of collateral action and movements. I arrived on the field about midday, and returned to this place at night. The batteries were commanded by Captain Lynch and other naval officers. The conduct of my entire force, under the command of Colonel Bate, of the Walker Legion, until my arrival on the field, was admirable throughout the day. The enemy is represented to have thrown five hundred and ninety-seven shots and shells, and our battery, under Captain Lynch, seventy-five.

batteries at Aquia Creek, and that the steamer Pawnee only has been lying off at that point, repairing damages, and in communication with various steamers and other vessels passing up and down the Potomac. It has just been reported to me, however, that after I left the creek yesterday, and at about 9 o’clock at night, two or more war steamers, with a vessel in tow, came down the Potomac and joined the Pawnee. Thus far I have no report of the renewal of the attack this morning. It is my intention to throw the Arkansas regiment, Colonel Fagan’s, now at Camp Jackson, upon the Potomac coast, near Chopawamsic, as soon as it is in condition to do so.
I am much in want of an effective battery of 24-pounder howitzers for service, in conjunction with that force, to prevent the enemy from landing. The Fredericksburg Artillery, of 6-pounders, will be wanted at Aquia Creek to prevent landing there, if an attack is made. The movements of the enemy indicate that an attempt will soon be made in force to land at, or in the vicinity of, Mathias Point in a brief period of time. I respectfully recommend that that point be covered by a good regiment of infantry, with a good battery of field-guns, until measures are taken to establish a good and sufficient battery at that point to command the channel, for the establishment of which I respectfully renew my former recommendation. Under authority given me, I have fabricated here carriages for a battery of 6-pounder guns, and respectfully request that guns may be furnished me without delay for use in the field.
Since it has become impracticable to establish a battery at the White House to command the Potomac, I respectfully recommend that a competent engineer be sent me to examine the vicinity of Evansport with that view, and, if found suitable, that a battery may be established there with as little delay as is practicable. That point is important in connection with the position at Manassas Junction, as well as the avenues of approach from the Potomac to this town.

Report of Col. William B. Bate, commanding Walker Legion.
Camp Jackson, on the Potomac, June 11,1861.
Dear Sir : I suppose you have heard all the particulars of the Aquia Creek fight and the part borne by the Walker Legion. One company of it was in one of the batteries, and the celebrated rifled cannon, so effective upon the enemy, was managed by one of our young lieutenants. The remainder of the regiment was held in reserve, though within range of their guns, at a point of concealment, to prevent a landing if such was attempted. The boys were too eager, and courted a hand-to-hand fight. I made a report to Colonel Buggies, and forbear further trespass now. I want the Walker Legion to be in the column which advances upon Washington. I believe we will have skirmishes here now—nothing more. We will sink their ships on another effort if they come in range. I had Walker’s rifle battery under my command placed with two rifle companies to sustain, and one company of mounted men

with carbines within hailing distance on Symmes’ Point under cover—a masked battery—Saturday night after the fight, thinking they would return to their same position next morning. That night we worked three hundred men all night to have two columbiads and this battery of Walker’s in place, but the enemy, being so crippled, did not return.
The arrangement Sunday morning would have sunk their ships in an hour had they resumed their position. We are drilling daily, and almost hourly, and will look to you to give us a chance.
I want one-half hour’s talk with you, and if you will telegraph General Holmes to send me individually to Eichmond for a day I can get to go; otherwise I don’t think the old Tycoon (Holmes) will let me, and I never disobey orders. You may be sure I will not leave when there is a prospect of a fight. Everything is peaceable now except the Pawnee, which still coils about our shore like a wounded viper. We have vedettes near here.
I get information from above and below this point for twenty miles every day through couriers, and can know when it is safe to leave for Eichmond only a day.
Pardon the length of this free-and-easy letter. I know it is a trespass on your much-engaged time. Let me hear from you. Send the dispatch spoken of or write letter, and oblige

Report of M. W. Cluslcey.
Aquia Greek, June 1,1861.
My Dear Sir : I had the pleasure of witnessing at this point to-day most of the engagement between one of our batteries and three Lincoln men-of-war, one of them supposed to be the Pawnee, the other the Ana-eostia, and the other unknown. Our forces acted manfully and suffered no injury, though some of the enemy’s shot was well directed, and where it seemed providentially averted from doing mischief. The fight was a continuation of the one the day before. Our battery fired the first shot to-day, then all of its garrison mounted the fort and cheered in defiance of the enemy. The shot was promptly returned, and the enemy kept up a brisk cannonading, firing, before the close, five hundred and ninety-two shots, comprised of shell and balls of the largest dimensions. The only damage to our side was the death of a chicken, though a stray ball killed a horse on the opposite side of the creek. Our own battery fired but seventy-six shots, three of which are said to have been fired with effect. The firing ceased at 3J p. m., when a barge from the Pawnee went to the Maryland shore, and returning, the Anacostia proceeded up the river, supposed to be bound for Washington, for a fresh supply of ammunition.
One of the guns on our battery was under the command of one of the Walker Legion, Cadet Patton Eobertson, of Nashville, who fired the rifled cannon with remarkable precision, and displayed, tor a young man not yet of age, the most dauntless and cool bravery. The big gun on the

new battery, which is garrisoned by the Carolina Greys, of our regiment, under command of Captain Hunt, was placed in position about 5 o’clock this afternoon, and will thunder in the anticipated engagement of tomorrow. Another one for the same battery will be planted to-morrow. These guns are in the most splendid locality to command the river that could well be wished for.
To-morrow Captain Walker’s command of rifled cannon will be at a prominent point of land at the mouth of the creek on the opposite side, which will bring him within a mile and a quarter of the location of the Lincoln vessels in the engagement of to-day. Pits will also be dug tonight at the same place for the use of two of the rifle companies of the Walker Legion. We are all at the creek, though our encampment is four miles back.
The vindictiveness of the enemy is shown by the quickness with which they throw their shells at any body of men who may appear on the height to view the engagement. One of our companies was fired at with a shell the moment they emerged from the woods to obtain a more satisfactory view of the fight, which exploded over them, and miraculously scattered so as not to hurt one of the number.
Colonel Bate has been assigned the command of the brigade here, composed of his o.wn regiment and the Virginia troops present, and is working with a zeal consistent with the energy and enthusiasm of his nature. I have written these lines thinking you would be glad to learn that the regiment which has appropriated your name as its designation is confided with the most important posts of duty in the engagement at this point and vicinity.

Sir : I have the honor to report, pursuant to verbal instructions received from the colonel commanding, that I left this camp on the evening of the 31st May in command of a detachment of Company B Second Cavalry, consisting of fifty men, with Second Lieut. David S. Gordon, Second Dragoons, temporarily attached, for the purpose of reconnoiter-ing the country in the vicinity of Fairfax Court-House. Upon approaching the town the picket guard was surprised and captured. Several documents were found on their persons, which I herewith inclose. On entering the town of Fairfax my command was fired upon by the rebel troops from the windows and house-tops. Charged on a company of mounted rifles, and succeeded in driving them from the town. Immediately two or three additional companies came up to their relief, who immediately commenced firing upon us, which fire I again returned. Perceiving that I was largely outnumbered, I deemed it advisable to retreat, which I did in good order, taking five prisoners, fully armed and equipped, and two horses. Nine horses were lost during the engagement and four wounded. The force actually engaged at the commencement of the engagement were two companies of cavalry and one rifle company, but re-enforcements coming in from camps adjacent to the court-house, which I have from reliable authority, increased their force to upwards of 1,000 men. Twenty-five of the enemy were killed and wounded. Captains Cary, Fearing, and Adjutant Frank, of the Fifth N. Y. S. M., accompanied the command as volunteers, and did very effective service. I regret to state that Captain Cary was wounded in the foot.
Lieut. D. S. Gordon, of the Second Dragoons, temporarily attached to Company B, Second Cavalry, accompanied me, and rendered me valuable services. The prisoners, horses, arms, and equipments taken have been this day turned over to the proper authority.

Col. D. Hunter,
Third United States Cavalry, commanding Brigade:
Sir : I have the honor to inform you that Lieutenant Tompkins’ report of the affair at Fairfax Court-House on the night of the 30th ultimo has been forwarded to the headquarters of the Army, indorsed as follows :
Headquarters Department N. E. Virginia,
Arlington, June 5, 1861.
Lieutenant Tompkins behaved most gallantly in the spirited encounter in which he involved himself. He had two horses shot under him, and is now temporarily disabled from a contused foot, caused by one of the horses which was shot falling on him.
The skirmish has given considerable prestige to our regular cavalry in the eyes of our people and of the volunteer regiments, but the lieutenant acted without authority, and went further than he knew he was desired or expected to go, and frustrated unintentionally, for the time, a more important movement. He has been so informed by me, verbally; and whilst in the future he will not be less gallant, he will be more circumspect.
Respectfully forwarded to the headquarters of the Army.
IRVIN McDOWELL, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
I am further directed to say that the General-in-Chief has fully concurred in the opinion of the general commanding the department.
It is perceived that Lieutenant Tompkins’ first report in this case has been given to the public through the columns of the New York Tribune. I am directed to ask you to give such instructions that this may not become a practice. Official reports and papers of this nature are not to be considered within the control of those who make them, but of those to whom they are made.

Sir : The reports of the attack on Fairfax Court-House by the enemy’s cavalry, on the 1st instant, from Colonels Ewell and Gregg,* already transmitted, should have been accompanied by this report, but a pressure of urgent business has hitherto prevented my sending it forward. Accompanying this is a fuller report from Colonel Ewell. Having taken an advanced position at Centreville, with Gregg’s regiment of infantry, and at Bull Bun with Kershaw’s regiment, I had directed Colonel Ewell, commanding the cavalry of this department, with one company of light infantry (Captain Marr), and two companies of cavalry (Captains Thornton and Green), to take position at Germantown, or at Fairfax Court-House, one and a half miles in advance of Germantown, whichever he might deem best, upon examining the positions. I had also ordered Captains Cabell and Ball, with their troops of cavalry, to report to Colonel Ewell the evening preceding the attack ; but unavoidT able circumstances prevented their reaching the place that evening. The reports of Colonel Ewell being full, I do not deem it necessary to add a great deal to what he has said. Unfortunately the two companies of cavalry were poorly armed, which prevented their taking so active a part as they would, doubtless, otherwise have done.
Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell was wounded in the shoulder. Not only on this occasion, in the face of the enemy, but at all other times he has exhibited promptness, energy, and gallantry in the discharge of his duties. Captain Marr fell early in the action, deeply lamented by all who knew him. His loss to the service will be sensibly felt. His corps of light infantry (the Warrenton Bifles) bore themselves like veterans, twice repulsing the enemy, and finally compelling them to fly across the fields, after fruitless efforts to return through the village by the streets through which they had entered. By Colonel Ewell and others present the bearing and usefulness of Ex-Governor Smith on the occasion are spoken of in the highest terms.
Killed, Captain Marr 5 wounded, Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell; missing (taken prisoners), five. One of the enemy known to have been killed; wounded, not known—several reported; prisoners, three, each of whom I saw and examined.
The enemy was eighty to eighty-five strong, well armed, and commanded by Lieutenant Tompkins, Second U. S. Cavalry.
I again respectfully urge the thorough arming of Green’s, Thornton’s, and Powell’s troops of cavalry with double-barreled shot-guns, musket-oons, or lances and pistols.

Fairfax Court-House, Ya., June 1,1861.
Sir: I have the honor to make the following report: Between 3 and 4 o’clock this morning the pickets on the Little Falls Church road gave an alarm, stating that the cavalry of the enemy had captured our advance pickets, and were rapidly approaching the town. This was immediately followed by the appearance of the enemy, and here rapid firing took place. They did not stop, but passed through towards Germantown. I found Captain Man’s company of Bifies (receiving valuable aid from his excellency Ex-*Governor Smith), and took a position on the road by which the enemy had gone towards Germantown. In a few minutes the enemy returned, and firing took place on both sides, and the enemy fell back. Having reformed, the enemy again advanced, and more firing took place on both sides. They again retreated, and made their way through the fields, by pulling down the fences. Captain Harrison has been sent with his company, to intercept them, and Captain Wickham has been sent on their trail. Some prisoners and some horses have been taken; what number I do not know. Also several carbines and pistols have been picked up in the road. Captain Marr, of the Warrenton Bifies, has been found dead near his company’s quarters, having been shot by a detachment of the enemy. I received a flesh wound in the shoulder from a bullet. Dr. Gunnell says that it will keep me from taking the saddle for several days. This is the result as far as known. I am having the roads patrolled. A United States saddle has just been brought in to me. The enemy were driven back twice by the Warrenton Bifies, who did good service.	«

June 1, 1861.
Sir: Between 3 and 4 o’clock this morning the pickets on the Little Falls Church road gave the alarm, stating that the cavalry of the enemy had taken the advanced pickets and were rapidly approaching the town. This was soon followed by their appearance, firing at the windows and doors of the hotel, where were no resistance or troops. They did not stop, but passed through toward Germantown. I formed Captain Marr’s company of light infantry (receiving valuable aid from his excellency Ex-Governor Smith) and took a position on the road to intercept the enemy’s return. They soon reappeared, forming in the street below the court-house, and, on the interchange of shots, they retreated up the pike. In a few moments they formed a second time at the same spot, and, after firing on both sides, the enemy ran off ingloriously, pulling down fences, and making their escape through the fields by Flint Hill. I had ordered up a squadron from the station, which was sent in pursuit, but the enemy outrode it. They left no dead on the ground, but carbines, pistols, sabers, &c., were lying around. I know of four horses left by them, two in the service of General Beauregard, one wounded and one unfit for use, being

both obstinate and unmanageable, besides two dead, close to the field, and have heard of several left dead on the road. An officer’s saber was picked up on the road by which they ran away. Three prisoners were brought in, who separately reported their strength at eighty, rank and file. They were driven off by less than fifty of Captain Marr’s company of War-renton Rifles. These had no bayonets or other arms than the rifle, while the eighty men of the enemy had a revolver and carbine each, or five hundred and sixty shots without loading. The two cavalry companies here (Rappahannock and Prince William) had very few fire-arms and no ammunition, and took no part in the affair. The enemy captured one vedette and picked up four of the Prince William Cavalry the first time they charged through the town. Captain Marr was found shot through the heart a short distance from the field. I understand he had started, with a portion of his company, toward the enemy and was intercepted by their pickets. This also explains, in part, why there were so few rifles present at the fight. Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell received a flesh wound through the shoulder when they made their last attack.
The above includes all our loss of killed and wounded. Official statements, published in the papers, vary in the loss of the enemy—killed from one to three, and six or eight wounded. A gentleman reported # that they impressed his wagon to carry off the dead and wounded. Their report states one to have been missing. Three prisoners were brought to me, so that they sink to official falsehoods to conceal the truth. The New York Times of the 4th gives their loss at six killed and wounded.
I send below a report made to me by a clergyman who met them on their retreat:
They appeared about forty, had twelve to fifteen led horses, and a wagon, with one corpse and some wounded men; some wounded men on horseback, supported by soldiers mounted behind.

ACTION AT PHILIPPI, W. VA.
The attack was made after a march during the entire night in a drenching rain. The surprise was complete. Fifteen rebels killed. The gallant Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Volunteers, I fear, is mortally wounded. No other important casualties on our side.
The dispatch from General Morris informs me that the troops at last advices were in hot pursuit of the rebels.

Sir: Inclosed I have the honor to forward the report of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris, Indiana Yolunteers, commanding theU. S. volunteer forces in the vicinity of Grafton, Va., giving a detailed account of the operations connected with the attack and occupation of Philippi.
After the two branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad leading from Wheeling and Parkersburg had been secured and Grafton occupied by our troops, I learned that the insurgents had retreated to Philippi, and received very considerable accessions to their numbers.
To prevent their further outrages upon the railroads or upon the property of loyal citizens, I directed an immediate movement to dislodge and disperse them from their new position. This was executed under the orders of General Morris, Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Yolunteers, having the immediate command of the attacking columns; and the result, as will be seen from General Morris’ report, was in many respects highly creditable to the troops engaged, and perfectly successful. The insurgents, about 2,000 in number, were surprised in their camp, routed, and in great confusion driven before our troops for several miles towards Beverly.
Although quite a number of them were killed and wounded and a large portion of their munitions captured, yet it is much to be regretted that the exhausted condition of our men, consequent upon a long night march through mud and rain, prevented them from overtaking and capturing the mass of the fugitives. It is believed, however, that the effect of this decisive engagement will be to inspire the Union people of the country with confidence in our ability to afford them protection.
Had the attack been supported by a few companies of cavalry, it is probable that many of the enemy would have been captured or cut to pieces. As I have no available troops of that description in my department, I would very respectfully urge upon the consideration of the general commanding the importance of a mounted force (regular cavalry if they can be furnished) to insure the success of future operations in this department.
Colonel Kelley, who conducted the movement on Philippi with marked ability and zeal, received a severe wound early in the action, which at the time was supposed to be mortal, but I am now happy to say that he is considered out of danger. From the moment he received my orders at Wheeling to move on Grafton up to the time he was wounded he has exhibited in an eminent degree the qualities of an efficient commander, and I take this opportunity of renewing my recommendation for his promotion to the rank of brigadier-general in the Virginia Volunteer Militia.
Colonel Dumont deserves great credit for his conduct in the attack and pursuit of the rebels.

Report of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris) Indiana Militia.
Headquarters IT. S. Volunteers,
Grafton) W. Ya., June 7, 1861.
General : I have the honor to report that I arrived at Grafton on the evening of the 1st day of June, and found that Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Regiment, had organized an expedition for that night against the enemy at Philippi. The available forces then at his command consisted of six companies of his own regiment and nine companies of the Ninth Indiana Volunteers, commanded by Colonel Milroy. After a full conference with Colonel Kelley as to the position of the enemy, his strength, and the character of the approaches to his position, I deemed it advisable to postpone the attack until the succeeding night.
Having satisfied myself during the evening that we were in the midst of spies, who readily obtained every information in regard to our movements, I endeavored to arrange the expedition so as to give a false impression, and thereby secure the advantage of a surprise of the enemy. With this view the following order was given to Colonel Kelley:
Headquarters U. S. Volunteers.
Grafton, W. Va., June 2, 1861.
Col. B. F. Kelley,
Commanding First Eegiment Virginia Volunteers:
Colonel : With six companies of your regiment, nine companies of Colonel Milroy’s Ninth Indiana, and six companies of Colonel Irvine’s Sixteenth Ohio, you will proceed this morning to a point about six miles eastward from this place on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and march by the shortest and most practicable route towards Philippi. You must regulate your march according to your own discretion, and your bivouac or rest at night in such manner that you are sure of coming before the town of Philippi as near 4 o’clock to-morrow morning as possible. Should you this evening receive certain information that the rebels have retreated eastward from Philippi you will make the resting time of your troops as short as possible, in order to follow them up with all the speed the strength of your troops will allow. In such case you will as early as possible inform Colonel Dumont on the other bank of the river, and direct his co-operation with you in the pursuit, which, if in your discretion you are in sufficient force, you will continue until they are beyond Beverly, and you will also apprise these headquarters, in order that supplies may be forwarded to you.
By command of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris:
JOHN A. STEIN,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
This column (the left of the attack) moved by railroad train on the 2d at 9 o’clock a. m. towards, and was generally understood to be an advance on, Harper’s Ferry.
After leaving the cars the distance to Philippi was about twenty-five miles, on a road but little traveled. The instructions required a rapid

march during the day and early part of the night to a point from which, after a sufficient rest, Philippi could be certainly reached at 4 o’clock next morning.
My information induced me to believe that two attacking columns, one on the left, the other on the right side of Philippi, would secure every exit which the enemy could use m retreat. I therefore organized the right column, under Colonel Dumont, in conformity with the following order:
Headquarters U. S. Volunteers,
Grafton, W. Fa., June 2, 1861.
Colonel Dumont,
Comdg. Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteers, near Grafton, Va.:
Colonel : You will proceed by railroad this evening at 8.30 o’clock to Webster, with eight companies of your regiment. At Webster you will be joined by Colonel Steed-man, with five companies of his regiment and rwo field pieces, also by Colonel Crittenden, with six companies of his regiment. From Webster you will, with this command, march on Philippi, using your own discretion in the conduct of the march, keeping in view that you should arrive in front of the town at 4 o’clock precisely tomorrow morning.
Information is received that the rebels are in some force at Philippi.
The object of your column will be to divert attention until the attack is made by Colonel Kelley, and should resistance be offered you are to aid him to the extent of your ability. In the conduct of your column you must use your discretion, being governed by such circumstances as may occur. When joined by Colonel Kelley, the whole force will be under his command.
The companies of your regiment will take two full days’ rations. Should you receive instructions from Colonel Kelley that the rebels have retreated, you will join him at once, and act under his command.
By command' of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris:
JOHN A. STEIN,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
This force, in leaving Grafton after dark, had reasonable assurance of reaching the enemy in advance of any information from their friends, and, as events proved, did so. The enemy was entirely off his guard, and was completely surprised, as the reports of those engaged in the attack attest.
The failure to capture the entire rebel force can only be attributed to the storm during the night. This unforeseen misfortune served to call forth an endurance seldom exhibited, and I feel that the heroism of officers and men was as truly displayed in a march of fifteen miles in pitchy darkness, drenching rain, and over a mountainous country as in the irresistible attack and hot pursuit of the discomfited enemy. The last five miles of Colonel Dumont’s column was made in one hour and a quarter. Many men fainted, and were left on the road. Others threw away their haversacks and provisions to keep up, rushing forward with a determination that showed what spirit animated the command. I regard it as remarkable that under such circumstances the two columns were but fifteen minutes apart at the time assigned for their meeting. An able reconnaissance in advance of Colonel Dumont’s column was made by Col. F. W. Lander, whose voluntary aid I gladly accepted, and to whose advice and assistance I am greatly indebted. The immediate direction of the artillery was confided to him. After the bridge was taken he pressed forward and joined Colonel Kelley, rode into the enemy’s ranks, and captured the prisoner reported to have shot Colonel Kelley. He had great difficulty in restraining the Virginia Volunteers from summarily dispatching the man, who is a noted secessionist and a quartermaster of the rebel forces.
From the reports of Colonel Dumont (who, by the fall of Colonel Kelley, had command) you will perceive there is much difficulty in an accurate statement of the enemy’s losses. His killed is estimated from

fifteen to forty, which were carried off, supposed by friends, during the confusion incident to the pursuit of the enemy. A large amount of camp equipage, provisions, arms, wagons, horses, and medical stores were captured, an inventory of which will be made as soon as possible.
Whilst I am happy to state that we have none killed, I am extremely sorry to report that the gallant Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Kegiment, whilst leading the attack of his column, fell severely wounded by a pistol-shot in the right breast. The wound, supposed at first to be mortal, I am glad to know will only deprive us of his valuable counsels and assistance for a few weeks. Although he still suffers, his ultimate recovery may be now regarded as certain. Much of the success of our attack is due to him. His thorough knowledge of the country, his skill in rendering that knowledge available, his cool and unflinching courage, will deprive us for the time of a great support in our enterprise. [Sic.]
To Colonel Dumont, who led the column on the right, too much praise can scarcely be given. For his energy, tact, and cool daring we are greatly indebted.
I feel it would be a trespass upon your patience to enumerate all who deserve especial praise, and would refer you to the report herewith forwarded for minute information, both as respects individuals and the various commanders engaged. I cannot, however, conclude without expressing my obligations to Capt. H. W. Benham, IJ. S. Engineers, for the valuable aid he has afforded me. Indeed, his great knowledge and experience are invaluable to me at ail times, and particularly on this occasion.
Immediately after the action, knowing the exhausted condition of the officers and men, I dispatched Captain Benham to the scene of action, gave him full command, and have the satisfaction to state that he restored order, and placed all in position to repel an attack with a promptness that exhibited his consummate ability and unbounded energy.
Justice obliges me, iu conclusion, to say, that of my staff, brigade inspector, Major Love; my aide-de-camp, Captain Hascall, and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General John A. Stein deserve all the encomiums that a deep sense of my dependene upon them obliges me to express. They are all thorough in their knowledge and untiring in their duties, and I feel sure that their services in my command will be duly appreciated by you, and be remembered gratefully by all.

Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Staunton, Fa., June 6, 1861.
Sir : Inclosed is a copy of a letter that I have written to Colonel Porterfield, at Beverly. From this you will perceive that, while I have received no communication from Colonel Porterfield informing me of the wants of his command, learning of their great need of supplies of ammunition from private sources, I have dispatched an express to him with a supply. From all the information that I have received I am pained to have to express my conviction that Colonel Porterfield is entirely unequal to the position which he occupies. The affair at Philippi was a disgraceful surprise, occurring about daylight, there being no picket guard or guard of any kind on duty. The only wonder is that our men were not cut to pieces. They were all asleep, and were only aroused by the firing of the enemy. The safety of the Northwest and of our inexperienced soldiers depends upon an immediate change of commanders, and giving the command to a bold and experienced leader.
I start in the morning the expedition under Lieutenant-Colonel Heck, under escort of two companies of cavalry, three companies of infantry, and one artillery company, with a battery, if the Tennessee company arrives. I send a large supply of provisions, fifteen hundred muskets, clothing, and all the ammunition that I can raise. I have arranged to concentrate the militia on the route, which will join Colonel Heck, and will be armed by him as they come in. I have the arrangements in progress to start promptly the detachment, which, I am informed, will be sent up on Saturday to this point. We are sadly in want of ammunition, our whole supply being exhausted by this expedition. I hope you will have a sufficient supply forwarded as early as possible to this point.
I would again urge rapid re-enforcements to regain possession of the Northwest, and that I shall receive authority from you to call out and arm the companies from all the valley counties, and send them to that quarter, instead of their going, as heretofore directed, to their different rendezvous. Send up five thousand flint-lock muskets from Richmond and I will have them overhauled and put in order for use. We shall need these in addition to what we have.

Headquarters of Virginia Forces,
Huttonsville, Va., June 9,1861.
Sir: I have the honor to address you as regards the state of my command. The force here now numbers about one thousand, of which one hundred and eighty are cavalry and the balance infantry. This force is not only deficient in drill, but ignorant, both officers and men, of the most ordinary duties of the soldier. With efficient drill officers they might be made effective; but I have to complain that the field officers sent to command these men are of no assistance to me, and are, for the most part, as ignorant of their duties as the company officers, and they as ignorant as the men. I hope, if I am continued in command, that good staff officers may be sent, to aid in organizing this raw force, than which there is none more so now in the service. I have not been able to even get proper returns made out to send to your headquarters, and my own reputation has been injured by the character of my command; in fact, if it had been intended to sa%rifice me, I could not have expected less support than I have had. If it is expected that the troops here should take the field effectively, it is necessary that at least five thousand well-drilled men should be sent at once, as the enemy’s army is being daily re-enforced $ and if aid is not soon sent, it will be impossible to keep the open field, even as a mere corps of observation, but will have to retire to the mountains, where it will be most difficult, if not impossible, to provision even this small force.

The country to the northwest is in a state of revolution, all law-abiding citizens being driven off by the traitors, assisted by Northern troops. The private property of secessionists, but otherwise inoffensive citizens, their cattle, young unbroken horses and colts, and the clothing of women and children, have been seized and taken off from citizens of Philippi. Captain Alexander will give verbally any additional information that may be desired as to the condition of this command.

Sir: I omitted to state in my last report that Lieut. Col. William L. Jackson, Virginia Volunteers, had reported to me for duty. He has been very active, and will become a most useful officer. Colonel Willey, who has also been very zealous and useful, was left sick in Philippi. 1 have assurance that he shall be well treated.
The enemy remains at Philippi, where they are reported to have about five thousand men, and are fortifying themselves. The same number are said to be at Grafton. From five hundred to one thousand are said to be at the Cheat River Bridge; but of this I have no reliable information. Other forces are stationed at different points on the railroads. I understand their object to be to occupy the western part of the State, to the Alleghanies or Blue Ridge, if possible. The greatest outrages have, in numerous cases, been perpetrated upon the private property of secessionists. Some militia companies have recently joined this command. A regiment from Tennessee is expected here to-morrow, having in charge, as I am informed, some pieces of heavy artillery. No pieces heavier than 6-pounders should be sent to this country, until some position is selected to be fortified and a strong and reliable infantry force sent to support it. I am not informed what quantity of ammunition is in Staunton. I have never received any other than the most limited supplies from that place. The percussion caps sent have nearly all been of small size for shot-guns and not large enough for muskets. As re-enforcements are now expected, and we shall have active service in this part of the State, I desire to be continued on duty here. It was not until after repeated calls for aid, aijd when left with a small militia force entirely unprepared for the field, that I asked for duty elsewhere. Beverly is now occupied by our cavalry.

preciate the difficulties you have had to encounter. General E. S. Garnett, 0. S. Army, has been sent to take command in the Northwest, with such a force as was disposable. It is hoped that he will soon reach the scene of action, that a more agreeable state of things will be inaugurated, and that loyal-spirited citizens of the country will be encouraged and enabled to put down the revolution which you mention. Your services will be very valuable to General Garnett, in giving him information as to the state of affairs in the country under his command, and in aiding him to achieve the object of his campaign.

Findings of the Court of Inquiry.
General Orders, )	Headquarters of the Forces,
No. 30.	J	Richmond, Fix., July 4, 1861.
I.—The court of inquiry, which convened at Beverly on the 20th ultimo, at the request of Col. G. A. Porterfield, of the Virginia Volunteers, to examine into the circumstances of the retreat of the Virginia forces from Philippi on the 3d of June, under his command, has reported the following facts in the case:
A force of Virginia troops, consisting of some six hundred effective infantry (or thereabouts), and one hundred and seventy-five cavalry (or thereabouts), sufficiently well armed, but badly and insufficiently supplied with the necessary accouterments and ammunition, was stationed at Philippi, Barbour County, Virginia, on the morning of June 3, 1861 (where they had been for six or seven days), under the command of Col. George A. Porterfield, of the Virginia Volunteers.
On the morning of the day just indicated, at between daybreak and sunrise, this command was attacked and taken by surprise 5 no alarm or intimation of the enemy’s approach having been given by the guard or infantry pickets, until the enemy was within some four hundred yards of the place, and had commenced the fire from his artillery. By the examination it is shown that a main and picket guard, as strong as was consistent with the effective infantry force present, was regularly detailed and posted at distances sufficiently far out to accomplish the object in view, provided they knew and did their duty, which latter is strongly to be suspected| from the fact that, although in advance, they failed to give any intimation of the enemy’s approach, a conclusion which is strengthened by the official report of the mounted officers, out with the scouting parties on the night of June 2, that they had neither seen an infantry picket nor been challenged by its sentinels, going from or returning to the town that night. It appears that, immediately upon the arrival of the command at Philippi, the officer in command, Colonel Porterfield, took measures to place his force, which was raw and new in service, under a course of instruction, and to select those, in his opinion, best fitted to instruct the sentinels and guards in their duties. The testimony shows that, while there was a certain degree of confusion in some quarters, a portion of the command moved from the town in good order, and that the whole force, nearly, after passing some distance from the town, was reformed, and proceeded in order.

ACTION AT PHILIPPI, W. VA.
It is shown in the evidence that an expectation of attack or movement upon Philippi, shortly to be made, was entertained generally among the officers and others of the command, and that intelligence (how well founded is not known) was brought from time to time of the strength and supposed intent of the enemy.
The testimony sets forth that this had so far produced its effect as to induce the officer in command to call a meeting of his officers; that the result of their consultations and deliberations was an almost, if not unanimous decision in favor of immediate retreat; that when Colonel Porterfield returned to the room (from which he had been absent a short time) their opinion was conveyed to him, to which he seemed loth to accede; yet, determined to make a further examination of the ammunition on hand, and to prepare the baggage and train for removal at a moment’s notice.
No orders to march at any particular time were given, so far as can be gathered from the testimony, although it appears that an understanding or impression was had or entertained by some that the movement would not take place until morning, while some believed it contingent upon the weather.
The record will disclose the fact of a difference of construction (as to the hour of return) of the orders given to the officer in command of the cavalry company, from which the scouting party or parties was taken for duty on the night of 2d instant.
The testimony of several witnesses bears evidence of the cool, deliberate, and self-possessed conduct of Colonel Porterfield on the morning of June 3.
The court having been directed to express its opinion, as well as report the facts, presents the following:
1st. That the commanding officer, having received information, deemed by him sufficient to prepare for an early retreat, erred in permitting himself to be influenced by the weather, so far as to delay the execution of his plan.
2d. That the commanding officer did order dispositions to be made to prevent surprise ; but a misunderstanding as to the time at which the scouts were to be called in, and a total want of proper vigilance on the part of the infantry pickets, caused a surprise, which distinct and definite instructions, properly executed, would have avoided.
3d. That the commanding officer erred in not advancing and strengthening his picket beyond the usual limits under the circumstances.
4th. That the commanding officer exhibited upon the occasion decided coolness, self-possession, and personal courage, and exerted himself, as far as possible, to effect a retreat in good order.
II.—The commanding general having attentively considered the proceedings of the court of inquiry in the foregoing case, concurs in the opinion expressed by the court and in the statement of facts deduced from the testimony. These facts show that the position at Philippi was seriously threatened by a superior force of the enemy, distant only four hours’ march; that Colonel Porterfield was aware of the danger of his position, and prudently prepared to evacuate it. His desire to prevent the occupation of the town by the enemy was worthy of all praise, and had he promptly sent back his baggage and ineffective men, arranged his plan of defense, and taken proper measures to secure information of the advance of the enemy, he might safely have retained his position, and either given battle or retired, as circumstances might dictate. It does not appear from the record of the court that any plan of defense was formed; but it does appear that the troops retired with-

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
out his orders, and that the instructions to his advance guard were either misconceived or not executed. To these circumstances must be attributed the disaster that followed, and they call for heavy censure upon all concerned. The commanding general remarks with pleasure upon the coolness, self-possession, courage, and energy displayed by Colonel Porterfield at the moment of attack 5 but he cannot exonerate him from blame in not taking proper precautionary measures beforehand. Yet, in consideration of all the circumstances of the case, he does not think it necessary to do more than to express the opinion of the court, in the hope that the sad effects produced by the want of forethought and vigilance, as exhibited in this case, will be a lesson to be remembered by the army throughout the war.

Report of Commander R. B. Regram, C. S. Wavy.
Pig Point Battery. June 5,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the Federal steamer Harriet Lane stood within range of this battery at 9 a. m. to-day, and, tailing a position at the distance of one and a half miles, commenced firing upon us with shot and shell from her 11-inch shell-gun and 32-pounders. She fired about thirty-three shot and shell, many of them well directed, but no one of our party was hurt, nor did the fortifications sustain any injury. A 32-pounder shot struck the muzzle of one of our 8-inch shell-guns and cracked it from the face to the chase ring. The gun at the same time was run in for loading, and, although the shot was broken in three fragments in the midst of our men, no one sustained the slightest injury. A number of shells exploded near and around us, but all fell harmless to the ground. In return we fired twenty-three shot and shell 5 four or five were seen to take effect in the hull of the steamer, and, I am inclined to believe, did her some injury, from the manner in which she moved off.
For men who had never before been in action, the Portsmouth Bifles were remarkably cool and self-possessed, and, after a few rounds, got the range of the enemy and fired admirably well. Every officer and man behaved in the most spirited and creditable manner, and were so regardless of danger, that I had often to interpose my authority to prevent their exposing themselves unnecessarily to the enemy’s fire. The action lasted about fifteen or twenty minutes.

JUNE 7, 1861.—Reconnaissance from Yorktown to Newport News, Va.
Report of Capt. W. RL. Werth, Chatham Grays, Virginia Cavalry.
Camp Yorktown, June 12,1861.
Sir : I beg leave to make the following report of a reconnaissance made by me of the enemy’s position at Hewport Hews on Friday, 7th June, 1861:
I had under my command twenty picked men and horses from the Old Dominion Dragoons, together with two men from my company. Captain Philips accompanied me, as did Lieutenant Cary and Lieutenant Harrison, the latter from the Charles City Cavalry. My object was to make a close examination of the enemy’s works at Hewport Hews, which I knew would be of service to you in your future movements. I did not start with the intention of pressing my men into certain ruin by an attack upon an overwhelming force, but simply to make a reliable reconnaissance. At about 1 o’clock I had approached the enemy’s position to within two miles. I, Captain Philips, and two men were in advance of the detachment some four hundred yards, whilst two men marched the same distance in rear.

## p. 76 (#92) ##############################################

﻿76
OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX
At this juncture I saw a squad of eight men on the bank of James River, and distant from me some distance, probably a mile and a half. I examined them with my glass, and knew them to be soldiers. They immediately fled toward their fortifications. I saw at once that if I allowed them to reach the works and give the alarm, my whole command might be cut off and my reconnaissance broken up, so I at once ordered a forward movement at speed so that J might cut them off. Our advance party of five being better mounted, and having so much the start, distanced the detachment in running the two miles, and placed them probably six hundred yards in the rear. When our little advance party had ridden to within seven hundred yards of Newport News fortifications, I ordered Captain Philips and the two men of the advance guard to change direction to the right, so that he might get between the eight fugitives and the works, whilst I continued my direct advance upon the works, thinking if Captain Philips failed to intercept these men that I should certainly meet them.
After I had approached the fortifications of the enemy to within four hundred yards, I turned to the right (the James River side) to head the eight men. I had gone in this direction probably two or three hundred yards, when suddenly I came up to within fifty yards of a party of the enemy engaged in cutting wood. I was then entirely alone. I halted and hid myself behind a thicket only twenty yards from the party. Here I remained long enough to count the number of men, distinguish the officers, &c. In about three minutes the eight men (whom Captain Philips had failed to intercept) raised the alarm in the Massachusetts regiment (which was encamped outside of the works, and not more than one hundred and sixty yards from the spot where I stood), and I at once saw that I must do quickly whatever I intended doing, so I reined my horse back, and walked him out into the clearing in plain view of the whole party, and not more than twenty paces from them, picked out the commissioned officer, and shot him dead in his tracks. The whole party then yelled, “Look out, look out for the d-^—d Virginia horsemen; they are down upon us,” &c., and at once threw down everything they had, and commenced a retreat at a double quick. I put the spurs to my horse and rode into them at full speed (giving at the same time a loud walla-walla war-whoop), and then delivered my second shot, which brought another man (a private) dead to the ground. (I shot the first one through the heart, and the last one under the right shoulder-blade.)
My horse by this time became totally unmanageable, and my third fire missed its aim, but killed a sorrel mule. I fired only these three shots. The party consisted of twenty-seven privates of infantry, two privates of artillery, one commissioned officer, and one non-commissioned officer of infantry—in all, thirty-one. Their uniform corresponded with mine—gray cloth with black trimming. Captain Philips and his party of two men had been joined in the mean time by the main party, and I soon crossed over to them. We then galloped after the retreating enemy, but saw one or two companies from the regiment running to the rescue, which induced me to apprehend an attack. In this I was mistaken, for instead of the party of thirty-one rallying in the two companies, the two companies partook of the panic, and rushed back towards the fortifications, yelling “Virginia horsemen” as long as I staid to hear them. The party of thirty-one had their arms stacked against a tree, whilst four of them were on guard with their muskets. I cannot say whether the guard fired or not. I did not pay much attention to them. The two companies which came to the rescue had their muskets, but forgot to fire. On the left wing of the encampment there was a field

battery of two brass 12-pounders, unlimbered, which were not over one hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty yards from us, but the gunners had abandoned the battery. If I had not been so entirely at the mercy of the guns of the fortifications at Newport News (only about six hundred yards off), I should certainly have burned the whole encampment, for it is my firm impression the whole regiment ran into the works and abandoned everything.
Captain Philips, I must say, proved upon this occasion that he was a man of consummate coolness and bravery, and his men are of that kind of metal which can be relied upon under any and all circumstances. Lieutenants Cary and Harrison were prepared for anything, and I am convinced would have followed to any place where their horses could have leaped.
In making the approach I went by New Market Bridge and St. Clair’s Steam Mill, but upon returning I took a new road through the woods, fearing the troops from Hampton had formed an ambuscade for my reception. I returned to Bethel by 6 o’clock without damage, and then joined my command on Poquosin Biver.

General : Having learned that the enemy had established an outpost of some strength at a place called Little Bethel, a small church about eight miles from Newport News, and the same distance from Hampton, from whence they were accustomed nightly to advance both on Newport News and the picket guards of Hampton, to annoy them, and also from whence they had come down in small squads of cavalry and taken a number of Union men, some of whom had the safeguard

[Chap. IX.
and protection of the troops of the United States, and forced them into the rebel ranks, and that they were also gathering up the slaves of citizens who had moved away and left their farms in charge of their negroes, carrying them to work in intrenchments at Williamsburg and Yorktown, I had determined to send up a force to drive them back and destroy their camp, the headquarters of which was this small church.
I had also learned that at a place a short distance farther on, on the road to Yorktown, was an outwork of the rebels on the Hampton side of a place called Big Bethel, a large church near the head of the north branch of Back Elver; that here was a very considerable rendezvous, with works of more or less strength in process of erection, and from this point the whole country was laid under contribution. Accordingly, I ordered General Pierce, who is in command of Camp Hamilton, at Hampton, to send Duryea’s regiment of zouaves to be ferried over Hampton Creek at 1 o’clock this morning, and to march by the road up to New Market Bridge $ thence, crossing the bridge, to go by a by-road, and thus put the regiment in the rear of the enemy and between Big Bethel and Little Bethel, in part for the purpose of cutting him off, and then to make an attack upon Little Bethel. I directed General Pierce to support him from Hampton with Colonel Townsend’s regiment with two mounted howitzers, and to march about an hour later. At the same time I directed Colonel Phelps, commanding at Newport News, to send out a battalion composed of such companies of the regiments under his command as he thought best, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn, in time to make a demonstration upon Little Bethel in front, and to have him supported by Colonel Bendix’s regiment with two field pieces. Bendix’s and Townsend’s regiments should effect a junction at a fork of the road leading from Hampton to Newport News, something like a mile and a half from Little Bethel.
I directed the march to be so timed that the attack should be made just at daybreak, and that after the attack wras made upon Little Bethel, Duryea’s regiment and a regiment from Newport News should follow immediately upon the heels of the fugitives, if they were enabled to get off, and attack the battery on the road to Big Bethel while covered by the fugitives, or, if it was thought expedient by General Pierce, failing to surprise the camp at Little Bethel, they should attempt to take the work near Big Bethel. To prevent the possibility of mistake in the darkness, I directed that no attack should be made until the watchword was shouted by the attacking regiment, and in case that, by any mistake in the march, the regiments that were to make the junction should unexpectedly meet, and be unknown to each other, also directed that the members of Colonel Townsend’s regiment should be known, if in daylight, by something white worn on the arm.
The troops were accordingly put in motion as ordered, and the march was so timed that Colonel Duryea had got in the position noted upon the accompanying sketch, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn, in command of the regiment from Newport News, had got into the position indicated upon the sketch, and Bendix’s regiment had been posted and ordered to hold the fork of the road with two pieces of artillery, and Townsend’s regiment had got the place indicated just behind, and about to form a junction as the day dawned.
Up to this point the plan had been vigorously, accurately, and successfully carried out. But here, by some strange fatuity, and as yet unexplained blunder, without any word of notice, while Townsend was in column en route, and when the head of the column was within one hundred yards, Colonel Bendix’s regiment opened fire with both artillery

79
and musketry upon Townsend’s column, which in the hurry and confusion was irregularly returned by some of Townsend’s men, who feared that they had fallen into an ambuscade. Townsend’s column immediately retreated to the eminence near by, and were not pursued by Ben-dix’s men. By this almost criminal blunder two men of Townsend’s regiment were killed, and eight (more or less) wounded. Hearing this cannonading and firing in his rear, Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn, not knowing but that his communication might be cut off, immediately reversed his march, as did Colonel Duryea, and marched back to form a junction with his reserves. General Pierce, who was with Townsend’s regiment, fearing that the enemy had got notice of our approach and had posted himself in force on the line of march, and not getting any communications from Colonel Duryea, sent back to me for re-enforcements, and I immediately ordered Colonel Allen’s regiment to be put in motion, and they reached Hampton about 7 o’clock. In the mean time, the true state of facts having been ascertained by General Pierce, the regiment effected a junction and resumed the line of march. At the moment of the firing of Bendix, Colonel Duryea had surprised a part of an outlying guard of the enemy, consisting of three persons, who have been brought in to me. Of course, by this firing, all hope of a surprise upon the camp at Little Bethel was lost, and upon marching upon it it was found to have been vacated, and the cavalry had pressed on toward Big Bethel. Colonel Duryea, however, destroyed the camp at Little Bethel, and advanced. General Pierce then, as he informs me, with the advice of his colonels, thought best to attempt to carry the works of the enemy at Big Bethel, and made dispositions to that effect.
The attack commenced, as I am informed (for I have not yet received any official reports) about half past 9 o’clock. At about 10 o’clock General Pierce sent a note to me, saying that there was a sharp engagement with the enemy, and that he thought he should be able to maintain his position until re-enforcements could come up. Acting upon this information, Colonel Carr’s regiment, which had been ordered in the morning to proceed as far as New Market Bridge, was allowed to go forward. I received this information, for which I had sent a special messenger, about 12 o’clock.
I immediately made disposition from Newport News to have Colonel Phelps, from the four regiments there, to forward aid, if necessary. As soon as these orders could be sent forward I repaired to Hampton, for the purpose of having proper ambulances and wagons for the sick and wounded, intending to go forward and join the command. While the wagons were going forward a messenger came announcing that the engagement had terminated, and that the troops were retiring in good order to camp.
I remained upon the ground at Hampton, personally seeing the wounded put in boats and towed around to the hospital, and ordering forward Lieutenant Morris, Vith two boat howitzers, to cover the rear of the returning column in case it should be attacked. Having been informed that the ammunition of the artillery had been expended, and seeing the head of the column approach Hampton in good order, 1 waited for General Pierce to come up. I am informed by him that the dead and wounded had all been brought off, and that the return had been conducted in good order and without haste. I learned from him that the men behaved with great steadiness, with the exception of some few instances, and that the attack wTas made with propriety, vigor, and courage, but that the enemy were found to be supported by a battery variously estimated as of from fifteen to twenty pieces, some of which

were rifled caimon, which were very well served, and protected from being readily turned by a creek in front.
Our loss is very considerable, amounting, perhaps, to forty or fifty, a quarter part of which, you will see, was from the unfortunate mistake, to call it by no worse name, of Colonel Bendix.
I will, as soon as official returns can be got, give a fuller detail of the affair) and will only add now that we have to regret especially the death of Lieutenant Greble, of the Second Artillery, who went out with Colonel Washburn from Newport News, and who very efficiently and gallantly fought his piece until he was struck by a cannon-shot.
I will endeavor to get accurate statements to forward by the next mail.
I think, in the unfortunate combination of circumstances and the result which we experienced, we have gained more than we have lost. Our troops have learned to have confidence in themselves under fire. The enemy have shown that they will not meet us in the open field. Our officers have learned wherein their organization and drill are inefficient.
While waiting for the official reports, I have the honor to submit thus far the information of which I am possessed.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. E. BUTLEE, Major-General, Commanding.
Lieutenant-General Scott.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fortress Monroe, June 16, 1861.
General : Upon examination of the official reports of the officers commanding the various corps who were engaged in the skirmish at Big Bethel, I find nothing to add or correct in my former dispatch, in so far as relates to the dispositions for the attack. It now turns out beyond controversy, as I deem, that the firing was commenced upon Colonel Townsend’s by Colonel Bendix’s men. It is not so certain whether Colonel Bendix gave the order to fire or not, although the evidence is strong upon the point that he did so. It was evidently a mistake, and in spite of the precaution that, before any order to fire was to be given in the dark, the watchword u Boston” should be shouted, and that Colonel Townsend’s men should be distinguished by a white badge upon the arm, with which order Colonel Townsend complied. Lieutenant Greble, of the Second Artillery (regulars), whose loss as a gallant officer, thorough soldier, and amiable man we all must deplore, was with Colonel Bendix’s command and participated in the mistake of Colonel Bendix, as I am informed by the colonel’s report. Colonel Townsend has desired a court of inquiry for the purpose of investigating this transaction, with which reqfuest, as soon as the exigencies of the public service will permit, I shall comply.
As I stated in the former report, this attack was not intended to enable us to hold Big Bethffi as a post, because it was not seriously in our way on any proposed road to Yorktown, and therefore there was never any intention of maintaining it, even if captured. The length of the road and the heat of the weather had caused great fatigue, as many of the troops, the previous night having been cool, had marched with their thickest clothing. I take leave to assure you that every precaution had been taken to prevent notice to the enemy of our approach. A picket guard had been sent out on the night before at 10

o’clock to prevent the egress of persons from our camp in the direction of Yorktown, but we have since learned that information had been communicated to the enemy of our approach, and we believe that we have under arrest the person who communicated the intelligence—a discharged soldier of the United States many years since, who resided in Hampton. If the evidence is satisfactory to a court-martial, he will be dealt with with such severity of punishment as will be a lesson to the many who surround us, and who are engaged in the same nefarious business.
From subsequent information I am certain that the force which was at first in Great Bethel did not exceed a regiment, and had the order been executed which I had given to General Pierce of attack, that, uif we find the enemy and surprise them, we will fire a volley if necessary, not reload, but go ahead with the bayonet,” I have no doubt of the capture of the battery. But in attempting to obtain information upon the road as to the force in Big Bethel, the exaggerated statements of the inhabitants and the negroes as to the numbers intrenched were taken, instead of the estimates and information of the commanding general, so that it was believed by the officers in command and by the men that there were 4,000 or 5,000 there in force. From the intelligence given the enemy, and the unfortunate occurrence of the morning, two regiments to re-enforce them were at last brought up, but not until about the time our troops retired. I make no doubt that the battery would have been taken but for another unfortunate mistake, as reported to me, wherein the colonel of a regiment mistook two companies of his own men, which had been separated from him by a thicket, for a flanking party of the enemy, making a sortie from the battery, and because of that mistake retired $ so that it would seem that the skirmish was lost twice because our officers mistook their friends for their enemies. I am informed, and fully believe, that immediately upon the retiring of our troops, for the purpose, as was supposed by the enemy, of turning the flank of the battery, the battery was immediately evacuated, and remained so evacuated until the second day. If it was so done it would be a matter of no consequence, because, as General Scott had been informed, as I have already previously stated, it was no part of our intention to occupy it. The major part of the officers and men behaved with the greatest gallantry and good conduct, and I have to mention in terms of commendation the gallantry and courage of Colonel Townsend, the coolness and firmness of Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn, and the efficiency of Captain Haggerty, of my staff, who was acting as aid to General Pierce, a part of his own being sick.
The country has to deplore the loss of Maj. Theodore Winthrop, my acting military secretary, who led the advance corps with Colonel Duryea, and who the moment before his death had gone forward on the right with the detachment of Vermont and Massachusetts troops, under order of Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn, and who at the moment of his death was engaged in finding the best manner of entering the battery, when he fell mortally wounded. His conduct, his courage, his efficiency in the field, were spoken of in terms of praise by all who saw him.
Subsequent knowledge has shown beyond all question that if, at the time our troops retired, an advance had "been ordered, the battery would have been taken; but this is the result of subsequent knowledge, and is not to be taken as evidence of the want of efficiency of those in command of our troops. It is a pleasure to be able to announce that our loss was much less even than was reported in my former dispatch, 6 n u—yol H

and appears by the official report furnished herewith. Our loss of those permanently injured is twenty-five. I have the honor again to inform you that we have gained much more than we have lost tiy the skirmish at Big Bethel, and while the advance upon the battery and the capture of it might have added eclat to the occasion, it would not have added to its substantial results. I have been very careful to procure an accurate account of the dead, wounded, and missing, in order that I may assure those friends who are anxious for the safety of our soldiers and an exact account may be given of all those injured. There is nothing to be gained by any concealment in this regard. The exact truth, which is to be stated at all times, if anything is stated, is especially necessary on such occasions. In this behalf I think we are not to take a lesson from our enemies. I am happy to add that upon sending a message to Yorktown I found that the courtesies of civilized warfare have been and are intended to sbe extended to us by the enemies of the country now in arms, which in this department at all times shall be fully reciprocated. 1 have omitted a detailed statement of the move-% ments of the various corps in this attack, because, while it might be * interesting, yet, without a map of the ground and details, would serve no useful purpose. I forward herewith the official reports of General Pierce and Colonels Bendix and Townsend, which contain all that may be material.

Report of Brig. Gen. E. W. Pierce, Massachusetts Militia.
Camp Hamilton, June 12,1861.
Sir : Sunday forenoon, June 9,1861, I received an order requiring my attendance at your headquarters forthwith, where I arrived at about 11 o’clock, and found you and Colonel Duryea, of my command, consulting upon a plan of proposed attack upon places known as Big Bethel and Little Bethel, and received from Captain Butler, of your staff, the following plan of operations:
A regiment or battalion to march from Camp Hamilton (Duryea’s), each

to be supported by sufficient reserves, under arms in camp and in advance guard out on the line of march. Duryea to push out two pickets at 10 p. in., one also two and a half miles beyond Hampton, on the county road, but not so far as to alarm the enemy. This is important. Second picket half as far as the first ; both pickets as much out of sight as possible. No one, whomsoever, to be allowed to pass put through their lines. Persons to be allowed to pass inwards, unless it appeared they intend to go around about and dodge through the point. At 12 o’clock p. m. (midnight) Colonel Duryea will march his regiment, with twenty rounds cartridges, in the county road toward Little Bethel; scows to be provided to ferry them across Hampton Creek.
March to he rapid, hut not hurried.
A howitzer, with canister and shrapnel, to go, and a wagon with planks and materials to repair New Market Bridge. Duryea to have the 200 rifles; he will pick the men to whom they are intrusted. Rockets to be thrown up from Newport News. Notify Commodore Pendergrast of this, to prevent general alarm. Newport News movement to be made somewhat later, as the distance is somewhat less. If we find the enemy and surprise them, we will fire a volley if desirable, not reload, and go ahead.with the bayonet. As the attack is to be made at night, or the gray of the morning, and in two detachments, our people should have some token, say a white rag, or nearest approach to white attainable, on the left arm. Perhaps the detachments who are engaged in the expedition should be smaller than a regiment.
If we capture the Little Bethel men, push on to Big Bethel aud similarly capture them. Burn up both the Bethels. Blow up, if brick. To protect our rear in case we take either field pieces, and the enemy should march the main body, if there are any, to recover them, it would be well to have a party of competent artillerists, regular or otherwise, to handle the captured guns on the retirement of our main body; also spikes to spike them. George Scott is to have a revolver. And in pursuance of these orders is issued the following order early Sunday evening:
General Orders. >	Headquarters Camp Hamilton, June 9, 1861.
No. 12.	5
A plan of attack to-niglit is herewith inclosed and forwarded to Colonel Duryea, commanding Fifth Eegiment of New York State Volunteers, who will act accordingly. Colonel Townsend, commanding Third Regiment of New York State Volunteers, will march his command in support of Colonel Duryea. Colonel Carr, commanding the Second Regiment New York State Volunteers, will detach the artillery company of his regiment with their field pieces, and take their position at the burned bridge, near Hampton. Colonels Allen, Carr, and MeChesney will hold their entire command in readiness, fully prepared to march at a moment’s notice. All the troops will bo supplied with one day’s rations, and each man with twenty rounds of hall cartridges; and, that no mistake may be made, all the troops, as they charge, will shout “ Boston.” Colonels Allen, Carr, Townsend, Duryea, and MeChesney will govern themselves accordingly.
By command of Brig. Gen. E. W. Pierce:
'	R. A. PIERCE, Brigade Major.
And, in compliance with this order, Colonel Duryea sent out two pickets at 10 o’clock p. m., two and one-half miles beyond Hampton, on the county road, with orders to keep out of sight as much as possible, allowing persons to pass in, but none to pass out. At twenty minutes past 12 o’clock (midnight) Colonel Duryea passed the remainder of his command over the river at Hampton, and pushed on for Little Bethel, having now upon that side of the river some 850 men. He was followed about two hours after by the Third Regiment New York State Volunteers, Colonel Townsend, with G50 men, and a detachment from Colonel Carr’s regiment, with two mountain howitzers, under the direction of

a non-commissioned officer and four privates of the IT. S. Army, accompanied by myself, with an aide-de-camp; and we had proceeded on about four miles, having taken the precaution to keep a mounted officer considerably in advance to reconnoiter the road until we had reached New Market Bridge, where we came up with a considerable number of Colonel Duryea’s men, who were left to guard the bridge. Passing on myself, with aide-de-camp still being considerably in advance, we discovered a large body of armed men by the roadside, who- appeared to be emerging from the woods and taking up their position on the road, and, believing them to be friends, we were passing on, when we suddenly discovered that they were occupying the road with a field piece, just ready to open fire upon us, and we were immediately saluted by a volley from their small-arms and a discharge from their field piece, quickly followed by an indiscriminate fire from Colonel Townsend’s regiment. I rode back, ordered them to cease firing, charge bayonets, and shout Boston. Colonel Townsend’s men fell to the right and left of the road in confusion, but in a few minutes rallied and reformed, by directions of myself and Colonel Townsend, under a very heavy fire. I then ordered the column to withdraw to a position about one-half a mile back across the bridge, on rising ground, where they could sustain themselves, destroying the bridge as we passed. This movement I caused to be made, hoping to draw the supposed enemy from their positions, and also to await re-enforcements, which I had sent for, from Hampton. When we found the supposed enemy advancing, I threw out skirmishers, who, to my surprise, I soon found uniting themselves with the supposed enemy, who in a few minutes proved to be friends, and a portion of the forces from Newport News, commanded by Colonel Bendix. The result of this fire upon us was, 2 mortally wounded (1 since dead); 3 dangerously ; 4 officers and 12 privates slightly; making a total, 21.
Leaving the rest to collect the wounded and refresh the tired men, I had an interview with the commanding officers present—Colonels Townsend, Duryea, and Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn—and was strongly advised by Duryea and Washburn not to proceed, as the enemy, being now warned of our approach, would gain strength from Yorktown, and that the original design of surprise had now become fully frustrated. I decided that it was my duty to follow my written instructions, and in this decision was sustained by Major Winthrop and Captain Haggerty, your aides-de-camp.
In answer to the remonstrance of Colonel Duryea and Washburn, that re-enforcements would come from Yorktown, I replied that we had already sent for re-enforcements from Camp Hamilton, and I hoped that ours at least might equal theirs. We then marched on, being joined by the forces from Newport News; and in reply to the question from Colonel Washburn, how are we to proceed, I said, follow the original design of General Butler to the extent of our several abilities.
Soon after arrived at Little Bethel. That we burned, finding no resistance, and halted the column, bringing the artillery to the front. We soon after obtained the testimony of a woman at a farm-house that Big Bethel was garrisoned by some 4,000 men, and from a negro obtained substantially a like information. When we arrived within a mile of County Bridge the column halted, and .Captains Kilpatrick and Bartlett having discovered that the enemy were holding a strong position in battery at the head of the road, we now drew up in line of battle at the skirts of the wood, the artillery and howitzers being pushed some thirty rods up the road. Captains Winslow, Bartlett, and Kilpatrick having been ordered to advance as skirmishers, the regiment of Colonel Duryea

was by my orders moved out to the right of the main road, the right flank resting behind a dense wood which skirted the road, where it remained in line of battle in an open field about 800 paces from the battery.
The forces from Newport News were brought into a second line of battle in the field to the left of the road, and were soon after moved by a flank so as to cross the road to cover the front, then being vacated by the Fifth Begiment, now being marched by a flank through and covered by the woods on the right, the Fifth Begiment being supported on the right by the forces from Newport News. The latter, being marched through the woods for that purpose, made several attempts to charge the batteries, but were prevented by creek. Meanwhile the artillery in the road was operated by the directions of Lieutenant Greble, who lost his life just at the close of the action.
While this was being done on the right, I directed Colonel Townsend, with his regiment, to advance and take a position in a lane at right angles to the main road leading to the battery, where he was directed to send out skirmishers to ascertain the strength of the enemy’s right, and for that purpose detailed Captains John G. Butler and Edwin S. Jenny, with their companies, to cross the field immediately, and to so skirmish as to draw the enemy’s fire, which was gallantly performed. The enemy’s fire was delivered vigorously. Colonel Townsend now moved his regiment up to the point where the skirmishers were engaged—a movement which the regiment performed in line of battle as if on parade, in the face of a severe fire of artillery and small-arms, in a manner entirely sat-isfaetory—and were joined by about one hundred of the Fifth Begiment as skirmishers on the right of Colonel Townsend’s command.
By the time Colonel Townsend’s regiment had arrived at its position it became apparent that the battery had been strongly re-enforced, and that any effort to take it was useless. Besides, a company of that regiment had been separated from the regiment by a thickly-hedged ditch, and as the regiment moved forward towards the skirmishers this company marched into the adjoining field in a line with the regiment. This was not known to Colonel Townsend, who supposed, when the regiment approached, that it was the entire regiment. Consequently, upon seeing among the breaks in the hedges the glistening of bayonets in the.
adjoining field, [he flanking him, [and'
immediately concluded that the enemy were out-conceived it to be his duty to retire and repel their advance, when by his order his regiment resumed their original position. Shortly after I directed all the forces to retire.
Colonel Duryea having said that his men were tired out, completely exhausted, and that they must be taken to the rear, Colonel Allen, of the First New York Begiment, advancing at this time, I immediately directed him to throw his regiment into the lane to the left of the main road leading to the battery, and the Second Begiment, Colonel Carr commanding, were by order promptly formed in line of battle, covering the ground lately occupied by the Fifth Begiment, with their field pieces, upon the left. I then ordered the killed and wounded picked up placed in whatever vehicle could be procured for their conveyance, the regiments of Colonels Allen and Carr mean while keeping the enemy at bay. On the retreat the regiment of Colonel Duryea led the column, followed by that of Colonel Townsend and the forces from Newport News, the regiments of Colonels Allen and Carr forming the rear guard of the retreating column. Some difficulty was experienced in keeping the men in proper order during the retreat, the men being so exhausted by thirst as to rush out of the ranks wherever water was to be had.
For killed, wounded, and missing please refer to my former report.

In closing this report, I wish to bear my testimony to the gallant and soldierlike conduct of Colonel Townsend, who was indefatigable in encouraging his men and leading them in the hottest scenes of the action. I also desire to acknowledge the valuable service rendered me by the lamented Major Winthrop and Captain Haggerty, of your staff, in carrying orders to posts of exposure and danger. Colonel Carr, in covering the retreat, showed himself a good soldier, ready and willing to do his duty. In the death of Lieutenant Greble, of IJ. S.

Report of Col. Frederick Townsend, Third Few York Infantry.
Hdqrs. Third Beuiment N. Y. Volunteers,
June 12,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report, for the information of Brigadier-General Pierce, that on the evening of Sunday, June 9,1 received orders from him to have my command in readiness, with one day’s rations, to move that night, to form part of a column composed of two regiments from Newport News and Colonel Djiryea’s and my own, intended to make a reconnaissance in force towards Yorktown. In obedience to these orders, with the concerted sign of a white badge upon our left arms, at midnight I marched my regiment to Hampton, where the general met the command and accompanied it.
On approaching a defile through a thick wood, about five or six miles from Hampton, a heavy and well-sustained fire of canister and small-arms was opened upon the regiment while it was marching in a narrow road upon the flank, in route step, and wholly unsuspicious of an enemy, inasmuch as we were ordered to re-enforce Colonel Duryea, who had preceded us by some two hours, and who had been ordered to throw out as he marched an advance guard two and a half miles from his regiment and a sustaining force half way between the advance and the regiment; therefore, had Colonel Duryea been obliged to retreat upon us before we reached his locality, we should have heard distant firing or some of his regiment would have been seen retreating. The force which fired upon us was subsequently ascertained to be only the regiment of Colonel Bendix, though a portion of the Vermont and Fourth Massachusetts regiments were with it, having come down with two 6-pounder field pieces from Newport News to join the column. These regiments took up a masked position in the woods at the commencement of the defile. The result of the fire upon us was, two mortally wounded (one since dead), three dangerously, and four officers and twelve privates slightly, making a total of twenty-one.
At the commencement of the fire the general, Captain Chamberlain, his aide-de-camp, and two mountain howitzers, were about two hundred and fifty paces in advance of the regiment. The fire was opened upon them first by a discharge from small-arms, and immediately followed

by a rapidly-sustained volley upon my regiment and the Held pieces. My men then generally discharged their pieces and jumped to the right and left of the road, and recommenced loading and firing. In a few minutes the regiment was reformed in. the midst of this heavy fire, and by the generals directions retired in a thoroughly military manner, in order to withdraw the supposed enemy from his position.
On ascertaining that the enemy were our friends, and providing for the wounded, we joined Colonel Duryea and Colonel Bendix, the former having returned, and proceeded on the reconnaissance at Big Bethel. Some seven or more miles on we found the enemy in force, well fortified, with a battery, said to be of twenty guns, in position, some of them rifle cannon. The information relative to the guns in position at the Bethel battery was given to me on the ground by Colonel Duryea, who informed me that he received it from a reconnoitering officer whom he had sent to the front to ascertain the position of things. On arriving at this point, in order to feel the enemy, battle was immediately given by the orders of the general. We were ordered to take up a position in a field about eight hundred paces from the battery. I was then directed by the general to advance to a position in a road at right angles to the main road leading to the battery, and about two hundred paces from it, on the left of Colonel Duryea. I was then directed to send out skirmishers to ascertain the strength of the enemy's right, for which purpose I detailed Capts. John G. Butler and Edwin S. Jenny, with their companies, to cross the field immediately in front of the right of the battery, and so to skirmish as to draw the enemy’s fire, which duty they gallantly performed. The enemy’s fire was delivered vigorously almost immediately upon these companies entering the field. On crossing it myself, and considering that there might be a possibility of our capturing the battery, I moved the regiment up to the point where our skirmishers were engaged—a movement which the regiment performed in line of battle as if on parade, in face of a severe fire of artillery and small-arms, and in a manner entirely to my satisfaction.
By the time the regiment had arrived at its position it became evident that the right portion of the battery had been strongly re-enforced by men from the enemy’s left, and that an effort to take the battery then was useless; besides, a company of my regiment had been separated from the regiment by a thickly-hedged ditch, and as the regiment moved forward toward the skirmishers, this company marched in the adjoining field on a line with the regiment.
This was not known to me until after the engagement. I supposed when the regiment approached that it was the entire regiment. Consequently, upon seeing among the breaks in the hedge the glistening of bayonets in the adjoining field, I immediately concluded that the enemy were outflanking us, and conceived it to be my duty immediately to retire and repel that advance. I resumed, therefore, my original position on the left of Colonel Duryea. Shortly after all the forces were directed to retire, the design of the reconnaissance having been accomplished.
I of course forbear speaking of the movements of other corps, excepting as immediately connected with my regiment, and it were especially gratuitous, inasmuch as the general was upon the field and directed the movements of the various commands in person.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
FRED’K TOWNSEND,
Colonel Third Regiment,

Report of Col. John E. Bendixy Seventh New York Infantry.
Camp Butler, Newport News, Headquarters Seventh Regiment N Y. F, June 12,1861.
Sir : On the evening of the 10th instant I proceeded, according to instructions, to the cross-roads, and took my position as reserve with one field piece. JThe advance, consisting of 300 men of the Vermont, 300 of the Massachusetts, and 150 men belonging to my regiment, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Washburn, of the Vermont regiment, had gone on with one field piece. I was taking my position when we saw what I supposed some cavalry. I asked the gunner if he was loaded. The answer was, u No, sir.” Then I directed him to load, but before this was done the firing commenced. Lieutenant Greble, of the U. S. Army, rode forward for assistance. The firing lasted some fifteen minutes—am not certain which commenced the fire. I did not give the word to fire, but think likely my men fired first, and finding the fire returned, and not expecting friends from that quarter, I stopped the firing as soon as I could, and directed one company to guard the rear and one company to go out in the field on the right and find out where the enemy (as I supposed them to be) were situated. Then sent a squad down the road and found to my horror that there had been a sad mistake, having fired upon General Pierce and staff and Colonel Townsend’s regiment. Our advance then returned to my assistance. Lieutenant-Colonel Kapff, on my right, then reported that he had taken two prisoners (citizens) with double barreled shot-guns in their hands. One of the pieces had one barrel discharged. The prisoners were sent to Fort Monroe. My men took one gold and one silver watch, with pocket-book, containing some silver and paper money, from them, which I have, subject to orders.
I was then ordered to bring up the rear of the column, and proceed to Big Bethel. We had marched some six or seven miles, when I was ordered to the front with the field piece, and before we had got ready for action the enemy opened their fire upon us, striking one man down by my side at the first shot. Not expecting this, it caused some confusion, and having received no orders, I did the best I could as skirmishers in the woods. I then looked for General Pierce, and by his direction took my position on the enemy’s left flank with some two hundred Vermont and Massachusetts troops, and we were not strong enough to make an attack, and after firing some time, withdrew back into the woods. When we got into the woods I found the troops retiring, and followed. I then saw General Pierce, who told me to retire, which I did in the main column until we came to the cross-roads, when our detachment came to Newport News.*

Report of Capt. Judson Kilpatrick, Fifth New, York Infantry.
Headquarters Camp Hamilton, June 11,1861.
Sir : In accordance with your order, I have the honor to submit the following report of my command, acting as the advance guard on the evening of the 9th, and a brief account of my command during the engagement on the following day at the new County Bridge. I left camp with my command at 10 p. m., consisting of fifty men of Company H, one lieutenant (Cambreleng), four sergeants, and four corporals; Company I, Captain Bartlett, one lieutenant (York), four sergeants, and two corporals. Crossed the river at Hampton half past 10 p. m., reached New Market Bridge at 1 a. m., threw out scouts in all directions, and waited for the main body, which arrived at 3 a. m.
According to your orders I advanced on the road to new County Bridge, the point where the enemy was reported to have made a stand. A little before daylight, when within a mile and a quarter of the bridge, we discovered the outlying picket guard of the enemy, and were challenged, u Who comes there ? ” I replied, u Who stands there ? ” A horseman attempted to leave. Corporal Ellerson, of Company H, sprang in advance, directing him to halt. I, supposing the enemy to be in force, gave the command to fire and charge. In a moment the affair was over; twenty or thirty shots had been given and exchanged; the officer of the guard was captured and disarmed. At this time, hearing firing in the rear, and supposing that our rear guard was attacked, I returned to follow the main body, under Colonel Duryea,who was advancing by forced march in the direction of the firing, only to discover that by mistake our own forces, coming in different directions, and supposing each to be the enemy, had fired several shots before the mistake was discovered. I again advanced, and at 8 a. m. met with and drove in the picket guards of the enemy. I then detached a portion of my command, made an armed reconnaissance, and found the enemy with about from three thousand to five thousand men posted in a strong position on the opposite side of the bridge, three earthworks and a masked battery on the right and left, in advance of the stream thirty pieces of artillery and a large force of cavalry, all of which information I reported to you at once.
I was ordered to advance and engage the enemy in throwing out skirmishers on the right and left of the road leading to the bridge. We rapidly advanced, supported by the advance guard of Colonel Duryea and three pieces of artillery, under Lieutenant Greble, of the Second Regiment U. S. Artillery. The enemy soon opened fire on us from the rifle cannon in front. We answered his discharges by a cheer and continued to advance, clearing all before us, till we reached a point just on the edge of the woods, where the fire was so hot and heavy that we were compelled to halt, and there we remained, as directed by Lieutenant-Colonel Warren, till that gallant officer had made dispositions to turn their flanks. The enemy’s fire at this time began to tell upon us with great effect. My men were falling one after another, as was the case with the rest of the command.
After remaining in this position about two hours, and our object having been accomplished—numbers of our men being killed and wounded, having received a grape through my thigh, which tore off a portion of the rectangle on Colonel Duryea’s left shoulder, passed through my leg, and killed a soldier in my rear—I withdrew my men to the skirts of the

wood. We managed to reach Lieutenant Greble’s battery, and bring to his aid several of my men. The charge was then sounded. Lieutenant Greble opened fire with grape and canister within two [hundred] yards of the enemy’s lines. Captains Winslow, Bartlett, and myself charged with our commands in front, Captain Denike and Lieutenant Duryea (son of Colonel Duryea), and about two hundred of the Troy Rifles upon the right, Colonel Townsend with his men to the left. The enemy were forced out of the first battery, all the forces were rapidly advancing, and everything promised a speedy victory, when we were ordered to fall back. Where this order came from I do not know. We maintained our position till Colonel Townsend began to retire with his whole command. Being left there alone, and no prospect of receiving aid, we ordered the men to fall back, which they did, and in good order, forming their line of battle about one hundred and fifty yards in the rear. A few minutes afterwards orders came from General Pierce to cease firing and retire.
It gives me great pleasure to mention the gallant conduct of Captain Bartlett, who came up with the reserve, re-enforcing my line, and was ever at the point of danger encouraging his men. Lieutenant York, in command of my left, and Lieutenant Cambreleng, in command of my right, displayed the greatest bravery. Lieutenant York’s sword was broken by a grape shot, and he was slightly wounded in the leg. I shall ever be grateful to Captain Winslow, who rescued me after our forces had left. He came to my aid, assisted by Sergeants Onderdonk and Agnus, at the last moment, but in time to rescue me from the enemy*
I would also favorably mention Private Wood, who brought me valuable information, and who fired the first shot 5 Private John Dunn, whose arm was shattered by a cannon ball, and who bore himself with the greatest bravery, and who said to Surgeon Gilbert, while amputating his arm, that he could not have lost it in a nobler cause. The whole command, men and officers, did themselves the greatest credit, and I am satisfied can conquer anything except impossibilities.
Respectfully submitted.

Sir : I have the honor to inform you that we were attacked by about 3,500 troops of the Federal Army, with several pieces of heavy artillery, firing grape shot, this morning at 10 o’clock, and at 12£ routed them completely, with considerable loss on their side. The prisoners report their force to be 5,000. It was certainly 3,500. Ours about 1,200 engaged ; 1,400 in all.
Mr. George A. Magruder, jr., a volunteer aide, who is as conspicuous for his gallantry as for his efficiency, will deliver this in person.
Thirty-five hundred men are on my right flank; 10,000 on my left. Please send re-enforcements immediately. Yorktown and Williamsburg, in my rear, have troops quite insufficient in numbers to defend them.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGBUDEB, Colonel, Commanding Hampton Division.

Headquarters Camp Bethel,
Bethel Church, June 10,1861.
Sir: The enemy, thirty-five hundred strong, attacked us at our post, and after a very animated conflict of two hours and a half was repulsed at all points and totally routed. Four companies of cavalry are now in hot pursuit toward Newport News. I cannot speak too highly of the devotion of our troops, all of whom did their duty nobly, and whilst it might appear invidious to speak particularly of any regiment or corps where all behaved so well, I am compelled to express my great appreciation of the skill and gallantry of Major Bandolph and his howitzer batteries, and Colonel Hill, the officers and men of the North Carolina regiment. As an instance of the latter I will merely mention that a gun under the gallant Captain Brown, of the howitzer battery, having been rendered unfit for service by the breaking of a priming wire in the vent, and not being defended by infantry from the small number we had at our command, Captain Brown threw it over a precipice, and the work was occupied for a moment by the enemy. Captain Bridgers, of the North Carolina regiment, in the most gallant manner retook it and held it until Captain Brown had replaced and put in position another piece, and then defended it with his infantry in the most gallant manner. Colonel Hill’s judicious and determined action was worthy of his ancient glory, and Colonel Stuart, Major Montague, Major Cary, Captains Walker and Atkinson, with every officer and every man under their command, did good service in the front of the fight.
The able and efficient manner in which Captains Douthatt, Phillips, and Jones, of the cavalry, performed the duties of infantry, and Lieutenant Chisman, of the Wythe Bifles, in protecting the rear of the position, is deserving of high commendation.
There were many acts of personal gallantry, some under my own observation, and others which were reported to me, that I will take occasion to mention in a subsequent communication. At'present I expect another attack, and have no $ime.

I am extremely indebted to the two brothers Robert H. and William R. Vaughan, my acting commissary and quartermaster, for the most gallant and efficient services, no less than to my youthful aides, Mr. George A. Magruder, jr., and Hugh Stannard, who were always in the front of the fight, and upon whom I request the Government to bestow commissions, as they are desirous of entering the regular service.
In the hurry of this communication I may have omitted to mention many gallant men.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Number of killed and wounded on our side—one killed and seven wounded. Enemy—ten dead bodies found, as reported to me, and perhaps fifty wounded. Three prisoners. ‘Our force, all told, about one thousand two hundred men. Enemy—three thousand five hundred, with 18 and 24 pounder guns, besides light guns.

Headquarters Yorktown, June 12,1861.
Sir : I had the honor to transmit by Mr. Hugh Stannard a short account of a battle with the enemy at Bethel Bridge, on the 10th. This was written on the field, and I had not then had time to ascertain the number of killed and wounded on the other side. I think I reported ten killed and many wounded. 1 have now to report that eighteen dead were found on the field, and I learn from reliable citizens living on the road that many dead as well as a great many wounded were carried in wagons to Hampton. I think I can safely report their loss at from twenty-five to thirty killed and one hundred and fifty wounded. I understand the enemy acknowledge one hundred and seventy-five killed and wounded. It is a source of great gratification to me to be able to say that our own loss as far as heard from was only one killed and seven wounded, but too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the heroic soldier whom we lost. He was one of four who volunteered to set fire to a house in our front which was thought to afford protection to our enemy, and advancing alone between the two fires he fell midway, pierced in the forehead by a musket ball. Henry L. Wyatt is the name of this brave soldier and devoted patriot. He was a member of the brave and gallant North Carolina regiment.
I omitted to mention in my hurried dispatch of the 10th the name of
Captain Jones, of----Cavalry, who rendered important service before
and during the battle. I regret to say that one of his vedettes was cut off by the enemy, and is presumed to have been taken prisoner.
I cannot omit to again bring to the notice of* the general command-ing-in-chief the valuable services and gallant conduct of the First North Carolina Regiment, and Major Randolph, of the howitzer batteries. These officers were not only prompt and daring in the execution of their duties, but most industrious and energetic in the preparations for the conflict. The firing of the howitzer batteries was as perfect as the bearing of the men, which was entirely what it ought to have been. Captain Bridgers, of the North Carolina regiment, retook in the most daring manner, and at a critical period of the fight, the work from which Captain Brown, of the artillery, had withdrawn a disabled gun to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy, and which work had been sub-

sequently occupied by the enemy. This work was soon again occupied with another piece by Captain Brown, who resumed an effective fire. Captain Bridgers deserves the highest praise for this timely act of gallantry.
The Louisiana regiment arrived after the battle was over, having made a most extraordinary march. They returned to Yorktown the same night, making a distance of twenty-eight miles. It was not thought prudent to leave Yorktown exposed any longer. I therefore occupied the ground with cavalry, and marched the remainder of my forces to Yorktown. We took several prisoners, among them some wounded.
Our means of transportation were exceedingly limited, but the wounded enemy were carried with our own wounded to farm houses in our rear, where the good people, who have lost almost everything by this war, and who could see the smoking ruins of their neighbors7 houses, destroyed by the enemy both in his advance and retreat, received them most kindly and bound up their wounds. I also ordered the humane Captain Brown to bury as many of the enemy7s dead as could be found near our camp, which was done.
The cavalry pursued the enemy for five miles; but were stopped by the bridge across Back River at New Market, which was destroyed by the flying enemy after crossing it.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Col. D. H. Sill, First North Carolina Infantry.
Sib : I have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders from the colonel commanding, I marched on the 6th instant, with my regiment . and four pieces of Major Randolph’s battery, from Yorktown, on the Hampton road, to Bethel Church, nine miles from Hampton. We reached there after dark on a wet night, and slept without tents. Early on the morning of the 7th I made a reconnaissance of the ground, preparatory to fortifying. % I found a branch of Back River on our front, and encircling our right flank. On our left was a dense and almost impassable wood, except about one hundred and fifty yards of old field. The breadth of the road, a thick wood, and narrow cultivated field covered our rear. The nature of the ground determined me to make an inclosed work, and I had the invaluable aid of Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, of my regiment, in its plan and construction. Our position had the inherent defect of being commanded by an immense field immediately in front of it, upon which the masses of the enemy might be readily deployed. Presuming that an attempt would be made to carry the bridge across the stream, a battery was made for its especial protection, and Major Randolph placed his guns so as to sweep all the approaches to it. The occupation of two commanding eminences beyond the creek and on our right would have greatly strengthened our position, but our force was too weak to admit of flie occupation of more than one of them. A battery was laid out on it for one of Randolph’s howitzers. We had only twenty-five spades, six axes, and three picks, but these were busily plied all day and night of the 7th and all day on the 8th. On the afternoon of the 8th I learned that a marauding party of the enemy was within a few miles of us. I called for a party of thirty-four men to drive them back. Lieutenant Roberts,

of Company F, of my regiment, promptly responded, and in five minutes liis command was en route. I detached Major Randolph with one howitzer to join them, and Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, First Regiment North Carolina Volunteers, requested and was granted permission to take command of the whole. After a march of five miles they came across the marauders busy over the spoils of a plundered house. A shell soon put the plunderers to flight, and they were chased over New Market Bridge, where our little force was halted, in consequence of the presence of a considerable body situated on the other side. Lieutenant-Colonel Lee brought in one prisoner. How many of the enemy were killed and wounded is not known. None of our command was hurt. Soon after Lieutenant-Colonel Lee left a citizen came dashing in with the information that seventy-five marauders were on the Back River road. I called for Captain McDowell’s company (E), of the First Regiment of North Carolina Volunteers, and in three minutes it was in hot pursuit. Lieutenant West, of the Howitzer Battalion, with one piece, was detached to join them, and Major Lane, of my regiment, volunteered to assume command of the whole. After a weary march they encountered, dispersed, and chased the wretches over the New Market Bridge—this being the second race on the same day over the New Market course, in both of which the Yankees reached the goal first. Major Lane brought in one prisoner. Reliable citizens reported that two cart loads and one buggy load of wounded were taken into Hampton. We had not a single man killed or wounded. Colonel Magruder came up that evening and assumed command.
On Sunday, the 9th, a fresh supply of tools enabled us to put more men to work, and, when not engaged in religious duties, the men worked vigorously on the .intrenchments. We were aroused at 3 o’clock on Monday morning for a general advance upon the enemy, and marched three and a half miles, when we learned that the foe, in large force, was within a few hundred yards of us. We fell back hastily upon our intrenchments, and awaited the arrival of our invaders. Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, of the Third Virginia Regiment, having come with some one hundred and eighty men, was stationed on the hill on the extreme right, beyond the creek, and Company G, of my regiment, was also thrown over the stream to protect the howitzer under Captain Brown. Captain Bridgers, of Company A, First North Carolina Regiment, took post in the dense woods beyond and to the left of the road. Major Montague, with three companies of his battalion, was ordered up from the rear, and took post on our right, beginning at the church and extending along the entire front on that side. This fine body of men and the gallant command of Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart worked with great rapidity, and in an hour had constructed temporary shelters against the enemy’s fire. Just at 9 o’clock a. m. the heavy columns of the enemy were seen approaching rapidly and in good order, but when Randolph opened upon them at 9.15 their organization was completely broken up. The enemy promptly replied with his artillery, firing briskly but wildly. He made an attempt at deployment on our right of the road, under cover of some houses and a paling. He was, however, promptly driven back by our artillery, a Virginia company—the Life Guards—and Companies B and G of my regiment. The enemy attempted no deployment within musketry range during the day, except under cover of woods, fences, or paling. Under cover of the trees he moved a strong column to an old ford, some three-quarters of a mile below, where I had placed a picket of some forty men. Colonel Magruder sent Captain Werth’s eonqjany, of Montague’s command, with one howitzer, under Sergeant

Crane, to drive back this column, which was done by a single shot from the howitzer. Before this a priming wire had been broken in the vent of the howitzer commanded by Captain Brown, and rendered it useless.
A force estimated at one thousand five hundred was now attempting to outflank us and get in the rear of Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart’s small command. He was accordingly directed to fall back, and the whole of our advanced troops were withdrawn. At this critical moment I directed Lieutenant-Colonel Lee to call Captain Bridgers out of the swamp, and ordered him to reoccupy the nearest advanced work, and I ordered Captain Boss, Company C, First Begiment North Carolina Volunteers, to the support of Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart. These two captains, with their companies, crossed over to Bandolph’s battery, under a most heavy fire, in a most gallant manner. As Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart had withdrawn, Captain Boss was detained at the church, near Bandolph’s battery. Captain Bridgers, however, crossed over and drove the zouaves out of the advanced howitzer battery, and reoccupied it. It is impossible to overestimate this service. It decided the action in our favor.
In obedience to orders from Colonel Magruder, Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart marched back, and, in spite of the presence of a foe ten times his . superior in number, resumed, in the most heroic manner possession of his intrenchments. A fresh howitzer was carried across and placed in the battery, and Captain Avery, of Company G, was directed to defend it at all hazards.
We were now as secure as at the beginning of the fight, and as yet had no man killed. The enemy, finding himself foiled on our right flank, next made his final demonstration on our left. A strong column, supposed to consist of volunteers from different regiments, and under command of Captain Winthrop, aide-de-camp to General Butler, crossed over the creek and appeared at the angle on our left. Those in advance had put on our distinctive badge of a white band around the cap, and they cried out repeatedly, “ Don’t fire.” This ruse was practiced to enable the whole column to get over the creek and form in good order; They now began to cheer most lustily, thinking that our work was open at the gorge, and that they could get in by a sudden rush. Companies B and C, however, dispelled the illusion by a cool, deliberate, and well-directed fire. Colonel Magruder sent over portions of Companies G, C, and H of my regiment to our support, and now began as cool firing on our side as was ever witnessed.
The three field officers of the regiment were present, and but few shots were fired without their permission, the men repeatedly saying, “May I fire?” “I think I can bring him.” They were all in high glee, and seemed to enjoy it as much as boys do rabbit-shooting. Captain Winthrop, while most gallantly urging on his men, was shot through the heart, when all rushed back with the utmost precipitation. So far as my observation extended he was the only one of the enemy who exhibited even an approximation to courage during the whole day.
The fight at the angle lasted but twenty minutes. It completely discouraged the enemy, and he made no further effort at assault. The house in front, which had served as a hiding place for the enemy, was now fired by a shell from a howitzer, and the outhouses and palings were soon in a blaze. As all shelter was now taken from him, the enemy called in his troops, and started back for Hampton. As he had left sharpshooters behind him in the woods on our left, the dragoons could not advance until Captain Hoke, of Company K, First North Carolina Volunteers, had thoroughly explored them. As soon as he gave the assurance oi

the road being clear, Captain Douthatt, with some one hundred dragoons, in compliance with Colonel MagrudePs orders, pursued. The enemy in his haste threw away hundreds of canteens, haversacks, overcoats, &c.; even the dead were thrown out of the wagons. The pursuit soon became a chase, and for the third time the enemy won the race over the New Market course. The bridge was torn up behind him and our dragoons returned to camp. There were not quite eight hundred of my regiment engaged in the fight, and not one-half of these drew trigger during the day. All remained manfully at the posts assigned them, and not a man in the regiment behaved badly. The companies not engaged were as much exposed and rendered equal service with those participating in the fight. They deserve equally the thanks of the country. In fact, it is the most trying ordeal to which soldiers can be subjected, to receive a fire which their orders forbid them to return. Had a single company left its post our works would have been exposed; and the constancy and discipline of the unengaged companies cannot be too highly commended. A detachment of fifteen cadets from the North Carolina Military Institute defended the howitzer under Lieutenant Hudnall, and acted with great coolness and determination.
I cannot speak in too high terms of my two field officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Lee and Major Lane. Their services have been of the highest importance since taking the field to the present moment. My thanks, too, are due, in an especial manner, to Lieut. J. M. Poteat, adjutant, and Lieut. J. W. Eatchford, aide, both of them cadets of the North Carolina Institute at Charlotte. The latter received a contusion in the forehead from a grape shot, which nearly cost him his life. Captain Bridgers’ company, A ; Lieutenant Owens, commanding Company B ; Captain Eoss, Company C ; Captain Ashe, Company D ; Captain McDowell, Company E ; Captain Starr, Company F; Captain Avery, Company G; Captain Huske, Company H ; Lieutenant Whittaker, commanding Company I; Captain Hoke, Company K, displayed great coolness, judgment, and efficiency. Lieutenant Gregory is highly spoken of by Major Lane for soldierly bearing on the 8th. Lieutenants Cook and McKethan, Company H, crossed over under a heavy fire to the assistance of the troops attacked on the left. So did Lieutenant Cohen, Company C. Lieutenant Hoke has shown great zeal, energy, and judgment as an engineer officer on various occasions.
Corporal George Williams, Privates Henry L. Wyatt, Thomas Fallan, and John Thorpe, Company A, volunteered to burn the house which concealed the enemy. They behaved with great gallantry. Wyatt was killed and the other three were recalled.
Sergeant Thomas J. Stewart and Private William McDowell, Company A, reconnoitered the position of the enemy, and went far in advance of our troops. Private J. W. Potts, of Company B, is specially mentioned by his company commander 5 so are Sergeant William Elmo, Company C ; Sergeants C. L. Watts, W. H. McDade, Company D ; Sergeant J. M.

I cannot close this too elaborate report without speaking in the highest terms of admiration of the Howitzer Battery and its most accomplished commander, Major Randolph. He has no superior as an artillerist in any country, and his men displayed the utmost skill and coolness. The left howitzer, under Lieutenant Hudnall, being nearest my works, came under my special notice. Their names are as follows:
Lieutenant Hudnall, commanding (wounded), Sergeant S: B. Hughes, G. H. Pendleton, R. P. Pleasants, William M. Caldwell, George W. Hobson, William McCarthy, H. C. Shook (wounded), L. W. Timberlake, George P. Hughes, John Worth (wounded), D. B. Clark.
Permit me, in conclusion, to pay a well deserved compliment to the First Regiment North Carolina Volunteers. Their patience under trial, perseverance under toil, and courage under fire have seldom been surpassed by veteran troops. Often working night and day—sometimes without tents and cooking utensils—a murmur has never escaped them to my knowledge. They have done a large portion of the work on the intrenchments at Yorktown, as well as those at Bethel. Had all of the regiments in the field worked with the same spirit, there would not be an assailable point in Virginia. After the battle they shook hands affectionately with the spades, calling them “ clever fellows and good friends.” The men are influenced by high moral and religious sentiments, and their conduct has furnished another example of the great truth that he who fears God will ever do his duty to his country.
The Confederates had in all about one thousand two hundred men in the action. The enemy had the regiments of Colonel Duryea (zouaves), Colonel Carr, Colonel Allen, Colonel Bendix, and Colonel Wardrop (Massachusetts), from Old Point Comfort, and five companies of Phelps’ regiment, from Newport News. We had never more than three hundred ‘ actively engaged at any one time. The Confederate loss was eleven wounded; of these, one mortally. The enemy must have lost some three hundred. I could not, without great disparagement of their courage, place their loss at a lower figure. It is inconceivable that five thousand men should make so precipitate a retreat without having sustained at least this much of a reverse.
Let us devoutly thank the living God for His wonderful interposition in our favor, and evince our gratitude by the exemplariness of our lives.
With great respect,

Sir : I have the honor to report that I took the position assigned me in the engagement of the 10th to the right and in front of the line of battle, and completed the slight breastwork erected to protect the command, consisting of three companies of my detachment, commanded by Captains Walker, Childrey, and Charters, numbering, rank and file, two hundred and eight men. The enemy deployed as skirmishers in the orchard, immediately in front and to our left, protected on the left by 7 R R---------YOL II

several frame buildings and sheds. Those in front were dispersed by a lire from the first platoon of Captain Walker’s company, but we were annoyed by the fire from behind the buildings and the battery in the road to our left, but under cover of the breastworks the men remained unhurt. After the dispersion of the skirmishers a column of about fifteen hundred appeared in the road immediately in our Iront, extending from the left to right, with a battery of artillery in front, and advancing a line of skirmishers down the ravine on my right, protected from both view and fire, which fact was reported to me by scouts sent out for the purpose of observing their movements. The battery in front commenced advancing on the left of the ravine and immediately in our front. The battery supporting us on the left had been silenced and withdrawn some time before this. These facts being communicated to you, in obedience to your orders I retired in order through the swamp to the second position assigned me on the hill on the left of the church. Here one of my companies was detached and sent to the support of Captain Werth ; another, under Captain Walker, was sent to Presson’s, near the Warwick and York Bridge.
About this time Captain Atkinson’s company had arrived on the field, and with this and a detachment of the Wythe Rifles I recrossed the swamp, advanced, and regained my former position. I was supported at this time by a portion of Company G, of North Carolina Rifles, and with their aid again drove oft* some skirmishers advancing through the orchard. The firing, however, after I regained my position, was irregular on the part of the enemy, and I only permitted some few shots to be fired at a prominent position of their column and stragglers skulking behind the fences, owing to the enemy being much beyond rifle range.
Both officers and men under my command behaved with, the greatest coolness throughout the whole engagement, and none were injured.

Report of Mag. George W. Randolph, commanding Howitzer Battalion.
Yorktown, June 12, 1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to report that in the action of the 10th instant the Howitzer Battalion, under my command, fired eighteen solid shot and eighty shells, spherical case and canister, and was injured in the following particulars: A lieutenant and two privates were wounded, one severely and two slightly ; five horses and three mules were killed or disabled ; the Parrott gun (iron rifled) had its linstock splintered, and a musket ball passed through the felloe of the left wheel; a musket ball pierced the corner plate and a partition of the limber chest of one of the howitzers and lodged against a shell; two poles of caissons, one set of swinglebars, one large pointing ring, a chain for a rammer, and several priming wires were broken, and one of the howitzers was spiked by the breaking of a priming wire in its vent. I have already made a requisition for ammunition enough to fill all the chests of the battalion, and will submit, as soon as practicable, requisitions for whatever else may be required.

﻿Chap. IX.]	ENGAGEMENT AT BIG BETHEL, YA.	99
As the position of the pieces was under your own observation, it is only necessary to state that the Parrott gun and one howitzer were posted in the battery immediately on the right of the road leading to Hampton; that a howitzer was placed in the battery erected on the right beyond the ravine, through which a passway was made for the purpose of withdrawing the piece if necessary; a howitzer was posted near the bridge$ the rifled howitzer was placed on the left of the^ road behind the right of a redoubt erected by the North Carolina regiment, and a howitzer was posted in the rear of the road leading from the Half-way House, a howitzer having been previously sent to the Half-way House under the command of Lieutenant Moseley.
Early in the action the howitzer in the battery on the right, having been spiked by the breaking of the priming wire, was withdrawn from its position, and the infantry supporting it fell back upon the church; but it was subsequently replaced by the howitzer of Lieutenant Moseley, which arrived at a later period of the action.
The ford on the left being threatened, the howitzer at the bridge was withdrawn and sent to that point, and the rifled howitzer was withdrawn from the left of the road and sent to assist in the protection of the rear. The same disposition was subsequently made of the howitzer at the main battery, situated immediately on the right of the road.
The enemy came in sight on the road leading from Hampton a few minutes before 9 o’clock a. in., and their advance guard halted at a house on the roadside about six hundred yards in front of our main battery. Eire, however, was not opened upon them for ten or fifteen minutes, when from the number of bayonets visible in the road we judged that a heavy column was within range. The action then commenced by a shot from the Parrott gun, aimed by myself, which struck the center of the road a short distance in front of their column, and probably did good execution in its ricochet. At no time could we see the bodies of the men in the column, and our fire was directed by their bayonets, their position being obscured by the shade of the woods on their right and two small houses on their left, and somewhat in advance of them. Our fire was immediately returned by a battery near the head of their column, but concealed by the woods and the houses so effectually, that we only ascertained its position by the flash of the pieces. The fire was maintained on our side for some time by the five pieces posted in front of our position) but, as already stated, one of them being spiked and another withdrawn to protect the ford early in the action, the fire was continued with three pieces, and at no time did we afterwards have more than three pieces playing upon the enemy. The fire on our part was deliberate, and was suspended whenever masses of the enemy were not within range, and the execution was good, as I afterward ascertained by a personal inspection of the principal position of the enemy. The cannonade lasted with intervals of suspension from a few minutes before 9 o’clock a. m. until 1J o’clock p. m., and the fact that during this time but ninety-eight shot were fired by us tends to show that the firing was not too rapid. The earthworks thrown up by .the battalion were struck several times by the cannon-shot of the enemy, but no injury was sustained. They fired upon us with shot, shell, spherical case, canister, and grape from 6 and 12-pounders, at a distance of about six hundred yards, but the only injury received from their artillery was the loss of one mule.
We found in front of our main battery, in and near the yard of the small house already mentioned, five killed and one mortally wounded by the fire of our artillery. We heard of two others killed at Cram-dall’s, about a mile from us, and have reason to believe there were many

﻿100	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. LChap. IX.
others. The injury done to our artillery was from the fire of musketry on our left flank, the ground on that side between us and the enemy sinking down so as to expose us over the top of the breastwork erected by the North Carolina regiment.
After some intermission of the assault in front, a heavy column, apparently a re-enforcement or reserve, made its appearance on the Hampton road and pressed forward towards the bridge, carrying the U. S. flag near the head of the column. As the road had been clear for some time, and our flanks and rear had been threatened, the howitzer in the main battery had been sent to the rear, and our fire did not at first check them, I hurried a howitzer forward from the rear, loaded it with canister, and prepared to sweep the approach to the bridge, but the fire of the Parrott gun again drove them back. The howitzer brought from the Half-way House by Lieutenant Moseley arriving most opportunely, I carried it to the battery on the right to replace the disabled piece. On getting there I learned from tlie infantry that a small house in front was occupied by sharpshooters, and saw the body of a Carolinian lying thirty yards in front of the battery, who had been killed in a most gallant attempt to burn the house.
I opened upon the house with shell for the purpose of burning it, and the battery of the enemy in the Hampton road, being on the line with it, and supposing probably that the fire was at them, immediately returned it with solid shot. This disclosed their position and enabled me to fire at the house and at their battery at the same time. After an exchange of five or six shots a shell entered a window of the house, increased the fire already kindled until it soon broke out into a light blaze, and, as I have reason to believe, disabled one of the enemy’s pieces. This was the iast shot fired. They soon afterwards retreated, and we saw no more of them.
The action disclosed some serious defects in our ammunition and equipment, for which I earnestly recommend an immediate remedy. The shell of the Parrott gun have a fixed wooden fuse which cannot be extricated, the shortest being cut for four seconds. The consequence was that the shells burst far in the rear of the enemy and served merely as solid shot. Had they been plugged and uncut fuses furnished, I think that our fire would have been much more effective. The power and precision of the piece, demonstrated by the thirty rounds fired from it, render it very desirable that all of its advantages should be made available. I therefore respectfully suggest that the shell be hereafter furnished plugged and the fuses left uncut.
It is reported to me that the Borman fuses used by one of the howitzers were defective, the shells cut for five seconds exploding as soon as those cut for two.
The caissons of the Navy howitzers were made by placing ammunition chests upon the running gear of common wagons, and the play of the front axles is so limited that the caisson cannot be turned in the ordinary roads of this part of the country, and wherever the road is ditched or the woods impassable it cannot be reversed. There is also great danger of breaking the poles in turning the caissons quickly, as was shown in the action of the 10th instant. I am aware that the expedient of using wagon bodies was resorted to in order to save time, but as it might lead to great disaster, I recommend that their places be supplied as speedily as possible with those made in the usual way.
The small size of the limber of the howitzers (Navy) renders it impossible to mount the men, and the pieces cannot move faster than the cannoneers can walk. In a recent skirmish with the enemy, in which we

pursued them rapidly, we could only carry two men, and having got far ahead of the others, we had to unlimber and fire with only two cannoneers at the piece. The piece having only two horses, and the carriage being very light, it is hazardous to mount any person on the limber. I therefore recommend that four horses be furnished to each Navy howitzer, one for the chief and the other three for the men usually mounted on the limber.
We have succeeded since the action in unspiking the howitzer disabled by the breaking of the priming wire, but from the inferior metal used in making our priming wires we shall have to lay them aside altogether, and I must request that better ones be furnished. At present I can say nothing more of the conduct of the officers and men of the battalion than to express the high gratification afforded me by their courage, coolness, and precision, and to ask permission at a future time to call your attention to individual instances of gallantry and good conduct. I have requested the commandants of companies to furnish me with the names of such non-commissioned officers and privates as they think especially worthy of notice.
I am happy at having an opportunity to render my acknowledgments to Colonel Hill, the commandant of the North Carolina regiment, for the useful suggestions which his experience as an artillery officer enabled him to make to me during the action, and to bear testimony to the gallantry and discipline of that portion of his command with which I was associated. The untiring industry of his regiment in intrenching our position enabled us to defeat the enemy with a nominal loss on our side.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Report of Maj. E. B. Montague, commanding Virginia Battalion.
On the morning of the 10th of June my command reported to Colonel Magruder at Bethel Church, according to orders. At---in the morn-
ing information was received that the enemy in force were advancing upon us. Colonel Magruder immediately ordered me to throw up a redoubt fronting toward a ravine, over which it was supposed the enemy might attempt to turn our right flank. My men worked well, and had nearly finished the redoubt when the first gun from our batteries was fired, which took place at — o’clock a. m. The enemy returned the fire with spirit, and the shell and shot flew thick and fast about my command, who were in a peculiarly exposed condition, my redoubt flanking towards and being nearly perpendicular to the points of attack. Fortunately for my command, however, the major part of the enemy’s shot had sufficient elevation to pass over our heads, though many shell and solid shot fell within a few feet of our redoubt. One ball passed under my horse between his fore and hind feet, several others passed within a few feet of his head, and a few buried themselves in our breastwork. Had the enemy’s guns been slightly depressed he must have raked my whole line with his enfilading fire. A very short time after the firing commenced I received an order to direct one of my companies, the Chatham Grays, under the command of Captain Wertii, to defend a ford one

mile below the bridge against the first battalion of the New York Zouave Regiment, and I saw no more of the company until after the fight.
About — minutes after the fight, and after Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart had been conceited to fall back across the ravine and occupy my redoubt, Colonel Magruder ordered me to take my command about one and a quarter miles around to aid the Wythe Rifles, under the command of Lieutenant Chisman, in guarding a marsh, where he thought the enemy were attempting to turn our left flank. I immediately carried my command around to the point indicated at the double quick, joined the rifles, and deployed my whole command as skirmishers over a line of a quarter of a mile under cover of a dense foliage. We remained in this position until late in the evening, when we were ordered back by Colonel Magruder to the church. The enemy did not attempt to cross our line, and we remained quiet and inactive during the remainder of the fight.
We had no killed or wounded. Every man in my whole command, both officers and men, was perfectly cool, calm, and collected during the whole time which we were exposed to the enfilading fire from the enemy’s battery and to diagonal fire of musketry from his left flank. I have no hesitancy in expressing my gratification at the manner in which my command, the Halifax Light Infantry, Captain Grammer; the Chatham Grays, Captain Werth; and the Old Dominion Rifles, Captain Dicker-son, as well as the detachment of the North Carolina regiment, under my command, conducted themselves during the whole engagement.
Respectfully reported.

Headquarters, YorTctown, June 12,1861.
Sir : I beg leave very respectfully to make the following report of my scout:
On Sunday afternoon, the 9th of June, 1861,1 procured the corn and oats on the Back River road as ordered, and had the wagons returning to camp in two hours and a quarter from the receipt of the order. I was then joined by one company of North Carolina Infantry, one piece of the howitzer battery, and a detachment of Captain Douthatt’s cavalry, as I supposed, to assist me in making observations near Hampton, on the Back River. I approached New Market Bridge at 5 o’clock p. m., planted the howitzer so as to sweep the bridge, deployed my infantry in open order on my right flank in ambush, so that they could rake the road. The cavalry I posted in the rear, and threw out vedettes on each of my flanks to avoid a surprise.
In this position I waited for the appearance of the enemy. I of course had no idea of endangering my command by engaging the enemy if in force. I was too weak. In a few moments alarm guns were fired by a chain of sentinels extending from New Market Bridge to Fort Monroe. In a few moments a force advanced from Hampton (supposed to be a battalion of infantry, but marching in detached companies), whilst at

the same time one or more companies approached by the road leading from Newport News. These forces were each advancing upon New Market Bridge from opposite directions, thinking I had crossed the bridge with my command. Upon observing their approach with a glass, I quietly retired from my position to a point in the rear three-quarters of a mile. The enemy approached the bridge, and when they suddenly came in sight of each other they (each mistaking the other for me) opened fire, and kept it up for some five minutes before they discovered their error. I was sitting on my horse near the bridge, and saw the firing plainly with my glass, but did not at the time know the cause, although I suspected it. At dusk I took up the march for Bethel Church, the enemy following me, and the next morning the fight opened.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Camp Yorktown, June 13, 1861.
I beg leave to make the following report of the movement of the troops under my command at the battle of Bethel Church on the 10th instant:
By the order of E. B. Montague, major of the Yirginia battalion at Bethel, my company, the Chatham Grays, was placed in the redoubt to the rear of the church, to defend the right wing in case of a discomfiture. From this point I was detailed, by your orders, to take position at the ford on the creek, about one mile below the bridge. I crossed my command over the open field under a shower of shell and canister, which the enemy poured into us from their battery, but sustained no damage.
A portion of the Fifth New York Zouave Eegiment (three companies) was at this time advancing down the opposite bank of the stream for th,e purpose of crossing the ford, and thereby turn our left flank. I saw the movement, and at once took double quick and made the distance of over a mile in about nine minutes, beating the zouaves, and getting in position at the ford in time to cause them to halt. I obstructed the ford in all conceivable ways by felling trees, &c., and then placed my first platoon on the northwest side, under cover of an old mill-dam, whilst my second platoon I placed in ambush on the opposite side, where the road leading to the ford could have been raked for four hundred yards with deadly effect.
At 10.10 o’clock one naval howitzer, with a detachment from the Howitzer Battalion, reported to me for duty. I at once placed the gun in position one hundred and twenty yards up the creek from my infantry, where I had a beautiful range for grape or canister on a spot in the road on the opposite side of the stream over which the enemy would of necessity pass in attempting the passage of the ford. From this point I had the pleasure of getting one good shot at the enemy, which, from the sudden rout of the party at which it was aimed, must have done much damage. I also threw down all the fences on either side of the creek, and cleared all the undergrowth and large timber, so that after the enemy had passed the range of the howitzer from its first

position I could limber up and in two minutes have it in position to deliver its fire between my two platoons and immediately upon the ford.
At 10 to 11 a. m. the Southern Guard, Captain-----, reported to
me for duty. I at once joined this command with my company, all entirely concealed from the enemy. At a little past 11 o’clock, so completely ambuscaded was my entire force, one of the enemy sent down to examine the ford came up to within twenty yards of my position, and did not suspect the presence of any force until I ordered him to ground arms, which he instantly did, and I had the pleasure of taking him prisoner. He had a fine minie musket, accouterments, and forty-five rounds of cartridges. I placed him under guard, and afterwards forwarded him to headquarters. All the men under my command displayed a wonderful degree of coolness for troops who had never been under fire, and I am assured, if we had been so fortunate as to have been attacked by a force five times our strength, that the command would have made a desperate resistance.
At sundown I was ordered to withdraw.
This special report is rendered necessary by my being detached from Maj or Montague’s battalion.

Headquarters Rockville Expedition,
Tennallytown, June 11, 1861.
Captain : I have the honor to report my arrival at this place with Captain Owen’s company of volunteer cavalry, and the Second, Third, Fifth, and Eighth Battalions District of Columbia Volunteers. We got into camp here yesterday at 11 o’clock a. m., with the exception of the Third Battalion, which was a little later, owing to the double duty of its commandA, who performs the duties of A. Q. M. and A. C. S. to the expedition, as well as those of commander of battalion. The section of Griffin’s battery and Captain Magruder’s cavalry arrived at Rockville about 11 o’clock a. m. yesterday, and at the same hour two canal-boats at the Chain Bridge, where they await a battalion for the expedition along the canal. I propose to detach for the latter service Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, with the Fifth Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, and have encamped him conveniently for the purpose.
The movement will be made as soon as the regiments at Rockville are sufficiently refreshed to move rapidly in the direction of Edwards Ferry.
The people in this immediate region are for the Government almost to a man. Those at Rockville are reported to me as being about one-half rabid secessionists, calling themselves u States-rights ” men.
Couriers are said to have been started immediately on the arrival of the first troops at Rockville, to give notice to the enemy at Harper’s Ferry of our advance. Exaggerated reports of our numbep have gone forward. No difficulty has been experienced in obtaining forage so far, and the A. C. S. will be able to purchase plenty of fresh beef. The small rations and bread for the command will have to come from Washington or Georgetown.

Yesterday afternoon at 4.10 o’clock Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, moving along the canal in boats with his battalion, occupied the aqueduct at Seneca Creek, placed guards, and established patrols. At 4 p. m. Major Jewell, with

his battalion, moving by the river road, occupied Seneca Mills, one-half mile north of Lieutenant-Colonel Everett. At the same time Colonel Stiles, moving with his regiment along the upper road, occupied the village of Darnestown, three miles from Jewell. There was but ten k minutes7 time difference in the occupation of the points designated, the i ■ three corps moving on different lines—one a distance of twenty-five v - miles} another twenty-two miles; the third nine miles5 an exactitude unusual in volunteer troops. The arrival of the troops here was most opportune. The loyal citizens were under most uncomfortable pressure, and doubtless would have had difficulty in casting unbiased votes at the election to-day. The conduct of the men in Eockville has been admirable. Not a complaint has been made to me of depredation on private property, and the soldiers are most kindly received and are very popular with the people.
Yesterday I sent forward Lieutenant Piper, of the artillery, to recon-noiter beyond our positions. He reports the roads good; beef and forage plenty. He reports also that the enemy crossed the river in small force yesterday morning near Edwards Ferry, and attempted to break the canal, but the lock-keeper drew off the water at that point, which satisfied them, and at the same time makes the destruction of the embankments more difficult. Sufficient water can at any time be let in to float out canal-boats in case of our desiring it. We ha^e now secured the canal to within six miles of Edwards Ferry, thus securing water transportation that far at least.
The impression has been produced (by my making reconnaissance and minute inquiries) that I move immediately on Frederick.
The troops of the expedition are now posted as follows: The Eighth Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, Captain Gerhard* at Ten-nallytown, keeping open communication at Washington and the rear of the three lines of advance. The Fifth Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, at the aqueduct, on canal, seven or eight miles from Edwards Ferry, one company of eighty-five of this battalion having been left at Great Falls to watch the ferries. The Second Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, Major Jewell, at Seneca Mills, three hundred and three strong, one-half mile north of Lieutenant-Colonel Everett. The Ninth Regiment New York troops at Darnestown, three miles north of Major Jewell, a good road connecting the last three-named positions. The First Pennsylvania and First New Hampshire Regiments, Third Battalion (Smead’s) District of Columbia Volunteers, are encamped here. The section of Griffin’s battery and the cavalry are encamped one mile from this, in the direction of Darnestown.
A fine spirit seems to be general in the command, and it is well supplied with everything, except medical attendance in the District of Columbia Volunteers. Only one assistant surgeon is present with all the battalions, and he comes simply as a volunteer. No provision has been made for them, although I have long since and repeatedly made the proper representations on the subject. I fear there will be suffering from this deficiency whenever the battalions are separated from the regiments, and in case of action there would be unnecessary loss of life. At present the health of the whole command is good.

Colonel: The First Regiment Pennsylvania was pushed forward early this morning two miles beyond the position of the New York Ninth Regiment, on the road to the two ferries. The section of Griffin’s battery has gone to the same point. The First New Hampshire will leave this evening, bivouac nine miles from this, and, in the cool of the morning, proceed to Poolesville. I leave within the hour, taking the cavalry force to make a reconnaissance beyond Poolesville, towards the ferries, where there are said to be 300 to 400 of the enemy. I do not credit the report, but, if true, it will not be difficult to capture them.
From Poolesville it will be easy to march either on the ferries or to the Point of Rocks, as may be deemed most advisable.
The command is in good health and fine spirits.

Colonel: I have the honor to report that the troops of the expedition have to-night occupied Edwards Ferry and Conrad’s Ferry, the two approaches to Leesburg. The former is held by a portion of the Pennsylvania regiment, a piece of artillery under Lieutenant Hasbrouck, and twenty cavalry. The latter is held by a portion of the First New Hampshire Regiment.
It is believed here that Harper’s Ferry has been evacuated, and that the garrison has retired, by way of Winchester, towards Manassas Junction. I shall send scouts out to-morrow. Ascertain, if practicable, the truth or falsity of the story.
Lieutenant-Colonel Everett reports that he thinks the enemy are erecting works nearly opposite his position, on the canal, at the mouth of the Seneca Creek. The enemy at Leesburg were frightened, it is said, on Thursday evening, and burned the Goose Creek Bridge (railroad), tore up track, burned cars, &c. They have not, however, yet evacuated the place. The command is well and doing well.

Colonel : 1 reported last night the occupation of the two nearpst ferries across the Potomac. One hour after that report was written there was a very large fire some miles to the westward of our position here, on the Yirginia side. Those who know the country well state that it must have been the destruction of the turnpike bridge over Goose Creek.
The enemy occupy with small (visible) force the Yirginia landing of Edwards Ferry, and it is my impression that they have four pieces of

artillery on the south side of Goose Creek, about two hundred yards south of the ferry landing.
If I become satisfied that Harper’s Ferry has been evacuated, and that a general retreat has been made, via Winchester, I shall cross the river by the upper ferry and ford, capture the force, whatever it may be, at the lower ferry, occupy Leesburg, and open means of communication, as rapidly as possible, with General Patterson on the one hand and General McDowell on the other, taking especial care to restore, as rapidly as practicable, the transportation routes on both sides of the river down. The canal on this side will require but -a handful of men, and should General Patterson be in possession of Harper’s Ferry, the whole canal from that point to Washington can be put in working order in one day.
I am just sending out an officer to inspect the canal above, and I think that water can be thrown into it a few miles north of this, which would relieve all this part of the State from the great inconvenience which now exists in getting supplies to and from Washington or other markets. Great convenience would also result to the Government in forwarding supplies along the river. Should such work interfere with the main objects of the expedition, it will not, of course, be attempted.

Colonel : The enemy have appeared opposite the two ferries in force, probably part of the late Harper’s Ferry force, and dispute our passage towards Leesburg. They are throwing up a battery on the road between Edwards Ferry and Leesburg. Lieutenant Abert is reconnoitering along the river above their upper position. Captain Magruder is doing the same up the Monocacy road. My weakness for attack is want of artillery. Had I a full battery the approaches might be guarded by part to advantage, while another portion could be used in turning them. My impression is that these are Harper’s Ferry troops, but that their main body has taken the road to Manassas Junction.

Colonel : I have the honor to report that the enemy opened fire on the guard at Conrad’s Ferry (five miles above Edwards Ferry) this morning about 10 o’clock. The point was and is occupied on our side by five companies of the Kew Hampshire First Infantry. The enemy were reported to have three cannon, but in a careful examination I was unable to discover more than one 6-pounder field piece. They amused themselves by firing some twenty shots, apparently at the staff on which the Kew Hampshire troops had raised the national colors. Ko damage whatever was done to our men by the firing, and it appeared so object-

less, that I conjectured it must have been intended to cover an advance at some other point. I therefore made dispositions for watching the fords above and below, and threw out scouting parties to intercept any possible movement from the mouth of the Monocacy Eiver.
It is very necessary to hold these ferries and protect the canal, for the enemy seem disposed to destroy everything they do not control, and the canal is absolutely necessary to the well-being of this neighborhood—one of the best small-grain districts in the State. It is now suffering for want of means of transportation, and the appearance of troops here has had an excellent effect.
I shall for the present hold the main body of troops here, keeping a strong guard at each of the ferries and pickets up and down the river at the fords. I have this evening strengthened the posts at Seneca Mills and the aqueduct by two companies of the Ninth New York, and have moved the remainder of that regiment to a point near Dawson-ville, to watch the roads leading toward Washington from the upper fords and ferries near the Point of Eocks.
It seems to be universally conceded here by the people along the river that Harper’s Ferry has been abandoned, but it appears to me strange that no communication has come from General Patterson, who, if at Harper’s Ferry, could communicate with me in four hours. I do not feel at liberty to detach a force so directly off* my necessary line of operations.
From the above rough sketch [diagram on the original copy] you will perceive that I cannot with safety trust my command immediately at the ferries, without exposing the route to Washington to any force which might have crossed above, near the Monocacy, and at the same time getting my troops into a horseshoe, with the rear exposed to the same force and a river in front. As at present arranged, they can all maintain their positions until relieved, and if attacked by an over: whelming force, all can withdraw towards Georgetown through defiles easily defended.
On the other hand, if all, or nearly all, the forces lately at Harper’s Ferry have retired toward Manassas, so that there remain none in sufficient numbers to make a demonstration by this route toward Washington, we are in a position here to be assembled and thrown into Leesburg at any moment.
I feel greatly the want of artillery, and should be glad if more pieces could be spared to me.

My Dear General : Your two notes of yesterday were both received by me this afternoon at Conrad’s Ferry, where I had gone to make an examination of the position of the enemy, who opened fire on our guards there this morning with one or more 6 pounder guns. The force on the opposite side of the river does not appear to be large, probably in the immediate vicinity of the Ferry not more than 800 men; I could not see 100. We have there five companies of the New Hampshire regiment, with pickets thrown out above and below the Ferry to watch the fords. I could see no other object for the firing

than an attempt to amuse us, to allow a large force to cross somewhere above and attack our flank and rear, for the purpose of cutting us off from Washington and marching in that direction. My dispositions were made accordingly.
The New York Ninth was ordered to the entrance of the Darnestown road, the Pennsylvania regiment and half of the New Hampshire, with one piece of artillery, disposed here for approach of the enemy from the north, and I strengthened Conrad’s Ferry only by twenty marksmen from the Pennsylvania First Eegiment. The New Hampshire troops have the old musket, which has not power enough to do mischief across the river. A chance ball from one of the Pennsylvania muskets is said to have disabled a man at the enemy’s gun this morning.
While writing this I hear the firing recommenced by the enemy.
I have no reliable news from General Patterson’s command. Eurnor here says Harper’s Ferry is occupied by U. S. troops.
Two companies are detached from the Ninth Eegiment to strengthen the force on the river near the mouth of the Seneca, where Colonel Everett and Major Jewell are stationed.
As your messengers do not seem to understand the roads near this point, and have letters from you to deliver at Seneca Falls, I send this to Captain Mead, at Eockville, with orders to send it forward immediately. I write also to Colonel Townsend by same route. All your kind hints will be carefully remembered.

General: Your letter of this date has just been handed me.* As 1 have conflicting reports about the strength of the enemy now firing on the front of my position, and no positive assurance that there is not a force above, I do not feel authorized to weaken the force here by a withdrawal of a regiment, as I might thereby expose Washington to an attack from this direction, and at the same time put my command in a desperate condition.
I hope to have reliable information by morning, and, if favorable, will send down the nearest regiment—the Ninth New York or the First Pennsylvania.

estimated by the officer in command of the guard there at from 800 to 1)00 men. They made use of the ferry-boat, which they had withdrawn from the Potomac. I had given orders that on any attempt to move the boat fire should be opened on it, and in-compliance with these orders Lieutenant Hasbrouck fired from his 12-pounder field howitzer a spherical case shot, which burst directly in range, and covered the boat with a shower of bullets and fragments. The effect was excellent. The horse of a mounted officer leaped overboard, and the boat was rapidly drawn back to the shore. The enemy then formed line along the crest of the bank and commenced firing, but a few well-directed spherical case shot dispersed them, and sent them flying towards Leesburg. I deemed it important to prevent communication along the river between these forces and those opposite Lieutenant-Colonel Everett’s position.
To-night I shall order up Captain Smead’s battalion to within supporting distance of both Colonel Everett and Colonel Stiles, and to-mor row morning shall be able to open communication with General Patterson by a trusty hired messenger.
I respectfully request that orders may issue to the proper departments to send to-morrow by canal, in boats of light draught, 18,000 complete rations, excepting the meat ration, of which only 9,000 will be necessary; also, 15,000 ball cartridges, elongated bullet, cal. .58; 15,000 ditto, elongated bullet, cal. .69, and 15,000 ditto, round ball, cal. .69, all consigned to Capt. John R. Smead, acting assistant quartermaster of this expedition. These stores can come by canal as far as the aqueduct, occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, and can be thence transported in wagons.
In addition to the before-mentioned ordnance stores, I request that there may be forwarded 140 6-pounder spherical case shot, fixed, and 144 12-pounder spherical case shot, fixed.
I can now at any time, with very small loss, occupy Leesburg, but can see no advantage which would justify even the small loss which would be sustained, and the slight risk to my line which would necessarily result.

Colone l : I have the honor to report that a gentleman has just arrived in my camp from Martinsburg, Berkeley County, Virginia, where he was a major of militia. He fled from Martinsburg on the 9th instant, because three companies of Confederate troops arrived there for the purpose of impressing into service all the militia. These three companies were commanded by Captain Letcher, he believes a brother of the governor. This gentleman concealed himself, and escaped with some two hundred others, and made their way through the mountains, away from the roads, out of the State. He states that two regiments have been impressed in Berkeley County, most of them strong Union men, who are determined to shoot their officers and go over to the Government troops the first opportunity; that these men carry, many of them, little United States flags concealed about their persons, and intend to

stick them in their musket boxes and join the United States forces whenever they can; that some of the impressed men are so obstinate that arms were not given to them, but they were carried away and made to do police duty in the camps. The troops at II aider’s Ferry were badly fed and badly clothed$ had very poor shoes, and few of them.
There is nothing new to be communicated from this command.

Colonel : I sent a trusty messenger up the river yesterday as far as opposite Harper’s Ferry. He reports that there were no troops of the United States at or near that place. Harper’s Ferry was completely deserted, except by a few poor families.
An action between our forces and those of the enemy at Martinsburg was vaguely reported as a complete defeat of the enemy.
I find it necessary to occupy the ferry and fords at Monocacy, and for this purpose order up the Ninth New York this evening. I go myself in a few minutes to take possession, hoping to capture the ferry boat, which the enemy were trying to raise last night. More artillery is needed, and I hope may be furnished me.
It is difficult to restrain the New Hampshire troops from crossing the river, but the officers seem disposed to do their duty in carrying out orders.
The people in the neighborhood seem to gain confidence in the Government day by day, and the troops, especially the Pennsylvania First, are very popular with them. I find that the women and children had been taught by the Virginians and active secessionists here to expect every species of outrage and horror on the arrival of the United States troops. The reaction is very strong, and the troops are now looked to for protection.
I am informed that repairs will be immediately commenced on the canal, and that the line will be in order in nine or ten days’ time. It will require careful guarding at present.

sent back to Washington, and having permitted the battalion evidently to become demoralized, I have issued an order directing its return to Washington, where I recommend that it be mustered out of service.
If practicable, a small regiment should be ordered to the post (Seneca Mills) lately occupied by that battalion.
I yesterday reconnoitered the river up to Poland’s Ferry, and found no signs of the enemy. I passed within three miles of the Point of Eocks.

Poolesville, June 22, 1861.
Colonel : I had the honor to report yesterday some dissatisfaction in the Second Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, in my zeal, and that I had ordered that corps to Washington. Later in the day such urgent appeals were made to me by all the officers of the battalion, that I consented to suspend the order directing its return, and it will hold the same position as before—Seneca Mills. I consider that part of the line of the Potomac so important, that I recommend its being strengthened by a small regiment or a strong battalion, which I cannot spare from this region.
The Ninth New York now occupies the mouth of the Monocacy and the line of the river Potomac as far as Noland’s Ferry.
The wheat crops of this region are now within a few days of harvest, and are very abundant. Loudoun County, Virginia, is exceedingly productive, and next week will commence one of the richest harvests ever made there. I deem it very important that that county should be occupied, so as to save the crops of the many loyal citizens there, and prevent the enemy seizing them and gaining advantage of the supplies.
I was this morning applied to for security for a crop immediately opposite, belonging to a Union man, but do not feel at liberty to cross until some communication comes from General Patterson, showing his dispositions and those of the enemy. I have sent messengers as far as eight miles above the Point of Eocks, but they were unable to learn anything concerning the position of troops of either force.
I respectfully renew my application for more held pieces or mountain howitzers; and if a small portion of the force now with General Patterson can be caused to join me Loudoun County can be secured and the enemy made very uneasy on his left flank while he faces General McDowell.

As stated in my letter of yesterday, I deem it important that Londonn County should be occupied immediately; but much, very much, has been already lost by a failure of some troops to occupy Harper’s Ferry and Point of Eocks.
My pickets extend to within three miles of the Point of Eocks, but with my present force I cannot advance them a mile with safety, and can only justify my present position by constant activity aM watchfulness, and by keeping these troops under my command worked as constantly as troops can bear.
Half a regiment at Point of Eocks, and the same force at a point opposite Harper’s Ferry (if it be not deemed advisable by the general in command at Williamsport to occupy the Ferry itself), would relieve me from great anxiety, and would have saved much uncertainty among the citizens of Virginia and Maryland.
When I pushed forward my posts to Monocacy and Noland’s Ferry I supposed that United States troops in some force had certainly occupied the abandoned important points within twenty-five miles of them. We cannot control the Potomac without holding all the points I do, and not with safety and certainty without occupying those of Harper’s Ferry or Knoxville and Point of Eocks.
The inclosed appeal of a Virginian I believe to be genuine, and I have no doubt many have been forced into the ranks of the enemy since my arrival here.
Yesterday the opposing pickets at Conrad’s Ferry met in the middle of the river, shook hands, and drank each other’s health. The Virginia picket men said they did not wish to fight, but u wanted to go home.”
With a little more force, and a slight co-operation on the part of General Cadwalader or General Patterson, I could move forward with safety and success. I cannot do so, however, until Harper’s Ferry is occupied by somebody and its position understood.
The health of the command remains excellent and the spirits good. An order to cross the river would be received with enthusiasm.

Poolesville, June 24,1861—8 p. m.
Colonel: I left camp at midnight last night on a reconnaissance up the river Potomac, accompanied by Capt. Wm. S. Abert, A. A. A. G., and Captain Stewart, A. D. C., with an escort of a dozen cavalry, having communicated all my plans of operations up to that time to Col. F. E. Patterson, First Pennsylvania Eegiment, and leaving him in command ; passed the extreme pickets of my command at 3 a. m. to-day, and arrived about daybreak at the village—Point of Eocks, Md.
As you are already aware, the bridge across the Potomac has been burned by the enemy. I found that the enemy had a picket of five men watching at the Virginia end of the burned bridge. At Point of Eocks I learned that there were no troops on this side of the river above, and dispatched Captain Abert, with two men on a hand-car, to a point opposite Harper’s Ferry. Captain Abert returned at 1.45 p. in., and reported that he had visited Sandy Hook, opposite Harper’s Ferry, where he was

received by the inhabitants with the greatest enthusiasm, and questioned with much earnestness and anxiety as to when they would be relieved from their present painful position by the presence of United States troops. He made a careful personal examination of the ground in the neighborhood, which he found had been occupied in the most absurd manner by the enemy during their recent presence there. He met Captain Newton, Engineer Corps, reconnoitering the position, and gave him, for the information of General Patterson, an account of the numbers and positions of the troops composing this expedition. Captain Abert learned from good authority that General Johnston was this morning at Winchester with about 10,000 to 12,000 troops, and that he had broken up his camp, and was preparing for a hasty march to-day in some direction, supposed to be Cumberland.
I had an interview at Point of Rocks with a man just from Leesburg, who informed me that he saw about 950 South Carolina troops arrive at Leesburg last night. This would make the force there about 1,600, with supporting troops nine miles off.
The enemy destroyed to-dav a large number of locomotives belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, together with a train of cars, said to be more than half a mile long. General Johnston might reach Leesburg by to-morrow afternoon, and either attempt the passage of the river or move towards Arlington. Should he come to Leesburg, my impression is that it will be with a view to make a demonstration on General McDowell’s right. In my opinion the Point of Rocks and Sandy Hook should be immediately occupied; the first, because it is now used as a crossing place to and from Virginia ; the second, because of the justly-founded alarm pervading the community, and the right of those loyal citizens who have faithfully stood by the flag under circumstances of difficulty and danger to protection at the first moment possible.
Had I one regiment more, and more artillery, I should occupy Sandy Hook to-morrow, and should I find that the enemy neglect my positions, I shall certainly occupy the Point of Rocks, for the purposes above indicated, and also for securing my right flank.

Colonel : From informers, and what can be seen from our positions, I feel assured that there has been a considerable increase of force in Leesburg and its vicinity. Yesterday morning General Johnston was at Winchester, as reported by me last night, and some of his forces may be those which have been seen this morning opposite us. I believe some have passed south of Goose Creek in the direction of Arlington, but there were undoubtedly nearly one thousand South Carolina troops opposite us yesterday.
The destruction of locomotives and railroad cars noticed in my letter of last night took place at Martinsburg. The number of locomotives is said to be thirty-five, and the line of cars was said to be more than half a mile long.
An eye-witness reported General Johnston’s force at Winchester to

have been yesterday morning at least ten thousand, and this informer said that he saw all baggage packed and the force ready to move at a moment’s notice.
I am not in a position to relieve the loyal people up the Potomac, but am impressed with the absolute necessity of relief being promptly afforded.
I respectfully request again, with the risk of being deemed importunate, an additional force of artillery of some class be sent me, and that the cavalry force may be increased by the remainder of Company H, Second Cavalry, now in Washington, if it can be possibly afforded. I am much cramped for pickets of mounted men and escorts for recon-n offering purposes.
The health of the command continues good.

Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of copy of letter to General Patterson of 25th instant. Nothing of importance has occurred since my last report. The Virginia guards at the ferries seem to have been replaced by South Carolina troops, who recommenced the unsoldierlike practice of firing at pickets across the river. The fire was carefully returned, and nothing of the kind has taken place for twenty-four hours past.
Colonel Patterson reports that the South Carolina troops, who passed Goose Creek the day before yesterday, are said to have encamped about two to two and one-half miles south of that creek, a mile or two back irom the Potomac. I respectfully repeat my application for more cavalry for reconnoitering purposes, and additional field pieces. This command can properly man four more pieces if they can be furnished, as on£ of the companies of the Pennsylvania regiment has been well drilled at a battery in Philadelphia (Cadwalader’s old battery), and I have with me three officers of the regular artillery. Guns in position would enable me to dispose of a more considerable portion of the infantry force for the watching of the fords, always numerous, and daily becoming more so as the dry weather continues. The health of the command remains excellent, the sick report not averaging three per centum of the force.
Considering the circumstances of the District of Columbia Volunteers, I respectfully recommend that said infantry force be replaced by a regiment of State troops, and if an additional regiment can be spared, it would greatly facilitate my operations.

Camp near Poolesville, June 28,1861.
Colonel : The following reports of the force and position of the enemy opposite my positions are from negro scouts, and from appearances are nearly accurate. There is a gradual strengthening of force near Edwards Ferry—two regiments (not Virginians) at Leesburg, about 1,200; 400 having been detached from the 1,600 previously reported as a guard at Conrad’s Ferry.
Four pieces of artillery are to-day reported opposite Edwards. One thousand additional troops were to arrive at Leesburg overnight.
Considering the ease with which their forces can be suddenly increased from the direction of Winchester, and the extended line of posts which I am obliged to occupy, I deem it only prudent that this command should be re-enforced, so that I may be enabled to complete my line of posts to above the Point of Eocks, and have a disposable force to move to any position which may be attacked, and be able to take advantage of any indiscretion on the part of the enemy. I deem it highly important to occupy the Point of Eocks, and guard the ferries and fords there, and a little above and below. Communication is constantly going on there, and the enemy can at any time cross and destroy the canal and railway track.
No communication has yet come to me from Major-General Patterson or any of his command. The only intercourse between us has been the meeting of our reconnoitering parties opposite Harper’s Ferry. I do not dare to weaken my force by further detachments, and there seems to be great delay in occupying the space between us by General Patterson.
All letters which pass from Maryland into Virginia now go between the Point of Eocks and Harper’s Ferry, a communication which could be entirely cut off by one regiment, which would at the same time give great impetus to the Union feeling in Frederick County, Maryland, and Loudoun and Berkeley, Virginia.
The disposition shown by the enemy to burn and destroy private property makes me solicitous about that strong Union district. Hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of property could be destroyed in a few hours there by a small force, the telegraph wires cut, and the canal made useless to us for months.

I yesterday reported an increase of the enemy’s force opposite my position, and am very desirous of showing them a strong front, and at the same time to occupy more ground on my right.
At present, with Harper’s Ferry unoccupied, the disaffected in Maryland have tree communication with Virginia across the Potomac above the Point of Eocks, and information and supplies go daily to the enemy.

The railroad and canal are not safe for a single night, and yet I cannot with anything like prudence detach a force fpr guarding the line unless strengthened for the purpose.
I suppose Major-General Patterson must have weighty reasons for leaving the point opposite Harper’s Ferry without guard, for I feel that each night risks an immense amount of private property and wearies the loyal people, while it encourages the sympathizers of the enemy.
With two regiments more I can occupy the entire line from Georgetown to Harper’s Ferry, and with three more do not only that, but operate between General Johnston and General McDowell.

Colonel: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Special Orders, No. 109, which came to hand this morning.
The advance towards General Patterson’s supposed position will commence this afternoon. I propose to occupy Point of Rocks to-night with six companies of the Ninth Regiment New York, to send forward the First Pennsylvania to-night as far as the Monocacy, which will enable the last-named regiment to join the Ninth New York fresh tomorrow forenoon. The rear will be covered by the First New Hampshire Regiment, which will, until the last moment possible, guard the fords and ferries near this place. To-morrow evening I shall hope to occupy the Maryland Heights, opposite Harper’s Ferry, with the First Pennsylvania and six companies of the Ninth New York, having four companies of the Ninth New York at Point of Rocks, and the New Hampshire First and battalion of Pennsylvania Twenty-fifth at the Monocacy.
It will be with serious misgivings that I leave this horseshoe of the river unguarded, for I shall expect to learn that the enemy have crossed immediately on my leaving, and doubtless the canal will be destroyed, as well as large amounts of grain of the old and new crop. To guard as far as possible against such a result, I shall post 100 of the returning District of Columbia Volunteers at Edwards Ferry, with two days’ rations, and shall send their baggage to the canal at Seneca, giving them orders to hold the ferry while their supplies last, and then fall back on the river road, or the tow-path, to their baggage, with which they will return by canal to Washington. The force at Seneca, being composed entirely of District of Columbia Volunteers, will hold their position until the arrival of the former, and return to Washington with them.
I regret greatly the necessity which exists for leaving this village and vicinity without troops, as I have said before, and hope that these troops may be replaced before any evil results. The position and crops deserve occupation, if it be in any way practicable.
The time required to retire the volunteers carefully will give opportunity to send other troops, if it be deemed advisable.

Colonel : The six companies of the Ninth New York advanced yesterday afternoon to Point of Bocks; First Pennsylvania Artillery (Colonel Patterson) started for Licksville, but the heavy rain which came on rendered the roads impassable, and he was obliged to halt this side the Monocacy. The battalion Twenty-fifth Pennsylvania Begiment arrived last night. The provision train with much difficulty reached here from Seneca this morning.
Captain Magruder has started on his march to Washington with Company H, Second Cavalry. The President’s Mounted Guard is at Edwards Ferry, and will march for Washington, via Seneca, to-morrow morning, with the Third Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers. Piper’s section of artillery will await the assembling of the District of Columbia Volunteer battalions at Seneca, and then proceed to Washington, accompanied by the President’s Mounted Guard.

Colonel : Yesterday afternoon, while I was engaged in bringing up more troops from the Point of Bocks, Harper’s Ferry was suddenly occupied by a few of the enemy, who opened fire on our pickets. The latter were re-enforced by a company of the Kinth Kew York Begiment, and firing was kept up for about half an hour, resulting in a slight loss on both sides ; on ours one private killed and three wounded. As far as now known the loss of the enemy was two killed and two severely wounded, but there are reports that his loss was greater. The enemy retired to the rear of the town.

Very respectfully, I am, colonel, your most obedient servant,

JUNE 13, 1861.—Descent of Union Troops on Romney, W. Va.
Report of Col. Lew. Wallace, Eleventh Indiana Infantry.
Headquarters Eleventh Regiment Indiana,
Camp McGinnis, June 14,1861.
Dear Sir : Having been notified that several hundred rebel troops were quartered at Romney, Hampshire County, Virginia, drilling there, impressing Union men, and in other ways oppressing loyal citizens, I determined to disperse them, if possible. For that purpose I left Cumberland at 10 o’clock on the night of the 12th instant, with eight companies, in all about five hundred men, and by railway went to Kew Creek Station, twenty-one miles distant.
A little after 4 o’clock I started my men across the mountains, twenty-three miles off, intending to reach the town by 6 o’clock in the morniug. The road was very fatiguing and rough, leading along high bluffs and narrow passes, which required great caution in passing; so much so, indeed, that with the utmost industry I did not get near Romney until about 8 o’clock. In a pass a mile and a half this side the town my advance guard was fired upon by a mounted picket of the enemy, who dashed ahead and alarmed the rebels. In fact, I afterwards learned that they had notice of my coming full an hour before my arrival.
In approaching the place it was necessary for me to cross a bridge over the South Branch of the Potomac. A reconnaissance satisfied me that the passage of the bridge would be the chief obstacle in my way, although I could distinctly see the enemy drawn up on the bluff, which is the town site, supporting a battery of two guns, xilanted so as to sweep the road completely. I directed my advance guard to cross the bridge on the run, leap down an embankment at the farther entrance, and observe the windows of a large brick house not farther off than seventy-five yards. Their appearance was the signal for an assault. A warm fire opened from the house, which the guard returned, with no other loss than the wounding of a sergeant. The firing continued several minutes. I led a second company across the bridge, and by following up a ravine got them into a position that soon drove the enemy from the house and into a mountain to its rear.
My attention was then turned to the battery on the hill. Instead of following the road, as the rebels expected, I pushed five companies in skirmishing order, and at double-quick time, up a hill to the right, intending to get around the left flank of the enemy, and cut off their retreat. Hardly had my companies deployed and started forward, and got within rifle range, before the rebels limbered up and put off over

the bluff in hottest haste. Between their position and that of my men was a deep, precipitous gorge, the crossing of which occupied about ten minutes. When the opposite ridge was gained we discovered the rebels indiscriminately blent, with a mass of women and children, flying as for life from the town. Having no horse, pursuit of the cannoneers was impossible. They went off under whip and spur. After that I quietly marched into the place, and took possession of the empty houses and a legion of negroes, who alone seemed unscared by our presence. After searching the towTn for arms, camp equipage, &c., I returned to Cumberland by the same road, reaching camp at 11 o7clock at night. My return was forced, owing to the fact that there was not a mile on the road that did not offer half a dozen positions for the ruin or rout of my regiment by a much smaller force.
The loss of the rebels we have not been able to accurately ascertain. A citizen of Bomney admitted two killed. My own surgeon dressed the wound of one man. A number of tents were taken. Quite a number of rifles were destroyed, and, among others, I have a Maj. Isaac Yan-dever prisoner, a gentleman who, from accounts, has been very active in exciting rebellion, organizing troops, and impressing loyal citizens. I have also an excellent assortment of surgical stores, which, with the tents, I have taken the liberty to convert.
My regiment behaved admirably, attacking coolly and in excellent order. Where all behaved gallantly, I cannot single out officers for praise. Sufficient to say they conducted themselves like veterans, and in such a manner as to entitle them to your confidence in any field.
I I beg to call your attention to the length of our march—eighty-seven jmiles in all, forty-six of which was on foot, over a continuous succession lof mountains, made in twenty-four hours, without rest, and varied by a brisk engagement—made, too, without leaving a man behind, and, what is more, my men are ready to repeat it to-morrow.
I have already received your approval of my enterprise, for which I am very much obliged. One good result has come of it: the loyal men in that region have taken heart. Yery shortly I think you will hear of another Union company from that district. Moreover, it has brought home to the insolent “chivalry” a wholesome respect for Northern prowess.
Yery truly, sir, your obedient servant,

﻿Chap. IX.]	ACTION NEAR VIENNA, VA.	125
The point to which it was intended the regiment should go by train, and establish itself for the twenty-four hours, had been occupied, for the day before, by the Sixty-ninth New York Regiment, under Colonel Hunter, commanding the brigade. The latter regiment had been sent there, on the return of General Tyler from his reconnaissance up the road, as an advance guard and a protection to the road, which had been repaired in anticipation of the demonstration I was to make on the notification of the General-in-Chief in favor of the. attack on Harper’s Ferry. It is said the attack on the Ohio regiment was made by the South Carolinians. If so, they must have been moved forward from Centreville, where they have been stationed for some time past. This would seem to indicate that the reports of an advance of troops to their posts in front of this position are well founded. I have asked if it would accord with the plans of the General-in-Chief that a movement be made in force in the direction of Vienna, near which the attack was made. I learn from a reliable source that the force at Fairfax Court-House has been increased. Had the attack not been made, I would not suggest this advance at this time; but now that it has, I think it would not be well for us to seem even to withdraw. General Schenck applies for permission to send a flag of truce to Vienna to bury his dead and care for his wounded. I do not think this necessary for either purpose, but think the morale of the troops would be increased if they went over the ground again with arms in their hands. The distance by turnpike from Falls Church to Vienna is about six miles.
General Tyler, who is in advance, sends me word that he sees the country as far as Falls Church. No signs of any movement. He wants no more troops than he has, unless it is intended to hold permanently the position he occupies.

Reports of Brig. Gen. Robert C. SchencTc, [7. $. Army.
Left camp with 668 rank and file, 29 field and company officers, in pursuance of General McDowelPs orders, to go upon this expedition with the available force of one of my regiments, the regiment selected being the First Ohio Volunteers. Left two companies—Company I and Company K, aggregate 135 men—at the crossing of the roads. Sent Lieutenant-Colonel Parrott, with two companies, 117 men, to Falls Church, and to patrol roads in that direction. Stationed two companies—D and F, 135 men—to guard railroad and bridge between the crossing and Vienna. Proceeded slowly to Vienna with four companies—Company E, Captain Paddock; Company C, Lieutenant Woodward, afterwards joined by Captain Pease ; Company G, Captain Bailey ; Company H, Hazlett ; total, 271 men.
On turning the curve slowly, within one-quarter of a mile of Vienna, were fired upon by raking masked batteries of, I think, three guns, with shells, round-shot, and grape, killing and wounding the men on the platform and in the cars before the train could be stopped. When the train stopped, the engineer could not, on account of damage to some part of the running machinery, draw the train out of the fire, the engine being in the rear. We left the cars, and retired to right and left of train through the woods. Finding that the enemy’s batteries were sustained by what appeared about a regiment of infantry and by cavalry, which force we have since understood to have been some fifteen hundred South Carolinians, we fell back along the railroad, throwing out skirmishers on both flanks; and this was about 7 p. m. Thus we retired slowly, bearing off our wounded, five miles, to this point, which we reached at 10 o’clock.
Casualties.—Captain Hazlett’s company, H, 2 known to be killed, 3 wounded, 5 missing 5 Captain Bailey’s company, G, 3 killed, 2 wounded, 2 missing 5 Captain Paddock’s company, E, 1 officer slightly wounded; Captain Pease’s, 2 missing.
The engineer, when the men left the cars, instead of retiring slowly, as I ordered, detached his engine with one passenger car from the rest of the disabled train and abandoned us, running to Alexandria, and we have heard nothing from him since. Thus we were deprived of a rallying point, and of all means of conveying the wounded, who had to be carried on litters and in blankets. We wait here, holding the roads for re-enforcements. The enemy did not pursue.
I have ascertained that the enemy’s force at Fairfax Court-House, four miles from Vienna, is now about four thousand.
When the batteries opened upon us, Major Hughes was at his station on the foremost platform car. Colonel McCaok was with me in one of the passenger cars. Both these officers, with others of the commissioned officers and many of the men, behaved most coolly under this galling fire, which we could not return, and from batteries which we could not flank or turn from the nature of the ground, if my force had been sufficient. The approach to Vienna is through a deep, long cut in the railway. In leaving the cars, and before they could rally, many of my men lost haversacks or blankets, but brought oft* all their muskets, except, it may be, a few that were destroyed by the enemy’s first fire or lost with the killed.

ACTION NEAR VIENNA, VA.
127
[Received at the War Department June 18,1861.]
I am enabled now to give you additional and exact details of the affair near Vienna last evening. A perfectly reliable Union man, residing in Vienna, [and who] was there during the attack, has arrived, bringing with him, in patriotic and Christian kindness, the six bodies of our killed who were left behind. I have sent them to Camp Lincoln by the train which has just left for burial. He reports also one wounded man remaining at Vienna, John Volmer, of Company G, for whom I have just sent an assistant surgeon and two men with the same gentleman who brought the killed in his wagon, carrying a flag of truce, to be displayed if necessary. When the wounded man arrives I will send him forward by a train to my camp, to be conveyed from there to Georgetown Hospital by ambulance.
The casualties, as I now am able accurately to state them, are as follows:
Dead, 8.—Captain Hazlett’s: 1st, George Morrison, of Company H, brought in to-day. 2d, David Mercer, of same company, brought off the field to this place, and died here. 3d, Daniel Sullivan, of Captain Bailey’s company, G. 4th, Joseph Smith, Company G, brought in to-day. 5th, Philip Strade, Company G. 6th, Thomas Fin ton, Company G. 7th, Eugene Burke, Company G. 8th, J. R. T. Barnes, Company G, shot in the passenger car that was carried away from us by the engineer, and died on his way to this camp.
Wounded and yet living, 4.—1st, David Gates, Company G, dangerously. 2d, B. F. Lanman, Company G, severely, but not dangerously. 3d, Henry Pigman, Company H, dangerously. (Those three were sent to the hospital this morning.) 4th, John Volmer, Company G, supposed dangerously; yet at Vienna and sent for.
Total killed and wounded, 12. None, I believe, are now missing.
From the same reliable source I ascertain that the whole force attacking us was at least 2,000, as follows: South Carolina troops, 800; these had left Fairfax Court-House on Sunday and gone over to the railway; two [hundred] came down yesterday through Hunter’s Grove. They sent, anticipating our coming to Fairfax Court-House, for 2,000 additional infantry, of whom only from 600 to 1,000 arrived before the attack. The enemy had cavalry, numbering, it is believed, not less than 200, and, in addition to these, was a body of 150 armed picked negroes, who were posted nearest us in a grain field on our left flank, but not observed by us, as they lay flat in the grain and did not fire a gun. The enemy had three pieces of artillery, concealed by the curve of the railway as we passed out of the cut, and more pieces of ordnance—six, our informant believes—arrived on the field, but not in time for action. The three pieces thus placed were tired very rapidly; must have been managed by skillful artillerists; but I cannot learn who was in command of the enemy. Our men picked up and brought away several round and grape shot, besides two or three shells, which did not explode because the Borman fuse had not been cut. This raking fire was kept up against the cars and upon us as we retired through the woods and along each side of the railway. Its deadliest effect was on Company G, on the third platform car from the front, and on Company H, on the second platform car. Company E, on the foremost car, was not touched. The first firing raked the train diagonally with round shot; the other, before the train came to a full stop, was cross-firing with canister and . shells through the hind cars. The pieces were ar a distance of about 150 yards, and no muskets or rifles were brought into action.
The rebels must have believed that our number far exceeded the'little

[Ciiap. IX.
force of 271, or else I cannot understand why they made no pursuit nor came out, as we could discover, from the rise of ground behind which they were posted with their overwhelming numbers.
The enemy’s whole tforee left Yienna last night between 10 and 12 o’clock; supposed to have gone to Fairfax Court-House. It is understood that there is a considerable force assembled at that point, but cannot ascertain how many. None of the bridges have been burned, nor the railway interfered with, between this point and Yienna since we came down the road.
I send this, as we remain at this point without other facilities for correspondence or writing except to communicate by the Army telegraph, and I trust you will accept it in place of a formal written report.
I am, just now ordered by Brigadier-General Tyler to move forward with my brigade in the direction of Falls Church, for which I am now getting in readiness. I have already spoken of the skill and coolness with which Colonel McCook and Major Hughes, with other officers, helped to conduct our retirement to this place. It was a very slow and painful march, carrying in the arms of the men and in blankets and on rude litters made by the way their wounded comrades. But I must not omit to mention others.
Adjt. J. S. Parrott, my aide, Lieutenant Raynor, and Surgeon McMal-len gave effective assistance. The company officers who were under fire generally behaved with coolness and gallantry. Captain Pease, of Company C, especially distinguished himself in protecting our rear and flanks, and I warmly recommend him to favorable consideration. The non-commissioned officers and men generally also behaved extremely well on the march, as we retired along the road. Captain Crowe, with Company D, which was among those I had left as patrol guards on the railway as we passed up, came up handsomely at double-quick step to our support, and Lieut. Col. E. A. Parrott, with his detachment of two companies, which had been thrown out to Falls Church and on the roads in that neighborhood, hearing of the attack on our advance, hastened by a cross-road to the line of the railroad to join and give us any support required.
I have, in my former dispatch, mentioned the disregard of my instructions and cowardly desertion of us by the engineer of the train. His name, I understand, is Gregg. One of the brakemen, Dormin, joined us, and carried a musket and gave good help. The enemy, I learn, burned that part of the train which was abandoned by the engineer.

Colonel : In pursuance of orders received at 1 o’clock a. m. on the 16th of June, I proceeded in the forenoon of that day to make a reconnaissance across the country towards the Potomac. Marching from this place with my regiment (about five hundred and seventy-five strong), after leaving a large camp guard and Captain Ball’s troop of horse, numbering about seventy, including a detachment from Captain Wickham’s troop, I met at the Frying-pan Church Captain Terry’s troop of horse,

﻿Chap. IX.]	ACTION NEAR VIENNA, VA.	129
about seventy strong (including a detachment of Captain Langhorne’s company), and two guns of Captain Kemper’s battery, commanded by him in person, and with thirty-four men. With this force I went on to Dranesville, learning on the way that some four hundred of the enemy came up the Alexandria and Leesburg turnpike the same day, about 1 o’clock p. m., to within a mile or two of Hunter’s Mill, and then returned.
Early in the morning of the 17th I rode with a troop of horse to the heights on this side of the Potomac, opposite to Seneca Creek, and went in person to the bank of the river to reconnoiter. I could see but few troops of the enemy, and no boats prepared for crossing the river. We marched down afterwards, under the guidance of Capt. John Powell, a high-spirited and highly intelligent and most zealous friend of our cause, to Hunter’s Mill, where, if the enemy had been engaged in repairing the railroad bridge, a plan of attack devised by Captain Powell would have offered the best chances of success. We found, however, no sign of the enemy, and only some railroad cars still smoking, which had been destroyed by our friends in the neighborhood.
We then marched to Vienna, and drew up our forces in readiness to receive the enemy if they should repeat the visit made for. the last two days. Nothing being seen of them, however, and the water-tank having been demolished to increase the obstacle already caused by the removal of the lead-pipe for conveying water, I put the command in march for Fairfax Court-House.
Toward 6 o’clock p. m., just as we were moving off, a distant railroad whistle was heard. I marched the trooj>s back, placing the two G-pounder guns on the hill commanding the bend of the railroad, immediately supported by Company B, First South Carolina Volunteers, Lieutenant McIntosh. The rest of the regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, was formed on the crest of the hill to the right of the guns. The cavalry were drawn up still farther to the right.
The train of cars came round the curve of the railroad into sight at the distance perhaps of four hundred yards. Captain Kemper and Lieutenant Stuart opened a rapid and well-aimed fire with the two guns, which would have been very destructive if the troops had not made a most rapid movement from the cars into the woods. Supposing that they might form and advance, I sent Companies A, Captain Miller, and E, Captain Gadberry, to deploy as skirmishers against them. Afterwards, finding that they were flying, I sent Captain Terry with his troop, guided by Mr. G. W. Hunter, a zealous friend of the cause, in pursuit. From the lateness of the hour, however, the nature of the ground, and the start which the enemy had, they could not be overtaken. Six of the enemy were found dead and one desperately wounded. Blood was also found in the bushes through which they had fled, but the darkness prevented any serious search. One passenger car and five platform cars were taken and burned. It seems from information which we gathered that five or six more cars belonging to the same train, and perhaps a number of cars in a second train, escaped by a precipitate retreat.
The wounded prisoner represented the number of the enemy’s force as eight hundred and fiftv men, and said that it was the Fifth [First] Begiment of Ohio Volunteers, commanded by Colonel McCook. Various arms, accouterments, and tools were taken, and one officer’s sword without a scabbard.
My orders requiring me to avoid any unnecessary engagement, and not to remain absent from my camp more than one night, I marched back to this place, where 1 arrived about 1 o’clock this morning. I 9 R R—VOL II

have every reason to be satisfied with the conduct of all onr troops. Captain Kemper’s command showed great ardor, combined with discipline. Captain Kemper’s and Lieutenant Stuart’s skill in the management of guns left. nothing to desire. Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton led the First Regiment with his usual gallantry of bearing, duly seconded by Major Smith, Lieutenant Ready (acting adjutant), and Captain McGowan, regimental quartermaster. Dr. Powell, surgeon, and Dr. Bull, assistant surgeon, had little to do, as the fire of musketry with which the enemy in scrambling out of the cars replied to our cannonade was straggling and ineffective. Major Kennedy, commissary, and Captain Tyler, volunteer on my staff, were prompt to carry orders and to give valuable counsel. The companies of Captains Miller and Gad-berry, though greatly fatigued with two days’ rough march in hot sun and dust, appeared revived at once when thrown forward as skirmishers against the enemy. The same spirit was shown by all the other companies of the regiment. Lieutenant Bragg, of Company M, proved himself ready and skillful in deranging the railroad track. Captains Terry and Ball and the cavalry which they led commanded my entire confidence by their bearing, and only needed opportunity for more effective action. We arrived here about 1 o’clock this morning.

Sir : I have the honor to report that on yesterday, at 8 p. m., in pursuance to your orders, I took two companies of the Thirteenth Virginia Volunteers, C.S. Army, commanded by Captains Crittenden and White; also two companies of Third Tennessee Volunteers, C. S. Army, commanded by Captains Liflard and Mathes, and advanced eighteen miles west to the line of the enemy, upon the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and found them posted in some strength, with two pieces of artillery, on the north bank of the Potomac, at the twenty-first bridge on said road. The enemy had no pickets posted.
At 5 a. in., after reconnoitering,! gave the order to charge the enemy, which command, I beg leave to say, wras gallantly executed and in good order, but with great enthusiasm. As we appeared in sight, at a distance of 400 yards, the enemy broke and fled in all directions, firing as they ran only a few random shots, one of which, however, I regret to say, entered the arm of Private Smith, of Captain Lillard’s company, which was in advance, wounding him slightly. The enemy did not wait to fire their artillery, which we captured, consisting of two loaded guns, both of which, however, were spiked by the enemy before they fled.
From the best information, their number was between 200 and 300. I do not know the loss of the enemy, but several were seen to fall. We did not take any prisoners, owing to the start the enemy got and to our having left in the rear all the horses belonging to my command.
I then ordered the twenty first railroad bridge to be fired, which was done, and in a few minutes only the piers remained. In further pursu* ance of your order I then retired, bringing with me the two guns.
The enemy’s flag, which I forgot to mention, was captured, and other articles of little value.

My Dear Sir: I have just received a note, by special messenger, from C. W. Montague, esq., requesting me to furnish to you an accurate account of all the doings of the enemy on the Rappahannock, on Monday evening last. I have taken much pains to gather, from persons who have visited the scene of action and conversed with those who were engaged in it, the following particulars, which you may regard as reliable: About 4 p. m. on Monday, the 24th, a war steamer (the Star of New York, of one thousand tons burden [the Monticello]), came to opposite the house of Mr. James W. Gresham, of Lancaster, situated immediately on the river, about twelve miles below Urbanna, on the Lancaster side. She dispatched to the shore three barges, one a very large one, with a swivel in the bow, and two smaller ones, all filled with armed troops. The large barge grounded on the flats. The other two came ashore with a number of armed men, variously estimated at between thirty and sixty. After reaching the shore some six or eight proceeded up to Mr. Gresham’s house. One of the party accosted Mr. Gresham, and introduced another

of the party. The first named, it seems, was the pilot, who was a captain of a wood vessel, and acquainted with Gresham. He inquired df he had any chickens or lambs for sale. Mr. Gresham replied that u He had a plenty, but not a d—d one for that party.77 He then took the pilot aside and told him they had better be getting away, as there were troops in the neighborhood, and that he did not wish his premises to be the scene of a battle, as his mother was very ill in the house. While they were talking a small company of Lancaster troops, about thirty in number, were seen coming down the road in double-quick time. The alarm was given, and the enemy fled precipitately to their boats, our men firing into them as they shoved off. In their flight they left one of the barges, the men, in great confusion, crowded into the other, and others wading out to the large barge on the flats. In their flight they left, besides the barge, two breech-loading rifles, a revolver, and several swords, with coats, hats, and shoes, thrown away in their hasty retreat. It is confidently asserted that four of the enemy were killed in the boat. Nobody hurt on our side. As soon as our men fired on the enemy the ship opened her guns on Mr. Gresham’s house. She fired fifty-three shot and shell, seventeen of which took effect, damaging the house to the amount of at least $1,000. As in all of our engagements, the preservation of life was most remarkable. One of the balls struck the bed on which Mrs. Gresham was lying ill. She was then removed to an outhouse, and a bomb-shell camb in and exploded in the room without injury to any one.
I have given you, in a very hurried manner, these particulars, which I gather from most reliable sources of information. You will unite with us in contemptuous indignation at the cowardly conduct of these dastardly scoundrels, who, refusing to meet half their number face to face, at a safe distance, in their ship, destroy the property of our citizens.
I hope to be able to visit your camp soon and renew the acquaintance I had the pleasure of having with you last winter.
Hastily and truly, yours,

Report of Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters, Brooke’s Station, Va., June 27,1861.
Sir : I have to report that a small party of the enemy landed at Mathias Point on the 25th and burned the house of Dr. Howe. The landing was effected under the guns of the enemy, and doubtless was with a view to discover whether we were erecting a battery there. If it be the wish of the commanding general that a battery should be erected to prevent the free navigation of the river, I respectfully recommend that the neighborhood of Evansport should be preferred to Mathias Point. There is very little difference in the distance of the channel from the shore, and large guns will command either. From Evansport there is a good road to Fredericksburg, which would turn this position, and a good road to Manassas, turning that position; whereas from Mathias Point it would require a long land travel to any vulnerable point. If you can send me two 32-pounders (rifled), or two 8-inch columbiads, I believe I

could stop tlie navigation of the river, if the general commanding thinks it a matter of sufficient importance to justify the expense. I could use the rifled 6-pounders that I now have in Walker’s battery to annoy the enemy’s commerce; but we have not the ammunition to spare.

Reports of Col. Lew. Wallace, Eleventh Indiana Infantry.
Grafton, YA., June 28, 1861.
The following dispatch from Colonel Wallace is so gratifying, that I send it to you entire:
Cumberland, June 27.
General McClellan: I have been accustomed to sending my mounted pickets (thirteen men in all) to different posts along the several approaches to Cumberland. Finding it next to impossible to get reliable infoAnation of the enemy yesterday, I united the thirteen, and directed them, if possible, to get to Frankfort, a town midway between this place and Romney, and see if there were rebel troops there. They went within a quarter of a mile of the place, and found it full of cavalry. Returning, they overtook forty-one horsemen, and at once charged them, routing and driving them back more than a mile, killing eight of them, and securing seventeen horses. Corporal Hayes, in command of my men, was desperately wounded with saber cuts and bullets. Taking him back, they halted about an hour, and were then attacked by the enemy, who were re-enforced to about seventy-five men. The attack was so sudden that they abandoned the horses, and crossed to a small island at the mouth of Patterson’s Creek. The charge of the rebels was bold and confident, yet twenty-three fell under the fire of my picket close about and on the island. My fellows were finally driven off, scattering, each man for himselfi and they are all in camp now; one, Corporal Hayes, of Company A, wounded, bur recovering; one, John C. Hollinbeck, of Company B, dead. The last was taken prisoner and brutally murdered.
Three companies went to the ground this morning, and recovered everything belonging to my picket except a few of the horses. The enemy were engaged all night long in boxing up their dead. Two of their officers were killed. They laid out twenty-three on the porch of a neighboring farm house. I will bury my poor fellow to-morrow.
I have positive information, gained to-day, that there are four regiments of rebels in and about Romney, under a Colonel McDonald. What their particular object is I cannot learn. The two Pennsylvania regiments are in encampment at the State line, about nine miles from here, waiting further orders. They have not yet reported to me. They hesitate about invading Maryland.
The report of the skirmish sounds like fiction, but it is not exaggerated. The fight was really one of the most desperate on record, and abounds with instances of wonderful daring and coolness.

cliased them a couple of miles, killed eight of them, and captured seventeen horses. Returning from the skirmish, they were in turn attacked by the enemy, re-enforced to seventy-five men, and driven to a kind of island in the neighborhood of the mouth of Patterson’s Greek, where they made a stand and fought till dusk, killing and wounding a large number, when they escaped with the loss of one man, John Hollinbeck, Company B, killed, and Corporal David Hayes, Company A, wounded. The bodies of twenty-three rebels were laid out on the porch of a farm house near the scene of the last engagement. Eight dead bodies (rebels) were left on the railroad track, where the first encounter took place. Hayes is doing well. His hurts are a saber cut on the head and two bullet wounds on the body.
I would simply say of this skirmish, that it was one of the boldest, most desperate, and fortunate on record, abounding with instances on the part of my scouts of rarest coolness, skill, and courage. What makes it most singular is that, for a considerable portion of the time, it was a hand-to-hand fight, carried on with pistol, saber, bayonet, and fist. One man, Louis Farley, killed six rebels; another (Grover) killed three; David Hayes, the wounded corporal, killed two, and received all his wounds while in hot pursuit at the very tails of the rebels’ horses. Among the dead of the enemy are a Captain Blue and two lieutenants.
Hollinbeek, the only man of mine killed, was severely wounded, then taken prisoner, and then brutally murdered by his captors.
All my men bear marks of the contest; some in bruises and cuts, others in bullet-holes through their clothes and equipments.
Very respectfully,

General : Herewith you will please find the report of Colonel Ruggles of an affair at Mathias Point. There are now there fifteen companies of volunteers, and I have ordered a section of Walker’s battery to re-enforce them. This force I think sufficient to prevent a landing for the purpose of holding the point. If it be your design to erect a battery there to command the river, I think instructions to that effect should be given immediately, and another regiment ordered to report to me for its defense after construction.

Report of Col. Daniel Buggies, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters, Camp Buggues, Ya.,
Jme 27, 1861—9.30 p. m.
Sir : I have the honor to state, for the information of the general commanding, that, in conformity to his orders, received last evening at 7 o’clock, I ordered Major Mayo, with his battalion, composed as indicated, to proceed without delay to Brooke’s Station, for which ample preparation has been made, to commence the movement to-morrow morning.
I have also the honor to state that, at an early hour this morning, a steamer, supposed to be the Freeborn, and two tugs, having in tow a large open boat or raft, with several small boats, suitable for landing men, took position nearly in front of this camp, and was represented to have effected that purpose. The employment of the principal part of the command for some hours was thus rendered necessary to ascertain the fact, with a view of repelling the enemy, which fortunately proved groundless. At about 1 p. m. our pickets reported that the enemy, whose steamers had returned to the immediate vicinity of Mathias Point, had already effected a landing of a strong detachment of men at the point, from which the pickets were mainly driven by the raking fire of shell and shot from the enemy’s steamers. The condition of things rendered vigorous measures on our part indispensable, and which has resulted, I am happy to inform you, in complete success. The enemy, who had landed, as before reported, with a detachment of at least fifty men, was driven, after a short conflict, on board of his steamers, in a state of undoubted discomfiture, and immediately withdrew from our shores. Night having closed in about the time this success was obtained, full particulars as to any loss of the enemy have not yet been obtained. I shall embrace an early moment to forward detailed reports of subordinate commanders.
I deem it of the utmost importance for your information that we discovered, immediately after the enemy was driven off, the foundation of a regular sand-bag battery, in the erection of which considerable progress had been made during the brief period the enemy had occupied the position, which would have completely commanded Mathias Point, where it has been in contemplation that a permanent battery may be established, commanding the Potomac River channel. In addition to the sand bags, we captured a considerable number of axes and spades, a very large coil of heavy rope (evidently to draw heavy guns on shore), left by the enemy in his precipitate flight. I have been thus particular in stating the arduous service in which this entire command has been engaged to-day, and from which we have this moment returned, at 9.30 p. m., to apprise you as to how completely paralyzed we are for the want of a battery of heavy guns to command the channel and one field battery of effective rifled guns to enable us to drive the enemy’s steamers from almost every portion of the extended range of coast constantly threatened by them. During the entire period of our operations this afternoon one or more of the enemy’s steamers has thrown shot and shell in rapid succession, sweeping almost the whole space in which the successive positions of our troops were taken, and at times greatly endangering them. Under the circumstances, I am constrained to request that you will send me Captain Walker’s light battery of rifled guns, or, in the event that it cannot be spared, Captain Braxton’s field battery, for a brief period of service, which I consider of vital importance to the

## p. 137 (#153) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.]	ATTACK ON MATHIAS POINT, VA.	137
interests of the State. I am also constrained to delay the movement of Major Mayo’s command, owing to the very critical condition of affairs in this district, rendering it necessary to employ strong pickets to-night, and to commence the erection of breastworks at Mathias Point and near Grimes’ house without a moment’s delay, and for which purpose detachments are now moving to the ground, until I may be enabled to receive further orders of the general in the case. I have reason to apprehend that the enemy may return, strongly re-enforced, before morning.
I have the gratification of being able to bear testimony as to the excellent tone which has been exhibited by this command to-day and the zeal with which officers and men have participated in the stirring scenes through which we have passed.
In conclusion, I feel constrained to express the opinion, in which all the field officers concur, that without artillery this command cannot hold this important position, and prevent the enemy from effecting a substantial lodgment, and strike an irretrievable blow against the interest and material defenses of the State.
I have to request that this communication may be forwarded to the War Department of the Confederate Government as my report of the events of the day.
I am happy to state that no casualties have occurred to our forces. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
DANIEL EUGGLES,
Colonel, Provisional Army.

Report of Maj. Ro. M. Mayo, 0. S. Forces.
Mathias Point, Ya., June 28,1861.
Sir : I have the honor of communicating to you the action of my command yesterday. About 3 o’clock I received a communication from Colonel Brockenbrough that the enemy wrere landing at the Point, and that he wished my co-operation. The distance from my camp to the Point is about three miles. I immediately put my command, consisting of one cavalry and three infantry companies, in motion. On arriving near the Point I found Colonel Ciaybrook with several companies in reserve. Being confident that I was better acquainted with the topography of this Point than almost any officer in this district, I determined, without waiting further orders, to take my command through the woods in an entirely different direction from that followed by Colonel Brockenbrough and yourself. Having heard from Colonel Brockenbrough’s pickets that they thought the enemy were erecting a battery in the pines on the end of the Point, I took ten men from Captain Gouldin’s company, and, halting the rest of my forces, went into the bushes with them to ascertain the correctness of the report. Having progressed some distance into the pines, and on the immediate brink of the river, where we could see a steamer and-a sail vessel about three or four hundred yards from the shore, I found that my skirmishing party was too small to examine properly the ravines and bushes, and, returning to my command, deployed Captain Gouldin’s company and Lee’s Legion (under

command of Lieutenant Beale, Captain Garnett being sick and absent) dismounted as skirmishers, leaving the rest of my command in reserve. We swept entirely through the bushes on the Point, and did not get in view of the enemy until we reached a marsh that separated us from them, and was entirely commanded by the steamer and the vessel. On arriving in this position we discovered the enemy getting into their boats about two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards distant, and we immediately commenced a fire both upon the boats and the steamer. The boats returned our fire two or three times, and then all of their men, except two or three who had fallen overboard, lay down in their boats, and it was some time before they could get their oarsmen to pull the boats from the shore.
We feel confident, from the number of men who never rose from the bottom of the boats and the blood upon the shore, that there were eight or ten killed and several more wounded.
After we had fired five or six rounds the steamer opened fire upon us with shot and shell, but by making my men lie down nobody was hurt. After firing several times the steamer went high up the river in order to meet their boats, which could not come to them, as they would have to approach nearer to our skirmishers. Having accomplished my pur-pose I would not allow my men to cross the marsh, as it would have exposed them to a raking fire from the steamer, but returned in the same direction we had come.
I have never realized until yesterday how absolutely necessary artillery is at this point. With a single smooth-bored 12-pounder I could have sunk the steamer and vessel without exposing my men more than they were. I am happy to say that my men acted very gallantly throughout the action.
Yery respectfully submitted.

sionists, if not the most numerous, are by far more active and effective than the supporters of the Federal Government.
It is the opinion of the Secretary of War, and I need not add my own, that the blow should be early struck, to carry consternation into the ranks of our numerous enemies about you. Accordingly, it seems desirable that you should take measures quietly to seize at once and securely hold the four members of the Baltimore police board, viz: Charles Howard, Wm. H. Gatchell, J. W. Davis, and C. D.Hinks, esqrs., together with the chief of the police, G. P. Kane. It is further suggested that you appoint a provost-marshal to superintend and cause to be executed the police law provided by the legislature of Maryland for Baltimore.
Your discretion and firmness are equally relied upon for the due execution of the foregoing views.

Lieutenant-General Scott.
Headquarters Department of Annapolis,

General : In pursuance of orders of the 24th ultimo, received from your department, I arrested, and now detain in custody of the United States, Mr. George P. Kane, chief of police of the city of Baltimore. Mr. Kane was arrested on the morning of the 27th ultimo. The strong-position he held as the head of a large body of armed men, posted in different parts of the city, who might be summoned together without loss of time, and the necessity of succeeding in the arrest, if attempted, made it impracticable, in my judgment, in view of all facts, to undertake at the same time the execution of other parts of this order.
The arrest of the chief of police, and the suspension of the powers of the board of police, were announced to the people of Baltimore in a proclamation, dated the 27th June, a copy of which is herewith inclosed [A]. Upon the arrest of the chief of police, Col. John B. Kenly, of the First Maryland Begiment, was appointed provost-marshal within and for the city of Baltimore, who entered at once upon his duties. Subsequent to a recognition and protest against the suspension of their functions by the board of police, they declared, in resolutions formally adopted and published, that the police law itself had been suspended, and the officers and men discharged from duty for the present, holding them at the same time to be subject to their orders, both now and hereafter. Colonel Kenly was obliged immediately to organize a force

## p. 140 (#156) ############################################

﻿140	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX
of four hundred men to serve as police officers, in order that the city should not be entirely divested of all police protection, which, with the aid of many loyal citizens, was effected, and the men sworn to the just performance of their duty, in the course of a few hours.
The city has remained in perfect order and quiet since the organization of the new police. The headquarters of the police, when vacated by the officers appointed by the board, resembled a concealed arsenal. Large quantities of arms and ammunition were found secreted in such places and with such skill as to forbid the thought of their being held for just or lawful purposes. An inventory of the arms and ammunition will be forwarded. Colonel Kenly has performed his duties as provost-marshal in the most prompt, faithful, and discreet maimer.
This morning at 4 o’clock the members of the board of police were arrested by my order, and, together with the chief of police, are now securely held in custody by Major Morris, commanding officer at Fort McHenry, in behalf of the Government of the United States. The persons arrested are Messrs. Charles Howard, president of the board) William II. Gatchell, Charles I). Hinks, and John W. Davis, being all its members, except the mayor of the city, who is connected ex officio with this department.
In view of possible occurrences, and the better to meet contingent action of disloyal persons, rumors of which have reached me from quarters entitled to respect, I have placed a large part of the force under my command within the city, and in possession of the principal public squares. No building of importance will be occupied, and no obstruction to the business of the city will occur, unless it be upon the strongest public necessity. The troops will be withdrawn from the city as soon as the question of the conflicting forces of police can be arranged. This I believe will be done at once. The arrests of this morning and the reasons for the occupation of the city have been announced by proclamation, a copy of which is herewith inclosed [B],
I have the gratification to inform you that all the arrests have been made without disturbance, and that the city is now and has been since the arrest of the chief of police more quiet and orderly than for any time for many months previous.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

By virtue of authority vested in me, and in obedience to orders, as commanding general of the Military Department of Annapolis, I have arrested and do now detain in custody Mr. George P. Kane, chief of police of the city of Baltimore. I deem it proper at this the moment of arrest to make formal and public declaration of the motive by which I have been governed in this proceeding. It is not my purpose, neither is it in consonance with my instructions, to interfere in any manner whatever with the legitimate government of the people of Baltimore or

Maryland. I desire to support the public authorities in all appropriate duties, in preserving peace, protecting property and the rights of persons, in obeying and upholding every municipal regulation and public statute consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and of Maryland. But unlawful combinations of men, organized for resistance to such laws, that provide hidden deposits of arms and ammunition, encourage contraband traffic with men at war with the Government, and, while enjoying its protection and privileges, stealthily wait opportunity to combine their means and forces with those in rebellion against its authority, are not among the recognized or legal rights of any class of men, and cannot be permitted under any form of government whatever. Such combinations are well known to exist in this department. The mass of citizens of Baltimore and of Maryland, loyal to the Constitution and the Union, are neither parties to nor responsible for them. The chief of police, however, is not only believed to be cognizant of these facts, but, in contravention of his duty and in violation of law, he is by direction and indirection both witness and protector to the transactions and the parties engaged therein. Under such circumstances the Government cannot regard him otherwise than as the head of an armed force hostile to its authority and acting in concert with its avowed enemies. For this reason, superseding his official authority and that of commissioner of police, I have arrested and do now detain him in custody of the United States; and in further pursuance of my instructions I have appointed for the time being Colonel Kenly, of the First Regiment of Maryland Volunteers, provost-marshal in and for the city of Baltimore, to superintend and cause to be executed the police laws provided by the legislature of Maryland, with the aid and assistance of the subordinate officers of the police department, and he will be respected accordingly.
Whenever a loyal citizen shall be otherwise named for the performance of this duty, who will execute these laws impartially and in good faith to the Government of the United States, the military force of this department will render to him that instant and willing obedience which is due from every good citizen to his government.

To the People of the City of Baltimore:
In pursuance of orders issued from the headquarters of the Army at Washington, for the preservation of the public peace in this department, I have arrested and do now detain in custody of the United States the members of the late board of police, Messrs. Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, Charles D. Hinks, and John W. Davis, the incidents of the late week furnishing full justification for this order. The police headquarters, under charge of the board, when abandoned by their officers, resembled in some respects a concealed arsenal. After public recognition and protest against the u suspension of their functions,they continue in daily secret session. Upon a forced and unwarrantable construction of my proclamation of the 27th ultimo, they declared the police law itself suspended, and the officers and men off duty for the present, intending to leave the city without any police protection whatever. They

To anticipate their intentions and orders, I have temporarily placed a portion of my command within the city. I disclaim for the Government I represent all desire, intention, and purpose to interfere in any of the ordinary municipal affairs of Baltimore. Whenever a loyal citizen can be nominated to the office of marshal who will execute the police laws impartially and in good faith to the United States, the military force will be withdrawn at once from the central parts of the municipality. No soldier will be permitted in the city except under regulations satisfactory to the marshal, or by order of the general in command, and whenever the municipal laws and regulations shall be by them violated, they shall be punished according to the municipal laws and upon the judgment of the civil tribunals.

Sir : My attention has been called to a resolution purporting to have been this day passed by the late board of police commissioners, expressing the opinion that u the suspension of their functions suspended at the same time the operations of the police law, and puts the officers and men off duty for the present.”
You will take special notice, sir, that by my proclamation of this day neither the law, nor the officers appointed to execute the laws, are affected in any manner whatever, except as it operates upon the members of the board of commissioners and chief of police, whose functions were and are suspended. Every part of the police law is to be enforced by you, except that which refers to the authority of the commissioners and chief of police 5 and every officer and man, with the exception of those persons above named, will be continued in service by you, and in the positions they now occupy, and with the advantages they now receive, unless one or more shall refuse to discharge their duties.
If any police officer declines to perform his duty, in order to avoid the anarchy which it was the purpose of the commissioners to bring upon the city by incorrectly stating that it had been by my act deprived of its police protection, you will select, in conference with such of the public authorities as will aid you, good men and true to fill their places and discharge their duties.
You will also take especial notice that no opinion, resolution, or other act of the late board of commissioners can operate to limit the effective

MEETING- OF THE POLICE BOARD.
Matters being thus arranged, the board of police commissioners went into secret session. The result of their deliberation was embodied in the following preamble and resolutions:
Whereas the laws of the State of Maryland give the whole and exclusive control of the police force of the city to the hoard of police, organized and appointed by the general assembly, and not only are said board bound to exercise the powers in and to discharge the duties imposed upon them, but all other persons are positively prohibited, under heavy penalties, from interfering with them in so doing; and
Whereas there is no power given to the board to transfer the control of any portion of the police force to any person or persons whomsoever other than the officers of police appointed by them, in pursuance of the express provisions of the law, and under their orders; and
Whereas, by order of Major-General Banks, an officer of the IJ. S. Army, commanding in this city, the marshal of police has been arrested, the board of police superseded, and an officer of the Army has been appointed provost-marshal, and directed to assume the command and control of the police force of this city: Therefore, be it
Resolved, That this board do solemnly protest against the orders and proceedings above referred to of Major-General Banks as an arbitrary exercise of military power, not warranted by any provision of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of the State of Maryland, but in derogation of all of them.
Resolved, That whilst the board, yielding to the force of circumstances, will do nothing to increase the present excitement or obstruct the execution of such measures as Major-General Banks may deem jnoper to take on his own responsibility for the preservation of the peace of "the city and of public order, they cannot consistently with their views of official duty and of obligation to their oaths of office recognize the right of any of the officers and men of the police force as such to receive orders or directions from any other authority than from this board.
Resolved, That, in the opinion of the board, the forcible suspension of their functions suspends at the same time the active operation of the police law, and puts the officers and men off duty for the present; leaving them subject, however, to the rules and regulations of the service as to their personal conduct and deportment, and to the orders which this board may see fit hereafter to issue when the present illegal suspension of their functions shall be removed.
[Signed by all the board.]
In conformity with these resolves, the board summoned the different police captains, and informed them that they had concluded to disband the police force, and through the captains the men were informed of this intention. They accordingly vacated the station-houses, and divested themselves of the insignia of office.

Report of the Board of Police Commissioners.
Fort McHenry, July 29,1861. To the honorable the General Assembly of Maryland:
The undersigned, commissioners of police of the city of Baltimore, have the honor respectfully to report: That from the date of their report made to your honorable body in May last they continued faithfully to discharge the duties imposed on them by the laws of the State until Thursday morning, the 27th of June. At an early hour on that day Col. George P. Kane, the marshal of police, was arrested at his residence by a body of military, acting under the orders of Major-General Banks, in the service of the United States, and was taken to Fort McHenry, where he is still confined. A few hours afterwards the board were called upon by Colonel Kenly, who read to them an order of General Banks, appointing him provost-marshal, and a proclamation by the same officer, announcing to the citizens of Baltimore that the marshal of police had been arrested and that the official authority of the board of police was u superseded.”
The commissioners of police, having maturely considered their duties and obligations under the law by which they held their appointments, could not avoid the conclusion that such action on the part of an officer of the General Government, who, in point of fact, held at the time military possession of the city of Baltimore, at once suspended the active operation of the police law, and put for the time off duty albthe officers and men who could not, without directly violating both the letter and spirit of the law, recognize the authority or be subject to the control of any other head than the board of police.
Accordingly the board unanimously adopted a resolution to that effect.
On the following Monday morning, the 1st of July, about the hour of 3 o’clock, all the members of the board, with the exception of the mayor, were arrested in like manner by order of General Banks, at their respective residences, and taken to Fort McHenry. One of them, Mr. 0. D. Hinks, was, after a fewT days’ confinement, allowed to return to his own house on parole, upon the representations of his physicians that owing to his state of ill health his life would be seriously endangered by a continuance of his imprisonment. The other commissioners, Messrs. Howard, Gatchell, and Davis, constituting a majority of the whole board, have ever since been confined in Fort McHenry; but they have this morning been officially notified that they are to be removed on the steamer Adelaide to some other place at 6 o’clock this evening.
The undersigned, Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, and John W. Davis, further respectfully report that, being deprived of their liberty without legal process, and the courts of justice, as v^ell of the United States as of the State of Maryland, being prevented by the military power of the former from affording them any relief, they addressed to the Congress of the United States a memorial asking that any charges made against them might be speedily investigated, and that the grievances of which they complain might be properly redressed.
To that memorial were appended copies of the twro proclamations issued by General Banks in reference to the board of police, and of the preamble and resolutions adopted by the board in reference to the first of said proclamations.
The undersigned respectfully ask leave to submit herewith, as a part of this report, copies of the above-mentioned memorial to Congress

Memorial of the Board of Police Commissioners.
To the honorable the Senate and Mouse of Representatives of the United
States:
The memorial of Chas. Howard, Wm. H. Gatchell, and Jno. W. Davis, citizens of Baltimore, in the State ot Maryland, respectfully represents:
That between 2 and 3 o’clock on the morning of the 1st of July instant, they were severally aroused from sleep at their respective dwellings by large bodies of soldiers of the Army of the United States, quartered in or about this city, and were removed by force and against their will from their homes and families to Fort McHenry, where they have ever since been confined as prisoners, and now are.
Your memorialists at the time received no information as to the cause of their arrest than that the same was made by order of Major* General Banks, commanding this military department, nor have they since been informed of any charges whatever against them further than those contained in a proclamation of General Banks issued later in the same day, a copy of which, taken from one of the newspapers of the city, they append hereto.*
By reference to the said proclamation your honorable bodies will perceive that the arrest of your memorialists is alleged to have been made u in pursuance of orders issued from the headquarters of the Army at Washington, for the preservation of the public peace in this department,” and is attempted to be justified by the refusal of your memorialists, as members of the board of police of Baltimore, to acquiesce in the legality and effect of a previous proclamation of General Banks declaring their official authority superseded. The proclamation in question goes on to charge that your memorialists, after such attempted suspension of their functions, had continued to hold sessions daily ; u that upon a forced and unwarrantable construction” of the previous proclamation referred to they had declared the police law to be suspended, and their police force to be off of duty, 66 intending to leave the city without any police protection whatever”; and that they had moreover refused to recognize as policemen certain persons selected by a provost-marshal, under General Banks, to act in that capacity. There is a further allegation that the u headquarters under the charge of the board, when abandoned by the officers, resembled in some respects a concealed arsenal.”
Your memorialists respectfully represent that together with their colleague, Charles D. Hinks, esq., who was arrested with them (but has since been discharged upon his parole because of ill health), and the

mayor of the city, who has not been arrested, they constitute the board of police, a quasi corporation created by the legislature of Maryland, and having exclusive police jurisdiction in the city of Baltimore. The nature and extent of their functions and duties will be made known to your honorable bodies by an examination of the code of Public Local Laws of the State of Maryland (art. iv, secs. 806 to 822, and secs. 199 to 228 inclusive). It will there be seen that their powers are of the amplest character, and that they not only have control of the whole police department of the State within the city limits, but are likewise charged with the appointment of all judges of election, and the conduct of all elections, whether Federal, State, or municipal, to be held in the city; so that every such election is, by special enactment, declared invalid and of no effect unless held by the board and under its control and supervision.
It will further appear by the explicit terms of the law that no police force can lawfully exist in Baltimore unless appointed and governed by the police board, and that neither officers nor men, when appointed, have any official authority or jurisdiction independently of or apart from the board; but that all of them are merely employed, in pursuance of the express provisions of the law, “to enable the board to discharge the duties imposed upon them.” By section 819 of the article of the code already referred to, heavy pecuniary penalties are imposed upon any person who shall forcibly resist or obstruct the execution or enforcement of any of the provisions of the law, in the premises, or disburse any money in violation thereof; and it is made the duty of the board to enforce such penalties by civil action, leaving the parties who may have violated the law still subject to indictment for any criminal offense committed by them in the course of such violation.
Your memorialists, with their colleague, Mr. Hinks, were duly appointed by the legislature of Maryland, at its January session, 1860, to carry out the provisions of the police system of which they have thus indicated the leading features, and they duly took the oath to do so, which is prescribed by the law. The term of office of Messrs. Howard and Davis does not expire until the 10th of March, 1862, and that [of] Messrs. Gatchell and Hinks extends for still two years longer. None of them are subject to removal except by the legislature of Maryland, from which they derive their authority and functions. All the provisions of the police law were fully tested by legal proceedings instituted in the superior court of Baltimore City shortly after its enactment, and carried on appeal to the court of last resort in the State. The result was an unqualified recognition by all the judges of tbe conformity of the law in all particulars with the constitution of Maryland and that of the United States.
Such being the official tenure and lawful and constitutional powers and duties of your memorialists, they were astonished, on the 27th of June last, to be visited, without previous notice, by Colonel Kenly, of the Maryland Volunteers, then encamped near Baltimore, and to be informed by that officer that he was instructed by Major-General Banks to read them a proclamation declaring their official authority superseded, and appointing Colonel Kenly provost-marshal to administer the police law of the State in their stead. Of that proclamation a copy is appended to this memorial,* by which it will be seen that although various causes are alleged for the arrest of Col. George P. Kane, marshal of police, and for superseding his official authority likewise, no ground of complaint whatever is pretended to exist against the board of police, and no excuse

is vouchsafed for the overthrow of the constitutional authority of the State of Maryland vested in your memorialists, and, of course, incapable of being constitutionally or lawfully divested bv any Federal authority, civil or military.
The city of Baltimore being entirely commanded by large bodies of Federal troops stationed around it, and it being wholly impossible for your memorialists to offer any effective resistance to the illegal proceedings of General Banks, they had no alternative but to submit to force, and to vindicate, as far as practicable, the authority of the State or Maryland, and their own personal and official rights and self-respect, by protesting against such proceeding as an arbitrary and unconstitutional exercise of military power. They accordingly adopted the preamble and resolutions likewise hereto appended.* It is in this act, and in their continuing their sessions under and in pursuance, that General Banks, in his proclamation issued on the day of their arrest, professes to find justification for his unwarrantable and unlawful violation of their personal liberty. It is no part of the intention of your memorialists to enter into any discussion of the allegations of that proclamation further than to say that it is wholly untrue, as therein alleged, that they continued to hold the police force of the State of Maryland, in the city of Baltimore, subject to their orders, for any purpose inconsistent with the peace or security of the Government. They declared the active operation of the police law to be suspended for the obvious and unanswerable reason that the forcible suspension of the functions of the board which alone had authority to administer the law necessarily paralyzed the law also. They declared the police force appointed by them to be still an existent body, because the law creating the force forbids the dismissal of the men, except for cause, and then by the board of police alone, after trial had. They declared it to be still subject to their orders,, for so long as the force exists it cannot be subject under the law to any other. They refused, as a matter of obvious duty, to recognize as policemen the parties named by Colonel Kenly to act as such, for they assumed it, as they still consider it to be beyond dispute, that Colonel Kenly could have no lawful right to appoint policemen, under the laws of Maryland, whatever his authority may have been as a military officer (which they do not propose to consider) to appoint military subordinates in the stead of policemen outside of those laws or in derogation of them.
The attempt by Colonel Kenly to enforce such police appointments, and all efforts of his nominees to act thereunder were moreover punishable offenses under the police law, the penalties of which it was the sworn duty of your memorialists to enforce, and in the violation of which it was impossible they could acquiesce. But your memorialists distinctly and emphatically deny that they had any other purpose in their official protest and action than to fulfill their manifest and sworn obligations, and to maintain the dignity and assert the authority of the* laws of Maryland which were intrusted to their hands for execution, but which they were precluded by force from executing. They solemnly declare that if they had been permitted to continue in the exercise of their functions, after the arrest and imprisonment of the marshal of police on the 27th of June, they would have continued to discharge their duties, as they had discharged them theretofore, in all respects faithfully, impartially, and that to the best of their ability, in obedience to the laws and the constitution, and they asseverate, and will maintain, that the imputation of any other intention or purpose on their part is wholly destitute of foundation in fact. The statement in regard to the
Seep. 143.

aconcealed arsenal” at the marshals office, they do not deem it necessary to allude to, further than to say that it is perfectly notorious, and has been fully shown by the message of the mayor to the city council of Baltimore,* that the arms in question were the lawful property of the city; that they were insignificant in quantity, constituting but little * more than the customary armament of the force for its public duties, and were lawfully concealed to prevent unlawful seizure. Your memorialists therefore respectfully represent that the grounds set up by General Banks, in his proclamation, give to their arrest and imprisonment no color of justification or necessity.
And as to the proclamation of General Banks issued on the 27th of June, announcing the arrest of the marshal of police, and declaring his official authority to have been superseded, these memorialists respectfully say that the charges against that officer contained therein are equally without foundation, so far as they believe or have any reason to suspect. They have personal knowledge of the fact, which is equally well known to all impartial citizens of Baltimore, that the official duties of Colonel Kane have been discharged throughout with singular ability, integrity, and courage, and never more conspicuously, or in better faith, or at more imminent risk of his own life, than in the protection of the troops of the Federal Government on the 19th of April. Of the police force placed under his command by these memorialists, and selected wholly without reference to their political opinions (as the law and the official oath of your memorialists require), your memorialists can say without exaggeration that they do not believe a body of men can be found anywhere more entirely devoted to the conscientious discharge of official duty, or less justly liable to the accusation of entering into unlawful combinations themselves, or encouraging such combinations in others. Down to the moment of the suspension of the active duties of the force by General Banks, these memorialists have pride in asserting that no community ever acknowledged more universally than the citizens of Baltimore, and none ever had better reason to acknowledge, the successful operation of a police system, in securing the strictest enforcement of the laws, the amplest protection of private rights, and the most rigid maintenance of public order.
Your memorialists further say that with every opportunity afforded by their official position, and every energy stimulated by their sense of duty to ascertain the existence of all unlawful combinations or associations within their jurisdiction, they have no reason whatever to suspect that any such combinations did, in fact, exist, as alleged by General Banks in his proclamation of June 27, and they confidently assert their conviction that his allegation to the contrary was founded upon false information, communicated to him by designing persons, and cannot be sustained or countenanced by credible evidence of any sort. But even if your memorialists were and are altogether mistaken in these particulars ; if the marshal of police had been faithless to his obligations, as ^charged, and had been willing or able to seduce the men under his command from theirs also, it was still only necessary for General Banks to furnish the board of police with the slightest evidence to that effect, and your memorialists would have given to his suggestions the most prompt and respectful consideration. They would have suspended or removed the marshal, if such action had been proper, and would have placed beyond question their own disposition and ability to discharge the whole of their duty in the premises. If General Banks, even without advising them, had seen fit to arrest the marshal of police, upon any charge

which might have been deemed sufficient to justify such a step, your memorialists would have taken care to govern the police force efficiently and properly during bis confinement. The legality of such arrest would have been a question for Colonel Kane, and not your memorialists, to consider ; but either of the courses suggested wTould have fulfilled the purposes, and have met the exigency announced in the proclamation. General Banks, acting doubtless in conformity with his orders, adopted neither the one course nor the other, but assuming jurisdiction not only over the person of an alleged offender, but over his official functions, likewise saw fit not only to arrest and imprison him, but to dismiss him from his place as a public officer of this State (which only your memorialists could lawfully do), and to supersede the lawful authority of your memorialists besides. Knowing that such a proceeding could not by possibility be justified by anything in the laws or constitution of Maryland or the United States, your memorialists were compelled by every consideration of sworn duty to treat the same as an arbitrary act of force and usurpation, no matter by whose orders it might have been committed, or under what pretexts it was sought to be excused. Ko construction which it was possible for them to give to the proclamation of the 27th of June could have brought them to any other conclusion than that it was their bounden duty to enter their protest against it.
They therefore deny that the construction which they adopted was either “forced” or “unwarrantable,” as charged in the proclamation of July 1; and they emphatically protest against the truth of the further allegation contained in the latter document to the effect that their official course upon the occasion was dictated by a purpose to “ leave the city without any police protection whatever.” If, indeed, they had entertained such a purpose, they respectfully suggest that it was not a matter with which any officer of the Federal Government had any rightful concern, howmuchsoever it would have furnished their fellow-citizens with just cause of complaint. But they entertained no such purpose. On the contrary, they aver and are prepared to show that when General Banks, by his proclamation of June 27, interrupted the exercise of their lawful authority, the city was thoroughly protected, in all particulars, by your memorialists and the force under their command; that its tranquillity was perfect; its peace neither disturbed nor threatened; the rights of person and property of all men were inviolate; the civil authorities of the State and city were in the beneficial and effective exercise of all their functions, and the laws were supreme, except in so far as interfered with by the military power. If, therefore, the city was left without protection on the 27th of June, it was the fault and upon the responsibility not of your memorialists but altogether of that department of the General Government by which the constituted authorities of the State were superseded and the protective provisions of its laws deprived of their vitality.
If General Banks himself were unlawfully superseded by force, he surely would not regard it as just in his captors to accuse him of leaving Ins department without protection, because he refused, as a man of courage and honor, to acquiesce in their violent suspension and assumption of his functions.
Your memorialists claim to be judged, officially and personally, by no lower standard of dignity, responsibility, or honor. As public officers and men of ordinary integrity, it must be obvious to your honorable bodies that they could not lend themselves in any way to what they know to be a palpable violation of the law they had sworn to support.
They could not transfer or acquiesce in the transfer to General Banks

or Colonel Kenly of an authority which the law commanded them to exercise exclusively themselves. They could not authorize their police force to serve under any command or control but their own in the face of the express provisions of the law to the contrary. They could not expose their officers and men to civil and criminal responsibility by leaving them on duty under unlawful orders which could afford them no protection before the tribunals of justice. Your memorialists had no choice therefore but to protest as they did) to declare their force off duty, and to leave the military authority to deal, on its own responsibility, with the exigency it had seen fit to create.
In entering thus at large into a discussion of the grounds set up by General Banks in justification of their arrest, your memorialists have been governed altogether by a desire to vindicate their personal and official character and conduct from unfounded and disparaging imputations, and to demonstrate the gratuitous character of the injustice against Which they appeal to Congress for relief. They are in no wise to be considered as thereby recognizing for an instant the right of the War Department, or of any officer acting thereunder, to proceed against them in the mode adopted, even if the accusations which they have repelled were perfectly well founded. The State of Maryland is one of the States of the Union. She is at peace with the Government. Her people are disarmed, and her territory is occupied by an overwhelming military force. Martial law has not been proclaimed among her people, but, on the contrary, all intention to set it up or enforce it is disavowed in the most explicit way in the proclamation of June 27. The Federal courts and those of the State are in full and undisturbed operation so far as citizens not belonging to the military force are concerned, and process is served without obstruction, and is obeyed without resistance by all except those in military authority. If, therefore, your memorialists were charged with any offense known to the law there was and is nothing to prevent their arrest and detention by the civil arm, in due course, and upon proper and lawful warrant supported by oath, as prescribed and required by the Constitution.
But they respectfully submit that in the proclamation by which their arrest is sought to be justified, there is no allegation of any matter or thing which, if sworn to in proper form of law, would authorize the issuing of process against them by any judicial tribunal.
If they were so unfortunate as to place an erroneous construction upon / the first proclamation of General Banks, as he alleges, they are not aware of any statute of the United States which renders such a mistake a penal offense.
If it be a crime on their part to regard as illegal and wholly null the attempted suspension by a Federal officer of their functions as constituted authorities of the State of Maryland, they have been unable to learn by what provisions of the Constitution and laws such an offense is created or defined.
If they are lawfully punishable for holding subject to their orders a police force which the laws of Maryland made it their duty so to hold, and for refusing to recognize as public officers of Maryland the appointees of General Banks, whom they are bound under the laws of Maryland to prosecute as offenders for attempting to exercise police functions, they are at a loss to conceive under what head of the penal law such criminality on their part exists. They mean no improper reflection when they assert their belief that no law officer of the Government would venture to ask for a warrant upon an affidavit of the facts recited in the proclamation of July 1, and that no competent tribunal

151
would liesitate to quasli such a warrant if issued. They know no principle of criminal jurisprudence, under free institutions, which would authorize even the courts of recognized jurisdiction to sanction the arrest and confinement of a citizen upon the indefinite allegation of his entertaining 44 some purpose, not known to the Government,” but still alleged to be u inconsistent with its peace or security.”
But be this as it roay, these memorialists respectfully? insist that if they are charged with any offense which is known to the laws, it is their constitutional right, as citizens of the United States, to be dealt with according to law. If they are charged with no offense, it is equally their constitutional right to have the fact recognized, and to enjoy their personal liberty.
They have, through their counsel, respectfully asked of General Banks a statement of the grounds of their imprisonment, and have challenged an investigation of any and all charges affecting either their personal or official integrity or their fidelity to the laws and the Constitution.
No such statement has been made to them, no such investigation has been granted, and no hope has been held out to them of any speedy relief from the unjust and unlawful imprisonment under which they are suffering. In the mean time they are withdrawn from their homes and separated from their families; their public duties are unlawfully committed to other hands; their private interests are exposed to detriment and perhaps ruin, and they themselves held as malefactors before the country, and are compelled by force to endure mortification and obloquy. The arbitrary suspension of the writ of habeas corpus has of course deprived them of the means provided by law for their deliverance, and unless your honorable bodies should see fit to relieve them, they are wholly without means of present redress. They therefore most respectfully and earnestly invoke the immediate interposition of Congress in their behalf.
They repeat that they have administered their public trust faithfully, impartially, and to the best of their ability, and have not used the police force under their control, nor have they permitted it, nor contemplated permitting it, to be used for any other purpose than the legitimate and faithful discharge of its duties as prescribed by law. As private citizens they invite scrutiny likewise into their conduct in every respect in which it may be lawfully impugned, and they assert their readiness to meet, without a moment’s delay, any charge which may be responsibly laid against their individual or official proceedings.
As citizens of the United States they therefore appeal to your honorable bodies for relief from oppression and unconstitutional wrong. As public officers of the State of Maryland they protest against the usurpation of their official authority by an officer of the United States Army, and they protest the more strongly because the usurpation against which they remonstrate is not an irresponsible proceeding of the officer in question, but the advised and deliberate act of the War Department itself. They are aware that the President of the United States has called upon Congress to sanction the suspension of the habeas corpus and other acts which have been done by the Executive Department, upon its responsibility, without previous sanction of law. But the President has not asserted in his message any right on the part of the Federal Government to depose and appoint State officers, or annul laws of the States constitutionally enacted, nor has he suggested any power in Congress to clothe him with any such authority. He has asserted no right to do wrong to individuals, nor has he asked the interposition of Congress to any such end. But whatever may be the claims of the

Executive, your memorialists respectfully insist that the demands of the Constitution and of individual right and public liberty are very far above them, and they throw themselves therefore for redress and deliverance upon the justice and authority of the representatives of the people. They have no other recourse against arbitrary power and military force, and they demand as matter .of right th at their case be investigated by Congress or remitted to the tribunals of justice to be lawfully heard and determined.

Memorial of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.
To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States :
The mayor* and city council of Baltimore respectfully present this their memorial:
The recent suspension of the functions of the board of police of this city makes it the duty of your memorialists to call your attention to certain consequences of that action which affect every citizen in this community. The memorial of the board of police already presented to your honorable bodies has given you full information of the nature and extent of their powers. A brief reference to certain leading features of the law of Maryland under which they hold office, and with whose execution they are charged, will enable you to appreciate the embarrassments which now affect the due administration of the government of Baltimore.
The board of police is, under the laws of Maryland, the sole police authority of the city. It alone is competent to provide for the preservation of peace and order within our limits; to appoint subordinate police officers, to appoint judges of elections, and provide for the execution of the laws regulating elections; to enforce all ordinances of the mayor and city council of Baltimore for the preservation of health and the maintenance of peace and order.
By other provisions of the laws for the police government of this city, the organization of any permanent police force other than that organized by and acting under the orders of the board of police is distinctly prohibited.
To the due execution of the laws of their State for their local government, by legally-constituted officers, the free citizens of Baltimore have an unquestioned constitutional right. The manner in which that right has been respected will appear from the facts which we now recite:
The major-general commanding in the military department of which this city forms a part issued a proclamation, dated June 27, announcing the arrest of the marshal of police. With professions of respect for every municipal regulation and public statute, the proclamation further announces to the public that the official authority of the marshal of police and the board of police is superseded, and a u provost-marshal,1 an officer unknown to the civil law of Maryland, is appointed. No charge is preferred against the members of the board of police, nor is

any reason assigned for superseding them and depriving the citizens of Baltimore of their only legal police authority.
The board of police, yielding to the force which prevented their execution of the laws of this State, submitted to the practical suspension of their functions, and neither offered nor permitted any resistance te such action as the general in command saw fit to adopt.
The provost-marshal, appointed by the general in command to execute the police laws of Maryland for the government of the city of Baltimore, took possession of the offices belonging to the city, and removed certain officials not appointed by the board, but by the mayor and city council of Baltimore, appointing others in their place.
The memorial of the board of police has presented at length the considerations of official duty which made it impossible for them either themselves to aid, or to permit the officers under their command to aid, in violations of the law under which they hold office. A comparison of the reasons assigned by them, with the provisions of the police law, to which they direct your attention, will prove the correctness of their conclusions. Under date of July 1 appeared a third proclamation of the general in command, announcing the arrest of the members of the board of police. Again disclaiming for those under whose authority he acts any intention to interfere with the municipal affairs of Baltimore, he assigns certain reasons for the summary arrest of these gentlemen whom without complaint on oath or civil process he arrested and now holds in custody. Examined in connection with the law under which they were appointed, the pretended offenses charged against them amount together to the simple performance of their official duty. Had they aided or acquiesced in the establishment of any police authority other than their own, they would have plainly violated the law under which they hold office.
By a fourth proclamation, dated July 10, the major-general in command informs the public that he has removed the u provost-marshal/7 and has appointed a u marshal of police,” in all respects to administer every department of the police law in full freedom for the peace and prosperity of the city and the honor and perpetuity of the United States. This officer now affects to administer the law for the police government of Baltimore by means of a force organized under and acting by his direction.
Whatever professions of regard for our laws accompany these transactions the facts are too plain to be concealed. The local laws of the State of Maryland for the police government of the city of Baltimore, to which all officers of the Federal Government are bound to yield obedience within our limits, have been set aside. The only officers competent to administer those laws have been superseded and then imprisoned. The general in command, professing to act under instructions from the Federal Government, has marched large bodies of armed men into the city, planted cannon in the principal streets and public squares, and, by the law and authority of superior force, has established the present acting police force, has enabled its officers to take possession of the offices and buildings belonging to the city of Baltimore, to eject officers appointed by the mayor and city council, and to assume the function of executing laws whose fundamental provisions they daily violate by the exercise of police authority. Your memorialists need not dwell on the embarrassments which must certainly result from thus disorganizing the civil government of a city, nor on the sense of insecurity which affects citizens who reflect that the present police acts without legal warrant or authority. A community thus deprived of its lawful government is en-

titled to demand that those who assume so grave a responsibility shall furnish some sufficient reason for their action. It is impossible to believe that the Federal authority have wantonly disturbed the peace and good government of the city. Yo doubt statements have been made to which credit has been given, and on the faith of which the Government has acted. The proclamation of the general in command, issued immediately after the arrest of the members of the board* of police, vaguely charges that the board u hold, subject to their orders, now and hereafter, the old police force, a large body of armed men for some purpose unknown to the Government and inconsistent with its peace and secu-rity.?? Your memorialists are left in doubt as to the precise nature of the purpose referred to, but the suspension of their authority, and the subsequent imprisonment of the board of police, seems to have been the result of a belief that their authority would be used to the injury of the Government of the United States.
That this opinion has any foundation in facts your memorialists deny, and appeal to the history of the official acts of the police authority of this city.
For a detailed account of the unhappy occurrences of the 19th April you are referred to the statement of the mayor of the city, which is herewith submitted.* FTo evidence of failure of duty on the part of the police authority on that day can be produced. The mayor, ex officio a member of the board, shared the dangers to which the troops were exposed, and both he and the marshal of police risked their lives for their protection. The great excitement which ensued, and which was intensified by the wanton killing of a citizen at a distance from the scene of the riot, and who was shot from the window of the cars as the train passed out of the city, was represented to the President by the mayor of the city. The President and his Cabinet recognized the necessity of temporarily avoiding a passage through Baltimore, and gave repeated assurances that the troops should not be brought through the city.
Unauthorized persons declaring openly their intention to cut their way through Baltimore with or without the orders of the Government, the authorities of Baltimore, as well the police board as your memorialists, called their people to arms, procured such weapons as could be hastily gathered, and did all in their power to provide for the defense of their city from the threatened danger. This they did, and this they justify, In the then excited condition of the people a portion of our population may have entertained designs of active hostility to the Government.
If such designs existed they were frustrated by the precautions of the board of police. Fort McHenry, believed to be without either a sufficient garrison or armament, was nightly guarded by the military of the city, acting under the orders of the board of police. Other Government property received especial protection. Arms, supposed to belong to the United States and found in the hands of individuals, were taken possession of and preserved by the board of police, who gave notice to the Government agents of their action. The persons and property of all citizens received equal and sufficient protection. Whatever charges malice may suggest, the preservation of peace in the city, the prevention of conflict between citizens divided in opinion, the protection of life, limb, and property during a period of great popular excitement, is a monument to the zeal and good faith of our police authorities. When there no longer seemed any necessity for a military array, the arms placed in the hands of the people were recalled, and the city resumed

its ordinary condition of quiet. So Baltimore remained until May 14, when, it being ascertained that the people were disarmed, and that the movement could be made without serious danger, the general then in command in this department occupied a portion of the city with certain troops under his command. His arrival was announced by proclamation: and in the afternoon of May 14 he sent a detachment of troops into the city, who seized and carried off arms belonging to and in the custody of the authorities of the city of Baltimore. No resistance was offered or permitted by the authorities of the city. Two of our citizens, one of them a member of the legislature of Maryland, were by the orders of the same military officer summarily arrested, and after an imprisonment of a few days were released because there existed no sufficient cause for either arrest or detention.
Since the middle of May many thousand United States soldiers have passed through this city. There has been no single instance of opposition to their progress, nor any failure on the part of the city authorities to take proper precautions for their protection as well as preserving the peace of the city. The courts of the United States are and have been unimpeded in the performance of their duties, save when in a memorable instance the marshal of the United States was not permitted to enter Fort McHenry or to serve process issued by the highest judicial officer of the United States. The order of the city has been preserved; no resistance of any kind has been made, even to illegal and unconstitutional acts of military officers: No arrest that has been made by mere military authority but that could have been made by civil officers. Thus, without the existence of a single fact to justify an appeal to a supposed authority growing out of military necessity, citizens have been seized and imprisoned, their homes invaded and searched without warrant or complaint on oath, as required by law.
The protection afforded by constitutional guarantees of the liberty of the citizen and constitutional restraints imposed on the power of the Executive has been denied. Obedience to the courts is refused when they interfere for the protection of the citizen. Arms belonging to the city of Baltimore and rightfully in the custody of its authorities have been taken. The buildings of the city have been given into the custody of officers not known to its laws. Its court-house has been occupied by troops. Its civil authority has been disregarded, and a revolutionary government established by mere force of arms and against law.
Against these manifold wrongs your memorialists, for themselves and the free community which they represent, do most solemnly protest.
The State of Maryland has been and is subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and her citizens are of right entitled to the protection of that Constitution and of those laws. The civil authorities of this city have heretofore, and do now, render fitting obedience to the requirements of both. If disaffection is believed to exist, from which danger is apprehended, the guns of Fort McHenry turned on the homes of the women and children of an unarmed city, the Federal troops encamped around its limits, would seem an adequate protection to the Government. Whether that disaffection is weakened by depriving a whole community of the protection of its laws, whether the risk of disorder is diminished by establishing a police government which fails to command the respect accorded to undoubted lawful authority, you in your wisdom will determine.
But your memorialists respectfully, yet most earnestly, demand, as a matter of right, that their city may be governed according to the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Maryland.

They demand as a matter of right that citizens may be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they be not deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. They demand as a matter of right that the military render obedience to the civil authority, that our municipal laws be respected, that officers be released from imprisonment and restored to the lawful exercise of their functions, that the police government established by law be no longer impeded by armed force to the injury of peace and order. These their rightful demands your memorialists submit for the consideration of your honorable bodies.

Entered and passed through this place to-day in hot pursuit of the enemy. The Army was welcomed with enthusiasm by the mass of the population, gratified by the protection promised and now given by the Government. The force we scattered yesterday was thirty-five hundred strong, and their loss about sixty killed. It rallied, and presented front to-day, but again retreated to a point seven miles from here, where they have been re-enforced by a party under Colonel Bee, claimed in all to be thirty thousand; in reality, thirteen thousand.
I have ordered the Bhode Island Battery to come up from Williamsport with a provision train on the 5th. Humor indicates Colonel Stone as approaching by way of Harper’s Ferry. My post-office is Hagerstown, unless the Government re-establishes the mail route.

visions in this part of the country are limited, and consequently with my present transportation I can advance but a short distance before I am compelled to halt. As soon as provisions arrive I shall advance to Winchester to drive the enemy from that place, if any remain. I then design to move towards Charlestown, to which point I believe Colonel Stone is advancing, and, if I find it not hazardous, to continue to Leesburg. I must do this or abandon the country, by retiring the way I ■ came, in consequence of the term of the three months’ volunteers being I'about to expire. They will not, in any number, renew their service, f though I think the offer should be made.
The Union sentiment here is apparently very strong, but many fear a reverse, and that this force will retire, either voluntarily or forcibly. The people cannot be made use of to raise a force for self-defense unless supported by a strong force of U. S. troops.
I desire to be informed of the wish of the General-in-Chief in regard to the continued occupation of this region. I have ordered up all force in the rear, except the Connecticut regiment, five companies of which are stationed at each of the depots, Williamsport and Hagerstown. The Ehode Island Battery and the Thirteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers join me to-night.

You will have to provide transportation for them thence to the post you may order them to. If any three-monthsr men will re-engage for the long term, designate a Regular officer of your command to muster them, provided a sufficient number to form a regiment can be obtained. Having defeated the enemy, if you can continue the pursuit without too great hazard, advance via Leesburg (or Strasburg} towards Alexandria; but consider the dangerous defiles, especially via Strasburg, and move with great caution, halting at Winchester and threatening a movement by Strasburg; or the passage of the Potomae twice, and coming down by Leesburg, may be the more advantageous-movement.

(Similar dispatch to McClellan.)
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Martinsburg, Yan July 6, 1861.
Sir : I telegraphed my intention to cross the Potomac on the 1st instant. I now have the honor to report my movements since that date.
I left Hagerstown on the afternoon of the 30th ultimo, the earliest day my command could take the field in a proper condition for active service, intending the following morning to enter Virginia with two columns at Darn No. 4 and Williamsport, to be united the same day at Hainesville, the known location of the rebels. Owing to the danger and difficulty attending the fording at Dam No. 4,1 placed all the force at Williamsport. My order of march for the 2d instant is given in the accompanying circular.
The advance crossed the Potomac at 4 a. m., all taking the main road to Martinsburg, with the exception of Negley’s brigade, which, about one mile from the ford, diverged to the right, to meet the enemy should he come from Hedgesville, to guard our right, and to rejoin at Hainesville. About five miles from the ford the skirmishers in front and on the flank suddenly became engaged with the enemy, posted in a clump of trees. At the same time their main force appeared in front, sheltered by fences, timber and houses. Abercrombie immediately deployed his regiments (First Wisconsin and Eleventh Pennsylvania) on each side of the road, placed Hudson’s section, supported by the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry, in the road, and advanced to the attack against a warm fire before him. The enemy, being supported by artillery, resisted for twenty-five minutes with much determination. Lieutenant Hudson after getting into position soon silenced their guns.
In the mean time Thomas’ brigade rapidly advanced, and deployed to the left to turn the right flank of the enemy. The enemy, seeing this movement, and being pressed by Abercrombie, retired, hotly pursued for four miles by artillery and infantry. The cavalry could not be employed, on account of numerous fences and walls crossing the country.
In the enemy’s camp were found camp equipage, provisions, grain, &c. This brush was highly creditable to our arms, winning as we did the day against a foe superior in number to those engaged on our side. They were well posted, sheltered by timber, and sustained by artillery and cavalry. Our men advanced over open ground against a warm fire of artillery and infantry. I present the reports of Colonels Abercrombie and Thomas and Lieutenants Perkins and Hudson, and take much pleasure in bearing testimony as an eye-witness to the admirable manner in which their commands were handled and their commendations earned.
I also bear testimony to efficient service in posting portions of the troops and conducting them to the front and into action rendered by the members of my staff present on the field of battle—Col. F. J. Porter, Capt. John Newton, and Lieutenant Babcock, and Majors Price and Biddle—who were employed conveying orders) also Surgeon Tripler in attention to the wounded.

F. J. PORTER,
Assistant Adjutant- General.
Martinsburg, Va., July 9,1861.
Colonel : I have received the telegrams of the General-in-Chief, notifying me of the additional regiments sent me. Colonel Stone and the Nineteenth and Twenty-eighth New York Regiments arrived yesterday. General Sandford, with the Fifth and Twelfth New York Regiments, will join to-morrow. Since I last addressed you I have made no movements—in fact, have been prevented by the necessity of sending all my wagons to the rear to obtain provisions for a few days in advance and to bring up troops. The commissary has supplies (with those in hands of troops) for about ten days. Though the quartermaster has spared no exertion, and his agents have been very active, he has not as yet been able to provide a supply train for the command. I am therefore much restricted in my movements, being compelled, after three days* advance, to send back for provisions. The difficulty will increase as I advance; indeed, I am now almost at a stand. Instead of receiving aid from the inhabitants, I find myself in an enemy’s country, where our opponents can procure supplies and we nothing, except by seizure. Even information is studiously kept from us. Supplies, especially provisions, are very scarce, and not even one day’s rations can be relied upon. The supply of grain also is very limited. Under these circumstances I respectfully present to the General-in-Chief the following plan, which, with my present views, I desire to carry into operation so soon as I can do so with safety and the necessity of following Johnston ceases:
I propose to move this force to Charlestown, from which point I can move easily, strike at Winchester, march to Leesburg when necessary,

and open communication to a depot to be established at Harper’s Ferry, and occupy the main avenue of supply to the enemy. My base will then be some seven miles nearer, more easily reached by road, and my lino of communication rendered more secure than at present. I can establish communication with the Maryland shore by a bridge of boats. In this way I can more easily approach you, and the movement, I think, will tend to relieve Leesburg and vicinity of some of its oppressors. My present location is a very bad one in a military point of view, and from it I cannot move a portion of the force without exposing that of what remains to be cut off.
General Sandford informs me by letter that he has for me a letter from you. I hope it will inform me when you will put your column in motion against Manassas and when you wish me to strike. The enemy retired in succession from Darkesville and Bunker Hill to Stephenson’s Station, a few miles from Winchester. There he has halted, and report says is intrenching. His design evidently is to draw this force on as far as possible from the base, and then to cut my line or to attack with large re-enforcements from Manassas.
As I have already stated, I cannot advance far, and if I could I think the movement very imprudent. When you make your attack I expect to advance and offer battle. If the enemy retires I shall not pursue. I am very desirous to know when the General-in-Chief wishes me to approach Leesburg. If the notice does not come in any other way, I wish you would indicate the day by telegraph, thus: “Let me hear of you on-----.”

Colonel Crosman, quartermaster, thought 900 wagons would be sufficient to furnish subsistence and to transport ammunition to our present force. Tlie calculation for the original column was 700 wagons, of which 500 were on hand and 200 expected. The great difficulty will be toj obtain forage for the animals, the present consumption being twenty-six* tons daily.
Captain Beckwith, commissary: The question of subsistence is here a question of transportation. Thus far no reliance has been placed on the adjacent country. A day’s march ahead would compel a resort to it. As far as known, those supplies would be quite inadequate.

Captain Simpson, Topographical Engineers: The difficulty of our present position arises from the great facility the enemy has to concentrate troops at Winchester from Manassas Junction. By the railroad 12,000 men could he sent there in a day, and again sent back to Manassas. Our forces should combine with the forces at Washington.
Captain Newton, Engineers: Our present position is a very exposed one. General Johnston can keep us where we are as long as he pleases, and at any time make a demonstration on our rear. Our whole line is a false one. We have no business here except for the purpose of making a demonstration. He threatens us now. We should be in a position to threaten him. We should go to Charlestown, Harper’s Ferry, Shepherdstown, and flank him.
Colonel Stone : It is mainly a question for the staff. Our enemy has great facility of movement, and to extend our line would be accompanied with great danger. Johnston should be threatened from some other point. We might leave two regiments here, two guns at Shep-JUerdstown, and proceed to Charlestown, and threaten from that point. /General Negeey: Ditto to Captain Newton.

Washington, July 11,1861. Maj. Gen. Patterson, Martinsburg, Va.:
The author of the following is known, and he believes it authentic:
Washington, July 9,1861.
The plan of operations of the secession army in Virginia contemplates the reverse of the proceedings and movements announced in the Express of yesterday and Saturday. A schedule that has come to light meditates a stand and an engagement by Johnston when he shall have drawn Patterson sufficiently far hack from the river to render impossible his retreat across it on being vanquished, and an advance then by Johnston and Wise conjointly upon McClellan, and after the conquest of him, a march in this direction, to unite in one attack upon the Federal forces across the Potomac with the army under Beauregard at Manassas Junction and the wing of that army, the South Carolina regiments chiefly, now nine miles from Alexandria. Success in each of these three several movements is anticipated, and thereby not only the possession of the capital is thought to he assured, hut an advance of the Federal troops upon Richmond prevented.
The plan supposes that this success will give the Confederate cause such prestige and inspire in it such faith as will insure the recognition of its Government abroad, and at the same time so impair confidence in the Federal Government as to render it impossible for it to procure loans abroad, and very difficult for it to raise means at home.
Real retreats, which have been anticipated, it will be seen, are by this plan altogether ignored. According to it, fighting and conquest are the orders.

I cannot now bring from Hagerstown, with present means of transportation, an ample supply of provisions for active operations. I can from Harper’s Ferry. I send to Hagerstown an officer to commence to-day the transfer, if assent be given, and I wish an answer to-day. Defeat here is ruin everywhere. I consider a regiment of regulars, and more, if possible, essential to give steadiness to my column and to carry on active operations against a determined opposition, and I urge that my three-months’ volunteers be replaced by three-years’ men. Many of them are barefooted and cannot be employed for active service. They can be made useful until their term expires for this transfer of depot. Many three-months’ men refuse to renew their service. The enemy have retired beyond Winchester, and are said to be fortifying.

Washington, July 12,1861—1.30 p. m.
Major-General Patterson :
Go where you propose in your letter of the 9th instant. Should that movement cause the enemy to retreat upon Manassas via Strasburg, to follow him would seem at this distance hazardous, whereas the route from Charlestown, via Key’s Ferry, Hillsborough, and Leesburg, towards Alexandria, with the use of the canal on the other side of the river for heavy transportation, may be practicable. Consider this suggestion well, and, except in an extreme case, do not recross the Potomac with more than a sufficient detachment for your supplies on the canal.
Let me hear of you on Tuesday. Write often when en route.

Martinsburg, July 13,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General :
McClellan’s victory received here with great joy; received without comment from the General-in-Chief. I have given and now give mine. My column must be preserved to insure to the country the fruits of this and other victories, which we hope will follow. My determination is not changed by this news. I would rather lose the chance of accomplishing something brilliant than, by hazarding this column, to destroy the fruits of the campaign to the country by defeat. If wrong, let me be instructed.

Martinsburg, July 13,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Received the announcement of McClellan’s victory with great gratification. His success, however, makes no change in my plans. This force is the keystone of the combined movements, and injury to it would counteract the good effects of all victories elsewhere. Johnston is in position beyond Winchester, to be re-enforced, and his strength doubled just as I would reach him. My position is a strong one, but I must act cautiously whilst preparing to strike.

SIMON CAMERON,

Martinsburg, Va., July 14,1861.
Colonel : I have thus far succeeded in keeping in this vicinity the command under General Johnston, who is now pretending to be engaged in fortifying at Winchester, but prepared to retire beyond striking distance if I should advance far.
To-morrow I advance to Bunker Hill, preparatory to the other movement. If an opportunity offers, I shall attack; but unless I can rout, shall be careful not to set him in full retreat upon Strasburg. I have arranged for the occupation of Harper’s Ferry, opposite which point I have directed provisions to be sent.
Many of the three months’ volunteers are very restless at the prospect of being retained over their time. This fact will cause you to hear from me in the direction of Charlestown. Want of ample transportation for supplies and baggage has prevented my moving earlier in the direction I desired.

To-morrow I move upon Charlestown. A reconnaissance shows the Winchester road blocked by fallen trees and fences placed across it, indicating no confidence in the large force now said to be at Winchester.

I send you a sketch,* prepared by Captain Simpson, of the works said to have been erected in the vicinity of Winchester.
I shall (preparations already commenced) hold and occupy Harper’s Ferry with the three years’ troops. If the General-in-Chief desires to retain that place (and I advise it never to be evacuated), I desire to be informed at once by telegraph.
I have to report that the term of service of a very large portion of this force will expire in a few days. From an undercurrent expression of feeling I am confident that many will be inclined to lay down their arms the day the term expires. With such a feeling existing any active operations towards Winchester cannot be thought of until they are replaced by three years’ men. Those whose terms will expire this week I shall arrange to send off by Harper’s Ferry—those for Philadelphia via Baltimore and those for Harrisburg via Hagerstown.
If Harper’s Ferry is to be held, after securing that I shall, if the General-in-Chief desires, advance with the remainder of the troops via Leesburg, provided the force under Johnston does not remain at Winchester, after the success which I anticipate from General McDowell. I wish to be advised if these propositions meet with the approval of the General-in-Chief.
The Wisconsin regiments are without arms and accouterments, which I have directed the commander of Frankford Arsenal to provide. Telegrams will reach me via Hagerstown and also via Point of Rocks.

I wrote yesterday on this subject, and now wish to be informed of the intention of the General-in-Chief. My march to-day was without opposition or incident of importance.

The time of volunteers counts from the day of muster into the service of the United States. You must not retreat across the Potomac. If necessary, when abandoned by the short-term volunteers, intrench somewhere and wait for re-enforcements.

without immediate increase of force to replace them. They will not remain.
I have ordered the brigades to assemble this afternoon, and shall make a personal appeal to the troops to stay a few days until I can be re-enforced. Many of the regiments are without shoes) the Government refuses to furnish them; the men have received no pay, and neither officers nor soldiers have money to purchase with. Under these circumstances, I cannot ask or expect the three months’ volunteers to stay longer than one week. Two companies of Pennsylvania volunteers were discharged to day and ordered home. I to-day place additional force at Harper’s Ferry, and establish communication with Maryland.
I send Captain Newton to prepare for its defense.
E. PATTEESON, Major-General, Commanding.
(Eepeated same day.)
Charlestown, Ya., July 18, 1861.
Colonel: I arrived at this place on the 17th instant. Nothing of importance occurred on the march. The principal inhabitants left some ten days since, anticipating its occupation by the Federal troops. It was till our arrival the location of a band of secession militia, engaged in pressing into service the young men of the country.
I have to acknowledge the receipt of two telegrams from the General-in-Chief of the 17th and 18th instants, both looking to a movement and attack upon Winchester. A state of affairs existed which the General-in-Chief is not aware of, though in some respects anticipated by his instructions that if I found the enemy too strong to attack, to threaten and make demonstrations to retain him at Winchester. I more than carried out the wishes of the General-in-Chief in this respect.
Before I left Martinsburg I was informed of a large increase to Johnston’s command, and the visit to Winchester of the leading members of the Confederate Army. Just before General McDowell was to strike I advanced to Bunker Hill, causing surprise, and, I have since learned, an additional increase of force.
On Tuesday I sent out a reconnoitering party toward Winchester. It drove in the enemy’s pickets, and caused the army to be formed in line of battle, anticipating an attack from my main force. This party found the road barricaded and blocked by fallen trees. The following day I left for this place.
Before marching from Martinsburg I heard of the mutterings of many of the volunteer regiments, and their expressed determination not to serve one hour after their term of service should expire. I anticipated a better expression of opinion as we approached the enemy, and hoped to hear of a willingness to remain a week or ten days. I was disappointed, and when I prepared for a movement to the front, by an order for the men to carry two days’ provisions in their haversacks, I was assailed by earnest remonstrances against being detained over their time—complaints from officers of want of shoes and other clothing—all throwing obstacles in the way of active operations. Indeed, I found I should, if I took Winchester, be without men, and be forced to retreat, and thus lose the fruits of victory. Under the circumstances neither I nor those on whom I could rely could advance with any confidence. I am, therefore, now here with a force which will be dwindling away very rapidly. I to-day appealed almost in vain to the regiments

to stand by the country for a week or ten days. The men are longing for their homes, and nothing can detain them.
I sent Captain Newton to-day to Harper’s Ferry to arrange for defense and re-establish communication with Maryland; also, the Massachusetts regiment. The Third Wisconsin will soon be there. Lieutenant Babcock has been at Sandy Hook several days, trying to get the canal in operation, preparing the entrance to ford, putting in operation a ferry, and reconstructing the bridge. Depots for all supplies will soon be established, and then I shall cause to be turned in the camp equipage, &c., of the regiments, and to that place I shall withdraw if I find my force so small as to render my present position unsafe. I cannot intrench sufficiently to defend this place against a large force.
I shall direct the regiments to be sent to Harrisburg and Philadelphia to be mustered out by Captain Hastings, Major Ruff, and Captain Wharton.

Almost all the three-months’ volunteers refuse to serve an hour over their term, and except three regiments which will stay ten days the most of them are without shoes and without pants. I am compelled to send them home, many of them at once. Some go to Harrisburg, some to Philadelphia, one to Indiana, and if not otherwise directed by telegraph, I shall send them to the place of muster, to which I request rolls may be sent, and Captain Hastings, Major Ruff, and Captain Wharton ordered to muster them out.

Colonel: In reply to your communication of yesterday* the commanding general directs me to say that there is no intention or desire to retain the regiment beyond their term of service against the will of the members. He, however, earnestly desires and appeals to the regiment to remain a short time over its term, to enable him to relieve it without the great injury to the service resulting from the loss of a large and valuable portion of this command. The sudden depletion of this force jeopardizes its safety and the interest of the country, which your regiment came out to defend, and have nobly sustained. In his appeal now to the brave he feels that sacrifices will be made till this place can be safely held and this force not be compelled to retire. Be-enforcements are promised and daily expected, and as rapidly as he can relieve every regiment which desires to go he will do so. He knows, too, that as long as danger threatens the regiment will not leave. Can you give him assurances they will remain till he can safely relieve them, which he thinks cannot exceed ten days, and may be much less ?

While awaiting the arrival of General Banks, who is addressed as commanding here, I have carefully considered the telegram of 11.30 p. in. of 23d from the General-in-Chief to him, and the course to be followed. Winchester is now occupied by about three thousand men. It is true they are militia; more in number than the effective men at my disposal. Three-years7 men only reliable. A proper force to take it now would strip the supplies here and at Sandy Hook of reliable protection. I consider the occupation of Harper's Ferry with the small force here as hazardous, and as untenable against a formidable force with less than 20,000 men. The number now here is too small to hold Harper’s Ferry, and too large to retreat with if forced to evacuate. No re-enforcements heard of, and regiments going off at the rate of two to four per day.

General Orders, \	Hdqrs. Dep’t of the Shenandoah,
No. 34.	j	Harper’s Ferry, Va., July 25,1861.
By virtue of orders received from the War Department, Maj. Gen. N. P. Banks hereby assumes command of this department.
By order of General Banks :
EOBT. WILLIAMS,
Assistant Adjutant- General.
Philadelphia, Pa., November 1,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington :
Sir : Believing to the present moment that, on account of other persons, a public examination into the maimer in which the affairs of the Department of Pennsylvania while under my command were conducted, and that the publication of the correspondence with and orders to me of the General-in-Chief, especially connected with the late campaign in Maryland and Virginia, might be detrimental to the interests of the service, I have refrained from asking for an investigation or permission to publish the orders by which I was controlled. The same reason has caused me studiously to avoid verbal statements on the subject in reply to numerous inquiries.
Charges have been publicly made through the press and the impression created that the design of the campaign was not carried out by me, but rather deranged by my neglect or violation of orders. Intimations against my loyalty have been insidiously circulated. From the silence of my immediate commander I infer he does not design to relieve me from the odium attached to these reports and rumors. While I am willing, if the general good demand it, to suffer personally, and am desirous that no course on my part shall prove injurious to public interest, yet I believe the time has arrived when the question as to the manner in which I executed the duties intrusted to me may be safely investigated, so that the failure to accomplish certain results never anticipated of my command by the General-in-Chief, until he saw his defeat, may be ascribed to the real cause. Further silence, therefore, on my part would confirm the impression that I plead guilty to the charges that have been made against my honor, my loyalty, and my military capacity. I have a right at least to be relieved from the position in which my long silence, caused solely by an earnest desire for the success of our cause, has left me.
In presenting this my application for a court of inquiry, or permission to publish, my correspondence with the General-in-Chief, I claim and am ready to substantiate—
1st. That if the General-in-Chief ever designed my command to enter upon the soil of Virginia with prospects of success, he destroyed my power when greatest, and when that of the enemy was weakest, by recalling to Washington, after they had crossed the Potomac, all my regular troops, with the Ehode Island regiment and battery, leaving me but a single company of cavalry, which had not then been one month in service, and entirely destitute of artillery.
2d. That the General-in-Chief forbade my advance, and compelled me to recall to Maryland all the troops which, confident of success, had crossed the Potomac into Virginia in execution of a plan which had been submitted to him and had received his cordial approbation.
3d. That for a long time the General-in-Chief kept my command in a crippled condition, and demanded my advance after he had withdrawn

[Chap. IX
from me all my available artillery, and only after the enemy had had time to become vastly my superior in artillery, infantry, and cavalry, and was intrenched. In answer to my earnest appeals he re-enforced me only after the occasion for employing re-enforcements had passed
away.
4th. That if the General-in-Chief designed me to do more than threa ten the enemy at Winchester, he did not divulge his wish.
5th. That if the General-in-Chief expected me to follow to Manassas u close upon the heels of Johnston,77 he expected a physical impossibility; the enemy moving part of the way by rail from an intermediate point, while our army was on foot, entering an enetny7s country, and guarding a heavy train and a depot retained by him in an improper place.
0th. The General-in-Chief forbade pursuit of the enemy in the event that he should retire towards Manassas, fearing to press him on Washington.
7th. That I was informed by the General-in-Chief the attack on Manassas would be made on Tuesday, the 16th of July, instead of Sunday, the 21st; at which time he directed me to make such a demonstration upon Winchester as to keep the enemy at that place. I claim that the demonstration was made on that day, and that he did not avail himself of the fruits of that movement, as he had expected to do. All that was demanded of me, and more, was effected.
8th. That if the army I had commanded had attacked Winchester on Tuesday, the 16th of July, as it has since been alleged I was ordered to-do, two armies, instead of one, would have been demoralized, and the enemy would have turned with all the flush of victory to a triumph in front of Washington.
9th. That I have suffered additional injustice at the hands of the General-in-Chief, who sanctioned and fixed the impression that the enemy at Winchester was inferior to me in force in every arm of service, and yet has not corrected that report, although he knew two days after the battle of Bull Run that siege artillery heavier than mine, and three times as numerous, had been left by the enemy at Winchester,, while a greater number of guns had been carried away.
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

November, which contains a request for an inquiry into the late campaign in Virginia, in which you commanded a part of the United States forces. Your letter did not reach me until my return to this city, and subsequent to the departure of Lieutenant-General Scott to Europe.
There appears to be no precedent in our service for an investigation or trial of an officer’s conduct after he has received an honorable dis-eharge. The inquiry you desire to have instituted would equally concern the late General-in-Chief, and as it appears to me, injustice to him, should not be made in his absence. The respect I have always entertained for you, as well as the friendly relations which have long existed between us, would claim for any personal request from you the most prompt and favorable attention ; but in my public capacity, in the present condition of affairs, I cannot convince myself that my duty to the Government and to the country would justify me in acceding to your request. I must, therefore, reluctantly decline the* appointment of a court of inquiry at this time.
With much respect, your obedient servant,

Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested, if not incompatible with the public interest, to furnish the Senate with copies of the correspondence between Lieutenant-General Scott and Major-General Patterson, and with all orders from the former to the latter, from the 16th day of April, 1861, to the 25th day of July, inclusive.

Sir: In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 17th instant, I have the honor to transmit herewith a report of the Adjutant-General, from which it will be perceived that it is not deemed compatible with the public interest at this time to furnish the correspondence between Generals Scott and Patterson, as called for.

New York, March 31,1862.
To the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War:
On the statement of Major-General Patterson, submitted by him as evidence to the honorable the Committee of the House of Representatives on the Conduct of the War, I beg leave to remark—
1.	That his statement, 148 long pages, closely and indistinctly written, has been before me about forty-eight hours, including a Sunday when I was too much indisposed to work or to go to church; that I cannot write or read at night, nor at any time except by short efforts, and that I have been entirely without help.
2.	That, consequently, I have read but little of the statement and voluminous documents appended, and have but about two hours left for comments on that little.
3.	The documents (mainly correspondence between General Patterson and myself) are badly copied, being hardly intelligible in some places from the omission and change of words.
4.	General Patterson was never ordered by me, as he seems to allege, to attack the enemy without a probability of success, but on several occasions he wrote as if he were assured of victory. For example, June 12 he says he is u resolved to conquer, and will risk nothing ;” and July 4, expecting supplies the next day, he adds, as soon as they u arrive I shall advance to Winchester, to drive the enemy from that place.’7 Accordingly, he issued orders for the movement on the 8th ; next called a council of war, and stood fast at Martinsburg.
5.	But although General Patterson was never specifically ordered to attack the enemy, he was certainly told and expected, even if with inferior numbers, to hold the rebel army in his front on the alert, and to prevent it from re-enforcing Manassas Junction by means of threatening maneuvers and demonstrations—results often obtained in war with half numbers.
6.	After a time General P. moved upon Bunker Hill, and then fell off upon Charlestown, whence he seems to have made no other demonstration that did not look like a retreat out of Virginia. From that movement Johnston was at liberty to join Beauregard with any part of the army of Winchester.
7.	General P. alludes with feeling to my recall from him back to Washington, after the enemy had evacuated Harper’s Ferry, of certain troops sent to enable him to take that place; but the recall was necessary to prevent the Government and capital from falling into the enemy’s hands. His inactivity, however, from that cause need not have been more than temporary, for he was soon re-enforced up to at least the enemy’s maximum number in the Winchester Valley, without leading to a battle or even a reconnaissance in force.
8.	He also often called for batteries and rifled cannon beyond our capacity to supply at the moment, and so in respect to regular troops, one or more regiments. He might as well have asked for a brigade of elephants. Till some time later we had for the defense of the Government in its capital but a few companies of regular foot and horse, and not half the number of troops, including all descriptions, if the enemy had chosen to attack us.
9.	As connected with this subject, I hope I may be permitted to notice the charge made against me on the floors of Congress, that I did not stop Brigadier-General McDowell’s movement upon Manassas Junction after I had been informed of the re-enforcement sent thither from Winchester, though urged to do so by one or more members of the Cabinet*

Now, it was at the reception of that news too late to call off the troops from the attack, and, besides, though opposed to the movement at first, we had all become animated and sanguine of success, and it is not true that I was urged by anybody in authority to stop the attack, which was commenced as early, I think, as the 18th of July.
10. I have but time to say that among the disadvantages under which I have been writing are these: I have not had within reach one of my own papers and not an officer who was with me at the period in question.

Report of Capt. James H. Simpson, U. S. Topographical Engineers.

Martinshurg, Fa., July 4, 1861.
Major : I have to report that the column under General Patterson crossed the Potomac from Williamsport into Virginia on the morning of the 2d, and encamped the same night at Hainesville, on Hoke’s Bun, twelve miles distant. The main column, under General Patterson, consisting of probably three-fourths of the command, took the most direct route. The balance of the command, under the command of General Negley, and which I accompanied, took a more circuitous route, the object being to sweep the whole country. We met the enemy on both routes, but they could not withstand the force of our array, and, after exchanging some shots, fled precipitately. The next morning we started for this city, which we reached yesterday before noon, our entry being of the most gallant character, and the citizens generally receiving us with cheers of gratulations and sweet smiles of approbation. The enemy in a small body is posted, or were yesterday, about two and one-half miles from us on the Winchester road, but they will not be permitted to remain there long. To-day our train has gone to Williamsport to obtain supplies. The main body of the enemy is represented as being intrenched about seven miles from us on the Winchester road. They are variously estimated by the citizens of the country from 7,000 to 20,000 strong. We probably are about 10,000 strong.

onel Abercrombie, in command of the leading brigade, was met by the enemy, who had taken a position in a body of timber, and opposed his advance with much determination, using both artillery and infantry. My brigade being the next, I brought it into line on the left of the road, one section of Perkins’ Battery being thrown forward, supported by the Twenty-third Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers (Colonel Dare), completely outflanking the enemy’s right. After a few discharges from the artillery the enemy retreated, hotly pursued both by Abercrombie’s Brigade on the right of the road, and mine on the left, for more than three miles. The Twenty-first Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers (Colonel Ballier) deployed as skirmishers, supported by the Sixth, Colonel Nagle, passed over their camp, which had been abandoned in much disorder and haste.
The artillery, supported by the Twenty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers, advanced along the road, until halted by the general’s orders, and my brigade went into camp upon part of the ground previously occupied by the enemy on Hoke’s Run. Two companies of the Second Cavalry, Captains Whiting and Royall, were held in reserve, as I hoped that I might have an opportunity of charging the enemy after the retreat commenced ; but no such opportunity was offered, on account of the broken and wooded nature of the country over which we had to operate.
There were no casualties in my brigade. One hundred and fifty tents were found in the enemy’s camps and destroyed; also a large quantity of forage, as we had no means of transporting either. It gives me much pleasure to say that the troops behaved with the utmost coolness and precision during the engagement. I herewith submit reports of Captains Perkins and Hudson, in command of separate sections of artillery.

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of my operations in the affair of the 2d instant. My battery of light artillery, Company F, of the Fourth Regiment, IT. S. Army, having been assigned by sections to the different columns, I remained with the center section (Lieutenant Martin’s), composed of two 6-pounder guns. A few miles after crossing the Potomac firing commenced on the right, with Colonel Abercrombie’s brigade, and by direction of Col. George H. Thomas, commanding brigade to which I had been assigned, I proceeded as rapidly as possible to the front, and took position in a wheat field on the left of the main road. Here, not finding any occasion to place my guns in battery, I passed on, inclining to the right through several fields, up to a thick wood, which afforded cover for a body of the enemy’s skirmishers. With the assistance of Colonel Dare and Colonel Ballier, commanding regiments, in support, this place was soon cleared, and I moved along the edge of the wood, when, by direction of Colonel Thomas, who vis-

itecl my section at that time, I struck into the main road, and continued in it thereafter.
A quarter of a mile beyond the point where I entered the road, I was informed at a farm-house that a considerable force of the rebels had passed about ten minutes before. Striking into a gallop, I took my section as far ahead of its support as I dared, and halted until I could get sight of its approach. Immediately I was visited by two officers of the enemy. I went out to meet them. We brought our horses together, and shook hands quite cordially, when they asked me what company I belonged to and how far u the boys ” were behind. I answered so as to allay any suspicion they might have that I was not one of their own party, and endeavored to detain them, for neither I nor my section were provided with small-arms. At first they appeared satisfied that my pieces formed a part of their own flying artillery. Suddenly they somehow discovered their error, and, bending, over their horses’ necks, ran away at the utmost speed. As soon as could be done in a narrow road, I put my pieces in battery and discharged some canister then some spherical case-shot, at them and their retreating friends, with what effect I do not know. I then returned to camp.

Sir : I have the honor to transmit to you the reports of the First Regiment Wisconsin Yolunteers, Col. John C. Starkweather, and the Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Yolunteers, Col. P. Jarrett, received through Col. J. J. Abercrombie, officer commanding Sixth Brigade, Second Division, U. S. Army. The details are given so clearly, it is not necessary to dilate upon that subject.
The enemy had the advantage of position and local information. Posted so as to command the approach of the brigade under Colonel Abercrombie, they opened fire near Hoke’s Run, beyond Falling Waters, six miles from Williamsport, Md. The Wisconsin regiment, in the advance, promptly responded to the attack, supported by the Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Yolunteers, until Captain Perkins’ battery was placed in position. When united, a galling fire was opened upon them. Captain McMullin’s Rangers, the First City Troop, Captain James, and Colonel Thomas’ command maintained a position under fire with great firmness.
Col. J. J. Abercrombie, commanding the brigade, deserves great credit for the skill and the masterly manner in which he handled the troops. I beg you will report him favorably to the War Department. The presence of the commanding general, Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson, and staff, was of essential service. It infused life and spirit into the different commands. With the eye of the commander upon them, they acted bravely and with great steadiness, considering the short time of service and with inexperienced volunteers.

Dear Sir : I have the honor of reporting for your information and that of the War Department, that on the 2d day of July, 1861, when en route for Martinsburg, within a short distance of Hoke’s Bun, at about 10 o’clock a. m. of that day, First Regiment WisconsmTolunteers being in advance of the column’s main body, I detailed Company B, Capt. H. A. Mitchell, to deploy to the right and left of the road as skirmishers in advance of the column, being sustained on the road by the cavalry. After such deployment had been made and an advance forward of about a quarter of a mile, firing was heard in continued long volleys from a large body of the enemy’s troops, which was well replied to by Company B and McMullin’s Bangers. The strength of the enemy being too great, however, for the skirmishers engaged, I deployed Company A, Capt. George B. Bingham, to their assistance, and kept them all in position, doing great execution, until ordered, to fall back slowly, so as to allow the artillery to work more effectually, who

had in the mean time been placed in position on the right. The companies rallied upon the center, and fell back slowly and in perfect order, keeping up their firing upon the enemy, and after reaching the head of column I deployed the whole right wing, Companies A, B, C, D, and E, assisted by Company F, of left wing, upon the enemy’s left front as skirmishers, sending at the same time the balance of the regiment by companies to the front by the road. The skirmishers, sustained by the left four companies, turned the right flank of the enemy, and with the assistance of the artillery, drove the enemy’s right flank in, and routed them from the woods. The whole regiment was then rallied on the color company, and deployed immediately to the front and in Advance of the column as skirmishers, sustaining such position until a halt was made by the whole column. My regiment was most handsomely sustained in the outset by the artillery and Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiment Volunteers, Colonel Jarrett, and afterwards by them and other troops in the column.
The field officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, Major Lane, and Adjutant Poole, are entitled from me to great praise for their promptness and great efficiency in the skirmish. Officers and men all behaved with the utmost bravery, and are entitled to great credit as raw troops.
The casualties consist in the death of Private George Drake, of Company A; Sergeant W. M. Graham, Company B, dangerously wounded, being shot in three separate places$ Color Sergeant Fred. Hutching, wounded in the leg, belongs to Company E, color company$ Privates William Matthews, P. O.

The regiment being formed in the woods to the right of the turnpike, I detached Companies A, B, and C as skirmishers, with a view of outflanking the enemy, whose cavalry were making a demonstration in that direction, and moved forward, maintaining a fire against the enemy, who retired as I advanced until I reached the point where I rejoined the left of the regiment. The loss in this part of the command was one wounded.
At the same time the remainder of the regiment, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Coulter, was advanced by him in line (Companies D and E being extended upon the right as skirmishers), with a view of turning the enemy’s guns upon the road. In this manner he moved forward upon the open ground for about one mile, keeping up a very brisk fire with the enemy until the woods to the right of their guns were

Then, closing in my line, I reunited the regiment, and there being no occasion for further operations in that direction, rejoined the remainder of the brigade upon the road.

Camp near Martinsburg, Virginia, July 4,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report the operations of the first section, one 12-pounder howitzer and one 6-pounder gun, of Light Company F, Fourth Artillery, under my command on the 2d instant.
The section was attached to Colonel Abercrombie’s brigade, and crossed the Potomac in rear of the advanced infantry about 4.15 a. m. (After proceeding some four miles along the road, the infantry being deployed to the right and left, a sharp fire opened upon our right wing from a thick wood. I brought my pieces into battery on high ground to the right of the road, and threw a few rounds of shell and shrapnel into the edge of the wood and at a house near by, from the garden of which some of the rebel fire seemed to proceed. The infantry were at the same time pouring a well-sustained fire into the wood, from which the enemy soon retreated. My section then advanced with the brigade, and was placed in position at several commanding points on either side k of the road. Nothing, however, occurred until in the immediate neighborhood of Hainesville. I was advancing on a narrow part of the road in column of pieces, when a company of some seventy-five of the rebels, whom I, from their gray uniform, at first took for Wisconsin troops, opened a very hot fire at the distance of some three hundred yards. I brought my howitzer into battery, and dispersed them with a single canister. At that moment two guns opened fire upon me from a point beyond and some distance to the left.
By this time my 6-pounder was ready for action, and two or three rounds from each piece silenced the fire of the rebel battery. After advancing a short distance beyond the village I was directed to halt, as already the place selected for camp was passed.
During the whole day, the First City Troop, Captain James, accompanied, supported, and protected my section.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient, servant,

Darkesville, July 3,1861.
Colonel : About 7J a. m. yesterday I received a note at Camp Stephens from Lieut. Col. J. E. B. Stuart, of the Virginia Cavalry, to the effect that the Federal troops were four and one-half miles in advance. Having received instructions from you not to fall back unless the enemy were in force, but having assured myself of his being in force to retire under cover of our cavalry, I immediately ordered forward Colonel Har-per’s regiment and Captain Pendleton’s battery, and gave the necessary instructions for moving the baggage to the rear should it be necessary, and for advancing other regiments should it be desirable; Colonel Gordon being instructed to guard the baggage. After advancing a short distance I left three pieces of the battery. On reaching the vicinity of Falling Waters I found Federal troops in the position indicated by Colonel Stuart. I directed Colonel Harper to deploy two of his companies* under command of Major Baylor, to the right. The enemy soon advanced, also deployed, and opened their fire, which was returned by our skirmishers with such effect as to force those of the enemy back on their reserve. From a house and barn which we took possession of an apparently deadly fire was poured on the advancing foe until our position was being turned, when, in obedience to my instructions, Colonel Harper gradually fell back. Soon the enemy opened with his artillery, which Captain Pendleton, after occupying a good position in rear and waiting until the advance sufficiently crowded the road in front, replied to with a solid shot, which entirely cleared the road in front.
Having ordered the quartermaster, Maj. John A. Harman, to move the baggage to the rear, as I had satisfied myself that the enemy were in force, and that my orders required me to retire, I continued to fall

back, checking the Federal forces, who were advancing through the fields in line and through the woods as skirmishers, endeavoring to outflank me, by means of our deployed troops and an occasional fire from the gun. Colonel Allen’s regiment, and also Colonel Preston’s, in obedience to orders from me, advanced to support Colonel Harper, if necessary, and once Colonel Allen’s took a position for the purpose of checking the advance, but it was not brought into action, as my purposes were accomplished without it.
Previous to my arrival at the position where the skirmishing commenced, Colonel Stuart, leaving Captain White with his company to watch the enemy, had with the rest of his command moved forward for the purpose of turning the right flank of the enemy, and if practicable capturing his advance. Fearing lest Colonel Stuart should be cut off, I sent a message to him that I would make a stand about one and a half miles in advance of Martinsburg, where I requested him to join me. Soon after I had posted my infantry and artillery Colonel Stuart joined me. The enemy halted at Camp Stephens for the night. Leaving Colonel Stuart in advance of Martinsburg, I encamped two and a half miles this side, at Big Spring, where I remained until I received your order this morning to join you at this place. Only one regiment and one piece of artillery of my command were brought into action.
Colonel Harper reports:
I carried but three hundred and eighty men of my regiment into the fight, of whom eleven are wounded and nine are missing; several are believed to have been left dead upon the ground. The enemy’s loss was much greater. One of my skirmishing companies, in its advance upon the orchard upon the left of the road, found eight dead bodies of the enemy. The fire upon the advancing line of the enemy in our front was also quite effective. A field officer was seen to fall from his horse, and one of my field officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Harman, in charge of the companies at the house and barn, reports that he saw as many as fourteen men carried to the rear in blankets.
Colonel Stuart reports his capture of an entire company (the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers), with the exception of the captain. Three, resisting, were killed. He further reports that u one of the enemy was killed by a negro of Captain Carter’s and one of Captain Patrick’s company.” The following is his list of prisoners: Forty-three privates, Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers; one second lieutenant, one surgeon, one (position not known), but all of the Fifteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers ; one private First Wisconsin Volunteers ; two privates Second IX. S. Cavalry, mounted and equipped ; making a total of forty-nine. He reports one wounded and two missing. The enemy, he states, entered Martinsburg at 12 m. to-day.
Colonel Stuart and his command merit high praise, and I may here remark that he has exhibited those qualities which are calculated to make him eminent in his arm of the service. He speaks of Messrs. Swan and Brien, citizens of Maryland, deserving, as usual, great credit.
Among the reasons which induced me to advance on the enemy may be mentioned a desire to capture him should his strength not exceed a few hundred, and should he appear in force, to hold him in check until the baggage wagons should be loaded and move in column to the rear. Great credit is due to the officers and men for the admirable manner in which they discharged their respective duties.

Report of Capt 8. W. Fisk, Crescent Rifles, transmitted by Major Rightor and Brigadier-General Magruder, C. 8. Army.
Young5s Mills, Va., July 5,1861.
Sir: A detachment of men, consisting of one hundred infantry, one howitzer, and about fifteen or twenty cavalry, left last night, about midnight, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux. We advanced in the direction of Newport News, and took post in the woods, near Curtis5 farm, near the road, as shown in diagram annexed.* We were ordered to lie in ambush. The vedettes soon after came in and announced the approach of a body of cavalry one hundred strong. Colonel Dreux5s orders were that they should closely conceal their persons and weapons, and permit the enemy to cross the road on our left and somewhat beyond the left of our line, and that no one should fire before he himself should give the order, after they had advanced, as above. A few of our infantry scouts had previously been sent into the woods, on our left, to observe the approach of the enemy and ascertain if they were enemies. In a few moments after sending out the scouts, Colonel D. said, “They are coming!55 addressing me. Whereupon I took my post a few paces from him, on his right, but not a word was said by him to intimate that he expected the approach of any but cavalry. Notwithstanding Colonel Dreux5s and my own positive order to the men not to fire, one or two shots having been exchanged between the scouts and the enemy, several of the men on the left began also to fire. Yery soon after I was informed that Colonel Dreux was wounded. This was about half an hour after daybreak. Being obliged to direct my attenton to our line of infantry, and still, according to the information I had received from Colonel D., of expecting cavalry, I pursued or carried out his original intention, and, in obedience to his order, not to give the command to fire until their column had passed in front of us. This was, however, but for a moment, and their column not passing our front, as expected, and the enemy being scarcely recognizable, except by the occasional flash of their arms when discharged, finding that they still remained on our left, in order to face towards them and enable us to charge, I gave the order, u Left into line, wheel,55 which, as far as I could observe, was well and promptly executed. When we wheeled into the road the enemy had disappeared or fled. About the time that this movement was executed the horses attached to the howitzer, being said to have taken fright, ran oif with the gun with great violence down the road, creating considerable confusion on our right, which was soon, however, remedied. Having remained near the scene of action long enough to bring off our wounded, we retired in good order, no possibility of carrying out the surprise originally intended by Colonel Dreux longer

existing, and being in the neighborhood of the large forces of the enemy, from whom they could readily be re-enforced.
I regret deeply to report the death of our gallant and able commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux, and of Private Stephen Hackett, of the Shreveport Grays. In addition, I report Private Buford, of the Crescent Rifles, slightly wounded in the head. Our position in ambush, and the sudden disappearance of the enemy, made it impossible for me to estimate the numbers of the latter with any approach to accuracy.
Both officers and men of the infantry, upon whom my attention was almost entirely bestowed for the two or three moments during which the command devolved on me, behaved with coolness. Three of the enemy are believed to be killed or wounded.

Brig. Gen. J. B. Magruder:
. Sir: I have received your dispatch, and in conformity with your instructions I send you the above detailed account of the affair, drawn up by Captain Fisk, of the Crescent Rifles. The bodies of the deceased are laid out in a little church near this place. Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux fell last evening about 10 o’clock, leaving me in command of the battalion. Please send me full instructions, and let me know whether the cavalry force stationed here is under my command. I have not the remotest idea of their whereabouts at this moment, and, in case of necessity, I have no means of dispatching you a courier.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
N. H. RIGHTOR,
Major, Commanding Louisiana Battalion.
Respectfully referred to Major-General Lee, commanding, with the following remarks:
Sir : I had left Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux in command at Lowery’s Mill on the morning before the skirmish, and had myself gone with a larger force to the York road, as the enemy had crossed Hampton Creek. Late that night I learned, for the first time, at Bartlett’s, of the expedition, and the next morning of the death of its gallant leader. I since ascertained that the whole of the enemy’s force was about four hundred. The enemy fled. Our men occupied the field, and very deliberately took off their killed and wounded. A war steamer, in the afternoon, came up the river and threw shells into the wood where the affair happened.*

on the Warwick road, below Smith’s, and the occasion of the running off of the howitzer gun.
On the evening of July 4,1 rode down from Young’s house (where you had stationed me to superintend the erection of breastworks) to Young’s Mills, and proposed to Colonel Dreux that we should make a trip with one howitzer and one hundred of his men and twenty horsemen to the point where the skirmish took place. We (the whole force detailed) arrived there about daybreak, or a little before, and were placed on the left of the road, in ambush, my howitzer on the left of the line. Soon after we arrived our guide (a Mr. Fitchett), who had ridden some distance down the road, returned and reported the approach of the enemy. He could not correctly state how strong they were, but told me that he thought they numbered from two hundred to three hundred and fifty men. Colonel Dreux had given instructions that the enemy should be allowed to advance till his rear passed ‘my howitzer, and that he would give the command when the firing on our side should commence. After waiting more than long enough for the enemy to have gotten up to us, and not understanding why they did not come, Colonel Dreux sent out five men as scouts, to ascertain, if possible, where the enemy was. During the absence of these scouts, Lieutenant Moseley (my first lieutenant) and myself walked into the road, and had not been there five minutes before we saw one of the enemy in advance, coming down the road at a charge bayonet. He had gotten up very close to us when we saw him. We at once jumped into the bushes, and ran to our gun, which was some thirty or forty steps from us. Just as we entered the bushes the man fired, and my impression is that he killed Colonel Dreux, as immediately afterwards I called for Colonel Dreux to know whether I should take the howitzer into the road. The epemy having stopped advancing, and having commenced an oblique fire into the bushes where we were, I could hear nothing from Colonel Dreux, and my howitzer being where it could not be brought into action unless the enemy came in our front, and being anxious to protect my men as much as possible, I gave the order to have the piece limbered up and taken into the road, so that, if we were to receive the fire of the enemy, we might at least be where we could see them, and fire on them, if necessary. My command was obeyed, but just as the howitzer entered the road the horses took fright and started off at full speed up the road. The driver of the horses to the howitzer (who was a volunteer and not accustomed to the team) informs me that he attempted to halt just as he got into the road, and that the dashing by of the troop which accompanied us caused his horses to become unmanageable, and to run off. Boon as I found that the howitzer had run off, I ran through the bushes, to the right of where we were stationed, and jumped into the road to try and stop it. It had gotten ahead of me, and, notwithstanding my running some distance after it, I could not stop it. I then sent my first lieutenant (Moseley) and my sergeant (Gretter) in pursuit of the piece. They soon returned with it. The fight (which lasted only five to ten minutes) was then all over. I then, for the first time, heard that Colonel Dreux was killed. I kept the howitzer in the road, for the purpose (if we could get no other conveyance) of putting on it any dead or wounded we might have. A cart was afterwards brought up, and three or four of my men assisted in putting into it the dead body of Private Hackett, of the Louisiana battalion. I afterwards put Colonel Dreux’s body in the same cart, and we moved off. I would state that the enemy, I am satisfied, did not know of the running off of the howitzer, as there was

no more firing that I heard of after it got into the road. The detachment of the battery which was with the gun stood at their posts, and, had the gun not run off, they would have had it ready for action as soon as it entered the road. This, sir, is my recollection of the affair, and I respectfully submit it to your consideration.
EO. C. STAGED, Captain Third Company of Howitzers.
General J. B. Maoruder.
No. 3.
Report of Capt. William Collins, C. 8. Army.
Camp Hood, Ya., July 7,1861.
Sir: In obedience to an order received from you, I have the honor to report the skirmish of the 5th instant, in which I was engaged, and the circumstances of the retreat of the cavalry under my command.
On the evening of the 4th instant I, in company with Captain Stan-ard, visited the quarters of Colonel Dreux, and informed him that we had received information that a squad or foraging party of the enemy had advanced up as far as Captain Smith’s that day, and that they were in the habit of visiting that point daily, and Colonel Dreux then informed us that he had received the same information, and intended to go out that night and try and capture a party of them, and that he desired that I should accompany him with a detachment of twenty of my command, and that he would also take along Captain Stanard and one of his howitzers, and also a detachment of twenty from four companies of infantry.
About 12 o’clock at night the above force marched from Young’s Mills, under the command Colonel Dreux. We marched down below the farm of Pembroke Jones, and turned in at the house of a man named Curtis, at which place we had expected, from information received, that we would, perhaps, find the squad above spoken of quartered. Pinding no one, we marched back to the main road, from which point Colonel Dreux sent down, in the direction of Newport News, three of my command, in company with a man named Fitchett as guide, to ascertain if there were any troops approaching, at which time Colonel Dreux marched his men up the road, towards Lee’s store, and, after having traveled about a half a mile, we arrived opposite a small woods road, running at right angles into the main road, at which point we were halted. The cavalry was then ordered down this woods road seventy-five yards, and directed to form in column of fours, facing the main road, in readiness to charge. The howitzer was then placed in the same road, about ten paces in front of the cavalry. The infantry was tlfen stationed on the right and left of this road, along the side of the main road. At this time the vedettes, that had been sent down the road towards Newport News, returned and reported that the enemy was approaching, about a mile off, and that they covered a distance of two hundred yards of the road, of which he could see, and how much farther their column extended he did not know. Colonel Dreux then sent a detachment of five or six of the infantry down the road to act as scouts, and to conceal themselves in the bushes^ and to report the approach of the enemy 5 and they were ordered to keep themselves concealed, and not to fire until the command was given, at which time the infantry and howitzer would fire simultaneously, immediately after which time the cavalry

was to charge upon them. The first information I received of the approach of the enemy, a gun was fired to our left, on the main road, and was immediately followed by another, and, with a short pause, the firing was again commenced about the same point, which was kept up regularly, the balls cutting around very near myself and men. My men were ordered to stand firm and hold their position. At this time some of the men of Captain Stanard’s command, who were standing firmly at their piece, called out to their captain for orders, to know what they should do. Captain Stanard was at that time just to my right, standing behind a large tree. I then called out to him to go and man his piece, or order his men what to do. I then remarked to the men of my command that I would ride up near the road and know why it was that they did not return the fire of the enemy, as they were then firing upon us on our flank and rear, and, about the time that I arrived near the line of the infantry the command was given by Captain Stanard to limber up the howitzer, at which time it was moved rapidly off, and just at this time three of the enemy presented themselves in the rear of the cavalry, and were fired upon by them, killing two and wounding the third. The cavalry then dashed out in the direction that the howitzer had gone, thinking that it was a signal for a retreat. This was all done in a moment. As soon as I saw they had retreated I rushed into the road, and went in the direction the howitzer and cavalry had gone, calling to the driver of the howitzer to halt his piece. He made no stop. I passed him, and threw myself in front of his horses and halted him. I will here state that the sergeant of the howitzer came rapidly up the road in pursuit of the piece, ordering the driver to carry it back. I accompanied it back down near the scene of action, when I learned that the enemy had fled, and had gotten a considerable distance. As I suppose, they retreated about the time the howitzer was run out. Then, for the first time, I learned that Colonel Dreux had been shot, and that his body was in charge of his men, together with the body of Private Hackett, belonging to the Shreveport Grays. There came up at the same time a private, wounded, whose name I did not know, and he was taken to his camp on the horse of one of the cavalry. I halted my men above Lee’s store, and awaited the bodies of the dead. I then accompanied them to the camp at Young’s Mills, in company with a portion of the howitzers and some of the infantry, where they were put in charge of the commandant of the post.
I dispatched, soon after the engagement, a dragoon to you, to report what had taken place. During the whole of the firing none of the enemy were seen by the cavalry except the three that were shot, and there was not a gun fired after the cavalry left. We were surrounded by a dense thicket, that rendered it impossible for a man mounted to see one on foot until he had approached within a few yards. And, notwithstanding the critical situation in which they were placed, I have the utmost confidence in believing that the cavalry would have belli their position until the last, if they had not believed that the moving of the howitzer was a signal for their retreat. The whole fire of the enemy seemed to be directed at the cavalry, as no shots, so far as I could ascertain, went in the direction of the infantry. I suppose the enemy learned the position of the cavalry from the noise made by their horses. No command was given during the engagement that I heard at all. In going thus into detail I have given, I think, a full and explicit account. All of which is most respectfully submitted.

Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Parkersburg, Va., June 22, 1861.
Colonel : I reached here yesterday morning, hoping to move forward during the day, but was delayed by want of wagons and the disorganization to be expected on the part of new troops moving for the first time into the field. In a few minutes (near 7 a. m.) I shall move with the advance to Clarksburg, taking one regiment of infantry, two detached companies (one of regulars), one battery, and a company of cavalry. Two Indiana regiments will follow during the morning, two Ohio regimen ts to-morrow. No other Ohio regiments will reach Grafton, via Bellaire, to-day. Reports from the front are somewhat contradictory, but agree in representing the enemy in strong force near Piedmont and Beverly. Notwithstanding that General Morris and others seem sure that we have a large force to contend with, I now am inclined to doubt it. I will, without delay, beat them up in their quarters and endeavor to put an end to their attempts in this direction. I have, I think, force enough to fight them wherever I find them.
General McCall telegraphs that Cumberland will be re-enforced on Monday. If that is accomplished, we should be able to cut off the force near Piedmont. As I cannot learn yet the quality of their troops (there are reports that there are some regiments of the regular Confederate troops) I shall be cautious in my movements. I feel very much the absolute necessity of more commissary and quartermaster officers, also of cavalry. I hope the Lieutenant-General will find it in his power to let me have the companies of First Cavalry, now at Leavenworth.
I received on the 18th instant the order adding Missouri to my department. My arrangements for coming here to take command are so far advanced that it was not possible for me to go to Missouri. I shall go there immediately on my return from this State.
I move hence on Clarksburg, and will act there according to the information I receive—either move in force on the rear of the enemy at Beverly or go on to Piedmont.
Excuse, colonel, the hurried nature of this.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel : Having completed as far as possible the necessary arrange ments for transportation, &c., I left Parkersburg' yesterday about 1 p. in. with the Ninth Ohio Regiment; Company I, Fourth Artillery, and the company of Chicago Rifles. I reached here about 2 a. m., having left the Ninth Regiment at Webster. The Eighth and Tenth Indiana, Loomis’ Michigan Battery, and Captain Barker’s company of Illinois cavalry reached Clarksburg to-day. The Third and Fourth Ohio also reached Fetterman to-day. The Seventeenth and Nineteenth Ohio and Howe’s battery will be up to-morrow.
From information I have received I think it more than probable that there are from fifteen hundred to three thousand rebels at Romney, intrenched with a few guns. I think their object is to cover the approaches to Winchester from an apprehended attack in this direction, as well as to cover the operations of guerrilla parties now acting towards Piedmont. It will probably be necessary to break up their establishment when I get through with other more important matters. If General Patterson could furnish the force to do it in the mean time, I think it would be advantageous. Their presence tends to alarm Union men even this far away. I did not find my orders intelligently carried out for the defense of Cheat River, and will go there mysgjf to-morrow to see it properly attended to. It is very important to secure that line.
There is certainly a force of some kind near Huttonsville, with a strong advanced party intrenched near the Laurel Mountain, between Philippi and Beverly. I think that the chief object of this party is to protect and furnish guerrilla parties, which are doing much damage in this region. I am of the opinion that the apprehensions of an attack in force, so constantly and so seriously reported to me that I felt it impossible to disregard them, are not well founded. It is confidently asserted that Georgia and Tennessee troops are among those at the Laurel Hill, but I do not feel certain of it. It seems to be a peculiar characteristic of the information obtained here that it is exceedingly vague and unreliable. I hope to inaugurate a better system.
My presence here was very necessary to reassure the Union men, and even if I find no force able to oppose us, I shall still be certain that it was very necessary for me to be here. As soon as I can get my command well in hand and obtain more reliable information—and I hope this will not occupy more than one or at most two days—I propose moving with all my available force from Clarksburg on Buckhannon, then on Beverly, to turn entirely the detachment at the Laurel Mountain. The troops at Philippi will advance in time to follow up the retreat of the rebels in their front. After occupying Beverly I shall move on Huttonsville, and endeavor to drive them into the mountains, whither I do not propose to follow them, unless under such circumstances as to make success certain. Having driven out the mass of their troops, and having occupied the pass by which they might return, I propose moving small columns through the country to reassure the Union men and break up any scattered parties of armed rebels. As soon as practicable, I intend to clean out the valley of the Kanawha.

To the Inhabitants of Western Virginia:
The army of this department, headed by Virginia troops, is rapidly occupying all Western Virginia. This is done in co operation with, and in support of, such civil authorities of the State as are faithful to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The proclamation issued by me under date of May 26, 1861, will be strictly maintained. Your houses, families, property, and all your rights will be religiously respected ; we are enemies to none but armed rebels and those voluntarily giving them aid. All officers of this army will be held responsible for the most prompt and vigorous action in repressing disorder and punishing aggression by those under their command.
To my great regret I find that enemies of the United States continue to carry on a system of hostilities prohibited by the laws of war among belligerent nations, and of course far more wicked and intolerable when directed against loyal citizens engaged in the defense of the common Government of all. Individuals and marauding parties are pursuing a guerrilla warfare, firing upon sentinels and pickets, burning bridges, insulting, injuring, and even killing citizens because of their Union sentiments, and committing many kindred acts.
I do now, th^efore, make proclamation, and warn all persons that individuals or parties engaged in this species of warfare—irregular in every view which can be taken of it—thus attacking sentries, pickets, or other soldiers, destroying public or private property, or committing injuries against any of the inhabitants because of Union sentiments or conduct, will be dealt with in their persons and property according to the severest rules of military law.
All persons giving information or aid to the public enemies will be arrested and kept in close custody, and all persons found bearing arms, unless of known loyalty, will be arrested and held for examination.

You are here to support the Government of your country, and to protect the lives and liberties of your brethren, threatened by a rebellious and traitorous foe. Ho higher and nobler duty could devolve upon you, and I expect you to bring to its perfor mance the highest and noblest qualities of soldiers—discipline, courage, and mercy. I call upon the officers of every grade to enforce the strictest discipline, and I know that those of all grades, privates and officers, will display in battle cool, heroic courage, and will know how to show mercy to a disarmed enemy.
Bear in mind that you are in the country of friends, not of enemies; that you are here to protect, not to destroy. Take nothing, destroy nothing, unless you are ordered to do so by your general officers. Be-meinber that I have pledged my word to the people of Western Virginia that their rights in person and property shall be respected. I ask every one of you to make good this promise in its broadest sense. We come here to save, not to upturn. I do not appeal to the fear of punishment, but to your appreciation of the sacredness of the cause in which we are engaged. Garry with you into battle the conviction that you are right, and that God is on your side.

Your enemies have violated every moral law; neither God nor man can sustain them. They have, without cause, rebelled against a mild and paternal Government; they have seized upon public and private property; they have outraged the persons of Northern men merely because they came from the North, and of Southern Union men merely because they loved the Union; they have placed themselves beneath contempt, unless they can retrieve some honor on the field of battle. You will pursue a different course. You will be honest, brave, and merciful 5 you will respect the right of private opinion; you will punish no man for opinion’s sake. Show to the world that you differ from our enemies in the points of honor, honesty, and respect for private opinion, and that we inaugurate no reign of terror where we go.
Soldiers! I have heard that there was danger here. I have come to place myself at your head and to share it with you. I fear now but one thing—that you will not find foemen worthy of your steel. I know that I can rely upon you.

General : On receipt of this you will at once assume command of the First and Second Kentucky Begiments and the Twelfth Ohio. Call upon Governor Dennison to supply you with one company of cavalry and six guns. Captain Kingsbury probably has State guns enough to give you.
You will expedite the equipment of those regiments, and move them at once to Gallipolis, via Hamden and Portland, hiring teams for the supplies of the troops between Portland and Gallipolis, sending to the quartermaster in advance to have teams ready. With the regiment first ready to move proceed to Gallipolis and assume command of the Twenty-first. Cross the river and occupy Point Pleasant. With the regiment that next arrives occupy Letart’s Falls, and then move the other two regiments to the mouth of Ten-mile Creek, or the point near there where the road from Letart’s Falls intersects the Kanawha Biver. Place the last regiment in reserve at Point Pleasant, or any proper point in rear of your line of defense. Intrench two guns at Letart’s and four at your advanced position on the Kanawha. Bemain on the defensive, and endeavor to keep the rebels near Charleston until I can cut off their retreat by movement from Beverly. Should you receive certain intelligence that I am hard pressed, seek to relieve me by a rapid advance on Charleston, but place no credit in rumors, for I shall be successful. Use your cavalry as pickets, not exposing them. Punish Bipley, if you can. Bepress any outbreaks that may occur at Guyandotte or Barboursville.
Bemember, my plan is to cut them off, and do all you can to assist that object. Always keep two or three boats on hand. Call on Capt. W. J. Kountz, at Marietta or Bipley, to supply boats from his fleet. If the two companies of Seventeenth Ohio are still at Bavenswood when you reach Gallipolis, order them to rejoin their regiment, via Parkersburg or Webster. Communicate frequently. A telegraph line follows me out.
Yery respectfully, yours,

Buckliannon, Va^July 5,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel : Yon will probably feel as much regret as I do in finding that I am still here. The cause is the difficulty of getting up supplies and arranging transportation. I hope that to-day’s arrivals will enable me to move in the morning. While waiting here I have endeavored to employ our time to advantage.
You will observe that this is the important strategical position in this region. From it I can cover our base of operations and supplies, and move readily by good roads in any desired direction. I have directed the positions on Cheat Eiver at Grafton, Webster, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg to be intrenched, that the necessary garrisons may be reduced as much as possible. The bridges, tunnels, &c., on the two branches of the railroad are' now well guarded. The Cheat Eiver, covering the left of our base, is guarded by eleven companies 5 Grafton, by a regiment; Clarksburg, some eight companies, besides Virginia recruits; Parkersburg, six companies, two regiments of Indiana troops to arrive there to-day, and to be disposable as a reserve where needed. Two other Indiana three-years’ regiments are en route to Bellaire, to be sent wherever needed. Six companies occupy Wirt County Court-House, where Union men have suffered much. Four companies at Eavenswood repulsed O. J. Wise night before last. I hope that he determined to renew the attempt, as in that case he will have been cut off by a column of twelve hundred men under Colonel Norton, that were to reach Eipley from Letart’s at 2 p. m. yesterday. I shall not be surprised to learn before this letter is closed that he is captured. In consequence of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Great Kanawha Valley I have ordered four regiments there, as explained in my instructions to General J. D. Cox, a copy of which has been forwarded to you.
Of the troops composing the active army fifty one companies and one battery are at Philippi, amusing the enemy, who is strongly intrenched with artillery on the Laurel Mountain between that place and Beverly. I have with me here six entire regiments of infantry, six detached companies, two batteries, two companies of cavalry; two more regiments, and some five or six detached companies of infantry will reach here by to-morrow night. The Seventh Ohio occupied Weston some three days since, and four companies of the Seventeenth reached Glenville from Parkersburg yesterday. I ordered strong detachments from these commands to move last night on Bulltown, and break up a large force of armed rebels congregating there. I can, if necessary, have them all back with me by to-morrow night.
I have sent out frequent small parties to break up the collections of rebels. We have them pretty well under now. One of our parties of forty last night broke up two hundred. The morale of our men is excellent—could not be better. It is difficult to get perfectly accurate information, but we are improving in that respect every day. The feeling of the people here is most excellent. We are welcomed wherever our men go. It is wonderful to see how rapidly the minds of many of these people become enlightened when they find we can protect them.
Fear and ignorance combined have made most of the converts to secession; the reverse process is now going on with great rapidity.
I expect to find the enemy in position on Eicli Mountain, just this side of Beverly. I shall, if possible, turn the position to the south, and thus occupy the Beverly road in his rear. If possible I will repeat the maneuver of Cerro Gordo.

Assure the General that no prospect of a brilliant victory shall induce me to depart from my intention of gaining success by maneuvering rather than by fighting. I will not throw these raw men of mine into the teeth of artillery and intrenchments if it is possible to avoid it. Say to the General, too, that I am trying to follow a lesson long ago learned from him; i. e., not to move until I know that everything is ready, and then to move with the utmost rapidity and energy. The delays that I have met with have been irksome to me in the extreme, but I felt that it would be exceedingly foolish to give way to impatience, and advance before everything was prepared. I think the troops are improving decidedly in their performance of guard and outpost duty, and that we are losing nothing in efficiency by the halt at this place.
From all that I learn the enemy is still uncertain as to where the main attack is to be made, and is committing the error of dividing his army in the face of superior forces. If he abandons the position on Laurel Mountain, the troops at Philippi will press him closely. I sholl know to-night with certainty what he has in the pass at Huttonsville. I am told that he has moved all his troops thence towards Beverly. By our present positions we have cut off all his supplies of provisions from this region, so that he must depend almost entirely upon Staunton— a long haul, over a rough mountain road.

Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. (7. :
Colonel : My advance guard, consisting of the Fourth and Mnth Ohio, Loomis’ Michigan battery, and Burdsal’s Ohio dragoons, under the command of Col. E. L. McCook, moves at 4 a. m. to-morrow to seize the Middle Fork Bridge, twelve miles from here. The headquarters will follow as soon as the transportation arrangements can be completed— say by 9 a. m. Two regiments of Bosecrans’ brigade will move in the morning. Another regiment of Sehleich’s brigade would have moved in support of the advance guard but for an unfortunate blunder in sending out a scouting party without my knowledge. This party is in trouble, and I have been obliged to send out a large portion of the Third Ohio to cover its retreat.
I expect to attack the enemy on the 8th or 9th. He is intrenched on Eich Mountain. I have to-day ordered General Morris to advance in the morning from Philippi with his command (sixty-two companies and one battery) to within one and a half miles of the Laurel Mountain, where the enemy is strongly intrenched. His instructions are to observe them closely and to follow rapidly any movement in retreat, but not to attack until he hears that I have carried Beverly.
I have instructed General Cox to occupy Eipley with one regiment, and to move with four on Charleston and the Gauley Bridge, the Eipley regiment supporting the movement. He is to reopen the navigation of the Kanawha, and when Gauley is occupied will open a communication with me via Summersville and Bulltown. Six companies are to occupy California, the county seat of Roane; four to hold Wirt County Court-House; six companies, Glenville; two, Weston; eight, Bulltown; four, Frenchtown; two, French Creek. At least four will hold this place after we advance.
I hope the General-in-Chief will regard these orders as prudent and efficacious. I hope in a few days to occupy all that portion of Western Virginia that is in my department; to restore order; establish the authority of the provisional go vernment, and to quell the secession feeling. I have taken the liberty of going somewhat beyond my department, and have instructed General Cox to occupy Barboursville and Guyan-dotte. If circumstances permit, and the General does not object, I would be glad, after securing all the country north of the Great Kanawha, to move on Wytheville and cut off the railroad communication. I shall soon be prepared to do that or move on Staunton, as the General may direct.
Hoping that my movements may meet his approval, I am, very truly, yours,

Tenth Indiana has moved up in support. Headquarters and four regiments, with one battery and one company of cavalry, move east to-morrow. Supply train now arriving. Three Indiana regiments march to-morrow. Enemy said to be intrenched in force in my front. Cannot rely on reports. Will not learn what I have met until the advance guard comes in contact. I will be prepared to fight whatever is in front of me. One of my parties surprised a party near Weston last night and took prisoners six armed men with their horses. Another party of fifty killed at least seven of the enemy, and lost one man killed and five wounded. Brought off all the wounded and the arms of the killed. Advance guard received the body .to-day. The men are in magnificent spirits for a battle. The only trouble will be to restrain them.

Newspaper reports say that my department is to be broken up. I hope the General will leave under my control both the operations on the Mississippi and in Western Virginia. If he cannot do so, the Indiana and Ohio troops are necessary to my success. With these means at my disposal, and such resources as I command in Virginia, if the Government will give me ten thousand arms for distribution in Eastern Tennessee I think I can break the backbone of secession. Please instruct whether to move on Staunton or on to Wy theville.* I thank the General for his commendation, and hope to deserve rather in the future than in the past. Please enforce the occupation of Cumberland and Piedmont. The condition of things in that vicinity renders it absolutely necessary to occupy both these points, and you will remember that my command does not extend that far. I cannot too strongly impress upon you the necessity of holding these points. The Pennsylvania State troops now in the vicinity of Cumberland will answer the purpose perfectly well.

In sight of the enemy, who is strongly intrenched and holds firm. A strong armed reconnaissance is now starting out. I think I can turn his position; feel sure of success in any event. This country exceedingly difficult to operate in. My other column from Philippi is also within a mile of the intrenchments on Laurel Hill; advanced guards within two hundred yards of the enemy on each line; all my men eager for the fight. The companies at Glenville are safe, and favorable chance of cutting off O. J. Wise. I shall make no further extended movement without laying the whole case before the General and obtaining his orders in advance. Wish to clear my department fully of the enemy, and then be ready to carry out the views of the General-in-Chief. Can shorten distance from base by adopting a new base in event of extended operations.
Please send me more regular officers; some old regiments, if possible. I want those mountain guns at once. I have great difficulties to meet, but have gone into them knowing that the General will give me support as I need it, and that he will appreciate my position.

We are in possession of all the enemy’s works up to a point in sight of Beverly. Have taken all his guns, a very large amount of ivagons, tents, &c.—everything he had. A large number of prisoners, many of whom wounded. Several officers prisoners. They lost many killed. We have lost in all perhaps twenty killed and forty wounded, of w hom all but two or three in the column under Bosecrans, which turned the position. Mass of enemy escaped through the woods entirely disorganized. Among prisoners, Dr. Taylor, formerly of the Army. Colonel Pegram wras in command.
Bosecrans’ column left camp yesterday morning and marched some eight miles through the mountains, reaching turnpike some two or three miles in rear of the enemy. Defeated an advance force, taking a couple of guns. I had position ready for twelve guns near main camx>, and as guns were moving up ascertained that enemy had retreated. I am now Xiushing on to Beverly, a part of Bosecrans’ trooi>s being now within three miles of it. Our success complete and almost bloodless. Doubt whether Wise and Johnston will unite and overpower me. Behavior of troops in action and towards prisoners admirable.

Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Camp at Beverly, Fa., July 12—8 p. m.
Colonel : I have the honor to inform you that the army under my command has gained a decisive victory, which seems to have accomplished the objects of my march. I turned the enemy’s very strong in-trenchments on Rich Mountain yesterday with General Rosecrans’ brigade of four regiments and one company of cavalry. He had a spirited action with a large party of the enemy (who had two guns) on the summit of the mountain, captured both guns, and killed a large number of the enemy.
This morning, as we were in the act of moving twelve guns into a position commanding the enemy’s intrenchments by a road cut last evening, it was ascertained that he had left in the utmost confusion. We have all his guns (six in number), all his wagons, tents, &c. The number of killed, wounded, and prisoners is large. Our loss very small— about 11 killed and 35 wounded.
I advanced at once on Beverly, and occupied it with the least possible delay, thus cutting off Garnett’s retreat on Huttonsville, and forcing him to take the Leedsville and Saint George road. I have ordered General Morris to press him closely, and have also given instructions by telegraph which will throw from 5,000 to 6,000 men and four guns in his front, so that there is good reason to hope that we may yet capture him. I shall move on Huttonsville to-morrow morning, and endeavor to seize the Cheat Mountain pass before the enemy can occupy it in strength. With that pass seized, the position on Cheat River (near Rowlesburg) strongly occupied, and the Gauley Bridge held, as it probably is by this time, by General Cox, I think we shall have placed the occupation of Western Virginia on a safe basis. After reaching Huttonsville I can determine better than I now can whether it will be advisable to occupy the Greenbrier Valley at present.
I hope to be able to give you to-morrow full details of the transactions of the last few days. I advanced so rapidly to this place that it is not now in my power. We occupy here a very strong defensive position. We are constantly picking up more prisoners.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captured official papers show Garnett’s force to have been 10,000 men. Please give instructions as to the disposition to be made of the prisoners of war.

Beverly, Va., July 13,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend :
Success of to-day is all that I could desire. We captured six brass cannon, of which one is rifled, all their camp equipage and transportation, even to his tents. The number of tents will probably reach two hundred, and more than sixty wagons. Their killed and wounded will amount to fully one hundred and fifty; at least one hundred prisoners, and more coming in constantly. I know already of ten officers killed

and prisoners. Their retreat complete. Occupied Beverly by a rapid inarch.
Garnett abandoned his camp early this morning, leaving much of his equipage. He came within a few miles of Beverly, but our rapid march turned him back in great confusion, and he is now retreating on the road to Saint George. I have ordered General Morris to follow him up closely. I have telegraphed for the two Pennsylvania regiments at Cumberland to join General Hill at Bowlesburg. The general is concentrating all his troops at Bowlesburg to cut off Garnett7s retreat near West Union, or, if possible, Saint George, f may say that we have driven out some ten thousand troops strongly intrenched, with the loss of eleven killed and thirty-five wounded.
Provision returns found here show Garnett’s force to have been ten thousand men. They were Eastern Virginians, Georgians, Tennesseeans, and, I think, Carolinians. To-morrow I can give full details as to prisoners, &c. Will move on Huttonsville to-morrow, and endeavor to seize the Cheat Mountain pass, where there are now but few troops. I hope that General Cox has by this time driven Wise out of the Kanawha Valley. In that case I should have accomplished the object of liberating Western Virginia. I hope the general will approve my operations.

Gen. McClellan, Beverly, Va:
The General-in-Chief, and what is more, the Cabinet, including the President, are charmed with your activity, valor, and consequent successes of Rich Mountain the 11th,, and of Beverly this morning.

Colonel Townsend :
Garnett and forces routed; his baggage and one gun taken; his army demoralized; Garnett killed. We have annihilated the enemy in Western Virginia, and have lost thirteen killed, and not more than forty wounded. We have in all killed at least two hundred of the enemy, and their prisoners will amount to at least one thousand. Have taken seven guns in all. I still look for the capture of the remnant of Garnett’s army by General Hill. The troops defeated are the crack regiments of Eastern Virginia, aided by Georgians, Tennesseeans, and Carolinians. Our success is complete, and secession is killed in this country.

to Staunton, and I have the pleasure to announce that, with the exception of the Kanawha, the part of Western Virginia included in my department is now free from the presence of the enemy. I expect every day to hear that the measures taken to drive Wise out of the Kanawha have proved successful. I shall now proceed to scour the country with small columns, unless the moral effect of our successes has sufficed to disperse the guerrilla bands. The three-months’ regiments are to be reorganized, and some time will be required to prepare this hastily-organized army for further operations.
The general’s kind telegraph is received. Offer him my thanks for it.
GEO. B. McCLELLAN.
Hdqrs. Army of Occupation Western Virginia,
Camp near Huttonsville, July 14, 1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Commanding General, the following report of the operations of the forces under my command from the time of my leaving Grafton. Previous to my departure from Grafton I became satisfied that a large body of the rebel army, supposed to consist of six or seven thousand men, under Brig. Gen. Bobert S. Garnett, formerly of the U. S. Army, occupied an intrenched position at Laurel Hill, about thirteen miles south of Phi-lippi, on the turnpike leading to Beverly, with the apparent intention of making a determined stand at that point; whereupon I at once resolved to push on with all the available force at my disposal, and endeavor, by making a rapid detour through Buckhannon, to reach Beverly, and strike their rear, cutting off their supply communication from Staunton.
As soon as I had concentrated my forces at Buckhannon I moved forward, and at the same time ordered General Morris to advance from Philippi, and take a commanding position about a mile and a half distant, and directly opposite the enemy’s works, thereby enabling him to divert their attention from me, also to watch their movements, and be in position to act promptly after I had reached their rear, at Beverly. General Morris promptly responded to my order, and secured the proper position with but slight resistance, and I pushed forward with my column as rapidly as my means of transportation would permit.
On the evening of the 9th instant I arrived at Roaring Creek, near the base of Rich Mountain, where I found the enemy in considerable force had destroyed a bridge, and were strongly intrenched at a point where the road enters a defile leading up the mountain, about two miles distant from my camp.
On the morning of the 10th I ordered a reconnaissance in force, consisting of the Ninth and Fourth Ohio Volunteers, and Loomis’ battery, under the supervision of Lieutenant Poe, Topographical Engineers. This was pushed within two hundred yards of the enemy’s guns, and resulted in the loss of one man killed and one wounded, but the dense thickets with which their works were surrounded prevented the attainment of much positive or satisfactory information. It served, however, to confirm my previous supposition, that the intrenchments were held by a large force, with several guns in position to command the front approaches, and that a direct assault would result in a heavy and unnecessary loss of life.
These considerations at once determined me to make an effort to turn their flank and commence the attack from the rear. Accordingly I ordered General Rosecrans to move at 4 o’clock in the morning with the Nineteenth Ohio, the Eighth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Indiana Regiments, and

## p. 206 (#222) ############################################

﻿206	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
Burdsal’s dragoons, to cut liis way through the almost impenetrable thickets of brush to the lofty summit of Rich Mountain, at Hart’s farm, about five miles distant, and to move thence at once down the turnpike road and attack the intrenchments in rear, and during the progress of his march to communicate with me every hour. The remainder of the force under my command to be held in readiness to assault in front as soon as Rosecrans’ musketry should indicate that he was immediately in their rear.
The order to General Rosecrans to advance to attack the rear of the enemy’s lower intrenchments was not carried out, but his brigade remained at Hart’s farm during the remainder of the day and the night, and I received no communication from him after about 11 o’clock a. m., when he was still distant about a mile and a half from Hart’s farm.
About the time I expected the general to reach the rear of their intrenchments I moved up all my available force to the front, and remained in person just in rear of the advance pickets, ready to assault when the indicated moment should arrive.
In the mean time I sent Lieutenant Poe to find such a position for our artillery as would enable us to command the works. Late in the afternoon I received his report that he had found such a place. I immediately detailed a party to cut a road to it for our guns, but it was too late to get them into position before dark, and as I had received no intelligence whatever of General Rosecrans’ movements, I finally determined to return to camp, leaving merely sufficient force to cover the working party. Orders were then given to move up the guns with the entire available infantry at daybreak the following morning. As the troops were much fatigued, some delay occurred in moving from camp, and just as the guns were starting intelligence was received that the enemy had evacuated their works and fled over the mountains, leaving all their guns, means of transportation, ammunition, tents, and baggage behind.
Then, for the first time since 11 o’clock the previous day, I received a communication from General Rosecrans, giving me the first intimation that he had taken the enemy’s position at Hart’s farm, from which it appeared that he, with great difficulty and almost superhuman efforts on the part of his men, had forced his way up the precipitous side of the mountain, and at about 1 p. m. reached the summit, where he encountered a portion of the enemy’s force, with two guns in position behind earth and log works—affording protection to their men.
The attack was commenced by the enemy with heroic spirit and determination. They opened upon the advance of our column with volleys of musketry and rapid discharges of canister, killing several of our men, and at first throwing them into some confusion. They, however, soon rallied, and returned a brisk and accurate fire, which told with terrible effect in the enemy’s ranks—killing and wounding nearly every man at their guns. The troops then advanced, continuing their well-directed fire, until they drove the enemy from their position, and caused them to take flight down the turnpike towards their intrenchments at the base of the mountain.
The troops then encamped on the battle-field at about 2 o’clock p. m., and remained there until the following morning, when I made a rapid march and occupied Beverly. I here learned that General Garnett, as soon as he discovered we were approaching his rear and had cut off his retreat in this direction, abandoned his intrenchments at Laurel Hill, leaving his tents and other property, and had irade a hasty retreat in the night over a rough country road leading towards Saint

George. General Morris had been repeatedly instructed by me to keep a close watch upon Garnett’s movements, and to be ready the moment he retreated to follow him up vigorously with all his available force, and crush him if possible 5 but, much to my surprise, when he discovered that Garnett had escaped, he only sent a portion of his force about eight miles, and then halted it for several hours, to communicate with me and bring up re-enforcements. This detention gave Garnett the opportunity to get far in advance, and had it not been for the rapid and well-directed march of the advance, conducted by Captain Benham, it is believed that the rebel general would have escaped unharmed. Captain Benham is entitled to great praise for his prompt and energetic movement upon Garnett’s rear, the result of which will be seen from his report inclosed. This shows that General Garnett and about twenty others of the enemy were killed, and fifty prisoners and two stands of colors and one rifle cannon taken, besides the baggage train and a large amount of other property. I take very great pleasure in recommending Captain Benham to the especial notice of the General in-Chief. Immediately after learning that Garnett had retreated, I ordered Brigadier-General Hill, commanding at Grafton, to assemble all his disposable force, and endeavor, by a rapid march upon Saint George or West Union, to cut off the retreat of the rebels, but I have not yet heard the result of his movement. My last advices this evening report General Hill’s advance within four miles of the retreating rebels.
I have not time now to notice individual acts of merit and bravery displayed in the recent conflicts, but shall take an early opportunity of presenting them to you in detail. I cannot, however, let the present occasion pass without making mention of the services of Brigadier-General Rosecrans in conducting his command up the very precipitous sides of the mountains and overcoming the formidable obstacles which impeded his progress} also for the very handsome manner in which he planned and directed his attack upon the rebels at Hart’s farm, carrying them after a stout and determined resistance.
I also conceive it to be due to my volunteer aide-de-camp, Col. F. W. Lander, to speak of his services in this connection. He, by the request of General Rosecrans, accompanied his column, and by his experience assisted materially in conducting the troops over a most difficult country, and displayed extraordinary activity and courage in the battle. He escaped unhurt, having the horse under him disabled by a canister shot.
I pursued the retreating rebels yesterday as far as Cheat River, and became satisfied that they would not stop short of Staunton. I therefore returned to this camp, which commands the communication between Eastern and Western Virginia, over the Staunton and Parkersburg turnpike.
General Garnett’s command when last heard from were retreating in great confusion near the North Branch of the Potomac, on the road leading from West Union to Williamsport.
I trust I will not be regarded as merely conforming to a formula when I express the great obligations due to my personal and general staff, who by their good judgment, untiring energy, and cool conduct have enabled me to overcome the inevitable difficulties of an imperfect and hasty organization, and to accomplish whatever good results have been achieved. As far as I have myself observed and learned from their officers, the conduct of the volunteers who participated in the actions at Rich Mountain and at Oarrick’s Ford was unexceptionable. They invariably displayed an ardent desire to meet the enemy, and

great gallantry in action, and in my judgment all they require to make good and reliable soldiers is a little more drill and discipline.
The results of the action at Eich Mountain, as nearly as can be ascertained, were as follows:
Our loss in killed, 12; wounded, 59; no prisoners. The loss of the enemy in killed, 135 $ wounded and prisoners not yet reported, as near as can be determined between 800 and 900. Two brass 6-pounder cannon, a large number of muskets, two stands of colors, and other property were taken. Two 6-pounder brass cannon were captured at the lower intreochments with a large wagon train, with horses and a large number of tents.
But the really important results of these operations are the complete rout and annihilation of the rebel forces; the capture of one and the death of the other of their leaders; that this portion of Western Virginia is entirely freed from their presence, and that there is now not one single organized band of the rebels on this side of the mountain north of the Kanawha Valley.
After my arrival at Beverly I received a note from Colonel Pegram, containing a proposition to surrender his command as prisoners of war. This note with my reply are inclosed. His command, consisting of 33 commissioned officers and 560 men, are now prisoners.

Instructions to General T. A. Morris.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Buclchannonj Fa., July 3, 1861.
General T. A. Morris, Philippi:
General : Yours of the 2d has reached me. After questioning your messenger and hearing his full story, I confess that I do not share your apprehensions, and that I am not a little surprised that you feel the defense of Philippi so hazardous and dangerous an operation. If four thousand (nearly) of our men, in a position selected and fortified in advance, with ample time to examine the ground carefully and provide against any possible plan of attack, are not enough to hold the place against any force these people can bring against it, I think we had better all go home at once. If we cannot fight in position, I am much mistaken as to our men.
I have, however, in deference to your views, ordered the Sixth Ohio on temporary duty with you until the crisis has passed, although I believe they can be employed to more advantage at other points. This is all the re enforcement I can now spare. As to the one or two squadrons of efficient cavalry asked for by Captain Benham, it seems hardly necessary for me to repeat that I have only one and a half companies, such as they are, and that more important duty is for them here.
You have only to defend a strong position, or, at most, to follow a retreating enemy. I fear you do not share the confidence I feel in our men, and that you regard their cavalry as more dangerous than I do. I feel that these men of ours can be worked up to any deed of daring, that their leaders can make them cool under fire, and that a couple of

good companies of infantry can drive off all their cavalry in this mount-ainous country.
I propose taking the really difficult and dangerous part of this work on my own hands. I will not ask you to do anything that I would not be willing to do myself. But let us understand each other. I can give you no more re-enforcements. I cannot consent to weaken any further the really active and important column which is to decide the fate of the campaign. If you cannot undertake the defense of Philippi with the force now under your control, I must find some one who will. I have ordered up Latham’s company, all of Keys’ cavalry that are fit to take the field, and the Sixth Ohio.
Do not ask for further re-enforcements. If you do, I shall take it as a request to be relieved from your command and to return to Indiana.
I have spoken plainly. I speak officially. The crisis is a grave one, and I must have generals under me who are willing to risk as much as I am, and to be content to risk their lives and reputation with such means as I can give them. Let this be the last of it. Give me full details as to the information you obtained—not mere rumors, but facts— and leave it to my judgment to determine what force you need. I wish action now and determination.

General: The major-general commanding directs that you advance from your present position to-morrow morning, and take up a position within two miles of the enemy—near Elliott’s farm—in preference on the south side of Barker’s Mill Run, on the heights in rear of William Yeager’s house. It is deemed preferable to avoid the defile north of the Elliott house by crossing the river somewhere near the nineteen-mile post from Beverly, and recrossing at the lord where the Middle Fork road crosses just at the position to be occupied by you.
Your train may remain at Philippi, under a sufficient escort, until you have occupied your new position. You will move prepared to force any opposition offered, and will at all hazards accomplish the object proposed. Occupy Belington by a strong advanced guard, and place a strong detachment to cover the paths leading from the rebel camp to the left flank of your position. From this position push out strong infantry reconnaissances, to ascertain the exact position, condition, and movements of the enemy. Watch them closely day and night. Have everything ready to pursue them should they retreat, and follow them up closely in that event. Make extended reconnaissances, calculated to give the impression that the main attack is to be made by you, and use all efforts to retain them in their present position. Arrange your hour of starting from Philippi so that you will by an easy march reach the vicinity of Elliott’s within an hour or two after sunrise.
Let your advanced guard be of infantry, strong, and near the main column. Do not push out any advanced cavalry patrols. A strong advanced guard will move from here to-morrow morning to occupy the Middle Fork Bridge. By the next day the Roaring Creek Bridge will be taken, and perhaps on the same day the town of Beverly will be

Weston, Bulltown, Sutton, &c., on the Gauley Bridge, in order to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion.
As far as I can now learn the effect of our operations against the larger forces has been to cause the small guerrilla bands to disappear, and I think we shall have no great difficulty in securing the entire pacification of this region. I propose moving back to Beverly to-morrow with headquarters, the advance-guard brigade, Howe’s battery, and Barker’s cavalry. I will leave here for the present Schleich’s brigade, consisting of the Third Ohio, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Indiana, Loomis’ battery, and Burdsal’s cavalry, with instructions to place an advance guard in the mountain, and to patrol the road in advance frequently. At Beverly I will be in a position to move promptly to any quarter required. The rather annoying business of reorganizing the three-months’ regiments is now to be gone through with. I have some fourteen of that character in my command. While this is being done, I will endeavor so to locate the three-years’ troops as to have good camps of instruction, while the necessary defensive purposes are at the same time subserved.
To effect this, I would ask the attention of the General-in-Ohief to the great necessity for the appointment of more general officers for the three-years’ service. But one brigadier-general has yet been appointed for Ohio, and none for Indiana. The appointment of J. J. Reynolds (formerly of the artillery, now brigadier-general in the Indiana State service) is much desired by the troops from that State, and I hope that he may receive the first appointment. I would be glad to have him here now to place him in command at this post. With the raw material which composes this army it would seem absolutely necessary that we should have general officers of military education.
I would beg leave to express the hope that a brigade of the old regular infantry and some companies of regular cavalry may be assigned to my command, if it is intended that I shall be engaged in further active operations. While engaged in reorganizing the three months’ regiments there is a great deal to be done in completing the organization of the trains and various staff departments.
Maj. R. B. Marcy, who has been acting during this brief campaign as inspector-general of this army, is in full possession of my views, and can communicate them better orally than I can on paper. May I ask that the General-in-Chief will communicate to the major for my benefit so much of his intentions as may be necessary to enable me to conform my preparations and movements to his views, it being my desire to act in strict accordance with the General’s wishes.

yesterday. Thirty-five men first attacked and fired upon our pickets without injuring them. They returned the fire effectually, and got safely into camp. All of our pickets got safely in during the night. The advance of the enemy was composed of about 160 well-armed and disciplined men, and by dark last night our little force was surrounded, the enemy covering the three roads leading past the Court-House.
He brings no definite information as to number of enemy; thinks at least 2,500, 1,000 of whom are an Eastern Virginia regiment, well armed and equipped and disciplined, the rest militia.
Irregular firing was kept up during the night. At daybreak, in the language of the scout, “ Both sides were firing like hell,” our men holding good their position. Tyler’s two companies stopped last night ten miles this side of Glenville, for what reason God only knows. But the delay has probably occasioned the cutting off of my brave boys.
Colonel Tyler himself at 10 o’clock this morning was not a mile and a half from Weston. If our men at Glenville cannot hold out till to-morrow morning Tyler and Lytle will not reach Wise at all.
The scout reports that our men are behaving nobly, determined to hold their position.

Reports of Brig. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, U. S. Army, of preliminary operations from June 27 to July 3.
June 29,1861.
[General:] On the receipt of your instructions by telegraph to proceed to Elk Camp, after midnight of the 27th I took my staff and sixty-five Chicago dragoons, under Captain Barker, and arrived at 6 a. m. I found it about ten miles below Clarksburg, in the woods, in a bend of the Elk, and about one mile and a half above the bridge. They were sent to cover in the position marked A on the sketch herewith.* Spending two or three hours in reducing things to order and reconnoitering the locality, I found there was no room for any one of the regiments, and some had not even room for a company roll-call. Meanwhile I received your dispatch by messenger, announcing the departure of General Sehleieh and of Colonel McCook for the same spot. I had the long-roll beat, and the troops assembled from the woods, fields, and ravines, where they were roaming. Those were arrested who did not obey the call, and experienced its meaning. Having given them this lesson I dismissed them for dinner, and gave orders that after they should prepare for a march. I then went forward to examine the country for a suitable camp. The valley in which is the Buckhannon turnpike is narrow, winding along through high hills, covered with timothy and clover, and offers no sufficient space for an encampment until you reach Duncan’s Bottom. Arriving there, the citizens of the vicinity told me I could find a good camping ground in a valley beyond Matty Mountain $ it proved a mistake, and I returned to this place, where I met the head of the column, and ordered them to encamp for the night.
It was then 8 o’clock, and 1 proceeded to Schleich’s camp and wrote you the dispatch sent last evening. On my way I found McCook’s regi-

ment on the only ground fit for the camp at the bridge, which the Eighth and Tenth were sent to cover at the point marked 0. Schleich had gone into camp at the Elk Camp at A on the sketch. I returned home at 12.30 o’clock last night, and this morning read your letter of the 27th. Yesterday intelligence of the non-occupation of Buckhannon was confirmed this morning by a scout of the Nineteenth, who slept there last night, and found no secession forces. As telegraphed you last night, I am more and more afraid we shall be compelled to hunt rather than fight.
After these details of my movements and position I have only to add that, according to the tenor of your instructions to occupy Buckhannon with one regiment when I deemed it safe, I have sent the Ninth Ohio, under Colonel McCook, who will probably reach there by 6 o’clock this evening.
No one, my dear general, among your general friends, has more disinterested and earnest wishes for the success of your efforts than the writer of this letter. None under your command are more loyally, cheerfully ready to conform to the duties of a subordinate position, and I even flatter myself I understand the position as well as most of your brigadiers. Review, if you please, that letter which you have put on record, and say whether, after you receive this, both private feelings and public interest are likely to be the better for it.

By order of Major-General McClellan, after a night’s march I occupied this place with my brigade—the Eighth and Tenth Indiana and Nineteenth Ohio—this morning at 7 o’clock amid the cheers and congratulations of the citizens. The Beverly and Weston roads are occupied in peace, and patrols will be established to scour the country in all directions.

to Parkersburg, and await orders. Subsequently be received an additional supply of provisions, and directions to x>roceed to Glenville, and thence to Weston, unless unforeseen circumstances should require other action. Since then Colonel Tyler informed me that he was thirty-seven miles west of Glenwood. I wrote Colonel Tyler to communicate with him, and gave no further orders, until I knew your views of the forces in that direction.
One company, under Captain Stinchcomb, of Colonel Silks [Connell’s] regiment, was detailed as a train guard during the 24th to 28th ultimo, when I was removed from the opportunity of communicating with them. Three companies, under Major Steele, a very enterprising officer of that regiment, was detached at Clarksburg on the 27th to proceed to Parkersburg, and there take boats for Bipley, Bavenswood, and Belleville.
The major arrived in Parkersburg on Friday, the 28th. On the same evening he embarked on two steamboats, commanded by Captain Kountz, and reached a landing two miles below Bavenswood with two companies, leaving the other steamboat to land above Belleville, and march down and take it while the two landed at Bavenswood.
The major proceeded to Bipley, which he reached at 4 a. m. of the 29th. He x>laced his advance guard hidden from sight, and having surrounded the place, completely surprised it, cajAuring the x>ostmaster and some eighty other secessionists. He administered the oatlrof allegiance to the captives ; installed the postmaster newly ax)pointed by the Government; took the captive postmaster with him to Bavenswood, where they captured all they could, and swore them in as at Bixdey.

What orders will you give for Colonel Connell % An answer to these questions seems necessary before I can give orders to Major Steele. I send this with him to expedite the matter.

ing the rebel forces from their intrenched position at Camp Garnett, on Eich Mountain.
After the armed reconnaissance was over, by direction of the major-general I ordered the Eighth Indiana to bivouac in advance of the camp at Roaring Creek, and the Tenth and Thirteenth into camp. About 10 p. m. I came to the headquarters with a plan for turning the enemy’s position. The general having considered it, and heard the information on which it was based, was pleased to direct me to carry it out, and for that purpose ordered Colonel Sullivan, of the Thirteenth Indiana, and Burdsal’s cavalry, temporarily attached to the brigade, and that the movement should begin at daylight of the next morning. The troops were ordered to parade in silence, under arms, without knapsacks, with one day’s rations in their haversacks, and their canteens filled with water. By inadvertence, the assembly was sounded in the Nineteenth Ohio Regiment, and lights put in several tents. When I discovered it, they were promptly extinguished. The pickets relieved, the regimental camps and guards, with the sick and a few men of each company remaining, orders were given that the reveille should be beaten at the usual hour, and the column formed and moved forward in the following order and strength:
1.	Eighth Indiana, under Benton....................................... 242	strong.
2.	Tenth Indiana, under Manson........................................ 425	“
3.	Thirteenth Indiana, under Sullivan................................. 650	“
4.	Nineteenth Ohio, under Beatty...................................... 525	“
Total infantry....................................................1, 842
5.	Burdsal’s cavalry.................................................... 75
Aggregate................................................1,917
Colonel Lander, accompanied by the guide, led the way through a pathless forest, over rocks and ravines, keeping far down on the southeastern declivities of the mountain spurs, and using no ax, to avoid discovery by the enemy, whom we supposed would be on the alert, by reason of the appearance of unusual stir in our camp, and the lateness of the hour. A rain set in about 6 a. m. and lasted until about 11 o’clock a. m. with intermissions, during which the column pushed cautiously and steadily forward, and arrived at last and halted in rear of the crest on the top of Rich Mountain. Hungry, and weary with an eight hours’ march over a most unkindly road, they laid down to rest, while Colonel Lander and the general examined the country. It was found that the guide was too much scared to be with us longer, and we had another valley to cross, another hill to climb, another descent beyond that to make, before we could reach the Beverly road at the top of the mountain. On this road we started at 2 o’clock, and reached the top of the mountain, after the loss of an hour’s time by mistake in the direction of the head of the column, in rectifying which the Tenth Indiana took the advance.
Shortly after passing over the crest of the hill, the head of the column, ordered to be covered by a company deployed as skirmishers, was fired on by the enemy’s pickets, killing Sergeant James A. Taggart and dangerously wounding Capt. Christopher Miller, of the Tenth.
The column then advanced through dense brushwood, emerging into rather more open brush-wood and trees, when the rebels opened a fire of both musketry and 6-pounders, firing some case shot and a few shells. The Tenth advanced and took position at A, Plan No. 1,* with one

company deployed as skirmishers covering its front. The Eighth advanced, and halted in column of fours at B. The Thirteenth advanced to 0, in an old road, where it was ordered to occupy the heights with three companies at d d d, and skirmish down the hill, keeping strong reserves on the top. Three companies were ordered back to E, to cover the debouche up the valley on the left. The companies of the remainder were to fill the space in the line marked JILL, the remaining two companies standing in column at t. The Nineteenth Ohio came down the road and halted in column at H.
Owing to misunderstanding orders, Colonel Sullivan occupied the hill with his whole regiment, and it took forty minutes to correct the error and get into the proper position, as indicated. The command u Forward” was then given, and another company from the right of the Tenth deployed as skirmishers, leaving an interval through which the Eighth could pass in column and charge the rebel battery on the left of their position at Z as soon as our fire had told properly. At the same time Colonel Sullivan was to take his four companies and charge around the road on the left.
After an advance of fifty yards and some heavy firing from our line, the enemy showed signs of yielding, and I gave orders to the Eighth, and sent them to the colonel of the Thirteenth, to charge in column. The Eighth made a mistake and got into line at B, where, in consideration of their abundant supplies of ammunition, I left them. The Thirteenth went into column at D, Plan 2. Seven companies of the Nineteenth Ohio deployed into line at H, and delivered two splendid volleys, when the enemy broke. Meanwhile I rode round to the Thirteenth, and drove them into charge up across the road, as shown at I. The Tenth charged by fours at J. The Eighth came down and charged upon the rebel front at K.
The battle was over, the enemy dispersed 5 one piece of cannon taken at A, another at B, and their dead and wounded scattered over the hillside.
Learning from a captive that the Forty-fourth Virginia and some Georgia troops and cavalry were below, and finding it too late to continue the operations against the rebels7 position that evening with troops as much exhausted as were ours, and threatened, too, by succors, the troops were bivouacked in the position shown on Plan No. 2, Lieutenant-Colonel Hollingsworth going down on the ridge with six companies to the position mentioned within half a mile of the rebel pickets.
The two brass 0-pounders captured were put in order, and, under command of Captain Konkle, Nineteenth Ohio, placed, one looking down the Beverly road at C, the other at D, looking towards Camp Garnett. During that rainy night our men bivouacked cheerfully, and turned out with great promptitude whenever the rebels by their movements alarmed our pickets.
About 3 o’clock in the morning of the 12th our pickets brought in a prisoner from the rebel camp, from whom I learned their forces were disorganized and probably dispersing. This determined the disposition for the attack on the camp. I ordered Colonel Beatty, with all the Nineteenth, to proceed along the ridge and take their position on the south side of the road, and directed Burdsal’s cavalry, accompanied by one company of the Tenth Indiana, to reconnoiter down the road. Colonel Sullivan, with the Thirteenth, was to follow the movement promptly, and by his skirmishers to clear the hillside north of the road.
These orders were obeyed, and, finding the position abandoned, Burdsal’s cavalry and Company C, Tenth Indiana Begiment, entered the camp about 6 o’clock a. m., where they found and took prisoners

10 officers, 5 non-commissioned officers, and 54 privates $ the descriptive list of which is hereto attached, and marked A.
Colonel Beatty entered the upper camp about the same time, and occupied it, taking charge of the property, among which were two brass 6-pounders and some eighty tents, four caissons, and one hundred rounds of ammunition. Colonel Sullivan, of the Thirteenth Indiana, came in and occupied the camp on the north side of the road, and took charge of the horses, wagons, tents, tools, and implements of the rebels there. The Eighth and Tenth Indiana were left in position on the battle-field, and were charged with the duty of burying the dead. They remained until next morning, the 13th, when the whole force moved forward to their present encampment at Beverly.
Having given the details, I close my report by the following summary of the movement:
With strong detachment from the Nineteenth Ohio, the Eighth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Indiana, and Burdsal’s cavalry, amounting to 1,912 rank and file, I set out at 5 a. m. of the 11th, and by a circuitous route, through a trackless mountain forest, reached the Beverly road at the top of Rich Mountain, where I found the enemy advised of my approach and in force, with two 6-pounder field-pieces, and infantry, from various circumstances, judged to have been from 800 to 1,200 strong, though probably not all of them in action. We formed at about 3 o’clock under cover of our skirmishers, guarding well against a flank attack from the direction of the rebels’ position, and after a brisk fire, which threw the rebels into confusion, carried their position by a charge, driving them from behind some log breastworks, and pursued them into the thickets on the mountain. We captured twenty-one prisoners, two brass 6-pounders, fifty stand of arms, and some corn and provisions. Our loss was 12 killed and 49 wounded.
The rebels had some 20 wounded on the field. The number of the killed we could not ascertain, but subsequently the number of burials reported to this date is 135—many found scattered over the mountain. Our troops, informed that there were one or two regiments of rebels towards Beverly, and finding the hour late, bivouacked on their arms amid a cold, drenching rain, to await daylight, when they moved forward on the enemy’s intrenched position, which was found abandoned by all except 63 men, who were taken prisoners. We took possession of two brass 6-pounders, four caissons, and one hundred rounds ammunition, two kegs and one barrel powder, 19,000 buck and ball cartridge, two stands of colors, and a large lot of equipments and clothing, consisting of 204 tents, 427 pairs pants, 124 axes, 98 picks, 134 spades and shovels, all their train, consisting of 29 wagons, 75 horses, 4 mules, and 60 pairs harness.
The enemy, finding their position turned, abandoned intrenchments, which, taken by the front, would have cost us a thousand lives, and dispersed through the mountains, some attempting to escape by the way of Laurel Hill and others aiming for Huttonsville. Among the former were the command of Colonel Pegram, which, unable to join the rebels at Laurel Hill, surrendered to the major-general on the 13th.
Our loss in the engagement killed and wounded is shown in the statement hereto appended, marked B. The list of prisoners taken is shown in the paper hereto appended, marked D. The invoice of property captured and turned over to the post quartermaster is hereto annexed, marked E.
In closing this report, I deem it proper to observe that, considering the rawness and inexperience of both officers and men, the fact that one-

fourth were on picket guard the previous evening, and had made a most fatiguing march through the rain and with only inadequate supplies of food, their conduct was admirable.
Among those who are entitled to special mention are Colonel Lander, who with the guide led the way into the very midst of the action; Colonel Manson, of the Tenth Indiana, wrho was everywhere along his lines, inspiring the men by his voice and presence, and who bravely led the charge of his regiment. Colonel Benton was ready to obey orders, and moved among his men with alacrity. Colonel Sullivan charged with his command as the rebels were dispersing, and captured several of the prisoners. Major Wilson, of the Eighth, was conspicuous for coolness and promptitude of action. Lieutenant-Colonel Colgrove, of the Eighth, deserves especial mention for his coolness while forming his lines of the regiment under fire. Major Foster, of the Thirteenth, showed coolness and self-possession in forming a portion of his men under the fire of the cannons.
My thanks are due Captain Kingsbury, my assistant adjutant-general, and to Capt. A. Irwin Harrison, for their valuable and efficient aid in carrying orders under fire.
The Tenth Indiana was under fire for an hour and a half. The Nineteenth Ohio distinguished itself for the cool and handsome manner in which they held their post against a flank attack, and for the manner in which they came into line and delivered their fire near the close of the action. I consider Colonel Beatty to have managed his men well, and to have been ably seconded by Colonel Hollingsworth and Major Buckley.
For the individuals who distinguished themselves under the eyes of their regimental commanders I respectfully refer to the reports of colonels of regiments, herewith submitted.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hdqrs. near Belington, Va., July 9,1861.
Sir: Since my report of the 7th instant, I have the honor to inform the commanding general that we now occupy the Elliott farm. Our advanced position is behind Belington, some two hundred yards. The cleared grounds extend some two hundred yards beyond Belington. A heavy body of timber then commences, which is now occupied by the enemy in large force. Skirmishing has been going on since the occupation of our position. Yesterday they appeared in such force that we threw several shells into the wood, and attempted to occupy it with our pickets; but we were driven in, with the loss of two killed and three wounded. Our total loss up to this time, in killed, is 45 wounded, 6 •, missing, 1.
I feel sure we could hold this side of the wood, did it not extend our lines too much beyond the point we are instructed to retain. Captain

Hines, my aide-de-camp, was on a hill in view of part of their camp the entire day yesterday. He saw forty to sixty large tents, capable of accommodating twenty to twenty-five men each, and saw the ends of rows of tents extending back, and which to him appeared as a large camp. The enemy were in motion several times during yesterday, and their columns were seen marching in our direction. We are sure they were last night in the rear of a round hill in front of Belington, and within three-fourths of a mile, and in numbers at least two or three thousand. Scouts on the hill this morning report their tents in the same position as yesterday.
The instructions of the commanding general will be carried out, although it is difficult to restrain our men from advancing. I hardly know in what terms to convey to you their enthusiasm. Their coolness under such fire as we have been subjected to (incessant since our arrival) is very creditable to them, and establishes beyond all question, if proof were needed, that they can be relied upon in any emergency.
The regiments in advance are Milroy’s Mnth Indiana, Barnett’s artillery, Steedman’s Fourteenth Ohio, and Dumont’s Seventh Indiana, which regiments deserve special mention.
Bumors from several sources reached us yesterday of re-enforcements to the enemy from the direction of Beverly, but they are not of a character to be reported to the commanding general under the instructions I have received.
Owing to the rapid march from Philippi, made necessary by the instructions of the commanding general of July —, it was impossible to bring much baggage or provisions. Our men are very short of the latter, and we have only seven wagons to the regiment and such scanty assistance as we hire to keep us supplied.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A. MORRIS, Brigadier- General.
Maj. S. Williams, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—Information just in reports the enemy as having retired from the wood in front of Belington. Reconnoitering parties are out in several directions, and the movements of the enemy will be closely watched.
July 13,1861.
Sir : After resting two hours near Leadsville our advanced column, Steedman, Dumont, and Milroy, moved on this morning at 3 o’clock in pursuit of the enemy. I am now advancing, at 5 o’clock, with the balance of my force to support them. We left Belington in pursuit yesterday with four wagons of hard bread and pork, which were all the available wagons, the balance having been sent to Philippi to bring up supplies from there. As I have before reported, we have but seven wagons to the regiment. Our men have necessarily been restricted in their rations, and must be more so as we advance. I shall pursue just as long as it is possible with the means of transportation at my command. If you could send us provisions, it would greatly assist us in the advance.
Inclosed I send you a dispatch, this moment received from Captain Benham, who is with the advance.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General : I have just started, after having halted the column for half an hour. There is no doubt they have passed up on Pleasant Run, opposite me, and I follow them, though with much doubt. It is said they are now about six miles ahead, having traveled on last night.
H. W. BENHAM, Captain.
Brigade Headquarters,
CarricWs Ford, Fa., July 14, 1861.
Sir : I reported yesterday, at about 6 a. m., the progress of the forces of my command in pursuit of the enemy retreating from Laurel Hill. The pursuit was continued through the day in the same order as stated in my report of yesterday morning, viz: Steedman’s Fourteenth Ohio in advance, with two sections of Barnett’s artillery, next Dumont’s Seventh Indiana and Milroy’s Ninth Indiana. These regiments, as I reported, started in pursuit from our resting place near Leadsville at about 4 o’clock in the morning, under the immediate command of Captain Ben-ham. The remainder of the column were on the march by 5 o’clock a. m. A drizzling rain commenced about 6 o’clock, which by 9 became quite heavy. The enemy left the main turnpike and turned towards Cheat River, crossing two branches of the Laurel Mountain over a narrow and difficult road. Owing to the heavy rain, the roads were rendered very difficult for the men and the few wagons of ammunition and provisions. By 11 o’clock the rain became a drenching storm, and continued for several hours, the roads in the mountains becoming nearly impassable. At 2 o’clock the whole command were up to the position which we now occupy.
For details of the operations of the advance column I refer you to the report of Captain Benham.
The attention of the commanding general is particularly called to the gallant bearing of the regiments which led the advance. I would also call attention to the fact that the entire command commenced the pursuit) on a few minutes’ notice, without time to prepare even a day’s rations for the haversacks. I ordered four wagons to be loaded with hard bread and pork to follow the command. These four wagons, with the little additional rations put in with the ammunition, are all the provisions the command has had since leaving Belington, except some beeves procured in this vicinity.
The march of yesterday was from eighteen to twenty miles. When it is considered that we have put to flight a force equal to our own, and have pursued him night and day for thirty hours, almost without provisions, over a mountainous and difficult road, and part of the time through a drenching storm, we may feel sure that our cause must be successfully maintained by men who show such gallant bearing and soldierly endurance.
Justice to a gallant soldier compels me to say that, from the commencement of our march from Philippi to the routing of the enemy at this place, too much praise cannot be bestowed on Captain Benham, and I take this occasion to thank him for the invaluable service he has rendered me. I must also call attention to the services of Maj. J. W. Gordon, now of the Eleventh Regiment of Infantry, U. S. Army. Major Gordon volunteered a private in the Ninth Indiana Regiment, was promoted sergeant-major in the same regiment, and two weeks since re-

ceived the appointment of major in the Regular Army. Owing to the position of the enemy in front of the brigade in which he was serving as sergeant-major, he requested to be retained until the issue should be settled. Acting yesterday as my volunteer aide with the advance column, Captain Benham testifies to his gallantry and invaluable services during the entire day, and more especially in the face of the enemy.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A, MORRIS, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Maj. Seth Williams,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Ohio.
Brigade Headquarters, Elliott’s Farm,
Near Belington, Fa., July 16, 1861.
Sir : On the morning of the 14th instant I reported to you the operations of the brigade up to the routing of the Confederate forces at Car-rick’s Ford at about 2 p. m. of the previous day, and I have to state that while our troops were halting for rest our scouts followed close upon the route of the enemy for from four to six miles farther, and on the morning of the 14th we learned that they were fully fifteen miles in advance of us. At about noon of the same day we started for Saint George, in pursuance of orders, which place we reached at night. Without provisions, other than the beeves sent by General McClellan, and in the exhausted state of the command, it was impossible to pursue farther. At Saint George we heard the report that General Hill, agreeably to an order sent by General McClellan, had met the flying enemy, and captured or dispersed the remnant. Twelve wagons, most of them loaded with new clothing, were discovered four miles to the right of our route by our scouts, and were taken possession of. Yesterday morning we left Saint George to return to this place, in order to get proper provisions and shelter for the troops.
After a fatiguing march of twenty-three miles, we reached here at about 9 o’clock last night. The command were getting sick from the use of fresh beef only, and many of them preferred doing without beef rather than increase the disease (diarrhea) brought on by its use without bread or salt.
When the reports of the different colonels engaged at Carrick’s Ford shall be handed me I will complete my report of that engagement, in order that individual cases (if such there should be) of special service and gallantry may be made. I am now gathering up all the captured property and having it properly cared for. The limited transportation with this column (which has been before reported) will take three or four days to gather up the property strewed from here towards Saint George. A large number of tents have been taken. An inventory of all property will be made as soon as it can possibiy be done.
Your letter of the 15th did not reach me till this morning. I shall, therefore, gather the captured property, recruit my command, and, as soon as it is accomplished, proceed to Philippi. I would respectfully state that I have reported to the commanding general as often as it was possible under the circumstances which have surrounded me.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A. MORRIS,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Report of Capt. H. W. RenJiam7 U. S. Corps of Engineers, of the pursuit of Garnett and action at Carriers Ford.
Cheat River Camp, Carrick’s Ford,
Eight Miles South of Saint George, Yan July 13, 1861.
Sir : In accordance with your directions, this morning I took command of the advance guard of your column, consisting of the Fourteenth Ohio, Colonel Steedman, with one section of Colonel Barnett’s artillery, the Seventh Indiana, under Colonel Dumont, and the Ninth Indiana, Colonel Milroy, in all about 1,800 men, and with this force, as instructed, I started from near Leadsville, at about 4 a. m., to pursue the army of General Garnett, which, consisting, as we learned, of 4,000 to 5,000 men and four to six cannon, had retreated from the north side of Laurel Mountain, near Belington, the day before yesterday. It being ascertained that the enemy had retired towards the village of New Interest, and thence, as was supposed, over a mountain road leading to the Shafer Fork, or main branch, of the Cheat River, to Saint George, the troops were brought rapidly forward on their route, so as to reach the entrance of the mountain road—about seven miles’ march—at about 6 o’clock. A short distance after entering this path the passage was found to be obstructed by large trees, recently felled, in about twelve to fifteen places, and in nearly every defile for three or four miles, but the information that was from time to time received that this force, which had some fifteen hours the start of us from Belington, were now only four to five miles in advance, encouraged our elforts, and though for nearly the whole time the rain was pouring in torrents and the clayey roads almost impassable in many places, the spirit of the troops, without exception, as it came under my eye, was such as to bear them most rapidly onward under all these trials, superadded to that of hunger—with the greater part of them for the previous fifteen or twenty hours.
At about noon we reached Kaler’s, or the first ford of the Shaver Branch or main Cheat River, having, within the previous two or three miles, fired at and driven in several pickets of the enemy protecting those who were forming the barricades, and at one place we broke up a camp where the meals were being cooked. At the ford near Kaler’s, and at about one-half of the distance to another ford, which we afterwards met with about one mile farther on, we saw the baggage train of the enemy, apparently at rest. This I proposed to attack as soon as strengthened by the arrival of Steedman’s second battalion, with Dumont’s regiment, when the thoughtless firing of a musket at our ford set the train rapidly in motion, and long lines of infantry were formed in order of battle to protect it. In a few minutes, however, the arrival of Barnett’s artillery, with Dumont close upon it, enabled the command to push forward in its original order, but the train and its guard had retired, leaving only a few skirmishers to meet us at the second ford, where, however, quite a rapid firing was kept up by the advance regiment, and the artillery opened for some minutes to clear the adjacent woods the more completely of the enemy.
We then continued our march rapidly to the ford, and as we approached it we came upon their train, the last half of it just crossing in the river. The enemy was found to have taken a strong position, with his infantry and artillery upon a precipitous bank of some fifty to eighty feet in height upon the opposite side of the river, while our own ground was upon the low land, nearly level with the river. Steedman’s regi-

ment, in the advance, opened its fire most gallantly upon them, which was immediately returned by their strong force of infantry and by their cannon, upon which Barnettes artillery was ordered up and opened upon them with excellent effect.
As I soon perceived a position by which their left could be turned, six companies of Colonel Dumont7s regiment were ordered to cross the river about three hundred yards above them, to pass up the hill obliquely from our right to their left, and take them in rear. By some mistake, possibly in the transmission of the order, this command crossed at about double this distance and turned at first to their right, which delayed the effect of this movement. After some fifteen minutes, however, this error was rectified, and, the hill being reported as impracticable, this command, now increased to the whole regiment, were ordered down to the ford, under close cover of this hill on their side, and there to take them directly in front at the road.
The tiring of Steedman7s regiment and of Milroy7s, now well up and in action, with repeated and rapid discharges of the artillery during this movement, decided the action at once. As Dumont reached the road, having passed along and under their whole front, the firing ceased, and the enemy fled in great confusion, Dumont7s regiment pursuing them for about one mile farther, having a brisk skirmishing with their rear for the first half of that distance, during which General Garnett was killed. The enemy would still have been followed up most closely, and probably to the capture of a large portion of their scatt ered army, but this was absolutely impossible with our fatigued and exhausted troops, who had already marched some eighteen miles or more, in an almost incessant, violent rain, and the greater part of them without food since the evening, and a portion of them even from the noon of the yesterday, so warm had been the pursuit on their hasty retreat from Laurel Mountain, twenty-six miles distant. The troops were, therefore, halted for food and rest at about 2 p. m.
The result of the action proves to be the capture of about forty loaded wagons and teams, being nearly all their baggage train, as we learn, and including a large portion of new clothing, camp equipage, and other stores; their headquarter papers and military chest; also two stands of colors and one fine rifled piece of artillery; while the commanding general, Robert S. Garnett, is killed, his body being now cared for by us, and fifteen or twenty more of the enemy are killed and nearly fifty prisoners are taken. Our own loss is two killed and six or seven wounded; one dangerously.
In concluding this report, I feel it my duty to state that just as the action was closing, the head regiment of the body of the troops under yourself, though starting as I learn three hours later, the Sixth Indiana, under Colonel Crittenden, came up to the field in excellent order, but, unfortunately, too late to aid us in the battle.
The conduct of those gallant officers, Colonels Barnett, Steedman, Dumont, and Milroy, with the steady perseverance of their officers and men in their long and arduous march, suffering from hunger, rain, and cold, with their gallantry in action, was most heroic, and beyond all praise of mine. Their country only can fully appreciate and reward their services.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, H. W. BENHAM, Captain of Engineers,
Chief Eng. DepH of the Ohio, and Comdg. advance Column.

Report of Brig. Gen. G. W. Mill, Ohio Militia, of operations from July 4
to 19.
Headquarters U. S. Volunteers,
Grafton, Va.y July 22, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following statement of facts, showing the operations of my command in attempting to intercept the retreat and to capture a portion of General Garnett’s army from Laurel Hill.
When I was first assigned to duty here, the Cheat Biver line was in the hands of Col. J. Irvine’s command (Sixteenth Ohio Begiment), and he continued in charge of the line until the night of the 15th instant. On the 1st instant I went over the line with Colonel Irvine from Bowles-burg to the Cheat Biver Bridge, five miles above, and there gave him in writing all of the instructions which I had received from the department headquarters touching that line. The instructions as given to me and thus imparted contemplated Bowlesburg as the point of support on the railroad, and West Union, distant thirteen miles, as the place for the advance guard to the eastward, with scouts farther east, and as soon as practicable an advance guard towards or at Saint George. Intermediate points were to be held, and for the whole, including the protection of the three bridges on the railroad, the garrison was to be increased early to 1,000 men. From the 4th to the 6th instant a minute reconnaissance of the line was carried on by my order by Col. Charles Whittlesey and Maj. J. B. Frothingham, engineers, and the conclusions arrived at reported on the 6th to department headquarters.
On the 7th instant twenty-five cavalry, to serve as vedettes, couriers, and pickets, were added to Colonel Irvine’s command, as had also been a 6-pounder field piece.
On the 12th instant six companies of the Eighth Ohio, under Colonel Depuy, had joined Colonel Irvine, moving in by way of Oakland and Chisholm’s mill; and the garrison at Bowlesburg and thence five miles up Cheat Biver was held by six companies of the Fifteenth Ohio, under Col. G. W. Andrews and two companies of the First Virginia.
On the 9th Colonel Irvine telegraphed as follows: aOur increased knowledge clearly indicates the occupancy of the junction (Bed House) as the proper position for our troops.” Beferring him to the instructions already given, and the views of Colonel Whittlesey and Major Frothingham, Colonel Irvine was informed on the same day that he “must act on his best judgment.”
On the 12th instant Colonel Irvine telegraphed me that he intended to move eastward along the northwest pike. He says: “My main force will be at the mill mentioned (Chisholm’s), eight miles from Oakland, with strong advance guard at the Bed House, say two hundred or three hundred men.” Our telegraphic correspondence was frequent each day, and conducted with a view to keep each other fully advised of all material facts.
On the 13th of July I was called in from Webster at about 11 a. m., and then I received a telegram from Maj. S. Williams, dated the 12th, at Beverly, and at Boaring Bun the 13th, saying:
General McClellan, having just learned that the rebel forces abandoned their positions at Laurel Hill last night, and are now making for Eastern Virginia, via the Louisville and Saint George pike, directs that you take the field at once, with all the force you can make available, to cut off their retreat. Two Pennsylvania regiments

at Cumberland have been directed to proceed forthwith to Rowlesburg by a special train and report to you. You can for the time being withdraw several companies from points on the railroad between Wheeling and Parkersburg, and concentrate them by special train. No time is to be lost. It is supposed you will be able to take the field with, sav, six thousand men, including Colonel Irvine’s command, and at least four guns. The rebel forces under Garnett are said to be to-night about six miles from Leadsville. Morris is following them up.
I immediately telegraphed Colonel Irvine:
The rebels are driven out of Laurel Hill, and in full retreat eastward on Saint George pike. Hold your position with firmness to the last man. I will re-enforce you in person and with all available forces as soon as possible.
It was not deemed safe to depend upon any of the Pennsylvania troops. (None came at any time or reported.)
The suggestion of six thousand troops and four guns was supposed to he an approximate rule. To comply with it near four thousand troops, in detachments scattered along the line of the two railroads to Parkersburg and Wheeling, would have to be gathered up, supplied with a reasonable amount of baggage, teams, forage, and six days’ rations, and horses and harnesses must be obtained for the three guns in battery at Grafton. Requisitions were therefore made, and by reaching to Parkersburg the figures were brought up to about 5,400 men, including detachments from the Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Eighteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-second Ohio, with a few artillerists and cavalry, and detachments from the First and Second Virginia Regiments. These troops were almost entirely destitute of baggage wagons, and nearly all of those subsequently obtained, being otherwise appropriated, were to be got by force only.
The orders were all given and answers obtained, except as to baggage teams, by 3 m. of the 13th. The troops and three guns to be moved from Grafton were much delayed for the want of horses, harnesses, and wagons, and the first train, with four companies of infantry, was not able to leave for Oakland until after 4 p. m. I went in that train, and arrived in Oakland about 10 o’clock p. m. The second train from Grafton, with a few more infantry of the Twentieth, three guns, and twenty-five cavalry, came up soon after. For all on these two trains there was but one baggage wagon, and that belonged to Colonel Morton, of the Twentieth. As soon as the horses of myself and staff could be got off from the cars and a guide obtained, all of the infantry (three companies), not required for guard duty, were ordered forward to Chisholm’s Mill, with Major Walcutt and Captain Bond, of my staff, to report to Colonel Irvine. They arrived there at about 4 a. m. of the 14th. Found no troops there; and, leaving the three companies to rest, went on and reported in person to Colonel Irvine at West Union, at about 6 o’clock a. m., a few minutes before he received news that the rebels had already passed the Red House, at 5 a. m., eight miles farther east. Colonels Irvine and Depuy immediately called to arms and went in pursuit, Major Walcutt with them. Captain Bond returned to Oakland to notify me, but, owing to the fatigue of his horse, did not arrive until 9 a. m.
Anticipating the arrival during the night of several other trains, including that having the horses, wagons, and harnesses ordered to be taken and brought on, I had given orders for such as should come up to march at daylight, by way of Chisholm’s Mill, not then knowing any other way to reach the Red House Junction. Several trains were known to have been on the way in time to arrive at Oakland long before daylight. The train with the horses, wagons, and harnesses was reported to be at Rowlesburg before 12 the preceding night, and this property was separated, and portions of it were said to be at Cranberry Summit 15 R R—VOL II

[Chap. IX.
the next morning at 9 o’clock. All the trains but the two first were equally and unaccountably delayed. From daylight till 9 o’clock my utmost efforts with the telegraph seemed to avail little or nothing. The regimental commanders, Colonels Dunning, Stanley, Morton, Smith, and Turley, were equally balked by railroad detentions. Without waiting further, the twenty-five cavalry and the few of Colonel Morton’s Twentieth Infantry had formed to move on, when Captain Bond arrived at 9 a. m. with news of the escape, as before stated.
Before this I had relied with entire confidence that the line was occupied as stated in Colonel Irvine’s telegraph of the 12th instant, instead of which it now appears that his troops were at West Union, eight miles west of the Bed House, where the Horseshoe Bun road, traveled by the rebels, intersects the Northwest pike; and it also appears by the statement of Lieut. H. A. Myers and Angier Dobbs, of the cavalry attached to Colonel Irvine’s command, that all scouts and pickets had been withdrawn, by Colonel Irvine’s order, from that road early on the 13th, and the road left entirely free all night long. On this subject see Colonel Irvine’s report, herewith presented.
As soon as possible after Captain Bond’s arrival at Oakland, the horses were taken from Colonel Morton’s baggage wagon and hitched to one of the guns, and, with the few of Colonel Morton’s infantry then arrived, started in the pursuit, while I moved on with as much dispatch as possible with my aid, Captain Bond, a guide, and twenty-five cavalry. At Bed House I found the gun sent to Colonel Irvine some days before, one company of his infantry, and a few prisoners captured that morning. Ordering forward all but eight of the cavalry, I stopped a few moments to gather information and make dispositions rendered necessary in consequence of the (since found to be erroneous) reports that there was a body of rebel troops yet to come up. I moved forward again with five of the cavalry, and soon overtook Colonels Irvine, Depuy, and their commands, which were halted about six miles east of the Bed House. A council was immediately called, including the field officers and captains of all the companies, in order to learn the actual condition of the men and all other facts that should govern the action of the command. A free interchange of facts and opinions occurred, when the facts found and opinions arrived at were, that the enemy had passed the Bed House, about three thousand strong, including from three to five guns and several hundred cavalry, before 5 o’clock in the morning, the artillery covering the rear.
That the very sparse settlements along the line of the march had been and were being so stripped of provisions by the enemy that no reliance could be placed upon getting any kind of supplies in their track.
That none of the companies that marched over the night before from Oakland had any supper, and that very few, if any, in the whole command had any breakfast, and the haversacks were almost entirely empty, and wholly so with the most of the men.
There did not appear to be on an average one day’s rations for the men then on the march drawn and unconsumed. For the whole but one wagon; and all there was in the way of means of transportation, provisions, camp equipage, and cooking utensils had been left in the rear and in camp.
The whole force then in the column, I think, did not exceed 1,300 men.
If the pursuit continued, the march for many miles must be over the ranges of the Alleghany Mountains, with no known possibility of cutting the enemy oft* or attacking him in flank, even though the pursuers could overtake the pursued. The mounted scouts, reconnoiter-

ing to the front, were sent out before my arrival, and did not report to me. I cannot, therefore, state from them the distance between the two armies before our return ; but Colonels Irvine and Depuy, in their reports, state the least distance to have been eight miles, and that while our command was halted the enemy had reached Stony Eiver.
Captain Keys, who, after overtaking Colonel Irvine, led the small detachment of cavalry, and serving as an advance guard, told me since our return that he saw none of the enemy, except a few stragglers a long distance off.
The fatigued condition of our men, and all of the matters above being considered in council (except the distance between forces, which was subject to speculation), a distinct vote was taken upon the question whether the command should then continue the pursuit or return, and every officer but three, in the whole numbering about twenty, was emphatic in opposition to further pursuit in the then condition of the command, and every officer voted against going forward except one—a major, who declined voting—and in that vote I fully concurred. What any one might have done under different circumstances and in the light of different facts it is idle now to speculate.
It is proper here to say, that on the march east from the Red House no prisoners were taken, nor were abandoned arms or articles of any importance found, so far as I have been able to learn.
To be in more convenient communication with the railroad at Oakland, and nearer to their camp equipage and supplies, the troops were marched back to Red House. On the way Colonel Morton’s infantry and one gun were met about two miles from the Red House. On arriving at Red House it was found that there were not provisions enough to give all of our troops there assembled one full meal without drawing from Oakland, and there being as yet no means of transportation, Colonel Morton’s companies and two companies of the Virginia troops marched back to Oakland to their dinners, suppers, and camp equipage, arriving there about 9 o’clock in the evening.
Late in the afternoon of the 14th, Col. T. R. Stanley and Lieutenant-Colonel Turley, of the Eighteenth and Twenty-second Ohio, from Clarksburg, had arrived at Oakland, and during that night Colonel Dunning, of the Fifth, also from Clarksburg, arrived at Oakland, as did Col. W. S. Smith, of the Thirteenth Regiment, at Grafton, from Parkersburg, each with his command, endeavoring to respond to my orders. In anticipation of a movement forward the next day, if meaus of transportation and horses and harnesses for the guns should be obtained, and information should come in indicating probable success in following the retreating enemy, orders were given that all of the troops at Red House and Oakland should be immediately provided with two days’ cooked rations, and be put in readiness to march. Such information did come about 2 p. m. of the 15th, and while it was being considered, and a plan of operations discussed with the commandants of regiments at Oakland, a dispatch from department headquarters at Huttonsville was received, dated the 14th, addressed to me, saying:
Garnett’s army completely routed yescerday, 13th, at 2 p. m., at Cheat River, on the Saint George road. Baggage captured; one gun taken; Garnett killed; his forces demoralized.
I charge you. to complete your operations by the capture of the remainder of his force. If you have but one regiment, attack and check them until others arrive. You may never have such another op portunity again. Do not throw it away. Conduct this movement in person, and /ollow them a Voutrance (to the utmost)!

Couriers by two different routes bad brought me intelligence that the enemy having burned the bridge at Stony River, on the Northwest pike, early in the afternoon of Sunday, had gone into camp a little east of Greenland, with intention to remain for several days, and had burned the bridge at the gap there, to protect them from a rear attack. Learning also that Stony River could be passed without serious delay; that the camp a little east of Greenland could be turned by a march from New Creek Station and also by a detour to the right in proceeding from the west by way of Greenland, and believing that a strong expedition moving with celerity might expect to reach the enemy at or before he would reach Petersburg and return in safety, I considered that such a movement would be within my discretion, and also within my instructions.
Accordingly, Colonel Stanley, with nearly 600 men of the Eighteenth Regiment, and Colonel Dunning, with 700 men of the Fifth Regiment, were ordered to move by the diagonal road from Oakland over the mountains to the bridge on the pike over the North Branch of the Potomac, there to be joined by eight companies of the Eighth Regiment, under Colonel Depuy; seven companies of the Sixteenth, under Colonel Irvine; six companies of the Fifteenth, under Col. G. W. Andrews, and two companies of the First Virginia Regiment, which were to move from Red House with the Ringgold Cavalry, Captain Keys, and two guns of Captain Damn’s battery; Colonel Morton, with six companies of the Twentieth Ohio and two Virginia companies, and Lieutenant-Colonel Turley, with five companies of the Twenty-second Ohio and two guns of Captain Damn’s battery, were ordered to proceed by railroad to New Creek Station, to attack the enemy from the north. The column to form its junction on the Northwest pike, at the North Branch of the Potomac, was to move towards Greenland, and leaving that on its left, press on to the intersection of roads leading to Petersburg and Moorefield, and to be followed by Col. Wo S. Smith, with the Thirteenth Regiment and a battery of two guns—he having been ordered up from Grafton, where he was waiting on the cars. The different columns were to, and did, keep up communication by couriers, and were to co-operate whenever the case required.
The column of Colonels Dunning and Stanley left Oakland with me at 5 p. m. on the 15th; was joined by Colonel Irvine’s column, as intended, and marched inside of the first twenty-four hours to Groves’, five miles beyond Greenland, the distance being estimated at thirty-five and a half miles from Oakland. The enemy broke up his camp near Greenland and retired as we approached that place, and reached Petersburg in the afternoon or evening of the 16th. That night we were but fourteen miles from the enemy, and scouts were sent towards Petersburg, as also towards Moorefield and Romney, to keep watch of the enemy’s movements in all directions. The column from the west, with the first division of one-third of the whole, made up of picked men, got off early the next morning, and after a four-mile march was stopped by a courier with a dispatch from Major-General McClellan, ordering the pursuit to be abandoned.
It was subsequently ascertained that the enemy had resumed his inarch in the direction of Staunton. The column would have abandoned the pursuit at any rate if the enemy could not have been reached at or in the immediate vicinity of Petersburg. The column marched back to Greenland, and there all the troops of the expedition were united, and remained for the night. The next day the entire body marched by the Northwest pike to the North Branch of the Potomac and encamped.

Sending the Eighth Regiment, Colonel Depuy, to the Red House, and the baggage around by the same route, the other troops marched to Oakland, arriving there about 10 a. m. Friday, the 19th instant. The march was certainly a very trying one, and brought out the good qualities of the officers and men to a remarkable degree. Too much could not be said in praise of the cheerful spirit and persevering fortitude of the command.
With the most active and thorough use of scouts, mounted men, and on foot, the country was ascertained to be so clear of the enemy in any force as to give no indications of his interrupting our movements during the period intended to be covered by the expedition.
Appended is a map, showing the topography of the country and the line of march.

General : In reply to your order of the 19th instant, requiring me to report the steps taken by me to intercept the retreat of the rebels from Laurel Hill, I have the honor to report that in obedience to your order I occupied and fortified the junction of the Buffalo turnpike with the Northwest road, together with the Cheat Bridge. Subsequent reconnaissances indicated the occupation of a point farther to the eastward on the Northwestern road, and upon the suggestion of Colonel Whittlesey, and your approval, I occupied the junction of the Saint George turnpike with the Northwestern with two companies, which by the reconnaissances then made was supposed to be the extreme eastern point of access to the Northwestern road from the vicinity of Laurel Hill.
On the information received from you I advanced with the remainder of my regiment (in ali seven companies) and one gun to West Union on Friday night, the 11th of July, arriving shortly after midnight, where I was joined by Colonel Depuy, of the Eighth Ohio, with his six companies. On Saturday, the 12th, Colonel Depuy and myself made reconnaissances of the roads in the vicinity, but failed to get the correct information sought. It was not until near midnight of the 12th that I learned that the road entering the Northwest pike at Red House was not a branch of the Saint George pike. I immediately dispatched mounted scouts to Horseshoe Run road (the one entering at Red House), and they brought me information of the passage of the enemy at about 6£ o’clock of the 15th. I immediately put my command in motion, and marched eastward on the Northwest pike to Red House, where I learned the enemy had left at 5 o’clock a. m. I followed, crossing

Backbone Mountain, and halted to rest my men two miles west of North Branch Bridge, where I was overtaken by you. My command had already marched fourteen miles, most of them without breakfast. I had but few rations to send forward, if I had transportation, but I had not a single wagon to carry anything. At the consultation then held, a full statement being made by the respective commanding officers of their condition and of yours, in regard to want of transportation, it was determined to abandon the pursuit, in which opinion there was a unanimous concurrence, with, I believe, a single exception amongst over twenty officers.
At that time the enemy were at Stony River Bridge, which they subsequently destroyed before even fresh troops could have reached them from where we then were. Subsequent operations being conducted under your own eye, I suppose are not called for in this hasty report, made under circumstances forbidding accuracy of date and detail.

Sir : In compliance with your order, dated July 19, 1861, requiring me to transmit you a full account of my proceedings with my command to pursue and intercept the rebel forces retreating from Laurel Hill, by way of Saint George and Red House Corners, on Sunday, July 14, 1861, with the number of my forces, the amount of provisions on hand, and means of transportation, herewith I present the following report:
I arrived at West Union from Oakland with four companies of my command on Saturday morning, July 13, at 1 a. m., in a violent rain storm, having been compelled to leave two companies at Chisholm’s Mill to guard all of my teams which had given out. They arrived at West Union at 9 a. m., making my force six companies, of 578 men. At 9 a. m., July 13, I waited on Colonel Irvine, of the Sixteenth Ohio Regiment, and we proceeded to examine the country for five miles in the different directions which we supposed the enemy would take. On our return Colonel Irvine received a dispatch from you, informing him that the enemy were retreating by way of Saint George. As yet not knowing but that West Union would be the route they would be compelled to take, owing to the impassable state of the other roads leading from Saint George across the country and intercepting the western turnpike, I, with Colonel Irvine and Major Bailey, immediately selected two positions, one south of West Union one-half mile, and the other one mile west, either of them strong enough to have defended us from any numbers. I ordered my men to lay upon their arms in readiness to take position at a moment’s warning.

At 5J a. m. Sunday morning Colonel Irvine’s scouts came in, and in-formedlne that the enemy were retreating by way of Red House Corners. We immediately got under way and gave chase, arriving at the Corners at 7 a. m., a distance of seven miles. Here we learned they had passed at 5 a. m., with the exception of a regiment or two still back. We immediately selected two companies of rifles—one from the Eighth, Captain Daggett, and one from the Sixteenth—and ordered them to proceed southward toward Texas Corners, and meet them if possible upon advantageous grounds, the main body, supposed to be, from what we learned from prisoners, about 5,000 strong, having got two and a half [hours] the start. We continued the chase until we were within eight miles of them, having traveled six miles. We halted to make reconnaissance, when we were overtaken by General Hill. The balance of our march was made under the supervision of the commanding general.
When I started on Sunday morning in pursuit many of my command had taken no breakfast, and made the entire march of that day with but half a biscuit. We had not one day’s provisions on hand, and our means of transportation were so limited as to cut off the hope of an immediate supply. My command had at that time received no horses or wagons from the Government, and my only means of transportation were teams pressed into service from farmers in and about Oakland.

Accordingly I dispatched Major Lamison over the line of said road, with instructions to withdra w from said line Companies A, F, I, and K, and proceed with them to such point as he might learn I would occupy, unless otherwise instructed. On the afternoon of same day I proceeded, with a detachment of one company of the Virginia First, Captain Britt; one company of the Virginia Second; two pieces of artillery, under Captain Daum; and Companies B and E, of the Twentieth Regiment O.

Sir: On Monday, July 15, I received your order to proceed with Companies A, Captain Nichols; B, Captain Dodds; E, Captain Mott; E, Lieutenant Taylor; I, Captain Cable; K, Lieutenant Adams, quartermaster (detailed to this special duty), of the Twentieth Begiment Ohio Volunteer Militia, and Companies---of the Twenty second Reg-
iment Ohio Volunteer Militia, under Lieutenant-Colonel Turley; one detachment of a company of the Virginia First, Captain Britt; one company of the Virginia Second, Captain Ewing, and two pieces of artillery, under the command of Captain Daum, numbering in all about 900 men, to New Creek, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and thence strike the Northwestern Virginia turnpike for the purpose of cutting off the retreat of the rebel forces passing over that road from Laurel Hill. The advanced guard, with the artillery, left Oakland at 4 o’clock p. m., under command of Major Lamison, but on account of the want of telegraphic communication was delayed by the conductor of the train until 8 o’clock p. m. within one mile of Oakland.
At 2 o’clock a. m., July 16,1 arrived at New Creek, and at 3 a. m. put my command in motion, and for the want of means of transportation, and that my movements might not be delayed, I took no baggage, except one-third of the cooking utensils and one day’s rations. We breakfasted after a march of six miles, and proceeded to Ridgeville, having learned that the enemy were in force at that place. Finding no force at that point, I proceeded, over a most rugged and difficult road, almost impassable for the artillery, to Martin’s Gap, after a march of fifteen hours, making thirty-three miles, at which place your courier reached us, ordering us to join you at Greenland, two and a half miles distant, at which place we arrived at 11 o’clock a. m. on Wednesday, July 17. J oining your forces at Martin’s Gap, I learned that the advance of the enemy, about 1,000, had encamped at that place on Sunday, July 14, about 10 o’clock a. m., and that, learning of the approach of our forces, had hastily retreated on Saturday, at 6 o’clock p. m., for Petersburg. In their retreat they destroyed the bridge over Patterson’s Greek, making the road impassable for wagons, and was therefore compelled to send my artillery around over the Northwestern turnpike, a distance of seven miles farther than pursued by my command. Being without a baggage train and ambulance, with short rations, the march was a most trying one, and to the endurance of men and officers and their cheerfulness and hearty co-operation I am indebted for the celerity of my movements, and for which all deserve much praise.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Oakland, Md., July 19, 1861.
In answer to your order, directing me to report to you the steps taken by me to intercept the rebels in their late flight from Laurel Hill, the force I had to march against them, &c., I have to say: On Saturday, 13th instant, at about 4 o’clock p. m., immediately after receiving your orders to move all my available forces up Cheat River from Rowles-burg, so as to take position near the bridge of the river, some four miles south of Rowlesburg, I moved what forces I could spare, making, with what I already had at that camp (Cheat River), about four hundred and fifty.
Before going to the bridge I sent for the late sheriff of Preston County, Yirginia, knowing him to be a loyal man, and very intelligent and useful in describing the geography of the country. I directed him to summon to his aid four other citizens in whom we could fully confide, and report them to me at Cheat River forthwith. He did all I required with great promptitude. After this preparation I marched to Cheat River Bridge, and arrived there about 8J o’clock p. m. same day. Mr. Shaffer sat down with me in my tent, and made a rough and hasty draught of the

country between Laurel Hill and Oakland and the Eed House, showing a main road running from a northward point from Laurel Hill to the N Northwestern turnpike, intersecting the same at the Eed House5 also showing many roads approaching the same5 also a road leading to Saint George northward to my camp, with various approaches. In the opinion of Mr. Shaffer, and those who were in attendance with him, awaiting orders to act as scouts, the rebels must pass along the first-mentioned road, leading to the Northwestern turnpike, so as to strike the turnpike at the Eed House. With the light I had before me I concurred in this opinion, and was about to take the available force of my command w ith the two companies of the First Virginia Eegiment, and immediately march to the road described as running from Laurel Hill to the Northwestern turnpike, so as to take position on the said road south westward from West Union about seven miles—about the same distance from the Eed House and some fifteen miles from my camp. But, reflecting on my instructions, I thought you had scarcely authorized me so to do. 1 abandoned the contemplated march, and concluded to send out mounted scouts, well armed, in the direction last mentioned, as well as in and around Saint George. Accordingly, at about 10 o’clock p. m., I dispatched four scouts, well armed and mounted, with directions to reach the Laurel Hill and Northwestern turnpike road as soon as possible westward from West Union, and to reconnoiter then the approaches thereto. This duty would take them over a very rough road (most of the way) some sixteen or eighteen miles. I directed them to first report to Colonel Irvine’s command, then at West Union, if they should make important discoveries nearer to him than to me, then hasten on to me. I also sent a scout in disguise to take observations about Saint George and the road leading from that point to my camp; also many scouts not mounted in various directions.
The first-named mounted scouts reached the road they desired at about 1 o’clock a. m. Sunday morning, and soon discovered the enemy in large numbers, and to get out of his reach they were obliged to secrete themselves for a short time. This was southwestward from West Union about seven or eight miles, of course much nearer Colonel Irvine’s than to my own command, and so, in obedience to my orders, he was notified before the messengers came to me. This notice, lam informed, was given between 3 and 4 o’clock a. m. same day. The horses of these scouts gave out, by which means I did not receive the report until 10 o’clock a. m. Little before 11 o’clock a. m. I started with all the force I could spare, with one day’s cooked rations, together with parts of the two Virginia companies, making altogether about 450, and arrived at the Eed House, passing through West Union, at 3£ o’clock p. m., a distance of eighteen or nineteen miles. When I arrived I found Colonel Irvine’s force, part of Colonel Depuy’s (Eighth Ohio), and a few of the Twentieth Ohio, under your own personal command, with two pieces of ordnance, that had been in hot pursuit several hours before me. Not gaining on the enemy, and our forces being considerably out of strength, and without any provision, and it plainly appearing that further immediate pursuit would be futile, under your order all our forces turned back and encamped at Eed House. Leaving my force, I returned to Cheat Eiver to order provisions and transportation forward.
On the next day (Monday) I received from you an order to join a forward movement from the Eed House, with all the forces of my command I could spare from the duties already assigned me.
At about 8 o’clock p. m. on Monday, 15th instant, I joined the column

under your command with about same force I took to the Eed House (450), and moved eastwardly on the Northwestern turnpike in imrsuit of the enemy. I left with two days7 rations, and ordered more to be sent. I had no transportation facilities, and could take little baggage of any kind. With some difficulty my quartermaster impressed two teams, which served to transport a few cooking utensils and the scanty provisions I took along. We pursued the enemy under your personal command little over two days, and seemed to gradually near him, when on Wednesday, the 17th, the column was turned back. The whole command marched back to this point in two days, somewhat fatigued, but in the best of order, and in very good spirits. * My own I know to be particularly so.

I was ordered by General Hill on the 7th of July to take twenty-five men of the Ringgold Cavalry to serve as mounted scouts under command of Colonel Irvine, of the Sixteenth Ohio, and reported my command to him on the same night. Colonel Irvine was then posted near Cheat River Bridge. I remained attached to his command until Monday, the 15th of July. On the morning of the 8th six men of my command were sent by order of Colonel Irvine out on the Saint George road, sometimes called the Horseshoe Run road, that intersects the Northwestern turnpike at Red House, to Rinehart’s School-House. They remained there until Saturday, the 13th, when they were ordered by Colonel Irvine to come into his camp at West Union, which they did the same afternoon. I had ascertained from persons living on the Saint George road before mentioned that the rebels were retreating, and would be through on that road from Saint George to Red House on Saturday night or Sunday, and reported the same to Colonel Irvine. I told him I thought it important that scouts should be sent out in that direction, and gave him the information I had received. He replied that there were other points of more importance.
About sundown on Saturday, the 13th, a man came up from the neighborhood of Rinehart’s School-House, and told me that he had heard that they were coming through on that road. I again went to Colonel Irvine and gave him this information, and told him that some of my boys were anxious to go out on that road. He said he would see about it, and walked away. I returned to my quarters, and remained there pursuant to his orders.

Congratulatory address from General McClellan.
Army of Occupation, Western Virginia,
Beverly, Va., July 16,1861.
Soldiers of the Army of the West!
I am more than satisfied with you.
You have annihilated two armies, commanded by educated and experienced soldiers, intrenched in mountain fastnesses fortified at their leisure. You have taken five guns, twelve colors, fifteen hundred stand of arms, one thousand prisoners, including more than forty officers— one of the two commanders of the rebels is a prisoner, the other lost his life on the field of battle. You have killed more than two hundred and fifty of the enemy, who has lost all his baggage and camp equipage. All this has been accomplished with the loss of twenty brave men killed and sixty wounded on your part.
You have proved that Union men, fighting for the preservation of our Government, are more than a match for our misguided and erring brethren; more than this, you have shown mercy to the vanquished. You have made long and arduous marches, often with insufficient food, frequently exposed to the inclemency of the weather. I have not hesitated to demand this of you, feeling that I could rely on your endurance, patriotism, and courage.
In the future I may have still greater demands to make upon you, still greater sacrifices for you to offer. It shall be my care to provide for you to the extent of my ability; but I know now that by your valor and endurance you will accomplish all that is asked.
Soldiers! I have confidence in you, and I trust you have learned to confide in me. Remember that discipline and subordination are qualities of equal value with courage.
I am proud to say that you have gained the highest reward that American troops can receive—the thanks of Congress and the applause of your fellow-citizens.

Sir: I reached Huttonsville on the 14th instant. I found there twenty-three companies of infantry, mostly mustered into service, but in a miserable condition as to arms, clothing, equipments, instruction, and discipline. Twenty of these companies were organized into two regiments, the one under Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson and the other under Lieutenant-Colonel Heck. Though wholly incapable, in my judgment, of rendering anything like efficient service, I deemed it of such importance to possess myself of the two turnpike passes over the Rich and Laurel Mountains, before they should be seized by the enemy, that I left Huttonsville on the evening of the 15th with these two regiments

I regard these two passes as the gates to the northwestern country, and, had they been occupied by the enemy, my command would have been effectually paralyzed or shut up in the Cheat River Valley. I think it was a great mistake on the part of the enemy not to have remained here after driving Colonel Porterfield’s command over it. I have caused all the country roads leading from the northwestern country, which cross this range of mountains between the foot of Cheat Mountain and Saint George, the county seat of Tucker County, to be blocked up by cutting large trees across them. I have done this to prevent the enemy from getting into my rear and cutting off my supplies, which, so far, I have been obliged to obtain chiefly from Staunton.
By sending out heavy escorts I am now endeavoring to collect grain and cattle, both from the direction of Philippi and Buckhannon. I have made Beverly for the present my principal depot. I propose in a few days to send the three small companies left at Huttonsville, six miles farther south, to the foot of Cheat Mountain, where, in a strong position, which I shall improve, I shall establish them, and deposit two days’ supplies for my entire command.
The road from Saint George to Cheat River Bridge, on the railroad, is a country road, and scarcely practicable for wheels. My last information, which is, of course, not very reliable, is that the enemy have blocked up this road from the Cheat Bridge to where it is crossed by the Northwestern turnpike, which leads by Evansville to Grafton. If this proves to be true, it will increase my difficulties in getting on this railroad very much. Should they have done the same thing on all the roads crossing the railroad from the south, they will have put the railroad, I fear, beyond the reach of my present force. This force I consider more than sufficient to hold these two passes, but not sufficient to hold the railroad, if I should get an opportunity of seizing it at any particular point; for I must have an adequate force in each of the passes to secure them for our use. My best chance of getting at the railroad seems at present to be by the Morgantown road, a road which leads from Yeager’s (see map) to Evansville. When once at Evansville, which is on the Northwestern turnpike, I should threaten equally Grafton (twelve miles distant) and Cheat Bridge (fourteen miles distant), at both of which points they now have a force which they would be compelled to keep in this position, and thus enable me to get at the road at Independence, five miles from Evansville, destroy it there, and then fall upon the force at Cheat Bridge (by marching on the railroad) before it could be re-enforced from Grafton. The objection to this operation is that it enables the enemy at Philippi to throw himself upon my rear. If, however, I had sufficient force to hold this post securely, my remaining force could regain it from Cheat Bridge, by way of Saint George, with a little work on that road; the roads from Philippi leading over the Laurel Mountain into that road, four in number, having, as I have already stated, been blocked up by me. My moving force (say three thousand), however, will not be sufficient, I fear, for this operation.
The various accounts which I get of the enemy’s strength (none positive or even reliable) represent him as having from four to seven thousand at Philippi, with from six to ten pieces of artillery, and that he is intrenched on the hill behind the town, about three thousand at Graf-

ton, three or four thousand at Clarksburg, and about two thousand at Cheat Bridge. I have been, so far, wholly unable to get anything like accurate or reliable information as to the numbers, movements, or intentions of the enemy, and begin to believe it almost an impossible thing. The Union men are greatly in the ascendency here, and are much more zealous and active in their cause than the secessionists. The enemy are kept fully advised of our movements, even to the strength of our scouts and pickets, by the country people, while we are compelled to grope in the dark as much as if we were invading a foreign and hostile country.
The Georgia regiment reached me yesterday. I hear nothing definite about the two remaining companies of the Twentieth Begiment, and the four remaining companies of Colonel Fulkerson’s. There has elapsed scarcely time for me to hear of the result of my application for two additional companies of cavalry. They are greatly needed here. The maps give very incorrect impressions as to the number of roads in this region of country.
I have heard nothing of the medical stores for my command, nor of other requisitions made on the Ordnance and Quartermaster’s Departments. I hope that they may be urged to fill them as speedily as possible. Many of my men are without blankets or tents*. The nights are frequently cold and we have frequent rains.
I shall have the defenses of this place complete in a week. The Buck-hannon Pass is naturally much stronger, and the regiment there will be able to hold five times their number in check for a sufficient time to admit of being re-enforced, if they will stand to their work.
At Philippi the enemy occupy the heights beyond the town, in the direction of Grafton. They have mined the bridge and thrown abatis in the ford. It is further said that they have blocked up the road on this side of Philippi. Until I can get some additional cavalry I shall not have adequate means of determining to what extent these reports are true.
This communication is rather lengthy, I fear, for the general to read, but, as I do not propose to trouble him often, I have deemed it best to report fully the condition of things under my command.
Two companies of infantry are being organized in Beverly, under Colonel Porterfield, whom I have assigned temporarily to the command of that place. Captain Bice’s company is also ordered to form part of his command, after turning over his battery to Captain Anderson. Accessions to my command come in very slowly.
No periodical muster rolls for June 30 have yet arrived, nor any other blank forms. The general’s order, in relation to the court of inquiry, had already been anticipated. The proceedings will be forwarded in a day or two. I was aware of the road by Stribling Springs, but it is impossible to cut off all communication with the enemy. The mass of the country people is against us.
I have already addressed several communications to General Cooper, and asked for instructions as to the proper person to address. Be pleased to inform me on this point.
At the end of this month I shall send a return of my force. I am pushing the instruction of the men with all possible activity.

Headquarters, Richmond, Va., July 1,1861. Gen. R. S. Garnett, Commanding Northwestern Army:
General : I have received your letter of the 25th instant [tilt.], reporting the condition and distribution of your force and your projected plan of operations. I have taken great pleasure in submitting it to the President, and trust you will be able to accomplish your purposes. The rupture of the railroad at Cheat River would be worth to us an army. The companies of the Twentieth and Thirty-seventh Regiments have been forwarded to you; also two companies of cavalry. Another squadron will be furnished if desired. I have ordered Capt. G. Jackson to report to you for duty with the cavalry. His commission will entitle him to precedence over officers of the same grade in the volunteer service. He is a cavalry officer of some experience. Everything that you have required has been sent as far as practicable. The remainder will be forwarded as fast as available. Muster rolls were sent some time since. Your correspondence can be addressed to this office as usual.

Lieut. Col. George Deas,
Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : It is with great reluctance that I feel constrained to call for an addition to my present force, for I know that these calls are coming in upon the Government from all quarters of the State, and from some, perhaps, more immediately threatened than I am, as far as I know; but, with the railroad running across my entire front, I have become satisfied that I cannot operate beyond my present position with any reasonable expectation of substantial success, with the present force under my command, and I deem it my duty to state the fact. My hope of increasing my force in this region has, so far, been sadly disappointed. Only eight men have joined me here, and fifteen at Colonel Heck’s camp, not sufficient to make up my losses by discharges, &c. These people are thoroughly imbued with an ignorant and bigoted Union sentiment. Unless success was reduced to a certainty, it would be imprudent to abandon the passes I now hold, yet they cannot be held securely with less than two thousand men, which would reduce my movable force to twenty-five hundred. If the necessities of the Government could afford it, I should be glad to have three or four thousand more men; but I must content myself with asking for as many only as can be spared, in the judgment of the Government.
We hear, though with what truth it is impossible to say, that the enemy is receiving accessions to his force. Twenty-two car loads are reported to have re-enforced the force at Cheat Bridge. This and some other movements of the enemy seem to indicate an intention of getting in my rear from that point by the Saint George road, and this will require another division of my force, or compel me to fall back to Leadsville, where that road comes into this $ but this operation would lose this position to us. I shall transfer to-day Colonel Heck’s regiment to that road, and send five companies, under Colonel Hansborough, to relieve him in his present position, which is a strong one. If necessary, I shall send a regiment from this place to join Colonel Heck. The iron

guns will be very acceptable for this or the Buckhannon Pass. If I could get two others, it would give me the bronze batteries for service with my movable force.
I have been waiting anxiously for a quartermaster of experience, but none has yet appeared. It would relieve me of much labor and anxiety if I had a competent officer to take these duties off my shoulders. The muster rolls have not yet arrived.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. S. GABNETT, Brigadier- General.
P. S.—Unless I have been misinformed as to the state of feeling among the people and the condition of things in the Kanawha Valley, it is my opinion that General Wise’s command could be of more service to the cause by operating in the direction of Parkersburg and the Northwestern Bailroad. It would produce a very effective diversion in favor of the operations from this point.

General B. S. Garnett, Laurel Hill, Va.:
General : In answer to your letter of the 1st instant, just received, I have the honor to state that the Forty-fourth regiment, Col. W. O. Scott, left here on the 2d instant for your command. There has been some delay in preparing the Georgia regiment for the field, but I hope to get it off to-morrow. It consists of over one thousand men, commanded by Col. Edward Johnson, an officer of experience. On the following day I will dispatch a North Carolina regiment, commanded by Col. Stephen Lee, twelve hundred strong. I will endeavor to send you two other field pieces. I will again apply to Colonel Myers for a quartermaster of experience for your command.

Lieut. Col. George Leas,
Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General:
Colonel: In the postscript to a communication which I had the honor to address to you a few days ago, I ventured to suggest the expediency of giving a more northerly direction to General Wise’s column, in order to threaten the railroad and country east of Parkersburg, now in possession of the enemy. Some subsequent information has confirmed me in my convictions as to the propriety of such a movement. I learned a day or two since, from sources in my front, that twenty-eight hundred men, who had been put upon light-draught steamers in Pittsburgh to operate in the Kanawha Valley, were diverted from that purpose and landed at Parkersburg, from which place they came to Clarksburg and thence to Buckhannon, where, with others from Philippi, to the number, it is said, of three or four thousand, they have now taken up their position, with a supporting force at Weston and at Clarksburg—numbers unknown. This latter point, it is said, they are forti-

fying, and making of it a place of detention for the secessionists whom they have arrested in the country occupied by their troops, and whom hitherto they have been sending to Ohio. It is my belief that as long as they can be made to apprehend any danger to their possession of the railroad and country in front of me they will not attempt any inroads in the Kanawha Valley, as the movement above reported indicates, and that one of the most effectual means of keeping that valley free of them 4s to occupy them fully here. I moreover think that if General Wise’s column should move from Charleston direct upon Parkersburg, by the road through Jackson, Wirt, and Wood Counties, it would have the effect, not of withdrawing any troops from my front, but of bringing others into Virginia from Ohio and the West, as it could be done with equal facility and rapidity, and greater safety. But if he were tore-trace his steps from Charleston to Summersville, in Nicholas County, and thence go to Bulltown, in Braxton, both of which counties are loyal to our cause, he would be within a day’s march of Weston, and threaten both it and Buckhannon, and the enemy would have to draw from his force in my front to meet him. Communication with me could be had by way of Huttonsville.
The valley of the Kanawha is comparatively loyal to our cause, and the force under General Floyd would be abundant to meet any force which it is probable the enemy will send into that region for the present.
The latest, and I believe the most accurate, information which I have yet received from the front is that the enemy has seven regiments of infantry at Philippi—say between five and six thousand men—and twenty pieces o^'artillery, two of which are mortars. I scarcely think they have as much artillery as. that stated. At Grafton, a few days ago, there were only a few hundred; at Clarksburg they are represented as having about three thousand men; at Weston two thousand, and at Cheat River Bridge from two to three thousand. I cannot learn whether they have artillery at this bridge, or whether they are erecting any defenses about it. General McClellan, at last accounts, was at Grafton. General Morris in command at Philippi. Were these numbers correct it would put their force in Northwestern Virginia at about seventeen thousand men, though I hardly think it can amount to that number. The term of service of one of the Indiana regiments at Philippi expired a few days ago, and I learn that they are now kept there by force. I do not now think it probable that the enemy, notwithstanding his superiority of numbers, will attempt to attack my position unless the necessity for his force elsewhere becomes very imperative, for the simple reason that he has as much of northwestern country as he probably wants. He could have possessed himself of more of the country after Colonel Porterfield’s retreat, if he had desired it, yet refrained from doing so. The onus is upon us to drive him out of the country he already holds, if we can. It is impossible for me or any one else, in my judgment, to say what numbers (within our means) are necessary to effect this. The facilities, on the one hand, which they possess at present, of throwing men in my front from other States, and the numbers they have disposable for this purpose, with, on the other hand, the slow process to which we are subjected in re-enforcing our force, will always enable them to exceed our numbers, whatever they may be, to any degree they may deem necessary 5 for secrecy in the movements of my re-enforcements in this disaffected country is a thing impossible. It then becomes a question which must be decided by the authorities of the Government, whether the mere paralyzation of a superior force of the enemy, in my rront, with the hope of seizing the railroad, if an opportunity should 1G r R—VOL 11

offer itself, is a sufficient object to warrant the maintenance of all our available force in this region; for as I have just said, I do not suppose that this force can ever obtain a strength, relative to that of the enemy, which would warrant us in offering him battle wherever we could meet him. I have by no means relinquished or abated my hope of being able, on some favorable occasion, to get at the road. But this is a contingency. The only certain result we can calculate upon is that our presence here will necessarily occupy a considerable force of the enemy, and, to that extent, relieve other points of the State where they might be employed against us. It is not for me to determine what the value of this very negative result is, but I have deemed it my duty to state the case as it presented itself to my judgment. I can only say I shall watch vigilantly, and strike whenever arid wherever I can see a reasonable hope of success.
Colonel Starke arrived yesterday, and I am gratified to learn that I am to have an addition to my force, and sufficient supplies to secure the health and efficiency of my command for the present. I am exhausting the country immediately around me of grain and other supplies, and the operation of supplying myself almost exclusively from Staunton is becoming a serious difficulty with me on account of the scarcity of transportation. The crops are backward in this region, and I shall not be able to draw from them earlier than the end of August.
I stated in my letter of the 1st instant that Colonel Heck’s regiment had been ordered to take up a position on the Saint George road, and that he had been relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel Hansborough’s battalion of five companies. This arrangement was countermanded in consequence of the appearance of the enemy in force at Buckhannon. Lieutenant-Colonel Hansborough took the positions on the Saint George road assigned to Lieutenant-Colonel Heck.

Your opinion as to the advantage of giving a more northerly direction to General Wise’s column will be communicated to that officer,! and it is hoped that he will find himself in a condition to conform to it, and that with your united columns you will be able to fall upon the enemy. I do not think it probable that the enemy will confine himself to that portion of the northwest country which he now holds, but, if he can drive you back, will endeavor to penetrate as far as Ptaunton. Your object will be to prevent him, if possible, and to restrict his limits within the narrowest range, which, although outnumbered, it is hoped by skill and boldness you will accomplish.
Your recommendation of the appointment of Mr. G. Thomas Getty a lieutenant in the 0. S. Army will be complied with, and also the promotions of Capts. R, G. Cole and Julius A. De Lagnel. Should you feel embarrassed by the present rank of Capt. G. Jackson you will please

say so. Mr. S. M. Yost will also be appointed assistant quartermaster. The officers whom you state you have found in that region were appointed by the governor, in the hope that their standing and political influence would enable them to organize regiments of volunteers. The appointment of Col. L. Wilson has not been confirmed by the convention. He is, therefore, not in the service. Maj. P. B. Adams is the major of the Thirty-fifth Virginia Begiment, whom you were directed, in a previous letter, to cause to report to Col. Alfred Beckley. W. L. Jackson was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the same regiment. The regiments commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Heck and Lieutenant-Colonel Jack-son, I presume, are the Twenty-fifth, of which G. A. Porterfield is colonel, and the Thirty-first, of which W. J. Willey is colonel. Should I be correct, please number them accordingly, and inform me the field officers which you have attached to them. Should Lieutenant-Colonel Arnett, Maj. Boston Stewart, Second Lieut. J. Bosworth, Second Lieut. B. Haymond, and Lieutenant torment have no commauds with the troops of your army, and be unable to organize any volunteer companies, please let me know.

Commanding, (fie., Charleston, Va.:
General: In a letter received to-day from General Garnett, commanding Northwestern Army, he reports having learned from reliable sources that two thousand eight hundred men, who had been embarked on light draught steamers at Pittsburgh to operate in the Kanawha Valley, have been diverted from that purpose and landed at Parkersburg, from which place they have been advanced to Clarksburg and Buckhannon, and with other troops have taken up their position in his front. He thinks they will not attempt an invasion of the Kanawha Valley if made to apprehend danger of losing possession of the Northwestern Bailroad and country, and that one of the most effective means of keeping that valley free is to give General McClellan full occupation where he now is. He thinks that if your column should move from Charleston direct upon Parkersburg it would merely have the effect of bringing further re-enforcements from Ohio; but if it were to march from Summersville, in Nicholas County, to Bulltown, in Braxton, both of which are loyal to our cause, it would be within a few days’ march of Weston, and would threaten both it and Buckhannon, and that the enemy would thus be divided, and might be struck at in detail. Communication with General Garnett can be had by way of Hutton sville. He estimates the enemy’s force at six thousand men; at Grafton, a few hundred; at Clarksburg, about three thousand; at Weston, two thousand; and at Cheat Biver Bridge, from two to three thousand; making a total of about seventeen thousand men. General McClellan was said to be in command at Grafton and General Morris at Philippi.

Have the offices kept open night and day. I have had all the colonels of the militia of the county summoned to be here at 7 o’clock this morning, and will, according to your orders, have the whole militia of the county called out to-day. Every exertion shall be made to have all pushed up with promptness and dispatch. I will advise you by telegraph as further information reaches me. I cannot yet tell the extent of the disaster, but fear, from Colonel Scott’s retrograde movement, that it is serious, and also much fear that General Garnett will at least lose all his wagons and baggage going through Hardy.
Mr. Hughes, a member of the Convention, from the county of Ban-dolph, I think, was sent by Colonel Scott to Colonel Pegram, and was killed by our own men. Captain De Lagnel was dangerously wounded, and reported left on the field. Give my orders by telegraph as anything occurs. Please see the Quartermaster-General. I wrote to him by to-day’s mail, and you will see, from his letter, that I need instructions to purchase horses for the transportation required. I have asked to be furnished with $20,000.

President Davis:
Oar force has retreated to Monterey. We have no certain knowledge that the enemy have taken possession of Cheat Mountain in force. We hope that by prompt action it can be taken and held by our troops with suitable re-enforcements. Certainly they can hold other mountains west of Monterey. The enemy is in possession of Cheat Mountain, and still more at Monterey will find free passage to the Central Railroad, and to the valley in rear of General Johnston, unless vigorously opposed. There is a turnpike road from Huttonsville to Huntersville, and thence to the Warm Springs, and thence to the Central Railroad at Millborough, as well as to Jackson’s River and Lewisburg, from Monterey to the Warm Springs, and to Hardy County. There are turnpike roads to prevent the enemy coming from the direction of Warm Springs, or northeastwardly into the valley. We should hold Cheat Mountain, or be as neat it as possible, so as to threaten his rear and flank in any movement he makes, besides checking his advance in this direction, and keeping command of several roads for the advance of our troops. A force may be sent also to Jackson’s River, by the Central Railroad, or by canal and turnpike from Lynchburg. A piece or two of artillery, with powder, lead, and buckshot, for the militia, should be sent with this force. They cannot be bought in this county. Without prompt action a local reverse may become a general disaster. Excuse these suggestions.

Lieutenant Smith, of Lee’s Rifles, just arrived, reports that the fight commenced about 4 p. m., and lasted about one hour and a half. The enemy outnumbered us ten to one. We repulsed them three times. We lost forty killed and prisoners. Among the killed, Captain De Lagnel. We killed quite one hundred and fifty of the enemy. Captain Curry, who was wounded, came down the hill to the fort, and was the only one who did. The men in the engagement were not re-enforced from Heck’s command, because he was fearing an attack from the front, the enemy being in view. Heck brought his regiment out of the fortifications to retreat, about 11 o’clock at night, by order of Pegram, who had returned from the battle-field, hurt from a fall from his hors’e. Heck formed in the road, Lilley’s company in front, and started through the mountains in the dark, and soon got separated, about three hundred having arrived at Monterey. Nearly the whole of Pegram’s regiment are safe. It is

supposed that the missing will yet reach the camp. Heck left his four cannon, and about twenty teams and ordnance. Curry and Pegram were not in condition to leave the fort, and insisted on being left, and are supposed to be prisoners.

Major, Commanding.
Headquarters Forces, Staunton, Pa., July 15,1861.
Maj. Gen. Robert E. Lee:
Dear Sir : After your dispatch of to-day, I have informed all that no company would be received as a volunteer company for less than three years or the war, except those companies that were in process of organization before the proclamation.
I would earnestly suggest for your consideration and prompt action the great importance of fortifying Cheat Mountain, and sending forces on the right and left, so as to guard the road from Huttonsville to Huntersville, and prevent the enemy from approaching the Central Railroad, at either Millborough or Jackson’s River, and from near Beverly, through Hardy and Pendleton, and thence to Rockingham, in rear of General Johnston. I would call your attention to the fact that there is a very good road down on the eastern base of Cheat Mountain to Huntersville.
Our retreat, in my opinion, to Monterey, is disastrous to us. If not changed, by marching at once upon Cheat Mountain and taking possession of it and fortifying it, so that we can hold them in check in front, and flank them on the right and left, the retreat to Monterey will havo a very demoralizing effect upon our people. And I would urge upon you the great importance of keeping the enemy from ever touching this country, for Union men, in great numbers, would be found here in this county, and other counties in the valley, if the Federal troops were here in force to protect them. It is necessary, to keep all our people loyal, to keep the enemy from having an opportunity to tamper with many of them. Of course, I would not express this opinion where it would be spoken of, as it would have a bad effect; but I assure you it is nevertheless true.
I hope you will not consider me as desiring to press my opinions, but my knowledge of the country induces me to make these suggestions. I feel confident that if Colonel Scott had gone to the aid of Colonel Pegram we would have gained a victory instead of meeting with a serious defeat. The enemy displayed no courage after defeating us on the top of Rich Mountain, or the whole force at Camp Garnett would have been cut to pieces. If President Davis would take twelve-months’ yolunteers, the call for the militia could be turned to a good account.

attacked in the rear several times by the enemy and defeated; that on Saturday he himself was killed, and it would seem that his command had been routed and dispersed. It is reported that Colonel Heck surrendered. The enemy may advance upon this line towards Staunton, or upon the line by Huntersville and the Warm Springs, to the Central Railroad. Speedy re-enforcements, especially of engineers and artillery, are'needed, to enable us to hold our position should he advance. The effective force under my command amounts to from twenty-five hundred to three thousand men, with three pieces of artillery—G-pounders.

Dear Sir : Inclosed is a communication sent you by telegraph, after waiting hours for the office to open.* It is most important that the telegraph offices should be open night and day, and that we should have a through connection between Richmond and Staunton, instead of having a relay at Gordonsville, and thereby creating great delay. The instrument at this office is nearly worn-out, as I months ago informed the superintendent of the telegraph line at Richmond in person. See that these matters are corrected.
Yours, very respectfully,
M. G. HARMAN,
Major, Commanding.
P. S.—I have asked the President to allow me to establish a pony express from this place to Monterey and Winchester. By all means, ammunition of all sorts should be sent to this point immediately. I have been notified to report at Richmond, for settlement of my accounts as quartermaster, on the 15th of this month. My accounts are all ready, but the present unfortunate state of affairs will prevent my attendance. Is anything necessary for me to do in regard to it? Please advise me.

repeated feints and skirmishes, on the afternoon of Thursday the 11th, turning the left flank of our position at Camp Garnett—in large force. He succeeded, after a protracted and, on our side, a desperate struggle, in seizing the summit of the mountain, which had been held by a small body of our troops. Camp Garnett was thereupon abandoned. A portion of the force, which had occupied it, attempting, by a flank movement, to join General Garnett, were intercepted, and, it is said, taken prisoners. Other parties, from the same command, succeeded in making their escape by mountain paths, and are daily coming into this camp. General Garnett, abandoning his position at Laurel Hill, retreated upon the road, towards Beverly, with the design of joining Colonel Scott. Finding this impracticable, he renewed his retreat, following the road to Saint. George, and intending to fall back through Petersburg and Franklin upon this point. The enemy, in superior force, with cavalry and flying artillery, pursued him, and on Saturday, in the vicinity of the left branch of Cheat River, attacked his rear, defended by the First Georgia Regiment. It is said that the enemy was at first repulsed, and repulsed three times, with great loss; but, while a portion of his infantry was scattered in the wood, his artillery was finally brought to bear successfully upon our column. It was during one of these engagements that General Garnett, proceeding in person to the rear, himself fell. Yesrerday, when I sent you a telegram, I was quite satisfied, from the reports of fugitives, and from the absence of all communication with his command, that it must have been disorganized. I have since been led to hope (through no official channel, however) that a considerable body of them, disencumbered by abandonment of their wagon train, succeeded in continuing an organized retreat, and were yesterday upon the eastern declivity of the Alleghany Mountain, some fifteen miles from Petersburg. If this be true, I look for their arrival at this point on Friday next.
Colonel Johnson, pursuing the turnpike road towards Huttonsville, had made a forced march on Saturday, to form a connection with Colonel Scott’s regiment, expecting to occupy Cheat Mountain. At Greenbrier River, however, some fifteen miles this side of the mountain stronghold, he met Colonel Scott in full retreat, was apprised of the retreat of General Garnett, and of the presence of the enemy, in large numbers, in the immediate vicinity. The troops having been wearied by long marches, &c., he felt too weak to continue his forward movement, and determined to fall back upon this point.
On Sunday morning I met him, and, after frank consultation, concerning some scruples, assumed command. My own judgment approving of what he had previously done, the backward march was continued to this place, for the purpose of relieving ourselves of heavy wagon trains, of forming a connection with the North Carolina Regiment, of resting and rallying the troops, and of holding them in readiness, either to resist the advance of the enemy on the Huttonsville road, or to move to the relief of General Garnett in the direction of Franklin and Petersburg. Hearing nothing from that direction, however, I was contemplating a renewed movement towards the Cheat Mountain, when I received intelligence yesterday of General Garnett’s death and the uncertain condition of his retreating column. This movement was contemplated, however, rather with a view to the moral effect to be produced by it, not simply at a distance, but upon the people of the intervening districts, who are really in a most pitiable state of panic, than with a hope of effectively preventing the enemy’s progress towards the east, should he propose to make it at once. You are, doubtless, already aware

that from Huttonsville, where he now is, there is a good road passing through Huntersville, and, by the Warm Springs, to the Central Bail-road, above Staunton.
I inclose herewith a rough sketch of the surrounding country, with its passes, roads, and distances, to which you may possibly have an occasion to refer.
I am impressed with the opinion that if the enemy advance farther it will be by the Huntersville and Warm Springs road. I have scouts, deemed to be reliable, put out upon that road to watch and report his movements; others upon the Huttonsville road and through the country towards Franklin and Petersburg for the same purpose, and to direct our scattered troops into this camp.
It is needless to add that we are encountering many difficulties and annoyances from the want of tents, blankets, clothing, &c., for the men who are coming in almost hourly, and even from their disorganized and depressed condition. However, I think I can report the command as being, on the whole, in fair condition, constantly increasing in numbers, and improving in every respect; the officers generally, and especially Colonel Johnson, energetic, and rendering cheerful and effective service. The returns indicate the presence of from three thousand to thirty-five hundred effective troops, among them two companies of cavalry. I have three pieces of artillery (6-pounders), with horses and ammunition, and I am organizing a company of officers and men, who are experienced, to a greater or less degree in the use of that arm, and will take them in charge. I would beg once again to urge the importance of our being speedily re-enforced, especially in artillery and engineers.
I am, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,

Sir : Inclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit copies of correspondence with Major-General McClellan, of the U. S. Army, which will explain themselves. Further information received has confirmed into assurance the hope expressed in my last letter that the retreat ing column of General Garnett had not been so wholly [dispersed] after his death as was first supposed. I have good reason to believe that by Friday next some twenty-five hundred or three thousand men connected with it will join me here.
I also learn that a company of artillery with four pieces, and capable of effective service, has escaped the disasters of the last week almost intact. With an Arkansas regiment, understood to be approaching from Staunton, this accession will raise my command to some seven thousand men. I have sent a courier to meet Colonel Bamsey, with a direction that the artillery and cavalry be advanced with all possible dispatch. So soon as I can control their services, I hope to occupy the stronghold of the Alleghany Mountains, which commands this road, the indications of yesterday having suggested that the enemy may conclude to advance by that route.
The work of reorganization is going on in this camp quite perceptibly, I think, but I have been somewhat alarmed by a notification from Major

Harman, quartermaster at Staunton, that within the next five days five thousand troops, whom I suppose to be the militia of the adjoining county, will be upon the march to join me here. It is questionable whether so large a body of wholly undisciplined men, however zealous and patriotic they may be, will be able to compensate, by service in the field, for the disorganization they must occasion in the camp, and for the labor of arming, transporting, and supplying them. Supposing that the death of General Garnett, and the relief of his command from immediate danger in removing the necessity for their services, may prevent their assemblage and forward movement, and exceedingly loth to interfere with any direction from the State authorities, I shall leave all communication with Major Harman upon this subject to the Com-mander-in-Chief.
Permit me again to reiterate that what we need upon this line is good engineers, artillery of a heavier caliber than we now have to meet such moving with the enemy, and mountain howitzers, which the character of this country would render eminently effective.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S.—Since writing the above I have received a note from Colonel Ramsey, a copy of which, together with a copy of my response thereto, I have deemed it proper to inclose to you. You will perceive that he contemplated moving his command in the direction of Staunton. While I had previously dispatched a courier with such instructions as would prevent such a result, and who had not reached Colonel Ramsey at the date of his note, and while I have no doubt that his column will now be moved to this point, nevertheless I have not felt authorized to withhold this information from the commanding general.

To the ComdGt. Officer of Forces near Staunton, Va.:
Sir : I have to-day received orders from the Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. Army respecting the disposition to be made of the prisoners of war now in my hands. These orders are substantially that the non-commissioned officers and privates shall be permitted to return to their homes, provided they willingly subscribe an oath or affirmation binding them not to bear arms or serve in any military capacity against the United States uatil released from this obligation according to the ordinary usages of war$ the officers to be permitted to return to their homes upon giving a similar parole of honor. From this privilege are excepted, however, such officers as may have recently left the United States service with the intention of taking arms against the United States. Such officers will for the present be sent to Fort McHenry, where they will, without doubt, be kindly treated.
There are at Beverly some thirty-three officers, five surgeons, and about six hundred non-commissioned officers and privates. There are others at Laurel Hill, &c., the numbers of whom I do not yet accurately know. With the wounded the number will probably amount to at least eight hundred men, besides officers.
It is my desire to arrange with you for the return to their homes of

such of these as may accept the terms offered them. I would he glad to know what transportation, &c., you can provide for them, and at what point I may expect it. If no other arrangement will be convenient to you, I will provide wagons and tents, as well as cooking utensils, for the party, with the understanding that the proper authorities shall undertake to return them to me. The wagons and tents will probably be of those captured at Camp Garnett. Please inform me how many days7 rations it will be necessary to furnish to the party. I will be glad also to arrange for the return of the wounded as soon as their condition will permit it. In the mean time their Mends may rest assured that every attention will be paid to them.
You will, ere this, no doubt, be informed of the unhappy fate of General Garnett, who fell while acting the part of a gallant soldier. His remains are now at Grafton, preserved in ice, where they will await the instructions of his relatives, should they desire to remove them to his home.
While I am determined to play my part in this unhappy contest to the utmost of my energy and ability, permit me to assure you of my desire to do all in my power to alleviate its miseries, and to confine its effects to those who constitute the organized armies and meet in battle. It is my intention to cause the persons and property of private citizens to be respected, and to render the condition of prisoners and wounded as little oppressive and miserable as possible. I trust that I shall be met in the same spmt, and that this contest shall remain free from the usual horrible features of civil war.
I send this by Lieut. E. G. Lipford, of the Forty-fourth Eegiment Virginia Volunteers, who chances to be the captured officer most convenient. I have not yet taken his final parole, but have given him a special one for the purpose of conveying this letter and bringing back an immediate reply. Upon his return he will be accorded the same parole as the others. For obvious reasons I request that your reply be transmitted by Lieutenant Lipford.
I will proceed, with as little delay as possible, to the release of the prisoners, and, if ready to forward before your reply reaches me, will take it for granted that you accede to my proposals in regard to the return of the property sent with them.

accompany the wagons transporting them to that point, it will be returned to your order as scrupulously as the tender of it was courteously made. ‘ The friends of the sick and wounded who may be too feeble to come with these trains will rest altogether tranquil in the assurances which you have given respecting the treatment of the latter. Permit me to add that your well known character as a man had rendered even those assurances a matter of supererogation.
Lieutenant Bruce and Dr. Garnett (the latter a relative and aide-de-camp of the late and much lamented General Garnett) will bear to you this communication, and will make the necessary arrangements for the removal of the remains of that gallant officer to his home. That his relatives and many friends will most sensibly appreciate your kind acts and words respecting him cannot be a subject of surmise.
I regret to say that there are peculiar reasons which have constrained me to place R. L Lipford, the bearer of your letter, under arrest. By representing himself to be a lieutenant, when he was simply a private in the Forty-fourth Regiment Virginia Volunteers, he was guilty of a gross imposition, exhibited his utter unworthiness of any confidence whatsoever, and I could not place this letter in his charge with any sense of security that it would reach you. In detaining him from you for the present, I need hardly assure you that he will not be allowed to violate the parole he has undertaken to give. He will be held in strict custody. I am, sir, with great-respect, your very obedient servant,

Sir : As the commander of this department, I have protected the persons of all citizens of Western Virginia, except those engaged in active hostilities against the United States, and, when under a misapprehension of patriotic duty, arrests have been made because of political opinions or sympathies, I have promptly ordered releases. I have protected all private property, by whomsoever owned. My proclamations and general orders on this subject have doubtless been brought to your knowledge. I am informed that arrests have been made in Western Virginia of citi-* zens loyal to the Government of the United States but not in arms for the support of it, and that such prisoners, or some of them, are within your control. I suggest to you the propriety of releasing all such persons, their detention being not only individual hardships, but calculated to increase the troubles of this section of the country, without contributing to any military result. Among the prisoners now within your control, and belonging to the class above mentioned, my attention has been called specially to the following names: W. M. Smith, John Brooks, Quilby Osborn, J. L.

Sir : Your letter of tlie 15th instant, with its anomalous address, has been received. In response, I have simply to say that I am as yet wholly unapprised that a different policy in regard to the arrests of suspected persons, or the protection of private property from the line you have so naturally proposed for yourself, has been pursued by the chief of the division of the Confederate Army. Hence your suggestion as to the propriety of abandoning any other would seem to be uncalled-for. Begging to remind you that any information you may receive as to the absence of sufficient grounds for the arrest and^ detention of the persons you name (or any others) may, to say the least of it, be quite as unreliable as the evidence upon which such persons are held, I will conclude by saying to you that justice will be duly regarded by me in the treatment of all persons whatsoever.

General: In the dispatch of the 14th instant yon were directed to take command of the available troops of the Northwestern Army, and oppose the advance of the enemy. I infer, from your dispatch from Monterey of this date, that our troops have retreated to that point. It is important that the passes of the Cheat Mountain, or at least those of the Alleghany, should, if practicable, be defended, to prevent the advance of the epemy by the road through Huntersville to Jackson’s Biver and Miilborough, where he would obtain command of the Virginia Central Baiiroad. Be-enforcements for the Northwest are collecting at Staunton, and I shall leave here on the 18th instant to join them.

Report of Lieut. Col. J. M. Seek, Twenty-fifth Virginia Infantry, of operations from May 24 to July 13, including skirmishes July 7 to 9, and engagement at Rich Mountain.
-------,-------, 1861.
On May 24 I reported for duty to Col. George A. Porterfield, who was then, with about 100 men, holding the town of Fetterman, three miles west of Grafton, on the Baltimore and Ohio Baiiroad.
On the 25th Colonel Porterfield received a re-enforcement of six or seven raw recruits, infantry and cavalry, under Col. B. Turk.
On May 26 Colonel Porterfield, with his small force of half-armed and undisciplined troops, took possession of Grafton.
At 12 o’clock on the night of the 26th I was ordered by Colonel Porterfield to proceed to Bichmond without delay, and report the condition of his little army, and the necessity of his being re-enforced. I started immediately, and by constant traveling reached Bichmond in time to report to General Lee on the evening of the 28th. The general informed me that owing to the movements of the enemy at Alexandria and other points it would be impossible for him to do anything more for the army in the Northwest than to furnish me with some arms at Staunton, Va., and authority to recruit a regiment in the valley and mountain counties immediately on the route to Grafton.
In compliance with his order and instructions I repaired to Staunton on the 29th in company with Maj. B. E. Cowan, where we proceeded with all possible dispatch, assisted by Col. M. G. Harman (at that time major and quartermaster at that point), to raise troops and get up supplies. While thus engaged the news of Colonel Porterfield’s retreat from Grafton and his subsequent defeat at Philippi reached us. This caused us some delay, as we had to provide clothing as well as provisions, as the army was then suffering, having lost all their clothing, provisions, ammunition, and many of them their guns. We also had some difficulty in fitting up a battery of four pieces (6-pounders), which had been furnished us by Governor Letcher, but was without caissons.

CAMPAIGN IN WEST VIRGINIA.

On June 7 we left Staunton with one battery of four pieces (6-pounder brass cannon), temporarily assigned to the Eighth Star Artillery, from Shenandoah County, commanded by Captain Eice, afterwards assigned to the Lee Battery, commanded by Captain Anderson; one company of cavalry, commanded by Captain Moorman, and three companies of infantry. About the same time we received orders from the governor to call out the militia of Pendleton, Highland, Bath, Pocahontas, Eandolph, and Barbour. We immediately dispatched Lieut. John T. Cowan (who had been ordered to report to me for duty) and others to these counties with the governor’s proclamation and orders for the militia of the three first-named counties to meet us at Monterey, in Highland County, on June 10. Having authority from the governor to use the militia or not, as we saw proper, we arranged for each county to furnish a company of 100 men, which was done, and the rest were discharged. We considered that many volunteers to be worth more than the whole militia force; besides, it was necessary for some to remain at home to take care of the crops, as our army had to be supplied principally from those counties. Three companies were formed from the militia of Highland, Bath, and Pendleton, and the militia from those counties sent home.
With this force (in all eight companies) we reached Colonel Porterfield’s headquarters, at Huttonsville, on June 15. General Garnett, who had reached there one day in advance with one staff officer, ordered Lieut. Col. W. L. Jackson and myself to form a regiment each from the companies then there, about twenty-four in number. My regiment was composed of ten companies of infantry, to which was attached one company of cavalry and one of artillery.
Immediately after the formation of my regiment I received orders to march that night to Eich Mountain Pass. Captain Corley, of the general staff, was sent with me to select the location for fortifications.
We marched that night, and early the next morning, June 16, occupied the western slope of the mountain near its base, seven miles west of Beverly.
We worked our whole force on the fortifications for several days, but made rather slow progress, as we had but few tools and no engineer until Prof. Jed. Hotchkiss joined the command.
On the same day that I occupied this position General Garnett, with Colonel Jackson’s regiment, occupied the Laurel Hill Pass, seventeen miles northwest of Beverly. The enemy was at this time holding Philippi with a considerable force and Buckhannon with a small force.
On June — I was ordered by General Garnett to take part of my regiment and all the wagons under my command and go to Buckhannon on a foraging expedition, a report of which you have.
The day after we left Buckhannon, June —, the enemy, under General Bosecrans, about 5,000 strong, occupied the place and was very soon largely re-enforced.
On July [6] a detachment of about 100 men made an attack on our picket at Middle Fork Bridge, about half-way between our camp and Buckhannon. Notwithstanding their superior numbers they were repulsed, leaving one dead on the field. Three of our pickets were wounded—one slightly, the other two severely. The enemy soon afterwards appearing in large force, our picket was compelled to withdraw from the bridge.
On July 7 I sent out Major Tyler, of the Twentieth Virginia Eegi-ment, who had been sent with seven companies to re-enforce me, with two companies to reconnoiter the enemy’s force and position at tnfe

bridge. This little force, under their gallant leader, attacked and drove in the enemy’s pickets, but finding the enemy in large force, withdrew in good order and returned to camp.
On the evening of the same day Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram arrived with the remainder of the Twentieth Regiment and assumed the command. I then offered to give him all the information I had of the surrounding country, fortifications, &c., and immediately introduced him to Professor Hotchkiss, my engineer.
On July 9 the enemy in large force moved up and occupied the Roaring Run Flats, about two miles from and in sight of our position, and on the evening of the same day made a reconnaissance in force, driving in our pickets. Colonel Pegram at this time very much underrated the force of the enemy, and wrote to General Garnett for permission to surprise and attack him in his position. General Garnett, I believe, advised against an attack, but I think this underrating of the enemy’s force kept General Garnett from ordering Colonel Pegram to fall back from the position, as I have no doubt he would have done, at the same time falling back from his own position to Cheat Mountain, had he learned or even supposed the enemy in front of our position half as strong as he was. I say this because I know General Garnett did not consider us strong enough in that position to resist a force so superior in numbers, even against a front attack only, as he inspected the position in person alter the fortifications had been commenced, and remarked that we could defend the position against the attack of an enemy three or four times our number. The force brought against us was at least ten to one. 1 deem the foregoing statement due to the memory of one of Yirginia’s noblest sons, a devoted patriot, a wise and sagacious general, who fell a victim to a combination of circumstances over which he had no control.
On July 10 the enemy made a second reconniassance in force, which returned to camp late in the evening. Lights were seen in the enemy’s camp until after midnight, and he appeared to be in considerable commotion, as if preparing for some expedition requiring extra rations, &c. Colonel Pegram, in anticipation of a rear attack, sent to the top of the mountain, about two miles in our rear, two companies of the Twenty-
fifth Regiment, Captain Curry’s, and--, of his own regiment, which
remained out all night.
Early on the morning of the 11th a cavalry sergeant of the enemy (who had been detailed to assist in keeping open the communication between General Rosecrans, who had started very early that morning with six regiments of infantry to turn our left flank, and General McClellan, whOj with the main body of the enemy and eighteen pieces of artillery, was to attack us in front as soon as Rosecrans made the attack in the rear) missed his way and rode up to our lines and was wounded and captured. Colonel Pegram learned from him that the enemy had moved a force to his rear, but could not learn by which flank, so he sent two more companies, with one piece of artillery, to re-enforce the picket on the mountain, which made in all a force of about 300 men, which was placed under the command of Captain De Lagnel, whose deed of daring on that day has won for him a name as lasting as history itself.
Colonel Scott, who was marching with a regiment to re-enforce General Garnett, was requested by Colonel Pegram to hold a road one mile west of Beverly. This was done because Colonel Pegram thought that the enemy would try to turn his right flank by a very circuitous route, coming in at that road, but the enemy made the attack about 11 o’clock on

tbe mountain from the left flank, having made a circuit through the woods.
Our brave little band of heroes under Captain De Lagnel met the enemy with great resolution and repulsed him twice, but were finally overpowered by overwhelming numbers and compelled to retreat, having lost in killed and wounded in the three hours’ fight about one-third of their whole force. After the brave Captain De Lagnel had been shot down, while, with the assistance of a boy—all the rest of the [men] at the guns having been killed or wounded—he was loading and firing his pieces, the gallant Captain Curry, of the Eockbridge Guards, assumed the command of the few remaining men and conducted the retreat in as good order as possible, being under the concentrated fire of four regiments, which made a perfect hail of leaden missiles.
The enemy, having charged and taken our piece of artillery, were bayoneting our wounded soldiers, who had been shot at their posts. As soon as Colonel Pegram learned that we had been driven from our position at Hart’s house and lost our piece of artillery, he determined to take about half of the command and charge and retake the lost position, and immediately organized them and marched from our camp, leaving me in command, with instructions to hold that position at all hazards*
In the mean time the enemy was busy making preparations for an attack in front, cutting roads and placing a large number of pieces of artillery in position. Our force had been so weakened by the heavy detail made by Colonel Pegram that we could do nothing but strengthen our position and await the attack of the enemy.
About 11 o’clock at night, having heard nothing from Colonel Pegram, his adjutant and other officers insisted on a council of war being called. I called a few officers together and repeated to them my orders from Colonel Pegram, instructing me to hold the position until I heard from him, which might not be before morning, as he had not then determined whether he would attack General Eosecrans that night or in the morning.
We were about returning to our several posts, as we were expecting an attack every moment, when Colonel Pegram returned and informed us he had determined not to make the attack at Hart’s house, and had sent the men he had selected for that purpose away under the command of Maj. Nat. Tyler, and he ordered me to call in all the companies and pickets and retreat with them immediately in the direction of General Garnett’s camp, at Laurel Hill. I proceded without delay to execute the order; had the remaining pieces of artillery spiked; the men formed single file; a pass-word by which they might recognize each other in the dark was given them, and they were marching out of the camp when Colonel Pegram came up and assumed command, he having before determined to remain in camp, owing to his weak condition, having been thrown from his horse during the day. His orderly, in halting the command until the colonel could get in front, failed to reach the head of the column, and forty or fifty men, under the command of Captain Lilley (guided by Major Stewart and Professor Hotchkiss), did not receive the orders to halt, and marched for some time, thinking they were followed by the rest of the command. On discovering that they had got separated from us, they changed their course, marched through Beverly, and escaped.
Soon after leaving Camp Garnett this little force passed between two regiments of the enemy, as we afterwards learned, and escaped being fired upon by replying by chance with the signal adopted by the enemy. The night being very dark and our route being over precipitous mount-17 R R—VOL II

ains and through almost impassable undergrowth, we made but little progress until after daylight-
Soon after sunup on the 12th we were in sight of Beverly on a high mountain, and could see the river valley for many miles both to our right and left. Had we gone directly down into this valley as urged by Colonel Wirt in person [and] some of the officers we would have escaped, as the enemy did not enter Beverly until about 1 p. m. on that day. I suppose that we would have gone into the valley at this point if Colonel Pegram had not mistaken some of our own (Lilley’s) men for the enemy's advance; as it was we were kept in the mountains, marching slowlv in the direction of General Garnett’s camp at Laurel Hill.
Late in the evening I asked permission of Colonel Pegram to go down into the valley and see if the road leading from Beverly to General Garnett’s camp was clear, which was granted. Taking with me a citizen that I could rely upon, I sent him to a house where he learned from the inmates that there was no news in that neighborhood of any movements of the enemy in the valley; but as they were three miles from the main road and could give no certain news as to the movements on it, I returned and reported to Colonel Pegram, and he determined to move his men to the main road without delay.
We found this march through the valley to the main road rather difficult, as we had to wade the Valley .River three times and cross much swampy land. When we were within a half mile of the main road the head of our column, having crossed the river, was halted till the rest of the command came up, when we were fired into, which caused some confusion, as it was very dark.
Colonel Pegram ordered me to recross the river with the command and form them, as he had just learned that the enemy was at Leadsville Church (3,000 strong), at the point where we would strike the main road. He soon afterwards ordered me to march the men back again to the foot of the mountain, he riding on in advance, having procured a horse after he got into the valley. When I arrived at the house late at night I found Colonel Pegram, who was much exhausted and very weak, asleep. I awoke him, and he told me to call together the commandants of companies and procure a private room. I did so, and sent for the colonel, who informed the officers that he had concluded to surrender the command, as he believed it would be impossible to escape, being, as he believed, so surrounded by the enemy that it would be impossible for us to cross the valley to the mountains on the other side, and admitting that if we were able to do so, he thought that in their present exhausted and starving condition it would be impossible for the men to reach the nearest settlement.
All the officers seemed to agree with the colonel except Capt. J. B. Moorman, of the Franklin Guards, and myself. The captain had marched his company by the same route after the defeat at Philippi, and thought that it could be done again. I argued that we could try the experiment, and if we came across a very superior force we could then surrender to it, which I thought would be much better than to send a proposition to surrender to Beverly, seven miles distant. I thought that with what meal, flour, and meat we could get in the neighborhood (there being several houses near) we could manage to subsist the men on short rations until we could get something in the mountains. But, as stated before, a majority of the officers thought it would be better to surrender at once. Colonel Pegram then wrote a note to the commanding officer of the IT. S. forces at Beverly and dispatched it about 12

o’clock that night (July 12) by a messenger, who returned a little after sunrise the next day with one of General McClellan’s staff officers, Colonel Key, and about twenty cavalry. Colonel Key brought Colonel Pegram a reply to his note from General McClellan (copies of which you have). Colonel Pegram and Colonel Key had a long conference, at the end of which the men were marched to Beverly and stacked their guns. There being no formal surrender or officer to surrender their swords to, Colonel Pegram and most of the officers who had swords hung them on the stacked arms, and many of them were soon stolen by the Yankee guards.
We were kept at Beverly and well treated by our captors until July 17, when all but Colonel Pegram were released on parole by order of General Scott, Pegram being refused his parole because he had been an officer in the tJ. S. Army.
The foregoing account has been written hastily and from memory, but I think in the main is correct. There are undoubtedly many points of interest that have been forgotten, but as I have been informed that you will have written statements from several of the officers, and among others one from Lieut. John T. Cowan, who was with me all the time, and to whom I am much indebted. He is a cool and intrepid young officer, and certainly deserves a much better fate.
There are many officers who deserve honorable mention, and foremost among those is the brave Captain Curry, who was wounded in the fight at Rich Mountain; but where many acted so well distinction would be invidious.
Yours, very truly,

Report of Maj. JVat. Tyler, Twentieth Virginia Infantry, of operations from July 1 to 14, including skirmish July 7, and the engagement at Rich Mountain.
During the night of July 1,1 was ordered by General Garnett, at Laurel Hill, to re-enforce Lieutenant-Colonel Heck at Rich Mountain with seven companies of the Twentieth Regiment Virginia Volunteers. Starting from Laurel Hill at 2 a. m., I arrived at Rich Mountain the next day at 12 m. Lieutenant-Colonel Heck’s command at Rich Mountain was one regiment of infantry, a battery of four G-pounders, and one company of cavalry.
The sketch furnished you will show very accurately the fortifications that had been made to‘protect the camp from front assault.
On Sunday, July 7,1 was ordered to reconnoiter the bridge over Middle Fork, about fifteen miles in front of our position. I proceeded with two companies, Captain Atkinson, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, and Captain Higginbotham, of Lieutenant-Colonel Heck’s regiment. When about one mile from the bridge I was informed by a country woman that a very large army occupied the bridge, and was entreated to return, as the Federal cavalry had but a few moments before left the house. The evidences of the cavalry were to be seen in the mud of the road. Proceeding carefully, I ascertained that a large force of infantry, artil-

260	OPERATIONS IN MD() PA., YA., AND W. YA. [Chap. JX
lery, and cavalry were at the bridge. Soon their pickets were seen and driven in by our force. I found it prudent to return, and immediately after the skirmish was over made disposition for an orderly return. The enemy were a considerable time getting ready to pursue us, which enabled us to get some distance ahead, so we were able to reach camp without annoyance from them.
Upon my return to camp I found Colonel Pegram with the remaining companies of the Twentieth Eegiment, and he immediately assumed the command. We continued to strengthen our fortifications in front and to ascertain the character of the country on our flanks, to ascertain if it were possible for an army to march over the mountains on either flank. Every assurance from the people of the neighborhood was given that it was impossible for any force to march around our position.
Thus matters continued until the morning of July 11, when our picket wounded and captured a Federal sergeant, who stated that McClellan had arrived the night before, and that Eosecrans had that morning at 2 o’clock started with a large force to turn our flank, but he was unable or unwilling to state which flank the enemy were threatening.
About 11 o’clock firing was heard from the pickets at our rear and towards our left flank, and three companies were immediately ordered to Hart’s house. Colonel Pegram had sent to General Garnett that the enemy were endeavoring to turn our right flank, and requested that Colonel Scott might be ordered to comply with his request and occupy a position at the foot of the road one mile from Beverly and about five miles from our position at Hart’s house. This position was promptly taken by Colonel Scott; but as the enemy were then marching around our left flank, the position occupied by Colonel Scott was useless, and he was of no aid to us whatever.
The fight began about 11 o’clock and lasted for three hours, when the enemy succeeded in getting to the road between our position and Beverly. Captain He Lagnel had used with great effect the one piece of artillery sent to him by Colonel Pegram, but when the second cannon arrived the enemy opened such a destructive fire upon it that neither men nor horses could maintain the position. The horses becoming unmanageable ran off and upset the gun and caisson down a precipice, depriving Captain He Lagnel of all ammunition. Wounded and in immediate danger of imminent capture, Captain He Lagnel ordered the infantry to return and make their way towards Beverly. The firing had now ceased, and the enemy were in possession of Hart’s house, and all opportunity and chances of escape along the road to Beverly were cut off. Colonel Pegram ordered me before the firing ceased to re-enforce Captain He Lagnel with the Twentieth Eegiment, and as we were marching up the mountain he determined to take command of a storming party and attempt the recapture of Hart’s house. Before arriving in position he ascertained the impossibility of successfully storming the enemy’s position, and ordered me to continue the retreat with the Twentieth Eegiment while he returned and brought the remainder of the command. He parted from us and marched the regiment all that night through a pathless mexplored mountain, with no guide but the stars and no path but the general direction of the running streams, and arrived in Be^viy at daybreak.
Continuing our march, we overtook Colonel Scott at Huttonsville about 9 o’clock in the morning, and continued the retreat over Cheat Mountain to the Greenbrier Eiver, where we arrived at daybreak on the morning of the 14th. There we were received by Governor Letcher. Soon Colonel Johnson, with a Georgia regiment, arrived. The retreat

of the whole command under Colonel Johnson was resumed to Monterey, where General Jackson, of Georgia, assumed the command, and where a halt was made until the remainder of General Garnett’s army arrived.

Report of Mr, Jed. Hotchkiss, Topographical Engineer, Confederate service, of events from July 2 to 14.
Churchville, Augusta County, Va., January 18,1862.
I was appointed engineer at Camp Garnett, Rich Mountain, Randolph County, Virginia, by you, as commander of the post, on Tuesday, July 2, 1861, and on Wednesday morning, the 3d, I commenced my duties by initiating a survey of the camp and its vicinity, preparatory to the construction of an accurate topographical map of the locality; and by the aid of parties detailed for the purpose I had nearly completed the necessary triangulations and measurements for the purpose indicated, and had'also by barometrical observations ascertained the height of the points occupied by our forces, and had made considerable progress in the drawing of the map of the camp and vicinity, when (the enemy having made their appearance before our lines on the evening of July 9), by your order I spent a portion of the 10th in the breastworks on the hill to the left of your position, and the whole of the 11th, during which day the battle of Rich Mountain was fought and lost. I remained at the breastworks until midnight of that day, the enemy having occupied the parallel ridge in front of us during the day.
At midnight, by your order, I came down from the hill in company with the Augusta Lee Rifles, Capt. R. D. Lillev, of your regiment, and followed by the companies of Captains Moorman, Kiracofe, Smith, Hall, and Mullins, and marched with them to the turnpike between the center and right of our position, and was there informed by you that Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram, who had assumed the command on the morning of July 8—he having been ordered by General Garnett to report to you with his regiment, and then he claimed the command of the post as being of the same rank in the Confederate service that you were in the State, and therefore ranking you—had been injured by a fall from his horse on the 11th and had resigned the command to you, again ordering you to march to Laurel Hill, to General Garnett, through the forest on the right of our position. You directed me to lead the front of the column over the hill on the right through the breastworks there, and so on towards the top of Rich Mountain. All the forces left at Camp Garnett were at that time formed in the road. As before said, I was directed to proceed at once, as the enemy was closing down upon our lines in overwhelming numbers, and you told me that you would bring up the rear. I then proceeded to the head of the column, occupied by Captain Li]ley’s company, and the command to move forward having been passed, was proceeding up the road, intending to reach the top of the hill [by] its easy winding grade, and had proceeded some little distance, when you overtook me and informed me that the enemy occupied the turn of the road on the hill, and that we must go up along the hill and so over by the way of the breastworks on the right.
The column was then countermarched in single file, and the countersign, “Indian,” said to be the countersign of the enemy for the night,

was communicated to the men, and then I started up the hill, accompanied by Major Beger, of your regiment, and Major Stewart and Colonel Wilson, who happened to "be at our camp. When at the top of the hill, which is very steep and rough, we halted for the column to close up, and then struck into the forest. The rain pouring down in torrents and the night being very dark, the line of march could hardly be kept but by a constant effort on the part of the men to keep almost in contact with each other, and our line was often broken by the fallen trees, dense thickets, and precipices that we encountered. By the advice of Majors Beger and Stewart we took a course bearing to the left, but I soon found that that was bringing us too near the waters of Boaring Creek and the adjacent laurel swamps, as well as too near the position occupied by the camp of the enemy; therefore I protested against going farther in that direction, and was seconded in my views by Captain Lilley and others that were near; and as I had reconnoitered the ground on July 6, they yielded to my opinion and my guidance from that time. We then pushed on, bearing gradually to the right, that we might reach the gap to the north of Hart’s, suffering much from the cold, as we were all drenched, and many of us had not eaten since morning. We did not halt much, and one time, shortly after leaving the camp, a low whistle on our right arrested our attention, and most of the line halted. I replied to thfe whistle and passed the order quietly to press on, and I have since learned from a prisoner-taken from the enemy that a whole regiment was drawn up parallel to our line of march, and was only kept from firing upon us by the reply to their signal and our continued moving.
Daylight found us two-thirds of the way to the top of the mountain, and then and there, to our great surprise and regret, we found that, instead of the whole command, I was only followed by a portion of Captain Lilley’s company and some few others—some fifty men. We were sorely disappointed; but as there was no alternative for safety but rapid flight, as we were certain that the enemy would speedily occupy all the roads by which we could escape, therefore I urged upon the men the necessity for a prompt obedience of orders in marching forward, and they responded with cheerfulness and alacrity, and we pushed rapidly forward and across the summit of the mountain at sunrise through a notch, and following down a ravine we struck the Merritt road, much cut up by the passage of the Churchville cavalry and most of Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram’s regiment, which had passed over it the evening before, under the command of Maj. Nat. Tyler. We reached this road at about 8 a. m. of the 12th. Following down that road, we obtained a few mouthfuls of food at a house just on the edge of the valley, where Major Tyler and men had spent part of the night. Then we took across the fields and reached Beverly at about 11 a. in., where we found the people helping themselves to the abandoned commissary stores, and we were informed by Captain Stofer, who was seated on the porch of the hotel, that the enemy was expected every moment, and that our forces under Colonel Scott had gone to Huttonsville. We then helped ourselves to a supply of crackers, &c., from the stores and proceeded towards Hut-tonsville. Finding a large quantity of tents, blankets, socks, &c., abandoned by the roadside, just across Files Creek, we took each one a supply of these needful articles, and had started on when we met a team going to Beverly, which we impressed and sent back and loaded up, and then went on towards Huttonsville. Overtaking stragglers from various companies by the way, and it being rumored that the enemy was in rapid pursuit of us, we had our men fire off their guns and reload them, each one having held on to his gun, and then made all fall into

ranks and so march in order, and having overtaken a wagon loaded with provisions, we kept it along and guarded it. Eeaching Huttons-ville at about 3 p. in., where we confidently expected to find Colonel Scott, we found the bridge just falling down from its conflagration by his order, and were told that he had gone to Stipe’s.
We had already marched some twenty-two miles, but we went on to Stipe’s and there found that he had gone, it was said, to the foot of Cheat Mountain ; still pursuing, we reached the foot of Cheat Mountain, eight miles farther, and there, after eating a scanty supper, we disposed of ourselves upon the bluff commanding the road up the mountain and its approaches, and there spent the night, resting on our arms, for fugitives had reported that 1,200 of the enemy’s cavalry was in close pursuit ; but we decided that an encounter from an ambuscade was preferable to a further retreat in our exhausted condition, having spent a whole day and half the night on our feet in the breastworks, and then retreated thirty miles through dense thickets, over fallen timber and ledges of rocks, through water-courses and along muddy roads ; but every man had his arms and ammunition and was ready for an encounter.
On the morning of the 13th we proceeded to the top of Cheat Mountain, at White’s, and there found the Churchville and Bath cavalry companies and portions of many other companies collected there after the retreat. All agreed that we would stay there and keep back the enemy, and I was selected as a committee of one by those on the top of the mountain to see Governor Letcher, who we had learned was at Greenbrier Biver, and get his consent to let us remain there.
Dr. O. Butcher, of Huttonsville, took me down in his sulky, and I had an interview with the governor, whom I found at Yeager’s, where the regiment of Colonel Scott had encamped and Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram’s regiment, under the command of Major Tyler, and where the regiment of Colonel Johnson (the Twelfth Georgia) came up.
The governor consented to our staying, and we had started back a short distance when a messenger came up and ordered all the men down, and we came down and proceeded up the Alleghany Mountains. That night slept a few hours on the summit, at Yearger’s, and then went on Sunday to Monterey, where we encamped. Major Beger procured a horse and left us at Beverly and went on to Yearger’s, and got his family and sent them on to Staunton, and then joined us at Monterey on the 14th.
By your order I did not go to my tent on the night of the retreat, and therefore lost all my instruments, notes, maps, and baggage; therefore I am unable to report to you an accurate map of Camp Garnett; but I accompany this report with a map drawn from memory of the camp and surrounding country, showing the route of the enemy, and also the route of our retreat as far as Beverly.
After we had been some days in Monterey we were informed that shortly after we left Camp Garnett Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram resumed the command of the forces and sent some one of his staff forward to halt the column, and that owing to the darkness and steepness of the hill he was unable to reach the head of the column, and therefore he interposed himself and a musket into the midst of Captain Lilley’s company and so divided it. Private Brownlee Bell, who was at the head of the forces cut off, gave us this information.
As imputations have been cast upon you in reference to the management of the army, &c., at Bich Mountain, on the retreat, &c., I may be permitted, from the opportunity I had of knowing all the facts and cir-

cum stances of your situation, to state tliat to my personal knowledge you sent one that came to you with information in reference to the designs or operation of the enemy in turning our left flank to communicate the same to Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram the day before the battle, and I heard you offer to communicate to him all the information you had in reference to the camp and its surroundings, referring him to me in person as having a partially-prepared map of it, and he did not avail himself but to a very limited extent of the large fund of information you had with diligence collected in reference to your position and the movements of the enemy. Being ordered by General Garnett, as he himself said, to report himself and command to you, he at once arrogantly demanded the command of the post because of his superiority in rank before asking for it or you had refused to give it to him; and after you had expressed a willingness to give it up to him if you could be assured that such was the desire of General Garnett, and afterwards by his arbitrary and selfish direction of affairs, in the opinion of many concerned and engaged, brought about the disasters that attended and followed the battle of Rich Mountain, and led to the surrender of 600 brave men to the enemy.
My report has been delayed by pressing engagements in the army and sickness to this late day.
Most respectfully submitted.

Report of Lieut Cot John Pegram, G. 8. Army, of the engagement at Rich Mountain and the surrender of his forces.
Beverly, Ya., July 14,1861.
Hot knowing where a communication will find General Garnett, I have the honor to submit the following report of the fight at Rich Mountain, which occurred on the 11th instant:
The battle-field was immediately around the house of one Hart, situated at the highest point of the turnpike over the mountain and two miles in rear of my main line of trenches, the latter being at the foot of the western slope of the mountain.
The intricacies of the surrounding country seemed scarcely to demand the placing of any force at Hartfs, yet I had that morning placed Captain De Lagnel, of the Confederate artillery, with five companies of infantry and one piece of artillery, numbering in all about three hundred and ten men, with instructions to defend it to the last extremity against whatever force might be brought to the attack by the enemy, but also to give me timely notice of his need for re-enforcements. These orders had not been given two hours before General Rosecrans, who had been conducted up a distant ridge on my left flank and then along the top of the mountain by a man, attacked the small handful of troops under Captain De Lagnel with three thousand men. When from my camp I heard the firing becoming very rapid, without waiting to hear from Captain De Lagnel, I ordered up re-enforcements, and hurried on myself to the scene of action. When I arrived the piece of artillery was entirely unmanned, Captain De Lagnel having been severely wounded, after which his men had left their piece. The limber and

caisson were no longer visible, the horses having run away with them down the mountain, in doing which they met and upset the second piece of artillery, which had been ordered up to their assistance. Seeing the infantry deserting the slight breastworks hastily thrown up that morning by Captain Be Lagnel, I used all personal exertions to make them stand to their work until even I saw that the place was hopelessly lost. The last companies which left their posts were the Rockingham Lee Guard, commanded by Oapt. Carter H. Irving, and the Powhatan Rifles, commanded by Capt. William M. Skipwith. On my way back to my camp I found the re-enforcing force under command of Captain Anderson, of the artillery, in the greatest confusion, they having fired upon their retreating comrades. I hurried on to camp and ordered the remaining companies of my own regiment in camp to join them. This left my right front and right flank entirely unmanned. I then went back up the mountain, where I found the whole force, composed of five companies of the Twentieth and one company of Colonel Heck’s regiment, drawn up in line in ambuscade near the road, under command of Maj. Nat. Tyler, of the Twentieth Regiment. I called their attention and said a few encouraging words to the men, asking them if they would follow their officers to the attack, to which they responded by a cheer. I was here interrupted by Captain Anderson, who said to me, u Colonel Pegram, these men are completely demoralized, and will need you to lead them.- I took my place at the head of the column, which I marched in single file through laurel thickets and other almost impassable brushwood up a ridge to the top of the mountain.
This placed me about one-fourth of a mile on the right flank of the enemy, and which was exactly the point I had been making for. I had just gotten all the men up together and was about making my dispositions for the attack when Major Tyler came up and reported that during the march up the ridge one of the men in his fright had turned around and shot the first sergeant of one of the rear companies, which had caused nearly the whole of the company to run to the rear. He then said that the men were so intensely demoralized, that he considered it madness to attempt to do anything with them by leading them on to the attack. A mere glance at the frightened countenances around me convinced me that this distressing news was but too true, and it was confirmed by the opinion of the three or four company commanders around me. They all agreed with me that there was nothing left to do but to send the command under Major Tyler to effect a junction with either General Garnett at Laurel Hill or Col. William C. Scott, who was supposed to be with his regiment near Beverly. It was now 6J o'clock p. ni, when I retraced my steps with much difficulty back to camp, losing myself frequently on the way, and arriving there at 11J o’clock.
I immediately assembled a council of war, composed of the field officers and company commanders remaining, when it was unanimously agreed that, after spiking the two remaining pieces of artillery, we should attempt to join General Garnett by a march through the mountains to our right. This act was imperative, not only from our reduced numbers, now being about six hundred and our being placed between two large attacking armies, but also because at least three-fourths of my command had no rations left $ the other one fourth not having flour enough left for one meal. Having left directions for Sergeant Walke, and given directions to Assistant Surgeon Taylor to take charge of the sick and wounded in camp and to show a white flag at daylight, I then called the companies, G and H, of Twentieth Regiment, with which and

﻿268	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
seven companies of Colonel Heck’s regiment I started at 1 o’clock a. m., and without a guide, to make my way, if possible, over the mountains, where there was not the sign of a path, towards General Garnett’s camp.
As I remained in camp to see the last company in column, by the time I reached the head of the column, wiiich was nearly one mile long, Captain Silly’s [Lilley’s] company, of Colonel Heck’s regiment, had disappeared and has not been since heard from. The difficulties attending my march with the remaining eight companies it would be impossible for me to exaggerate. We arrived at Tygart’s Valley River at 7 o’clock 1^. m., having made the distance of about twelve miles in eighteen hours. Here we were met by several country people, who appeared to be our friends, and who informed us that at Leadsville Church, distant three miles, and situated on the Beverly and Laurel Hill turnpike, there was a small camp, composed of a portion of General Garnett’s command. Leaving Colonel Heck with instructions to bring the command forward rapidly, I hired a horse and proceeded forward until within sight of Leadsville Church, when I stopped at a farm house, where were assembled a dozen men and women. They informed me that General Garnett had retreated that afternoon up the Leading Creek road, in Tucker County, and that he was being pursued by three thousand of the enemy, who had come from the direction of Laurel Hill as far as Leadsville Church, when they turned up the Leading Creek road in pursuit.
This of course rendered all chance of joining General Garnett, or of escape in that direction, utterly impossible. Hurrying back to my command I found them in much confusion, firing random shots in the dark, under the impression that the enemy was surrounding them. Reforming them, I hurried back to the point where we first struck the river, and persuaded a few of the country people to cook all the provisions they had, hoping it might go a little way toward satisfying the hunger of my almost famishing men.
I now found, on examining the men of the house, there was, if any, only one possible means of escape, and that w as by a road which, passing within three miles of the enemy's camp at Beverly, led over precipitous mountains into Pendleton County. Along this road there were represented to me to be but a few miserable habitations, where it would be utterly impossible for even one company of my men to get food, and as it was now 11 o’clock p. m. it would be necessary to leave at once, without allowing them to get a mouthful where they were. I now called a council of war, composed like the one of the preceding night, when it was agreed, almost unanimously (only tw~o members voting in the negative), there was left to us nothing but the sad determination of surrendering ourselves prisoners of war to the enemy at Beverly. The two members who voted in the negative, whilst they did so, stated that they considered our chances of escape very slim, to w hich I replied that if I thought them as good as slim I should certainly not entertain the idea of surrendering for one moment, and that I was perfectly convinced that an attempt on our part to escape w ould sacrifice by starvation a large number of the lives of the command. I now dispatched a messenger to Beverly, which was distant some six miles, with a note of which the following is the substance:
Headquarters at Mr. Kettle's Farm House, July 12, 1801.

Between 7 and 8 o’clock next morning two officers of General McClellan's staff arrived with bis reply, of which the following is an exact copy •
Headquarters Department of th^i Ohio,
Beterly, Va., July 13, 1861.
John Pegram, Esq.,
Styling himself Lieutenant-Colonel, P. A. C. S. :
Sir : Your communication, dated yesterday, proposing to surrender as prisoners of war the force assembled under your command, has been delivered to me.

I replied to Major Williams, U. S. Army, the bearer of this letter, who told me that General McClellan had with him at Beverly a force of three thousand men, that I was in no condition to dictate terms, and was obliged to accept those of his general. I then formed the companies, and found that one officer and about forty men had left during the night. I now found my force to be twenty-two officers and three hundred and fifty-nine men of Colonel Heck’s regiment, and eight officers and one hundred and sixty-six men of my own (the Twentieth) regiment. With these I marched towards Beverly. On the way we were met by wagons containing hard bread for my men. On arriving at Beverly we stacked arms. Our men were at once put into comfortable quarters, under charge of a guard, and rations issued to them. The officers are on their parole, with the liberties of the town. I deem it my duty to return my thanks and the thanks of the officers here with me to "General McClellan for the kind treatment our men have received from his troops.
I have now to bring to your attention the gallantry of our troops at Hart’s. This is shown by the mere statement that they held their position for three hours in the face of a force ten times their own number, and did not retire until they had lost in killed and wounded nearly one-third of their number. Having been confined to a bed of illness ever since my arrival here, I have been unable to find out our exact loss in killed and wounded, but from what I can gather it is as follows : Killed, Capt. AVilliam M. Skipwith and Second Lieutenant Boyd, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, and between 40 and 45 men, names not known. Wounded, Capt. C. H. Irving, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, severely; Captains Curry and Higginbotham, Colonel Heck’s regiment, and Second Lieut. J. S. Dorset, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, slightly; and about 20 men. Missing, Captain De Lagnel, C. S. Army, known to be badly wounded.
I, of course, lost all my baggage and camp equipage. I now wish to add that had I known the number of the enemy, and their means of getting to my rear, which all of my so-called reliable woodsmen informed me was impossible, I would have retreated on the night before, cutting down trees on both sides of the mountain, thus giving time to General Garnett to retreat by the way of Beverly and Huttonsville.
The loss of the enemy was not less than thirty killed and forty wounded.
When all so distinguished themselves by their gallantry it would be invidious to particularize, so I will only give a list of the companies engaged under the gallant De Lagnel: Company B, Twentieth Regi-

Of the officers with the companies sent to re-enforce Captain De Lagnel I particularly observed Lieutenant Brander’s conduct in his efforts to rush his men on to their duty.
Beverly, Va., July 15, 1861.
I find on examination that I have failed to mention my whole force at Rich Mountain on the 11th instant. It was about thirteen hundred men, of whom certainly not more than three hundred and fifty at the utmost were engaged in the battle at Hart’s house. As I placed them there myself, I am positive on this point. The whole force opposed to me was nearly ten thousand 5 their force engaged at Hart’s, as before mentioned, three thousand.
I have also failed to mention that very early on the morning of the 11th I made two most urgent appeals to the chief commissary stationed there for three days’ rations of hard bread and bacon.
I have now only to give you a list of all the officers who are prisoners here, and to urgently request you will have our exchange effected at the earliest possible day, as it is and always will be our most ardent wish to shed the last drop of our blood in the defense of our noble cause.

Battery, at Gamp Garnett, near Rich Mountain, Va., on the lltli of July last, are herewith inclosed.
The report of Lieutenant Raine shows that the movements of the enemy to attack us on the flank or in the rear were observed on the night of the 10th. Early on the morning of the 11th the observations of the night previous were confirmed by information from a wounded trooper of the enemy, who was captured. Communicating with Colonel Pegram early on the morning of the 11th, I received from him an order to take a gun that was stationed on an eminence on our left flank and locate it suitably on the turnpike road at Rich Mountain, about one mile and a half in the rear of Camp Garnett. Capt. J. A. De Lagnel, by orders of Colonel Pegram, took charge of this gun. I returned to the position of a gun one mile down the road toward the camp. Between 1 and 2 o’clock the first gun was fired by the gun on the hill. When I had planted that gun I asked Colonel Pegram if he would not have another gun there, to which he replied, uNTo; Captain De Lagnel will send to you for a gun when he needs one.” Between 4 and 5 o’clock I received a message from Captain De Lagnel that he needed a gun. Immediately I moved rapidly with the gun to his assistance, ordering Lieutenant Raine to bring on the caisson. Within a short distance of the scene of action one of the wheel-horses was killed and the other wounded. After this, meeting our retreating forces, I formed them in line and took position on the upper side of the road, in order to check the advance of the enemy. After being thus formed Colonel Pegram came up and proposed a night attack upon the enemy on the hill. In attempting to execute this movement Colonel Pegram advanced some distance beyond the position of the enemy on the hill. As we proceeded, finding that we had lost our way, I stopped with Lieutenant Raine and some others.
It was now raining freely: the night was dark; the trail was zigzag through thick clustering bushes, over large logs, and often steep and slippery. After resting a few hours I pursued the trail, and shortly overtook two companies of the column, from whose captains (Bruce and Jones) I learned that Colonel Pegram had returned to camp after directing Major Tyler to take the men on to Beverly. Being now about eight miles through the hills from General Garnett’s camp at Laurel Hill, I determined to attempt to communicate with him, for the purpose of obtaining such assistance as he could afford us, while we might attempt to unite our forces with his.
Taking Lieutenant Raine and three of my men I moved rapidly towards his camp. Striking the turnpike road near his camp, I perceived by the desertion of the picket-houses and the felling of trees across the road that his camp was evacuated. Surrounded by foraging parties of the enemy, who were moving about in different directions, I was compelled to remain in the mountains of Cheat for several days and nights before I could come out safely. At length I succeeded in doing so. During this time Lieutenant Raine and my three men, each armed with a musket, suffered much from fatigue, hunger, and thirst, but they were prompt and fearless in the discharge of duty.
I cannot close this report without referring to the conduct of the officers and soldiers of the Lee Battery, who were engaged either in the conflict at Rich Mountain or on duty during the several days preceding the action of the lith and on that day. They were surrounded by an overwhelming force. The guns of the battery were widely separated, from one-half to two miles apart. The conduct of Lieut. J. R. Massey and the men under him, in defense of their position against a large

force on their left, and their retaining it during the night of the 11th until all hope had vanished of further successful resistance, is worthy of all praise. Lieut. 0. I. Eaine bore himself on all occasions with calmness, prudence, and courage. Lieut. 0. W. Statham attested in the bloody fight on the hill at Eich Mountain that he did his duty truly and faithfully. He was wounded severely in his right hand. Of Capt. J. A. De Lagnel no words can express all that should be felt or known about his conduct on that day. After nearly all his cannoneers were either killed or wounded, he continued to load his gun until in the very act of bringing a cartridge from the limber-box to the gun (having then only two men at the gun) he was struck by a minie ball and fell. Fortunately, however, he escaped capture. The soldiers of the Lee Battery, noncommissioned officers and officers, have done their duty faithfully during this conflict.
The total loss of my men and officers was two killed and ten wounded —two commissioned officers, two non-commissioned officers, and eight privates. Of the twenty-one in the detachment at Eich Mountain a majority were either killed or wounded. The number of prisoners captured by the enemy of my men was eighteen, the most of them severely wounded. The enemy’s loss in killed and wounded is believed to have been more than three hundred. The loss of our own forces, including the infantry, cavalry, and artillery, is believed to be in killed and wounded seventy.

Report of First Lieut. Charles W. Statham, Lee Battery, 0. 8. Army, of the engagement at Rich Mountain.
Eich Mountain Pass, July 13,1861.
Sir : I have to report that on the 11th instant, by your order, I moved with one gun and a detachment of twenty-one men to occupy this pass in Eich Mountain. We took our position about 1 o’clock p. m. In less than two hours the enemy made their appearance in large column, six regiments strong, immediately on the hill south of the pass. We reversed our gun, which was pointed down the pass, and prepared to receive the enemy in the direction in which he was approaching. In a few minutes the sharpshooters of the enemy commenced a fire upon us from behind trees and rocks at a distance ranging from two to three hundred yards, the body of the enemy being still farther. We opened upon the main body with spherical shot, which I cut at first one second and a quarter, and could distinctly see them burst in their midst. I knew we did good execution, as I could distinctly hear their officers give vehement commands to close up ranks. After "firing this way some little time at the rate of near four shots per minute we forced the enemy to retire.
In about twenty minutes the enemy reappeared in a column of three regiments, advanced briskly upon us, when we moved our gun a little higher up the opposite hill and again opened upon them, and with our spherical shot cut as low as one second down to three-quarters. After

firing rapidly for some time the enemy again beat a hasty retreat, when my men, including the infantry not yet in action, rent the air with their shouts, confidently believing that we had gained the day. But in a short time the enemy again formed and renewed the attack with more swiftness than before, and soon played havoc with our horses. These, with the caisson, ran down the mountain, with drivers and all, leaving us with only the small amount of ammunition in our limber-box. We then limbered and moved our gun near a small log stable, behind which we placed our horses for protection. By this time our men were falling fast. Sergeant Turner, of the gun, had both legs broken and shot through the body; I. I. Mays had his left arm splintered with a musket ball ; Isaiah Ryder shot through the head, and died instantly; John A. Taylor had his thigh broken; E. H. Kersey, shot in the ankle; Lewis Going, wounded in the arm; William W. Stewart, badly wounded in the head and breast. This left me but few to man the gun. Captain De Lagnel, who was the commander of the post, having his horse shot under him and seeing our crippled condition, gallantly came and volunteered his valuable aid, and helped load and fire three or four times, when he was shot in the side, and, I think, in the hand. He then ordered us to make our escape, if we could, but the enemy was too close, and his fire too severe, to admit of safe retreat to many of us. I was shot through the right hand, and am now a prisoner, with the following of my men: Warren Currin, B. H. Davidson, James B. Creasey, William H. Broyles, and R. W. Walker. The rest of my command made their escape. I suppose we killed and wounded of the enemy some three hundred or more.
I take great pleasure in saying that my command in this fight, both those with guns and those in the artillery, acted heroically, and deserve the highest commendation. Private W. H. Broyles was the last to leave the gun, and pricked the last cartridge that we fired.

Camp Alleghany,
Focahontas County, Fa., August 8, 1861.
Sir: On the morning of the 11th of July, 1861, I was stationed, with one gun and detachment under my command, in a gorge on the left of the front breastworks at Camp Garnett, near the Rich Mountain, in the county of Randolph, Ya.
On the morning of the 11th of July you notified me to hold myself in readiness for prompt action. Between 10 and 11 o’clock a. m. I was informed by Colonel Heck that it was your order that my gun should be moved to the top of the Stonecoal Hill, which was on the extreme left of the camp in front. I moved to that position thereafter. Discovering a number of the enemy’s cavalry on top of Rich Mountain, opposite Hart’s house, about one and a half miles in the rear of our breastworks, I requested Colonel Heck to inform Colonel Pegram.

[Chap. IX.
About 12h o’clock the firing of a gun at Hart’s Hill, on Rich Mountain, commenced. After the fire of that gun had continued for some time forty or fifty of the enemy’s infantry appeared on the turnpike road in front of our breastworks. I commenced firing on them as they retired. The fire on the Rich Mountain continued for some time—between two and three hours. Shortly after its cessation the enemy commenced chopping and working with picks on the ascent of the hill called the Sugar Hill, on my left. While this was going on we heard the noise of gun-carriages ascending the hill. The day had been cloudy and rainy. The appearance of the sun about thirty minutes discovered to me a large body of the enemy’s infantry marching along the side of Sugar Hill next to me. The sun was now about an hour high. I commenced firing upon them. The enemy were evidently thrown into confusion and retired.
The loss of the enemy, I have been informed, in killed and wounded, was twenty-seven. In my detachment there were none killed or wounded. The men under my command, non-commissioned officers and privates, all performed their duty promptly and efficiently.
Remaining at my position, between 2 and 3 o’clock a. m. July 12 I was ordered to spike my gun and retreat. The companies supporting my gun all retired from the hill. At length a man came up the hill and spiked the gun, being ordered to do so, as he said, by Colonel Pegram. I then returned to the camp, and found the companies in camp forming to retreat. Captain Anderson and Lieutenant Raine had gone with Colonel Pegram and a portion of his command to make a night attack upon the enemy, and had not returned. Lieutenant Statham had been wounded at Rich Mountain, and was a prisoner. The command of the company devolving upon me, I ordered the musketeers to get their guns. I marched them and the cannoneers down into the road, and finally effected our retreat with the loss of the prisoners taken at Rich Mountain and a few others, in all amounting to eighteen men.

Report of Lieut. Charles L. Raine, Lee Battery, C. S. Army, of the engagement at Rich Mountain.
Camp Alleohany, August S, 1861.
Sir: On the night of the 10th of July, 1861, I was stationed with a gun and detachment of the Lee Battery on the extreme right, in front of Camp Garnett. In the forepart of the night of the 10th you brought to the support of my gun about thirty of your musketeers. Immediately after dusk chopping of axes commenced on the creek leading from the gorge near which I was stationed. At the same time chopping was distinctly heard on the mountain to the left of Camp Garnett. This chopping in both directions continued the whole night. On the night of the 10th, about 12 o’clock, you called my attention, awaking me, to the sound of the enemy’s bugle. In about one half hour we heard the roll of their drum, and shortly thereafter another sound of their bugle. We then saw on the ridges lights as if in motion. You concluded that

the enemy were moving, and ordered me to report the fact to Colonel Pegram. I did so. This was about 1.30 o’clock a. m. Thursday, the 11th. Colonel Pegram sent Adjutant Eansom to you. I remained up with you watching the movements of the enemy till morning, when you returned to camp.
About 9 o’clock a. m. of the 11th, as you passed with a gun to Hart’s house, on Eich Mountain, you ordered me to change the position of my gun, so as to rake the road and the ravines coming down into camp from near Hart’s house. About 1.30 o’clock p. m. the fire of Lieutenant Statham’s gun was heard. In about two hours or more you received a message from Captain De Lagnel. You immediately took the gun forward, and ordered me to bring up the caisson with ammunition. The gun and cannoneers moved at a rapid rate. Proceeding on quickly U the turn of the road I met our forces retreating. I was then informed that before the gun reached the top of the hill one of the wheel-horses of the gun-carriage had been killed and another wounded; that the tongue of the gun-carriage had been broken off $ that one of the drivers had been thrown, and the gun-carriage thrown down by the side of the hill. This occurred as reported to me. The enemy were in possession of the hill. I turned the caisson around in the road and brought it back. Proceeding a short distance back I found our retreating forces had been halted by you, and that you were urging them to go and retake the guns which had been lost. You immediately rallied the companies on the side of the hill, awaiting the advance of the enemy upon the retiring forces. While in this position Colonel Pegram came up and proposed a night attack upon the enemy. We advanced under Colonel Pegram and yourself toward Hart’s Hill, taking a route through the woods. The gun under my charge was left in the road, as hereinbefore stated. The caisson was sent back by me to the camp. The men under my command did their duty faithfully and promptly.

and anxious that Colonel Pegram’s letters and General Garnett’s orders under which I acted shall he preserved, I now beg leave to supply the omission.
In obedience to orders to proceed with my regiment to Laurel Hill, I left Richmond on the night of the 1st of July last, and after receiving two orders from General Garnett on my route to hurry on as rapidly as possible, and after marching my men seven days in succession from Staunton, I encamped with my regiment at Beverly, the county seat of Randolph County, on the night of Wednesday, the 10th of the same month $ and it is necessary that you should understand the localities of Beverly, Camp Garnett (Colonel Pegram’s camp), and Laurel Hill, with their surroundings, before you can fully understand and appreciate the remainder of my report. I will here insert a copy of a diagram drawn by General Garnett’s own hand, as I am informed by Colonel Corley, who then acted as his aid, and sent to me with order No. 5, hereinafter inserted. I have only taken the liberty of writing on it my own position during the greater part of the fight at Rich Mountain and the position of Huttonsville and Leadsville Church.
Colonel Pegram’s camp, called Camp Garnett, was on the western slope of Rich Mountain, and his fortifications faced west in the direction of Buckhannon. It is sixteen miles from Beverly to Laurel Hill and eight miles from Beverly to Colonel Pegram’s camp, as I have been informed. As you proceed from Beverly along the Buckhannon turnpike towards Colonel Pegram’s camp you will perceive a road on the right, which enters that turnpike about one and one-half miles from Beverly. From that road, which is a county road, a path, indicated by dots, strikes off at the point B, and crossing Rich Mountain at A bends to the left and enters the turnpike again in the front or on the west of Colonel Pegram’s camp. It will be perceived in the sequel that Colonel Pegram expected a portion of the enemy’s force to be sent by that path around his right flank, and after entering the county road to get into the turnpike in his rear, one and one-half miles from Beverly; at least such was the understanding of General Garnett, who drew and sent me the foregoing diagram.

I have already stated that I spent the night of Wednesday, the 10th of July, at Beverly. Next morning early a messenger from General Garnett waited on me, informing me that it was General Garnett’s orders I should hasten to Laurel Hill, and that he was then on his way to meet Colonel Edward Johnson, who had left Staunton with his regiment on the previous Monday. Accordingly, immediately after breakfast I started on the Laurel Hill turnpike for Laurel Hill, but T had not proceeded with my regiment more than three or four miles on that turnpike before I was overtaken by a messenger, who delivered to me the following letter from Colonel Pegram:
Headquarters Camp Garnett, July 11, 1861. Col. Wm. C. Scott, Forly-fourth Virginia Volunteers:
Sir : I think it almost certain that the enemy are working their way around my right flank, to come into this turnpike one and one-half miles this side of Beverly. I would suggest you place your regiment in position on that road, and take with you the two pieces of artillery at Leadsville Church. I have cavalry scouting between this and that road, and will re-enforce you as soon as I get information of the approach of the enemy. I shall at once write a letter to General Garnett, informing him of my opinion a$ to the movements of the enemy and of the request I have made of you. I need not tell you how fatal it would be to have the enemy in our rear, as it would entirely cut off our supplies.
Very respectfully,
JOHN PEGRAM, Lieutenant~Colonel, Commanding.
After delivering this letter the messenger dashed on to Laurel Hill. This letter was read to most of my officers and to Mr. John N. Hughes, who resided in Beverly, with whom I had become acquainted in the late Virginia Convention, and who had expressed a determination to join my regiment. He said he was perfectly acquainted with the road on which Colonel Pegram desired me to take position. What was I to do ? The exigency was pressing. If the enemy should get to Colonel Pegram’s rear and get possession of Beverly, where all our quartermaster and commissary stores, &c., were deposited, both Colonel Pegram and General Garnett would be compelled to retreat, for an army cannot live without supplies. I could not wait to send to Laurel Hill, twelve or thirteen miles distant, for orders, for, were I to do so, from the character of Colonel Pegram’s letter I believed the enemy would get into the Buck-hannon turnpike before me, for that letter says: u It is almost certain that the enemy are working their way around my right flank to get into this turnpike one and a half miles this side of Beverly.” u Are working their way ” being in the present tense, I supposed the enemy were already on their march by that route, hence I did not hesitate as to the course I should pursue. Having no writing materials, I sent Captain Shelton and Sergeant Spindle to Leadsville Church, about three or four miles in advance of me, for the two pieces of artillery spoken of in Colonel Pegram’s letter, and for the Greenbrier Troop of Cavalry, which I understood was stationed at that place. After distributing cartridges to the men I returned to Beverly, and then took the Buckhannon turnpike, which I followed until I reached the point at which the county road referred to by Colonel Pegram enters it on the right, one and a half miles from Beverly. At that point I took position with my regiment. While there Captain Shelton and Sergeant Spindle, who had been sent to Leadsville Church, brought me information that the two pieces of artillery had been removed from that place to Laurel Hill, and that the commander of the Greenbrier Cavalry refused to come, on the ground that my order was not in writing. The messenger, who had gone on to Laurel Hill with a

[Chap. IX.
letter from Colonel Pegram to General Garnett, also returned, bringing me the following orders from General Garnett:
Headquarters Department N. W. A.,
Camp at Laurel Hill, July 11, 1861.
Colonel Scott,
Commanding Regiment en route to Laurel Hill:
Colonel : General Garnett directs that you return to Beverly and take up the position in the Bnckhannon road requested by Colonel Pegram, and defend your position to the last, if you should he attacked.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JAMES L. CORLEY,
Captain, C. S. Army, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
Take some of Captain Moorman’s men with you from Leadsville Church, and inform me by a mounted express of any movement of the enemy of which you are positive.
By order of General Garnett:
JAMES L. CORLEY,
Captain, C. S. Army.
And for fear I should not know the point in the Buckhannon road which Colonel Pegram requested me to occupy, General Garnett sent me, with the order, the following extract from Colonel Pegram’s letter to him, viz:
I have reason to believe the enemy is trying to work his way to my rear by the road which comes into this turnpike, one and a half miles this side of Beverly. I have therefore suggested to Colonel Scott that he take position with his regiment on that road.
Respectfully, &c.,
JOHN PEGRAM, Lieutenant-Colonel, fyc.
Prom this extract and these orders there was no room for mistaking u the position in the Buckhannon road requested by Colonel Pegram.” It was at the junction of the county road and the Buckhannon turnpike. You will observe the stringency of these orders. They gave me no discretion. Let us analyze them:
1.	I was ordered to take position in the Buckhannon road, as requested by Colonel Pegram.
2.	I was ordered to defend my position to the last, if I should be attacked.
3.	In case there should be any movement of the enemy of which I was positive, I was not authorized to use my discretion whether or not I should leave my position to meet or counteract that movement, but I was to inform General Garnett by a mounted express, and of course wait for orders.
There were but two contingencies on which I should have felt justified in leaving my position.
1.	If Colonel Pegram had requested me to go anywhere else, as he was the commanding officer at the fort, and was presumed to know from his pickets and scouts more of the movements of the enemy than any one else, and as I had been placed in my position at his request, I should have abandoned it and gone anywhere else he desired on a like request, presuming that my doing so would meet with the approbation of General Garnett.
2.	The only other contingency on which I should have felt justified in quitting my position was, if I should ascertain by any means that the enemy would not come along the county road which I was ordered to guaTd and along which Colonel Pegram thought it was almost certain they would come. I heard the firing on the mountain in the direction of Colonel Pegranfs camp. Indeed, it had commenced before I had received the foregoing orders. It was at first straggling, as if pickets

277
were engaged, as I presume was the case. After a while it became more animated, and a volley could occasionally be heard, though generally it seemed to be independent and at will. Ultimately artillery opened and was continued with great animation. I thought that the artillery was fired at Colonel Pegram’s fort and from his fort. I had no reason to believe that he had removed any of his artillery outside of his intrench-ments. In short, from the firing of the artillery, I thought that the enemy had attacked his camp ; but was that any reason why I should, in disobedience of General Garnett’s orders, quit my position and go to the firing ? I thought not. For if the enemy were working their way around Colonel Pegram’s right flank, as he thought it almost certain they were doing, to get into his rear by the county road which I was ordered to guard, I thought it very natural they should make an attack on his camp, either a bona fide attack or a feigned attack, to attract his (Colonel Pegram’s) attention, and cover up their design of getting to his rear by the county road aforesaid. I therefore looked for the enemy by that road as eagerly after the firing commenced as I did before.
Again, I reflected if I should leave my position, and the enemy in my absence should come along that road and go to Beverly and destroy our quartermaster and commissary stores, &c., there, or should go up the mountain and attack Colonel Pegram in his rear, and I should be arraigned before a court-martial for disobedience of orders, what defense could I make ? I would say I thought a fight was going on at the camp and that my presence was necessary. But the judge-advocate would reply: Did not Colonel Pegram inform you in his letter that he was almost certain the enemy were working their way around his right flank to come into the turnpike at the point at which you were posted ? Did not General Garnett order you to take position at that point and defend it to the last if you should be attacked? Did he give you any discretion whatever in regard to leaving your position ? On the contrary, did he not order that if there was any movement of the enemy of which you were positive, you were to inform him of it by a mounted express, and of course wait for orders ? Did not Colonel Pegram inform you in his letter he had cavalry scouting between his camp and your position, and ought you not to have known that he would have sent for you if he had wanted you ? To these interrogations I could only have replied in the affirmative. I repeat, if I had left my position and the enemy had come along that way, as Colonel Pegram thought it almost certain they would do, I would have been, and would deserved to have been, cashiered for disobedience of orders.
Again, it occurred to me if I should go up the mountain and before getting to Colonel Pegram’s camp find men fighting in the woods—and it was nearly all woods between my position and his camp—upon which party should I direct my men to fire? There was no badge by which friends could be distinguished from enemies, and even if there had been, it would have been of no use in the woods. I should as likely have fired on friend as foe. Should our friends have fired on me by mistake I should have returned the fire, and thus the most disastrous consequences would have ensued. In such case both the public and a court-martial would have condemned me for disobeying orders by leaving my position. I have since ascertained I was right on this point. Our men engaged in the fight on Bich Mountain knew nothing of my position nor of my presence in their immediate neighborhood, and many of them have since told me that had I gone up they certainly would have fired upon me. Lieutenant Statham, of Lynchburg, who commanded our piece of artillery in the fight after Captain De Lagnel was wounded, has informed

﻿278	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
me that if I had come up the turnpike that day he would have riddled my regiment. Had I been furnished with a guide I might probably have rendered material service in that fight, but without a guide I was as likely to do as much damage to friends as foes.
Again, I reflected, my position is occupied by me at the instance of Colonel Pegram. He has informed me in his letter that he has cavalry scouting between his camp and my position, and if he needs me elsewhere he will certainly inform me of it.
From these considerations I did not think proper to disobey General Garnett’s orders and leave my position, unless I should get some message from Colonel Pegram that he desired me to do so. Although I constantly looked for the enemy on the county road along which it was almost certain they would come, yet I as eagerly looked for a message from Colonel Pegram by some of the cavalry, which he informed me were scouting between his camp and my position. But getting no such message or any information from the fight, and becoming impatient, I determined to send a messenger myself. I therefore ordered Mr. John NT. Hughes, who volunteered for that purpose, to go to Colonel Pegram, and know from him whether or not he wished my services at any other point than the one I then occupied, and if so, to send me a guide. If not, I ordered Hughes to bring me information of whatever was going on.
He dashed up the mountain at a rapid gallop. I awaited his return. At length I began to think it was time for him to be back. But then I recollected he would have to go more than six miles to Colonel Pe-gram’s camp and the same distance back, besides finding and having an interview with that officer. At length a cavalry officer and a few of his men came down the turnpike. He announced himself as Lieutenant Cochrane, of the Churchville Cavalry, from Augusta County, Virginia. He informed me that the enemy, to the number of four thousand or five thousand men, had come around Colonel Pegram’s left (not his right) flank, and were then engaged fighting some three hundred of our men about a mile and a half in the rear of Colonel Pegram’s camp, and between my regiment and that camp; that there had been no attack upon the camp itself; that our men were on the right and the enemy on the left of the turnpike as I would approach the camp; that our men had one piece of artillery in or near the road, and that I was wanted at the fight.
Being satisfied then that the enemy would not come around Colonel Pegram’s right flank and the county road I was ordered to guard, as they had already gotten in his rear by coming around his left flank, I determined to quit my position, where I was no longer of use, and taking Lieutenant Cochrane and his men with me as guides, go up the mountain and join in the fight. That officer readily consented to accompany me as guide, and I put my men in motion at double-quick time. But for a detailed account of my march up the mountain and down again to Beverly I refer to the following letter of Lieutenant Cochrane, who was with me the whole time, premising that, with the exception of one or two unimportant particulars, his recollection coincides with mine :
Monterey, March 6, 1862.
Col. William C. Scott,
Forty-fourth Regiment Virginia Volunteers:
Colonel : Your letter, dated Powhatan Court-House, February 28, requesting me to state in my reply what occurred while I was with you on the 11th day of July last in relation to the Rich Mountain fight, has just been received, and I hasten to reply. I was sent out with a squad of six men by Captain De Lagnel, who commanded our forces engaged in the fight, to bring up some cavalry that he had fired on through

mistake. In going down the turnpike I unexpectedly met with your regiment drawn up in the road about a mile and a half from Beverly. I told you your regiment was needed at the battle which was then going on; that the enemy to the number of four or five thousand had gotten around Colonel Pegram’s left flank, and were engaged with a few hundred of our men about a mile and a half in the rear of Colonel Pegram’s camp ; that the enemy were on the left, and our men in and on the right of the turnpike as you would approach the camp; that our men had hut one piece of artillery. You asked me if I would go with you and act as guide. I consented. You instantly put your regiment in motion in double-quick time. I remonstrated; told you we had to go between four and five miles up the mountain before we would reach the battlefield, and if the men traveled at that rate they would not he fit to fight when they got there. You then brought them down to quick time.
In going up the mountain we met with several men on horseback who had been in the battle; one, I recollect, of my company, who had been shot through the foot, and another whose coat had been shot across the shoulders. The latter told us that he was aid to Colonel Pegram, and that Colonel Pegram had been killed. Some of these men turned back and went with us part of the way up the mountain, but they all disappeared before your regiment stopped. On our way up I informed you of the death of Hughes, and you requested me not to mention it to your men, as it might dampen their spirit. When we arrived within about a mile of the battle the firing ceased, and in a few moments a loud huzza was heard coming from the position our forces had occupied when I left them. You asked me what that huzza meant. I told you that I was fearful the Yankees had driven our men from the field and captured our artillery, for the shout came from about the place where our artillery and fortifications stood. You continued your march to within half a mile of the battle-ground, when I informed you that it "was unsafe to go farther; that you could not with one regiment encounter successfully four or five thousand of the enemy, with the advantage of position, fortifications, and a piece of artillery. You halted your regiment; you and I dismounted, and in company with some of your officers passed around a turn in the road that we might see, if possible, how things stood at the pass on top of the mountain, when we did see rpore men, as I told you at the time, exulting and shouting, than Colonel Pegram had in his entire command.
You were yet unwilling to go back, but requested me either to go myself or to send some of my men to reconnoiter. I told you I would not go, nor should any of my men go, for I was perfectly satisfied as to how things stood. A young man named Lipford, of your regiment, stepped forward and proposed to go if he could get a pistol and horse. Thus equipped, he went off up the road, but in a very short time we heard the shout from many voices, u Halt, shoot him,” and the firing of several guns, and then another loud huzza. It being now plain that the enemy had either killed or taken Lipford prisoner, you were satisfied that I was rig;ht, and that the enemy did have possession of the field. You appearing still unwilling to go hack, some of your officers suggested that as the enemy’s pickets could plainly be seen around the fields on each side of the road in which we stood, if you went forward the enemy would receive you in ambuscade, whereas if you went back they would probably follow, and then you -could take them in ambuscade. This suggestion being approved by all of us who expressed any opinion, you marched your regiment down the mountain, leaving men in the rear to give you information of the approach of the enemy. In going down information was brought you that the enemy were in pursuit, when you put your men in position to receive them. After remaining there some time, and the alarm proving false, and all being quiet on the mountain, you returned to Beverly.
Had the firing been renewed, I know it was your intention to have returned to the battle. Shortly after arriving in Beverly you had a private conference in a room in the hotel with Judge Camden and Mr. Berlin. During the conference I consulted you on the? propriety of removing the military stores from Beverly, when you gave the order that every wagon that could be obtained should be filled with them, and all the prisoners should be taken out of jail and put under a guard of your regiment; *all of which was accordingly done. I and my company were with you during your retreat as far as Greenbrier River, and acted as scouts, and am free to say that the retreat was conducted in good order, both by yourself and regiment—the men, worn-oat by continued marching, in the rear, guarding prisoners and tram. During the whole affair you conducted yourself with coolness and firmness becoming an officer.
JAMES COCHRANE, Lieutenant, Churchville Cavalry.
Some of those we met in going up the mountain estimated the enemy •at from eight to ten thousand, and it turns out that I acted wisely in not making an attack upon the enemy when I went up the mountain. Oolonel Pegram estimates the number of the enemy engaged in the fight at three thousand. I have no doubt they told him so in Beverly,

## p. 280 (#296) ############################################

﻿280	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., YA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
but I have as little doubt they underrated their strength. Colonel Pegram did not see the enemy engaged after the fight, and therefore had no means of forming a correct estimate for himself. Lieut. C. W. Statham, who commanded our artillery in the fight, and who was wounded and taken prisoner on the field, and who did have an opportunity of judging for himself, and others who were taken prisoners, have informed me that the enemy had six regiments engaged, under General Rosecrans, on that occasion. As it is said that Northern regiments are composed of twelve hundred men each, it is fair to presume that the six regiments, after making all allowances for sickness, &e., numbered at least five thousand or six thousand men. According to the estimate of my adjutant, I had with me on that day five hundred and seventy. What chance I would have stood with that number, without artillery, in an attack on five or six thousand men, or even three thousand, flushed with victory, with choice of position, and in possession of artillery and fortifications, every one can decide for himself. Every officer and, I believe, every man in my regiment approved of the course I pursued, and subsequent reflection has only confirmed my conviction that I acted wisely.
It may be said that I should have renewed the attack, with the expectation that I would be re-enforced from the fort. I had heard from one who said his name was Bacon, and who styled himself Colonel Pegram7s aid, and who therefore ought to have known that Colonel Pegram was killed before he (the aide) left the fight, and I concluded if his command in the camp would not or could not re-enforce a portion of their own men when engaged in the fight, and whom they knew needed their assistance, I had no reason to believe they would re-enforce me, when they did not know whether I needed their assistance or not. I believed the battle to be over, as far as Colonel Pegram’s command was concerned. Had the fight, however, been renewed by any of them, I should unquestionably have gone to their assistance, and so expressed myself at the time.
It is especially unbecoming in that portion of Colonel Pegram7s command who remained in the camp, and who took no part in the fight, to find fault with me, as I understand some of them have done, for not quitting my position earlier, or not renewing the attack after I went up the mountain. They knew, or had an opportunity of knowing, that the enemy in large force had come around Colonel Pegram’s left flank, and were engaged with a small number of their own men, who needed their assistance. I knew none of these facts until the moment I started up the mountain, nor whether our men who were engaged needed my assistance or not. If they say they could not leave their posts without disobeying orders, I say I could not leave my post, where I was informed I was wanted, to go to a place where I did not know whether I was wanted or not, without equally disobeying orders. If they sent no messenger to Colonel Pegram, I did send a messenger to him, to know whether my presence was wanted or not. If they say they could not leave their post because they expected the enemy in front, I say I could not leave my post because I expected the enemy by the right flank, by a road along which I was informed by the commanding officer it was almost certain they were coming. If they say that with one thousand two hundred men (for they did not lose one hundred in the fight), with artillery, they were too weak to renew the fight with so numerous an enemy to cut their way out, I say I was too weak with less than half that number, without artillery, to cut my way in.
It has been said that I should have gone to the assistance of Colonel

Pegram. I did go to Ms assistance at tlie very time, at the very place^ and in the very manner requested by him and ordered by General Garnett. If that time, place, and manner were not the right time, place, and manner, it was not my fault.
It has been said that Hughes was drunk when I sent him to Colonel Pegram. This, in my opinion, and in the opinion of those of my regiment with whom I have conversed on the subject, is a foul slander on a gallant man and a patriot, who lost his life in serving his country. If Hughes had been drinking at all, I did not perceive it in his appearance, manner, or conduct.
It is proper I should notice the following order, which I received from General Garnett some time during the day on which the fight took place:
Headquarters Department N. W. A.,
Camp at Laurel Hill, July 11, 1861.
Colonel Scott,
Commanding Begiment en route to Laurel Hill:
Colonel : General Garnett directs that you take your position high up on the road indicated by Colonel Pegram, secrete your men, and cut down trees to block up the road in front of you. If you are forced hack, block up the road as you go and defend every inch of it.
By order of General Garnett:
JAMES L. CORLEY,
Captain, C. S. A., Acting Assistant Adjutant-General,
If you have not axes enough to block up the road with, send down to Beverly for them.
The road to which that order refers is the county road I was ordered to guard. Candor compels me to say that I do not recollect distinctly the time at which that order was received. I know it was not received before I sent Hughes as a messenger to Colonel Pegram. I am satisfied it was received after Lieutenant Cochrane came to me from the mountain, and I believe I received it after I returned from the mountain and reached Beverly. If I received it after I sent Hughes to Colonel Pegram, and before I went up the mountain, I doubtless did not obey' it, because I was anxious to hear from Colonel Pegram; and to go high up the county road and secrete my men would place it out of my power to reach him in time to render him any assistance in case he should request my presence on the mountain. If I received it, as I am satisfied I did, after Lieutenant Cochrane came to me, I did not obey it, because I had ascertained from that officer and his men that the enemy would uot come along that road, as they had already come around Colonel Pegram’s left flank. But whenever received, it made but little or no impression upon me, as I deemed it folly to be executed at that time. My decided impression is, however, that I received it after my return to Beverly, and late in the evening, while annoyed by a crowd.
My retreat— Why I did not fortify Cheat Mountain, &c.—On arriving at Beverly I was immediately surrounded by a crowd of citizens and others. Seeing among them Mr. George W. Berlin, with whom I had been acquainted in the Convention, and Judge Camden, a member of the Provisional Congress, I requested an interview with them in a private room in the hotel. During that interview Lieutenant Cochrane consulted me on the propriety of removing quartermaster and commissary stores from Beverly, and I ordered him to get all the wagons that could be procured and fill them with those stores, and take out of jail some twenty prisoners and place them under a guard of my regiment. I consulted Mr. Berlin and Judge Camden as to the course I should pursue, and our interview ended by my determination to go to Laurel Hill with my regiment that night; but on going into the street

﻿282	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
in which I left my regiment I found it had gone towards Huttonsville, the opposite direction to that of Laurel Hill, some one having informed my lieutenant-colonel it was my wish he should go that way. I mounted my horse, dashed off at a rapid rate, and overtook it between one and two miles from Beverly, and turned it back in the direction of Laurel Hill 5 but on reaching Beverly I saw two men, who informed me that they were just from Laurel Hill, that General Garnett himself was on the retreat, and that he had ordered his tents to be struck for that purpose before they left his camp. This changed my programme. I saw no use in going to General Garnett, as I would only serve to encumber his retreat. I therefore determined to retreat myself, and accordingly left Beverly, I suppose, between 10 and 11 o’clock that night.
The night was dark, rainy, and dismal -3 the roads were muddy. My wagons, with those loaded with our quartermaster and commissary stores, munitions of war, &c., constituted a train one, two, or three miles in length. My regiment marched in the rear to protect them from attack. When one stopped all behind it stopped, and my regiment also; consequently my progress was slow. After getting about two or three miles from Beverly I was overtaken by a messenger from General Garnett with the following order, which I read by the lantern which the guard carried with the prisoners:
Headquarters Department N. W. A.,
Camp at Laurel Hill, July 11, 1861.
Colonel Scott,
Commanding Regiment en route to Laurel Hill:
Colonel : I am directed by General Garnett to furnish you with the inclosed sketch, and to say that he wishes you to march all night, if necessary to attain the point B on the sketch, and to block up the path so far towards A as you can, and the road towards C. If the enemy should have reached the point A, then block up as much as you can.
By order of General Garnett:
JAMES L. CORLEY,
Captain, C. S. A., Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
The inclosed sketch to which he refers was the diagram, a copy of which is inserted above [p. 274]. Your honor cannot fully understand this order unless you read it in connection with the diagram. If you will turn to it you will see I was not directed to blockade the Buckhannon turnpike, leading from Colonel Pegram’s camp to Beverly, but that portion of the county road I had been ordered to guard which extends from B to C, and the path which struck off from that county road from B to the point A where it crossed the mountain. I saw at once the mistake under which General Garnett was laboring. He had heard of the fight at Rich Mountain, and from Colonel Pegram’s letter to him in the morning he believed that the enemy had gotten to Colonel Pegram’s rear by turning his right flank, and coming along that path and county road would still continue to come that way. Now I knew they had not come that way, but had come around Colonel Pegram’s left flank. I deemed it, therefore, an act of supreme folly to turn my regiment back at 12 o’clock at night, and march all night, and next day commence blockading a path and road in which I knew no enemy had put his foot and no enemy would put his foot. Besides, as neither artillery or cavalry could get over the mountain by that path, of what use was it to blockade it on this side of the mountain against infantry, which could easily get around the blockade?
Again, I reflected if I should obey General Garnett’s orders it would almost certainly insure the loss of my whole command. It would probably take me all night to reach the point B, and later in the day to climb the mountain and reach the point A. This point A was but a

283
short distance from the place where the fight occurred, and where I understood the enemy would bivouac that night. As soon as the trees should begin to fall they would be heard by the enemy, their pickets or scouts, and almost immediately it would be ascertained that a regiment was blockading the path. In that case all that the enemy would have to do would be to come down the Buckhannon turnpike leading to Beverly with their piece of artillery until they should reach the county road I was ordered to guard that day and go up that road until they should reach the path I was blockading. What then would be my situation, blocked up in front by my fallen trees and hemmed in the rear by an overwhelming enemy ? I therefore told the messenger who brought me the order to tell General Garnett that he was mistaken in supposing the enemy had gotten to Colonel Pegram’s rear by the path and road he had ordered me to blockade, for that they had come around Colonel Pegram’s left flank ; that I should probably lose my whole command if I were to obey his order, and that therefore I should continue my retreat. I have since seen Colonel Corley, General Garnett’s aide, who wrote that order, and he informed me I was right in supposing that when that order was given General Garnett was under the belief the enemy had gotten to Colonel Pegram’s rear by the path and county road aforesaid and would continue to come that way.
I have been charged with blockading a part of the turnpike between Laurel Hill and Beverly, which prevented General Garnett’s retreat by that town. The charge is false. No road was blockaded by me. No tree was cut by my orders or by my regiment anywhere.
On arriving next morning near the Jeff. Davis Hotel, a log tavern, seven miles from Beverly, I was overtaken by another messenger from General Garnett with the following order:
July 11, 1861.
Colonel Scott :
General Garnett directs that you endeavor to keep the enemy in cheek on the other side of Beverly until daylight. If you are forced back, send me a mounted expressman stating the facts.
JAMES L. CORLEY,
Captain, C. 8. A., Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
As it was already sunrise when I received this order, and I was nearly seven miles from Beverly, its execution was impracticable. In answer to it I wrote a long note with a pencil on a fence rail to General Garnett, and sent it by the same messenger who brought me the order.
On arriving at Huttonsville, eleven and a quarter miles from Beverly, I halted my regiment for breakfast. While there I was joined by Major Tyler with a few companies from the Twentieth (Colonel Pegram’s) Regiment, and while there I received the following (the last) order from General Garnett:
General Garnett has concluded to go to Hardy County and towards Cheat Bridge. You will take advantage of a position beyond Huttonsville and draw your supplies from Richmond, and report for orders there.
JAMES L. CORLEY,
Captain, C. S. Army, Acting Assistant Adjiitant-General.
It has been stated that I was ordered by General Garnett to stop on Cheat Mountain and fortify. There is not a word in this order about Cheat Mountain. General Garnett, as he ought to have done, left it to my discretion where to stop. At the time I did think seriously of stopping on Cheat Mountain and fortifying, but I abandoned the idea on the following considerations:
1. I had no adequate implements with which to fortify. I had thirty picks, ten shovels, and ten axes; and when it is recollected what a rocky

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
mountain Cheat is, it will be seen that it would have taken a long time to throw up the most ordinary field works.
2.	I thought that if I had all the implements I could desire the enemy would be upon me before I could make even respectable fortifications. My men were worn-out by marching nine days and one night continuously. I expected the enemy to pursue, as I thought he ought to pursue. Why should he not ? He had from ten thousand to twenty thousand men in the valley which lay at the foot of the mountain, with no enemy there to engage his attention. General Morris pursued General Garnett; why should not General McClellan pursue me, as I was encumbered by a long train of wagons conveying our commissary and quartermaster’s stores, &c. ? Indeed, information was brought me by my scouts, when near the top of Cheat Mountain, that the enemy’s cavalry had been seen between Beverly and Huttonsville, coming in our direction. I therefore expected if I stopped upon the mountain the enemy would be upon me before I could make much progress in making fortifications, and I have since ascertained I was right in my opinion, as the following letter of Adjutant Willis, of the Twelfth Georgia Regiment (who was sent by General Henry R. Jackson to General McClellan’s camp on Cheat Mountain to receive our men who had been taken prisoners on parole, and who there met Lieutenant Merrill), will show :
Camp Bartow, Va., November 21, 1861.
Col. Wm. C. Scott :
Sir : You having expressed a desire that I should recount to you the conversation which passed between myself and Lieut. William E. Merrill, formerly an officer of the U. S. Army, Corps of Engineers, and at this time a prisoner of war in Richmond. Va., I comply by making this statement of facts, namely: That Lieutenant Merrill said that had Colonel Scott’s regiment attempted to make a stand on Cheat Mountain on the 12th day of July, the time his regiment passed that point on its retreat from Rich Mountain, McClellan would have bent every energy and employed every man, so that he (Colonel Scott) could not have held it an hour, and not only that he could not, but both his regiment and Colonel Johnson’s Georgia regiment would have been driven therefrom had they attempted to have stopped, the enemy being in such close pursuit that there would have been no time for them to have erected even light field fortifications. He admitted McClellan’s force to exceed twenty thousand men. I will add, sir, that Lieutenant Merrill is an old friend of mine, honorable and brave, and a consultation of the Army Register for the year 1859 will show that he carried away without division all the honors of his class; consequently his professional opinion as given above can but have weight.
Hoping that should any of that class of brave fellow-citizens known as critics dispute the policy of either your not passing or Colonel Johnson not advancing on Cheat Mountain, this unvarnished recital of facts may be its refutation.
I am, sir, yours, truly,
EDWARD WILLIS,
Second Lieutenant, First Infantry, C. S. Army.
P. S.—Lieutenant Merrill said that McClellan and staff reached Cheat Mountain the next day about 3 o’clock.
I passed the top of Cheat Mountain just before sunset Friday, the 12th of July. General McClellan and staff were there on the next day (Saturday) at 3 o’clock, and he occupied the place in force on Monday, as I am credibly informed. It is plain, therefore, that had I halted there I should have been overtaken by an overwhelming force of all arms before I could have made the most ordinary defenses.
3.	I ascertained that if I were to stop on Cheat Mountain, and could even make successful fortifications, my position could easily be turned, and the enemy could get into my rear and cut off my supplies. All that they would have to do for that purpose would be to leave the Staunton turnpike at Huttonsville, and go by a good road to Huntersville, some thirty or forty miles distant, and then by another road thirty

285
miles, where it intersects with the Staunton turnpike again at Greenbrier River, at the eastern base of Cheat Mountain. By doing this they could besiege me in front and rear. Nor had I any reason to expect that in the mean time I could get sufficient re-enforcements to be of any practical utility, for the top of Cheat Mountain is more than eighty miles from Staunton, from which our re-enforcements would have to march on foot.
For these reasons, to say nothing of the want of artillery to defend fortifications when made, I concluded not to stop on the top of Cheat Mountain, but continue my march to Greenbrier Biver, at the eastern base of the mountain and some ten or twelve miles distant, where I expected to meet Col. Edward Johnson, who was due there with his regiment that (Friday) night, and who would have command both of his regiment and mine, and leave it to his discretion whether or not to return to the top of the mountain and fortify. I did so, accordingly, and met Colonel Johnson the next day (Saturday) at Greenbrier River, as I expected. He, without consulting me on the subject, ordered the retreat to be continued to the top of the Alleghany Mountains, where we met General H. R. Jackson, who continued it to Monterey.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. C. SCOTT,
Colonel Forty-fourth Regiment Virginia Volunteers.
General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General.
No. 29.
Report of Col. W. B. Taliaferro, Twenty-third Virginia Infantry, of the action at Carricos Ford.
Monterey, August 10,1861.
General : As no report has been required of me by the officer (Colonel Ramsey, of the First Regiment Georgia Volunteers) who succeeded to the command of General Garnett’s force on the death of that officer, of the action at Carrick’s Ford, at which my regiment with a section of artillery was engaged with the enemy, I beg in justice to the officers and men who were with me to make to you a brief report.
On the evening of the 12th July General Garnett bivouacked at Kaler’s Ford, on Cheat River, the rear of his command being about two miles back on Pleasant Run. On the morning of the 13th July the command was put in motion about 8 o’clock, the Thirty-seventh Virginia and Colonel Jackson’s regiment and Lieutenant-Colonel Hans-borough’s battalion, with a section of artillery, under Captain Shumaker, and a squadron of cavalry, under Captain Smith, forming the advance; then the baggage train, and then Colonel Ramsey’s First Georgia and the Twenty-third Virginia Regiment, constituting, with Lieutenant Lanier’s section of artillery and a cavalry force under Captain Jackson, the rear of the command. Before the wagon train (which was very much impeded by the condition of the county road over which it had to pass, rendered very bad by the heavy rains of the preceding night) had crossed the first ford half a mile above Kaler’s, the cavalry scouts reported that the enemy were close upon our rear with a very large force of infantry, well supported by cavalry and artillery. The First Georgia Regiment was immediately ordered to take position across the meadow on the river side and hold the enemy in check until the train had passed

﻿286	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
the river, and then retreat behind the Twenty-third Virginia Regiment, which was ordered to take position and defend the train until the Georgia troops had formed again in some defensible position.
By the time the Georgians had crossed the river, and before some of the companies of that regiment who were thrown out to ambuscade the enemy could be brought over, the enemy appeared in sight of our troops, and immediately commenced firing upon them. This was briskly returned by the Georgia regiment, who after some rounds retired, in obedience to the orders received. The Twenty-third Virginia and the artillery were halted about three-quarters of a mile below the crossing, and were ordered to occupy a hill commanding the valley through which the enemy would have to approach and a wood which commanded the road* This position they held until the Georgia regiment was formed some distance in advance; then the former command retired and again reformed in advance of the Georgians. This system of retiring upon eligible positions for defense admirably selected by Captain Corley, adjutant-general to General Garnett, was pursued without loss on either side, a few random shots only reaching us, until we reached Garrick’s Ford, three and a half miles from Kaler’s. This is a deep ford, rendered deeper than usual by the rains, and here some of the wagons became stalled in the river and had to be abandoned.
The enemy were now close upon the rear, which consisted of the Twenty-third Regiment and the artillery; and as soon as this command had crossed Captain Corley ordered me to occupy the high bank on the right of the ford with my regiment and the artillery. On the right this position was protected by a fence, on the left only by low bushes, but the hill commanded the ford and the approach to it by the road, and was admirably selected for defense. In a few minutes the skirmishers of the enemy were seen running along the opposite bank, which was low and skirted by a few trees, and were at first taken for the Georgians, who were known to have been cut off; but we were soon undeceived, and a hearty cheer for President Davis having been given by Lieutenant Washington, C. S. Army, reiterated with a simultaneous shout by the whole command, we opened upon the enemy. The enemy replied to us with a heavy fire from their infantry and artillery. We could discover that a large force was brought up to attack us, but our continued and well-directed fire kept them from crossing the river, and twice we succeeded in driving them back some distance from the ford. They again, however, came up with a heavy force and renewed the fight. The fire of their artillery was entirely ineffective, although their shot and shell were thrown very rapidly; but they all flew over our heads without any damage, except bringing the limbs of trees down upon us. The working of our three guns under Lieutenants Lanier, Washington, and Brown was admirable, and the effect upon the enemy very destructive. We could witness the telling effect of almost every shot.
After continuing the fight until nearly every cartridge had been expended, and until the artillery had been withdrawn by General Garnett’s orders, and as no part of his command was within sight or supporting distance, as far as I could discover, nor, as I afterwards ascertained, within four miles of me, I ordered the regiment to retire. I was induced, moreover, to do this, as I believed the enemy were making an effort to turn our flank, and without support it would have been impossible to have held the position, and as already nearly thirty of my men had been killed and wounded. The dead and severely wounded we had to leave upon the field, but retired in perfect order, the officers and men manifesting decided reluctance at being withdrawn. After march-

ing half a mile I was met by Colonel Starke, General Garnett’s aide, who directed me to move on with my regiment to the next ford, a short distance in advance, where I would overtake General Garnett.
On the farther side of this ford I met General Garnett, who directed me to halt my regiment around the turn of the road, some hundred and fifty yards off, and to detail for him ten good riflemen, remarking to me, “ This is a good place behind this drift-wood to post skirmishers.’7 I halted the regiment as ordered, but from the difficulty of determining who were the best shots, I ordered Captain Tompkins to report to the general with his whole company. The general, however, would not permit them to remain, but after selecting ten men, under Lieutenant Depriest, ordered the company back to the regiment.
By General Garnett’s orders, conveyed by Colonel Starke, I posted with that officer three of my companies on a high bluff overlooking the river, but, finding the undergrowth so thick that the approach of the enemy could not be well observed, they were withdrawn. A few minutes after these companies rejoined the regiment Colonel Starke rode up and said that General Garnett directed me to march as rapidly as I could and overtake the main body. In a few minutes afterwards Lieutenant Depriest reported to me that General Garnett had been killed. He fell just as he gave the order to the skirmishers to retire, and one of them was killed by his side.
It gives me pleasure to bear testimony to the coolness and spirit displayed by officers and men in this affair. Lieutenant-Colonel Crenshaw and Major Pendleton set an example of courage and gallantry to the command, and the company officers behaved admirably, doing their whole duty. It would be invidious, when all behaved so well, to distinguish between them. The gallantry of Lieutenant Washington was conspicuous. After the 6-pounder rifled piece had been disabled and it was discovered it had to be abandoned, he spiked it under a heavy fire.
It is not my province, perhaps, in this report to speak of officers outside of my own command, but I trust I shall be pardoned for bearing testimony to the coolness and judgment that characterized the conduct of Colonel Starke and Captain Corley during the whole of this day and afterwards on the march. These officers, but more particularly the latter, selected every position at which our troops made a stand, and we were never driven from one of them.
The loss to the enemy in this action must have been very great, as they had from their own account three regiments engaged, and the people in the neighborhood whom I have seen since report a heavy loss, which they state the enemy endeavored to conceal by transporting the dead and wounded back to Belington in covered wagons, permitting no one to approach them.
After receiving the order of General Garnett I marched my regiment four miles farther on to Parson’s Ford, a half mile beyond which I overtook the main body of our troops, who had been halted there by General Garnett, and which had been drawn up to receive the enemy.
The enemy did not advance to this ford, and after halting for some time our whole command moved forward, and marching all night on the road leading up the line of Horseshoe Bun, reached about daylight the Bed House, in Maryland, a point on the Northwestern turnpike near West Union.
At this last place a large force of the enemy under General Hill was concentrated. This body did not attack us, and we moved the same day into Yirginia as far as Greenland, in Hardy County. After seven days’ arduous march we reached this place.

oners, including two colonels and one lieutenant-colonel and two captains, and a member of the late Wheeling Convention, charged with treason. Major Duffield will personally give you details. This extraordinary war, in which the odds here are multiplied against us immensely by domestic enemies, requires absolutely an officer of high intelligence and responsibility to attend to prisoners. Rigid and harsh discipline of traitors in the Kanawha Yalley and adjacent counties would fill all the jails of the trans-Alleghany. Dismissing all we can, from policy as well as necessity, still the cases are very numerous, and would require the greater portion of my time, which is all now hard pressed upon by the enemy’s army. The traitors, their most efficient allies, spies, and soldiers* too, I have turned over to Major Duffield, who, since early after my arrival, has been examining them and applying the law to their cases. This he has been assiduously and laboriously doing, without any known mode of compensating him whatever. He is not of military education,* and I therefore could not promise him a staff or line appointment, which i might be detailed for this duty. Indeed, we require double the number * of officers we have for military duty proper, and I therefore gaVC Duffield a special acting appointment, which he most devotedly accepted I beg that you will authorize his appointment, fix his pay, and give him a proper rank on my staff. And there are two other descriptions of officers doing absolutely necessary service for whom there is no provision of pay—first, the engineers to locate the sites and plan the construction of works for defense, and the scientific explorers of mountains, gorges, rivers, passes, roads, &c. For the first I have employed Colonel Adler— a Hungarian—a man of consummate ability, science, and bravery, and for the last Prof. Thomas I. L. Snead, of William and Mary, and Lieut. J. B. Harvie, of the Provisional Army. The latter has commission in the Provisional Army and the former are treated as mere employes. They have two parties, Adler chief of both, one headed by Snead and the other by Harvie, performing very arduous and hazardous duties. I ask authority to allow them rank, pay, and forage for horses, with pay for a limited number of assistants, say six to each party. They have strengthened us far more than all the militia called out. Another unpaid corps is that of drill officers, without whom we could not make a stand or a good run from the enemy. The companies elect their officers, the drill officers train them, and then stand off to see them paid and win honors, I hope, whilst they are fed only and transported. Lastly, Major Duffield will tell you how much we need artillery. Do send us two rifled sixes, two 12-pounder howitzers, and allow us four small 4-pounders, which Major Duffield can select at Gosport navy-yard. The enemy knocked over one of our little iron guns, as you will see, in the late fight. We now have in all eight pieces—three brass and five superior iron guns. The enemy’s artillery (rifled cannon) outfired us, doing double our execution. Welch lost his life spiking our disabled gun, thinking, poor fellow, it was to fall into the hands of the enemy, and not surviving to joy in victory. Supply us more ammunition. The force I sent to attack the enemy returned yesterday evening, having chased him to his in-trenchments at Pocotaligo Mouth. He is now there, about three thousand three hundred stron g, awaiting re-enforcements. W e are threatened by that number in the valley, by about one thousand five hundred from Ripley to Sissonville, and by forces from Weston, Glenville, and Sutton, via Summersville. If I go toward Point Pleasant they rush on Coal, on Two-Mile, and the Elk and Gauley, and if I move out of the valley in any direction with anything like an effective force, they rush in and take the valley, and if I stand still they move from all sides and shut me

in. By all means, then, hasten on re-enforcements, arms, and ammunition.
To-day I send a flag of truce to obtain baggage of prisoners, at their request. Colonel Patton is doing as well as having done nobly well deserves. His arm I hope will not have to be amputated. We are throwing up breastworks and defenses at every pass, and mean never to be taken. Haste to prepare every means now shortens this report.

General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General.
Two-Mile,
Near Charleston, Fa., July 17, 1801.
General : Yours of the 11th instant was received last evening. General Garnett was mistaken in his anticipations about the enemy not invading the Kanawha Yalley and in his apprehension of my moving from Charleston direct upon Parkersburg. We are now on both sides [of] the Kanawha as high as the mouth of Coal River, front to front to the foe. He has about 1,600 approaching Coal, on the Guyandotte road j 3,000 coming up the Kanawha, with three steamers and several heavy pieces of artillery; 1,500, it is supposed, on each side, with his artillery on this side, and intending, I think, to concentrate all his forces first against Coal, approaching and threatening the post at Two-Mile and at Elk Mouth by the valley road, and at the same time by the road from Ripley, to which place, and ten miles below, they have advanced forces from Ravenswood, Murraysville, and Letart Falls, and it may be from Parkersburg. At Coal I have posted 900 efficient men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Patton. At Two-Mile and Elk I have posted in all, efficient and inefficient forces—say 800 efficient—about 1,600, and at Gauley Bridge, Summersville, and the Old Mill, on the Birch River, in all 1,000, with instructions to scout towards Suttonville, where the enemy are already in possession. I have anticipated General Garnett, you see, in this movement. I cannot re-enforce him, but he may me by the road leading from Huttonsville up Tygartfs Yalley road to Rackstone ; up that fork to where it crosses the range of Rich Mountain ; thence between Grassy Creek and Back Fork of Elk to where it crosses Elk 5 thence southwest to the head of Laurel Creek; thence to the head of Big Birch River, and down the same to the old mill near there, at the gorge of Birch Mountain, in my outpost from Summersville.
Now, if General Floyd can re-enforce Coal River and General Garnett can, in considerable number, re-enforce Birch and Elk, I will make a diversion that shall distract and defeat the enemy. My plan of defending the valley of the Kanawha is to hold its head and Coal and Elk and Two-Mile and the head of summer navigation with, say, 3,000, and to expand outposts to Barboursville on the one side, say 1,000, and to Ripley, California, the Forks of Elk, Arnoldsville, Sutton, Old Mill, and Summersville, say 3,000, requiring in all 7,000 men at least, if not 10,000, and you see we have but 3,500 in all, facing 6,000 at least on this and the other side of the Ohio. We have now 10 small pieces of artillery—6 iron, 3 brass, 1 made at Malden, private property. Our troops, raw, unequipped, not half armed and accoutered, untented, out of reach of clothing, unofficered, unorganized, yet they are prime personnel and fight well. I have tried them at Ripley, and yesterday my

aide, Colonel Clarkson, witli Brock’s and Becket’s troops of horse, about 120, thrashed about 200 of their infantry, charging them up the mount-tain side to its top, driving them in to their cannon, and killing eight known, with the loss of one horse only killed. All we want is your fostering attention. Give us arms and ammunition speedily and I will drive them into the Ohio River and across, and then tutu on Master McClellan, with the co-operation of Generals Garnett and Floyd.
I implore of you, sir, two things: First, re-enforce us with men, arms, and ammunition, and ask the President to allow me to increase the legion to 4,000 men. Please obtain for me these requests at once and I will be answerable for the rest.
Inclosed is an inventory of arms, &c., two days past. The militia here are literally in the way of action. They require help from us. Let me add two more ideas: We are treading on snakes while aiming at the enemy. The grass of the soil we are defending is full of the copperhead traitors 5 they invite the enemy, feed him, and he arms and drills them. We are surrounded with extraordinary difficulty of defense. A spy is on every hill top, at every cabin, and from Charleston to Point Pleasant they swarm. We will fight hard, retire slowly if we must, and make a last stand at Gauley. The men we have are true, but there are no deserters to us, and if we advance to meet the enemy at the mouth of Kanawha he comes down behind us from the north, and if we advance to attack him in the north he comes up behind us from the mouth of the valley. He aligns us from Parkersburg to Philippi on the north, and from Guyandotte through Gallipolis, Letart Falls, Flesher’s, Ravens-wood, and Murraysville to Parkersburg on the west. He has sent but few regiments, comparatively, as yet from Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio eastward; holds the whole Northwest in reserve; and has command of all the navigation and railroad steam-power. This all combined makes it wonderful that we make a stand at all. Besides, sir, remember this army here has grown by neglect at Richmond. It has been literally created by Colonel Tompkins, at first beginning with Patton’s company alone, since assisted by my legion, which I have created between this and Richmond. General Garnett’s army was sent out with him equipped. Let him comedo us; we need his help. In connection with this I have ordered Colonel Tompkins to account for pay-rolls. We have had no pay for State troops, Paymaster-General Hill informs me, for want of rolls, and Colonel Tompkins and Captain Carr will account for them.
Most respectfully,
HENRY A. WISE,
Brigadier- General.
P. S.—	Thursday, July 18,1861.
General : Since mine of yesterday I have the proud satisfaction to report to you a glorious repulse of the enemy, if not a decided victory.
Colonel Norton,* of the Federal Army, yesterday approached the mouth of Coal with about 1,200 men, expecting, as he says, to be supported by two regiments, making in all about 3,000. I had ordered Colonel Patton to retire gradually from Scarey Creek, below Coal, to Coal Mountain and the passes across Coal River, concentrating his forces finally at Bunker Hill, on Upton Creek, on the left bank of the Kanawha. But when Norton approached he returned to Scarey Creek and met him and his 1,200 there with about 800 men and two iroji sixes. Norton had one heavy piece of artillery, and the battle aqross the creek ravine commenced

[Chap. IX.
about 4 p. m. It was soon shown the enemy had better guns, both ordnance and small-arms, but our men stood steadily and firmly fighting for about half an hour, when a panic seized three-fourths of them; portions of each company fled. At this moment Colonel Patton dashed on horseback to rally his men, when his horse for a short distance became unruly and caused them to mistake his movement 5 but he rallied a portion of them, returned instantly to action, and in fifteen minutes received a bullet in his left shoulder, which took him off the field. Jenkins, Bailey, Swan, and Sweeney stood their ground, as also Col. F. Anderson, with two companies posted so far on the left that they up to this time had not come into action. The most of the men who had fled again rallied, and were fighting bravely when the enemy’s superior piece of artillery disabled one of our sixes, killing Lieutenant Welch and mortally wounding a private, when First-Lieutenant Quarrier retired with the other piece of artillery and never returned into action, causing a second panic, when Captain Jenkins bravely took the command for the moment until Colonel Anderson came up from the left and rallied a forlorn hope, in which he and Bailey, Swan and Sweeney, bore the whole brunt of the enemy for some time, until they were re-enforced by Captain Coons from the post on Coal Mountain and by the rerally of those who had fled. This won the day, drove back the whole force of the enemy, captured Colonels Norton, Woodruff,* and Be Yilliers,f Lieutenant-Colonel Neff, Captains Austin and Ward, and some 10 or 20 privates, and killing about 30. Our loss was 1 killed and 2 wounded, but 1 mortally.
The enemy crossed the river and encamped below the mouth of Scarey.
I immediately determined to attack him there, and last night moved upon him with three troops of cavalry and 650 infantry and artillery, under Colonel McCausland, by two roads. The enemy retreated, and I have just (at 3 p. m.) learned that our force of 800 followed him to near the mouth of the Pocotaligo. McCausland having the Blues with him, I ordered him to put the steel of his bayonet into their teeth. They are found intrenched at the Pocotaligo with heavy pieces. They have there at least three regiments, and we cannot attack them for want of some 12-pounder howitzers. I beg you for four such pieces. Give them to us, and we will repay the service fourfold.
We get some re-enforcements by Colonel Bavis to-day, perhaps 300. I again implore you to let me increase the legion.
To-day one of Brock’s cavalry was accidentally wounded by a picket-guard, owing to whisky, after I had ordered all to be destroyed. Ohio has sent thousands of gallons over the border, doubtless to demoralize the camp. Excepting measles, the command is doing well.

Lieutenant von Heringen took with him a horse belonging to Adjutant Schaffner, and a saddle belonging to Dr. Schenk, now visiting the camp. The horse is reported killed and the saddle taken by the enemy. Captain Brestel reports that on Friday morning last (the 12th instant) one corporal and sixteen privates of his company, E—[an evident omission here occurs in the original]. The men belonging to my company (except four, who are missing) have returned, and report that they were surprised by the enemy and routed.

This report shows that these men were lost from disobedience to orders. The place of surprise was at least nine miles from camp at Newport News, while the wood for which the party was sent was within a short distance. If the officers in command had returned, they would have been subject to punishment for disobedience to orders. As it is, their insubordination has brought with it their own punishment. The regret is that innocent men should suffer for their wrong. Colonel Bendix will

Report of Lieut. Col. E. Kapff. Seventh New YorJc Infantry.
Camp Butler, July 13,1861.
The undersigned respectfully reports that about 3.30 o’clock yesterday afternoon he, according to orders from the commander of the post, left the camp at the head of a patrol, consisting of all the available men of Companies A, B, D, F, G-, H, and K, numbering about 200. He sent Companies A and F, under the chief command of Captain Gaebel, as a vanguard, to proceed up the road to the spot where, according to the statement of those returned, the engagement had taken place, and followed with the main body. Having arrived at the farm of Mr. William Lee, he halted there, and dispatched Company D up the road as a connecting link between the vanguard and the main body, and also several smaller troops to search the neighboring woods, fields, and farms. These smaller parties, on their return, reported that they had seen nothing of the enemy, but met some of our own men, whom they brought with them, and from whom further information was obtained in regard to the engagement.
Meanwhile Captain Gaebel advanced up the road, having sent out on either flank smaller parties to search the neighboring woods, fields, farms, &c., without meeting with any sign of the enemy until he came to the spot where a side road branches off from the main road to the right in an angle of about 75°, and from which there is a connection, by a lumber road, with the farm of Mr. Baker Lee, where he found unmistakable traces of a large body of cavalry, which had come down this side road, as it appeared, in full trot, and turned sharp around the corner of the main road, obliterating on it the tracks of the horse-cart which Lieutenant Heringen had taken with him, and which thus far had been visible. Meanwhile several stragglers had been picked up by Captain Gaebel’s men, who confirmed all the former information and his own conclusions, arrived at by the hoof-prints just referred to, as to the place where the engagement had taken place, and he therefore proceeded up the road with all dispatch possible, without, however, neglecting to search carefully the woods, &c., on either side of the road.
Having arrived at the spot pointed out by the stragglers, which is about a hundred yards this side of the opening on which Mr. Nelson Smith’s dwelling-house is situated, he found in the vicinity of a fallen tree, near which Lieutenant Mosebach was said to have been wounded, larger and smaller pools of blood, and other signs of an engagement having taken place there, which extended up the road to the fields and the dwelling-house of Mr. Smith. Captain Gaebel then sent several small pickets into the woods to search th^m carefully, and commanded Lieutenant Glaubensklee, with about twenty-four men, to Mr. Smith’s farm, leaving the rest of the troops, under the command of Lieutenants Brausen and Hohenhausen, on the main road, after the latter had posted three men about three hundred yards farther up the road, as an outpost against the enemy, the neighing of whose horses was distinctly heard by these men in very close vicinity.

Lad reached Mr. Nelson Smith’s dwelling-house Captain Gaebel had overtaken him, and both now proceeded to examine both the buildings and their inmates. They were kindly received by Mr. Smith and his family, who gave all information they asked for. In the buildings they found nothing suspicious, but on the road, as well as in the field, blood and so on. They then returned to the main road, joined Lieutenant Brausen and his men, and Captain Gaebel now gave a private signal, known only to himself and his men, to gather. The pickets who had searched the woods brought with them a stirrup and a pistol ramrod which they had found in the woods, but reported that they had not been able to discover any dead or wounded.
Captain Gaebel now proceeded on his way home, it being then nearly dark, joined the main body at Mr. William Lee’s farm, and the whole command then returned to the camp, where they arrived about 11 o’clock. From both the local inspection and the information received from those of our own men who have been saved, as well as from Mr. N. Smith and others, it seems that Lieutenant Heringen and the patrol under his command were suddenly attacked by a large body of cavalry from behind, whilst they were at a halt and resting bn the spot above mentioned ; that the attack was so sudden as to exclude the possibility of a systematic resistance, as apart of the men were scattered after the first volleys had been fired by the enemy, who probably were armed entirely or in part with revolving rifles ; that several of our men were wounded, and two probably killed, but that the enemy also must have lost a number of their men. At least eight or ten horses were seen without riders when they proceeded to their camp, which cannot be very far from the place of the engagement, as a loud cheering was distinctly heard at Mr. Smith’s farm soon after the troop had passed there. At the present moment (10.30 a. m.) there are still missing Lieutenants Heringen and Mosebach and twelve privates, in consideration of which the undersigned would respectfully recommend that a flag of truce be sent to the enemy’s encampment, for the purpose of obtaining, if possible, further information, and begs to state that Lieutenant Brausen and Mr. E. Bob-inson, jr., of New York, have volunteered to go thither as such.

This party that* was attacked by the enemy went out without imparting to me any knowledge of their designs. The result was in perfect accordance with the spirit of insubordination which they have manifested. The request for a flag of truce is respectfully referred, without my approval, to the major-general commanding the department.

Headquarters, Williamsburg, Fa., July 13,1831.
Sir : I have the pleasure of sending a report from Major Hood, the efficient cdmmander of the cavalry of my department, of a brilliant little affair with the enemy on the spot where the gallant Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux fell. Too much praise cannot be bestowed on Major Hood and the cavalry generally for their untiring industry in efforts to meet the enemy, and for the energy with which they have discharged their harassing and unusually laborious duties. I have directed the prisoners to be sent to Richmond, to headquarters.

Report of Maj. John B. Hood, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters Cavalry Camp,
Near Bethel, Va., July 12,1801.
Sir : I have the honor to inform you that I left my camp on yesterday afternoon, at 7 o’clock, with a small force of cavalry, consisting of detachments from Capts. Thos. F. Goode’s, J. C. Phillips’, W. H. Easley’s, R. Douthatt’s, W. Adams’, and W. Johnson’s companies, commanded, respectively, by Captains Goode, Phillips, and Easley, and Lieuts. S. Wilcox, E. O. Fitzgerald, and B. J. Allen, and proceeded to within three miles of Newport News, and went into camp.
About 10 o’clock this morning one of my vedettes reported to me that the enemy were advancing on the Warwick road, and were from seventy-five to one hundred strong. I immediately marched up the road in their rear, and discovered that they were in ambush, ready to receive me, about four miles from Newport News. At that time they opened fire upon my advance, when I ordered Captain Goode’s detachment to dismount, leaving one-fourth of his men with his horses. Captain Phillips, being already on foot, I dismounted myself, and, with the

Sharp’s carbines in the hands of Captain Goode’s men, and a few shotguns in those of Captain Phillips’, together with Colonel Sandidge, of Louisiana, and Mr. Christian, of Alabama, in all not exceeding thirty men, threw a portion as skirmishers in the thick bushes near the road, and drove them from their ambuscade, which occupied some three-fourths of an hour, a brisk lire being kept up all the time.
The enemy having been driven from cover in a very rapid and disorderly flight in the direction of Captain Smith’s house, on the banks of James River, I then ordered a charge, and the detachments of Captain Easley, Lieutenants Wilcox, Fitzgerald, and Allen, together with Mr. Sandidge, jr., and Mr. Terrett, of Louisiana, dashed gallantly down upon them, taking the flying enemy prisoners. Lieutenant Wilcox had his horse shot under him.
During the engagement, which lasted about one hour and a quarter, First Lieut. Oscar V. Heringen, Second Lieut. Frederick Mosebach, and ten privates of the Seventh New York Regiment Qf Volunteers (one of the privates being wounded), surrendered themselves up as prisoners of war, the first lieutenant handing his sword to Captain Phillips. The horse and equipments of the commanding officer were captured by Private Joseph Phillips, of the Old Dominion Dragoons, who was among the first in the charge. A fine mule and cart were also taken. The muskets taken, fourteen in number, are here and ready for use. I had two of the enemy, who were lying near the road, buried, and then returned to my camp. Owing to the dense thicket in which I had the engagement, I am not able to state how strong the enemy were, nor can I tell how many were killed and wounded. I am happy to state, however, that my loss was only one horse.
I cannot mention in too high terms the coolness and true courage of one and all engaged on this occasion.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

﻿Chap. IX.] RECONNAISSANCES FROM ALEXANDRIA, YA.	299
JULY 14, 1861.—Reconnaissances from Alexandria, Va.
Report of Col. Thomas A. Davies, Sixteenth New YorJc Infantry.
Hdqrs. Second Brigade, Fifth Division,
Alexandria, Fa., 14,1861.
Sir: In pursuance of your verbal order of yesterday, I made a reconnaissance on the Fairfax road, seven miles out, and on the Richmond road about ten miles, and on the Mount Yernon road as far as Mount Vernon. The pickets on the Fairfax road captured a newly-painted ambulance, containing a set of harness and two bags of buckwheat. On the curtain on the inside was distinctly written in pencil, “John Hughes, Fairfax.”
The picket on the Richmond road saw three horsemeu, who, by a dexterous turn, evaded a shot from the picket. The picket on the Mount Yernon road, in its diligence, discovered on the premises of one John A. Washington, formerly a resident and still an occupant of a large estate near Mount Yernon, what was supposed to amount to eight thousand pounds of bacon and seventy-five barrels of fish. The officer in charge of the picket was informed that these provisions were to be sent for to-night (July 14) by some person who was to convey them and the negroes on the plantation to the Southern Army. On this representation he took into possession three horses, and the negroes harnessed up one four-mule team to a wagon and one two-mule team to a wagon, and got in to the number of ten, of their own accord, and drove to my camp. Deeming the transaction of sufficient consequence to merit my individual attention, and supposing that I might capture the force sent to convey these provisions away, I immediately ordered out three companies of the Sixteenth Regiment, and, taking the two teams referred to and two others, proceeded to capture the provisions and bring them to camp. On arriving at the plantation, I proceeded to make inquiry and ascertain if such an amount of provisions was really upon the place. I could not find anything like the quantity of bacon—not more than sufficient, in my judgment, to carry on the operations of the plantation, whatever might have been there in the morning; but I found twenty-five barrels more fish (one hundred in all) than were at first represented. On looking the whole matter over, whatever may be my individual views as to the confiscation of the property of rebels, who are using it and its income to overthrow the Government, I consider that the case was not sufficiently plain to authorize me to retain the mule-teams, or seize upon the fish and bacon, although their owner is well known to be an officer high in rank in the rebel army and now in active command.
As to the negroes, there being no law or orders directing me either to cause them to remain at home or to prevent them from volunteering to do team duty in my brigade, I shall allow them to remain until otherwise directed. I, however, have placed a guard over the provisions, the mules, and the wagons on the estate, and shall await your orders for their disposition.

The troops will march to the front this afternoon in the following order:
1.	The brigades of the First Division (Tyler’s) will leave their camps in light marching order, and go as far as Vienna, the Fourth Brigade (Richardson’s) taking the road across the Chain Bridge, and by way of Langley’s, Louisville, and Old Court-House; the others by the Georgetown turnpike and Leesburg Stone roads. The order of march of the several brigades to be arranged by the division commander.
2.	The Second Division (Hunter’s) will leave their camps in light marching order, and go on the Columbia turnpike as far as the Little River turnpike, but not to cross it, the Second Brigade (Burnside’s) leading.
3.	The Third Division (Heintzelman’s) will leave their camps in light marching order, and go on the old Fairfax Court-House road, south of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, as far as the Accotink, or the Pohick, if he finds it convenient; the brigades to march in the order the division commander may direct.

[Chap. IX.
4.	The Fifth Division (Miles’) will proceed in light marching order, by the Little Biver turnpike as far as Annandale, or to the point where the road leads to the left to go into the old Braddock road (so called), which runs between the Little Biver turnpike and the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad.
5.	The brigades of the several divisions will be put in march in time to reach their respective destinations by dark.
6.	The reserve will be held in readiness to march at the shortest notice, and will, on and after the 17th instant, keep constantly a supply of cooked rations on hand for two days.
7.	Brigadier-General Bunyon, commanding the reserve, will have command of all the troops not on the march to the front, including those in the fortifications and camps. He will, to-morrow, send two regiments, up the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad to aid the railroad managers in rebuilding it in the shortest possible time, the commanding officers to* conform to the plans of the principal managers.
8.	Brigadier-General Bunyon will guard the Loudoun and Hampshire Bailroad as far as the present camps of the Ohio Volunteers, and the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad as far as it is or may be repaired.
9.	The regiment now in Fort Corcoran, the Twenty-eighth New York;, the Twenty-fifth New York, at Boach’s; the Twenty-first New York, at Fort Bunyon, and the Seventeenth New York, at Fort Ellsworth, will not be removed from their present stations except in an emergency,
II.	On the morning of the 17th the troops will resume their march after daylight in time to reach Fairfax Court-House (the Third Division, Sangster’s) by 8 o’clock a. m.
1.	Brigadier-General Tyler will direct his march so as to intercept the enemy’s communication between Fairfax Court-House and Centreville, moving to the right or the left of Germantown, as he may find most practicable. On reaching the Centreville turnpike he will direct the march of his leading brigade either upon Centreville or Fairfax Court-House, as the indication of the enemy may require. The Second Brigade will move on the road in the direction not taken by the First. The rear brigades will be disposed of by the division commander as circumstances may require. Should he deem it best, a brigade may be sent on Fairfax Court-House direct from Flint Hill.
2.	The Second Division (Hunter’s) will (after the road shall be cleared of the Fifth Division) move on the direct road to Fairfax Court-House* by the Little Biver turnpike.
3.	The Fifth Division (Miles’) will turn off from the Little Biver turnpike and gain the old Braddock road, which it will follow to its intersection with the road from Fairfax Court-House to Fairfax Station, where-it will turn to the right and move on the Court-House.
4.	The Third Division (Heintzelman’s) will move by the best and shortest of the roads to the south of the railroad till he reaches the railroad at Sangster’s. He will, according to the indications he may find, turn his Second and Third Brigades to the right, to go to Fairfax Station or to the front to support the First Brigade. He may find it necessary to guard the road coming up from Wolf Bun Shoals and the one leading to Yates’ Ford.
III.	The enemy is represented to be in force at Centreville, Germantown, Fairfax Court-House, and Fairfax Station, and at intermediate places, and on the road towards Wolf Bun Shoals. He has been obstructing, as far as possible, the roads leading to Fairfax Court-House, and is believed on several of these to have thrown up breastworks and planted cannon. It is therefore probable the movements above ordered.

may lead to an engagement, and everything must be done with a view to this result.
The three following things will not be pardonable in any commander: 1st. To come upon a battery or breastwork without a knowledge of its position. 2d. To be surprised. 3d. To fall back. Advance guards, with vedettes well in front and flankers and vigilance, will guard against the first and second.
The columns are so strong and well provided that, though they may be for a time checked, they should not be overthrowm. Each is provided with intrenching tools and axes, and if the country affords facilities for obstructing our march, it also gives equal facilities for sustaining ourselves in any position we obtain. A brigade should sustain itself as long as possible before asking for help from another. It can hardly be necessary to attack a battery in front; in most cases it may be turned. Commanders are enjoined to so conduct their march as to keep their men well closed up. This is of great importance. No man will be allowed to get into an ambulance or baggage wagon without written authority from the regimental surgeon or his superior. Guards will be placed over the ambulances and wagons to enforce this order.
Troops will march without their tents, and wagons will only be taken with them for ammunition, the medical department, and for intrenching tools. A small baggage train for each brigade, to take the camp-kettles, mess-pans, and mess kits, and the smallest allowance of personal baggage of the officers and men, will follow the divisions the day after they inarch. This train will consist of from twelve to fifteen wragons.
A subsistence train will follow at a day’s interval the First Division from Fort Corcoran and Vienna. A second subsistence train will follow the Second Division at a day’s interval. A wagon for forage will be taken with each battery and squadron. A herd of beef cattle will be sent with each subsistence train. There is on many of our regiments nothing to distinguish them from those of the enemy, and great care must be taken to avoid firing into each mother.
The national color must be kept continually displayed, and, if possible, small national colors should be placed on the cannon of the batteries.
Division commanders will see fhat the axmen and engineers at the head of the columns (and men of the ordnance guard) are well provided and in condition to worl^ efficiently. When there are no ax-slings, the axes will be carried and the muskets will be slung.
Department headquarters will be with the Second Division, on the Little River turnpike. Division commanders will communicate with them by every opportunity.

Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the Army, Washington:
We have occupied Fairfax Court-House, and driven the enemy towards Centreville and Manassas. We have an officer and three men slightly wounded. The enemy’s flight was so precipitate that he left in our hands a quantity of flour, fresh beef, intrenching tools, hospital furniture, and baggage. I endeavored to pursue beyond Centreville, but the men were too much exhausted to do so.

Fairfax Court-House, July 18, 1861.
Sir : The First Division, under General Tyler, is between Germantown and Centreville. The Second (Hunter’s) is at this place, just about to move forward to Centreville. The Fifth (Miles’) is at the crossing of the old Braddock road with the road from this to Fairfax Station, and is ordered forward to Centreville by the old Braddock road; Barry’s battery has joined it. One of Heintzelman’s brigades (Willcox’s) is at Fairfax Station. Heintzelman and his other brigade are below the station, but he has not reported to me since we have been here, and I have not been able to communicate with him. I think they are at Sangster’s Station. The four men wounded yesterday belong to Miles’ Division, who had some slight skirmishes in reaching his position. Each column encountered about the same obstructions—trees felled across the road— but the axmen cleared them out in a few moments.
There were extra-sized breastworks thrown up at this place, and some of them with embrasures revetted with sand bags. Extensive breastworks were also thrown up at the Fairfax Railroad Station and the road leading to Sangster’s.
A great deal of work had been done by them, and the number and size of their camps show they have been here in great force. Their retreat, therefore, must have a damaging effect upon them. They left in such haste that they did not draw in their pickets, who came into one of our camps, thinking, as it occupied the same place, it was their own. The Obstructions to the railroad in the vicinity of the station, including the deep cut filled in with earth and trees, can be cleared out in a few hours. The telegraph poles are up, with the wires on them. I look to having communication by rail and telegraph in a very short time. Much Hour, some arms, forage, tents, camp equipage were abandoned by them. I am distressed to have to report excesses by our troops. The excitement of the men found vent in burning and pillaging, which, however soon checked, distressed us all greatly. I go on to Centreville in a few moments.

Brigadier-General Tyler,
Commanding First Division:
There seems to be a misunderstanding on your part of the order issued for a brigade of your division to be posted in observation on the road leading to the place where your command was engaged yesterday (July 18). It was intended that the movement should have been made long before this.
The train of subsistence came up long ago. I have given no order or instruction of a change in this matter.
I thought that the brigade was posted as desired until just now, when Major Brown, who is just returned from your headquarters, informs me that no action under these orders has been taken.

[IRVIN MCDOWELL.]
Hdqrs. Department Northeastern Virginia,
Centreville, Fa., July 19, 1861.
Colonel: Learning yesterday there were but few troops of the enemy in this place, I directed Brigadier-General Tyler to take it, and keep up the impression we were to advance in this direction. I then went to Colonel Heintzelman’s division, to make arrangements to turn the enemy’s right and intercept his communications with the South. I found on examining the country that the roads were too narrow and crooked for so large a body to move over, and the distance around too great to admit of it with any safety. We would become entangled, and our carriages would block up the way. I was therefore forced to abandon the plan of turning the enemy’s right, and to adopt my present one of going around his left, where the country is more open and the roads are broad and good. I gave orders, therefore, for the forces to move forward on the Warrenton turnpike so soon as the supply trains came up and the men could get and prepare their rations.
Whilst with Colonel Heintzelman’s division 1 learned that the advance had become engaged with the enemy. I therefore directed the movement, which in the first instance was to take place after the arrival and distribution of subsistence, to take place at once. By the time I got over from Colonel Heintzelman’s column the firing on both sides had ceased. I have directed General Tyler to make a report of the affair, which I will forward when it comes to hand. I learn from the medical director that there were three killed, twenty-one slightly and eight severely wounded 5 total, thirty-two. Of the severely wounded three have since died.
A negro, belonging, he says, to Colonel Fontaine, of Virginia, came in last night from the other side, saying his master had been killed at the first cannonading. He reports great havoc among the enemy, but his imagination is evidently too active to trust to his statements. All the divisions are now here or in the immediate vicinity. I have ordered General Bunyon to station the larger part of the reserve on the railroad to guard it.

By command of General McDowell:
JAMES B. FRY, Assistant Adjutant- General.
Hdqrs. Department Northeastern Virginia,
Gentreville, July 20,1861.
Colonel : Yesterday was occupied mainly by the engineers in re-connoitering the defenses of the enemy on Bull Run, at and above the crossing of the Warrenton turnpike. Bull Run, though not a wide stream, is only to be crossed at certain places, owing to its precipitous, rocky banks. The Warrenton road crosses it over a stone bridge, which is mined and defended by a battery placed behind an unusually heavy abatis, whilst the bank on our side is clear. The ford above is also protected.
The object of the reconnaissance was to find a point which might be bridged or forded, so as to turn these places where the enemy are prepared for us. Thus far these efforts, five of them, have not been successful, the enemy being in such force on this side of the run as to make it impossible to ascertain. I wished yesterday to make the reconnaissance in force, but deferred to the better judgment of others—to try and get it by observation and stealth. To-day I propose to drive in the enemy and get the information required. If it were needed, the experience of the 18th instant shows we cannot, with this description of force, attempt to carry batteries such as these now before us.
I shall go forward early to-day and force the enemy beyond Bull Run, so as to examine it more closely than we have been able to do. I am told they obtain their supply of water from this stream. If so, and we get possession of the right bank, we shall force them to leave the now strong position of Manassas.
I am somewhat embarrassed by the inability of the troops to take care enough of their rations to make them last the time they should, and by the expiration of the term of service of many of them. The Fourth Pennsylvania goes out to-day, and others succeed rapidly. I have made a request to the regiment to remain a few days longer, but do not hope for much success. In a few days I shall lose many thousands of the best of this force. Will it suit the views of the General and the Government that they shall be replaced by long-service regiments? The numbers may be replaced, but it will not be an equal force.
I learn from a person who represents himself as having just come from General Patterson that he has fallen back.
There are rumors that Johnston has joined Beauregard. Yesterday some volunteers burned a house ou Centreville Hill, which must have been seen by all the troops at Manassas; but the most thorough investigations did not lead to any discovery of the authors of this additional outrage.
I remain, colonel, most respectfully, vour obedient servant,

Reports of Col. Orlando B. Willcox, First Michigan Infantry, of sJcirmish at Fairfax Court-House.
Headquarters Second Brigade, Third Division,
Fairfax Station, July 17, 1861.
Sir : After leaving the Old Fairfax road this noon with my brigade, we proceeded with an advance guard in skirmishing order and pioneers with axes, and felt our way until the skirmishers came upon this point. The enemy fled precipitately without firing a shot, but we succeeded in capturing a sergeant, a corporal, and nine men, belonging to the First Alabama Kifle Begiment. They occupied two camps, and are reported to have been two regiments, of about 1,000 men each, from Alabama and Louisiana. We found every evidence of hasty departure—provisions; fires burning; a box of medical instruments, partly consumed; a secession flag, &c., in their camps. Our most extended skirmishers towards the left saw also some cavalry scattering and flying.
The enemy must have been early apprised of our coming, but whether their main body had left before we commenced cutting the road I cannot tell. The earthworks were, as supposed, near the railroad. There was a masked earthwork in the woods farther about a mile west of the station, but no guns in any of them. I await the coloneks further orders at this point, having promptly returned after following the Fairfax road two and a half miles and communicating with Colonel Miles.
Very respectfully,
O. B. WILLCOX,
Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade.

Sir: I have just received a dispatch from Colonel Heintzelman. He is still at Sangster’s, waiting orders. Not knowing whether he has succeeded in communicating with you otherwise, I deem it best to report the fact myself.
I can get guides to Wolf Run Shoals and Bacon Race Church. I deem it necessary to have both telegraphic and railway communication with Alexandria. Have sent word to this effect to General Runyon, and hope it is approved by General McDowell, but would respectfully suggest that orders be issued.
If we could have struck this point and Sangster’s about three hours earlier we might have taken about three thousand prisoners.
The bridges beyond have been burnt by the enemy.

Report of Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler, Connecticut Militia, of action at Blackburns Ford.
Hdqrs. First Div. Dep’t Northeastern Virginia,
Washington City, July 27, 1861.
Sir : On the 18th instant you ordered me to take my division, with the two 20-pounder rifled guns, and move against Centreville, to carry that position. My division moved from its encampment at 7 a. m. At 9 a. m. Richardson's brigade reached Centreville, and found that the enemy had retreated the night before—one division on the Warrenton turnpike in the direction of Gainesville, and the other, and by far the largest division, towards Blackburn’s Ford, on Bull Run. Finding that Richardson’s brigade had turned towards the latter point and halted, for the convenience of obtaining water, I took a squadron of cavalry and two light companies from Richardson’s brigade, with Colonel Richardson, to make a reconnaissance, and in feeling our way carefully we soon found ourselves overlooking the strong position of the enemy, situated at Blackburn’s Ford, on Bull Run. A moment’s observation discovered a battery on the opposite bank, but no great body of troops, although the usual pickets and small detachments showed themselves on the left of the position.

## p. 311 (#327) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.]
THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.
311
Suspecting from the natural strength which I saw the position to possess that the enemy must be in force, and desiring to ascertain the extent of that force and the position of his batteries, I ordered up the two rifled guns, Ayres7 battery, and Richardson’s entire brigade, and subsequently Sherman’s brigade in reserve, to be ready for any contingency. As soon as the rifled guns came up I ordered them into battery on the crest of the hill, nearly a mile from a single battery which we could see placed on the opposite side of the run. Ten or a dozen shots were fired, one of them seeming to take effect on a large body of cavalry, who evidently thought themselves out of range.
The battery we had discovered on our arrival fired six shots and discontinued fire. Finding that our battery did not provoke the enemy to discover his force and his batteries, I ordered Colonel Richardson to advance his brigade and to throw out skirmishers to scour the thick woods with which the whole bottom of Bull Run was covered. This order was skillfully executed, and the skirmishers came out of the wood into the road and close to the ford without provoking any considerable fire from the enemy.
Desiring to make a further attempt to effect the object of the movement, and discovering an opening low down on the bottom of the stream where a couple of howitzers could be put into battery, I ordered Captain Ayres to detach a section, post it himself on the ground I pointed out to him, and sent a squadron of cavalry to support this movement.
The moment Captain Ayres opened his fire the enemy replied with volleys, which showed that the whole bottom was filled with troops, and that he had batteries established in different positions to sweep all the approaches by the road leading to Blackburn’s Ford. Captain Ayres maintained himself most gallantly, and after firing away all his canister shot and some spherical case with terrible effect, as we afterwards learned, withdrew his pieces safely and rejoined his battery. This attack on Captain Ayres accomplished the object I desired, as it showed that the enemy was in force and disclosed the position of his batteries, and had I been at hand the movement would have ended here; but Colonel Richardson having previously given an order for the Twelfth New York to deploy into line and advance into the woods, in an attempt to execute this order the regiment broke, with the exception of two companies, A and I, who stood their ground gallantly, and was only rallied in the woods soma mile and a half in the rear. The fire which the regiment encountered was severe, but no excuse for the disorganization it produced.
Having satisfied myself that the enemy was in force, and also as to the position of his batteries, I ordered Colonel Richardson to withdraw his brigade, which was skillfully though unwillingly accomplished, as he requested permission with the First Massachusetts and Second and Third Michigan Regiments to charge the enemy and drive him out. It is but justice to these regiments to say that they stood firm, maneuvered well, and 1 have no doubt would have backed up manfully the proposition of their gallant commander. After the infantry had been withdrawn, I directed Captain Ayres and Lieutenant Benjamin, who commanded the two 20-pounders, to open their fire both on the battery which enfiladed the road leading to the ford and on the battery which we had discovered in the bottom of Bull Run, which we knew to be surrounded by a large body of men. This fire was continued from 3.15 until 4 o’clock, firing 415 shots. The fire was answered from the enemy’s batteries, gun for gun, but was discontinued the moment we ceased firing.
The concentrated position of the enemy, and the fact that the eleva-

tion of our battery and the range were both favorable, induce the belief that the enemy suffered severely from our tire, and this belief is confirmed by the fact that the ensuing day, until 12 m., ambulances were seen coming and going from and to Manassas, two miles distant.
In closing this report, it gives me great pleasure to call to your attention the gallant conduct of Colonel Richardson; Cax>tain Brethschn eider, who commanded the skirmishers; Captain Ayres; Lieutenant Lorain, who, I regret to say, was wounded; Lieutenants Dresser, Lyford, and Fuller, attached to Ayres’ battery, and Lieutenants Benjamin and Babbitt, in charge of the two 20-pounder rifled guns, all of whom displayed great coolness, energy, and skill in the discharge of their official duties.

General : I have the honor to report that I left the camp at Germantown at an early hour yesterday morning, my brigade consisting of the Second and Third Michigan Regiments, the First Massachusetts Regiment, and Twelfth New York. A battalion of light infantry, consisting of forty men from each regiment, one hundred and sixty in all, and commanded by Capt. Robert Brethschneider, of the Second Regiment of Michigan Infantry, moved in front of the brigade some five hundred yards in advance, and threw pickets still farther in advance on the road. A section of 20-pounder rifled guns, commanded by Lieutenant Benjamin, of the Second Artillery, moved in rear of the light battalion. The march of the column was slow, so as to prevent surprise.

THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.
313
No enemy appeared at Centreville, three miles from camp, he having abandoned his intrenchments the night before.
On advancing one mile in front of Centreville, I'came to a halt near some springs to procure water for the brigade, and General Tyler and myself left with a squadron of cavalry and two companies of infantry, for the purpose of making a reconnaissance to the front, which, on arriving one mile in front of Blackburn’s Ford, proved that the enemy had a battery in rear of the run, so as to enfilade the road. He had also strong pickets of infantry and skirmishing parties occupying the woods and houses in front of his position. The battalion of light infantry was now ordered to deploy live hundred yards in front of the eminence upon which this camp is situated, and a position at once taken by the rilled guns, which now opened their lire. This fire was not answered by the enemy until several rounds had been fired, and I pushed forward the skirmishers to the edge of the woods, they driving in those of the enemy in fine style, and then brought up the First Massachusetts Begiment to their support, the skirmishers still advancing into the woods.
Captain Brackett’s squadron of the Second Cavalry, and two 12-pounder howitzers, commanded by Captain Ayres, Fifth 17. S. Artillery, now moved up into an opening in the woods in support. The enemy also opened another battery, more to our left, so as to cross-fire with the other upon the road. I ordered up at this time the Twelfth New York Begiment, Colonel Walrath, to the left of our battery, and it being formed in line of battle, I directed it to make a charge upon their position, the skirmishers still pushing forward and drawing the enemy’s fire, but keeping themselves well covered. I now left the position of the Twelfth New York Begiment, to place upon the right of the battery the Massachusetts and Second and Third Michigan Begiments, when a very heavy fire of musketry and artillery was opened by the enemy along his whole line. On moving towards our left, I found that the Twelfth New York Begiment had fallen back out of the woods in disorder, only parts of two companies, some sixty men in all, remaining in line, and retreating. The howitzers and also the cavalry had been withdrawn. Our left was thus exposed, although the skirmishers still held the ground in the woods, and the three remaining regiments on the right remained firm and determined.
I now reported to General Tyler that the main body of the New York regiment had fallen back in confusion, and I proposed to make a charge with the three remaining regiments for the purpose of carrying the enemy’s position. The general replied that the enemy were in large force and strongly fortified, and a further attack was unnecessary ; that it was merely a reconnaissance which he had made; that he had found where the strength of the enemy lay, and ordered me to fall back in good order to our batteries on the hill, which we did, the enemy closing his fire before we left the ground, and not venturing to make an effort to follow us.
Our batteries on the hill now opened fire, sustained by the Second Michigan Begiment on the right, in close column by division, the other two regiments forming line of battle on the left. The New York regiment alter some time formed under cover of the woods in rear. In this affair our skirmishers advanced so close to the enemy’s works and batteries that two mounted officers were killed inside the breastworks, and one of our men was shot through the shoulder with a revolver by one of the enemy’s officers, and one of their cannoneers was bayoneted by one of our men while the former was engaged in loading his gun. Our

skirmishers also, in falling back, had several of their wounded bayoneted, by order of one of the enemy’s officers.
The enemy’s intrenehments and batteries appeared to be in rear of a creek called Bull Bun. The batteries on the extreme right of their line were on high ground, and fired over the heads of their infantry in front. At night we fell back to Centreville for water and rations, and this morning have again occupied our ground upon the hill in front of the enemy, they being in large force, and having their pickets and skirmishers in the woods and in front of them, as yesterday. I have the honor also to inclose a statement of our loss incident to this affair.

Reports of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, commanding U. S. forces.
Centreville, July 21,1861—5.45 p. m.
We passed Bull Bun. Engaged the enemy, who, it seems, had just been re-enforced by General Johnston. We drove them for several hours, and finally routed them.
They rallied and repulsed us, but only to give us again the victory, which seemed complete. But our men, exhausted with fatigue and thirst and confused by firing into each other, were attacked by the enemy’s reserves, and driven from the position we had gained, overlooking Manassas. After this the men could not be rallied, but slowly left the field. In the mean time the enemy outflanked Bichardson at Blackburn’s Ford, and we have now to hold Centreville till our men can get behind it. Miles7 division is holding the town. It is reported Colonel Cameron is killed, Hunter and Heintzelman wounded, neither dangerously.

The men having thrown away their haversacks in the battle and left them behind, they are without food; have eaten nothing since breakfast. We are without artillery ammunition. The larger part of the men are a confused mob, entirely demoralized. It was the opinion of all the commanders that no stand could be m ade this side of the Potomac. We will, however, make the attempt at Fairfax Court-House. From a prisoner we learn that 20,000 from Johnston joined last night, and they march on us to-night.

Fairfax Court-House, [July] 22, 1861.
Many of the volunteers did not wait for authority to proceed to the Potomac, but left on their own decision. They are now pouring through this place in a state of utter disorganization. They could not be prepared for action by to-morrow morning even were they willing. Hearn from prisoners that we are to be pressed here to-night and to-morrow morning, as the enemy’s force is very large and they are elated. I think we heard cannon on our rear guard. I think now, as all of my commanders thought at Centreville, there is no alternative but to fall back to the Potomac, and I shall proceed to do so with as much regularity as possible.

pike, where I had been for a couple of hours turning stragglers and parties of regiments upon this place and Alexandria, I received intelligence that the rear guard, under Colonel Richardson, had left Fairfax Court-House and was getting along well. Had not been attacked. I am now trying to get matters a little organized over here.

Brigadier- General.

Hdqrs. Department Northeastern Virginia,
Arlington, Va., August 4, 1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to submit the following report of the battle of the 21st of July, near Manassas, Va. It has been delayed till this time from the inability of the subordinate commanders to get earlier a true account of the state of their commands.
In my communication to you of the 20th ultimo, I stated it as my intention to move that afternoon and drive the enemy from the east side of Bull Run, so as to enable the engineers to make a sufficiently accurate reconnaissance to justify our future movements. Later in the day they had obtained enough information of the passages across the stream to dispense with this reconnaissance, and it was decided to move without further delay.
It had been my intention to move the several columns out on the road a few miles on the evening of the 20th, so that they would have a shorter march in the morning; but I deferred to those who had the greatest distance to go, and who preferred starting early in the morning and making but one move.
On the evening of the 20th ultimo my command was mostly at or near Centreville. The enemy was at or near Manassas, distant from Centre-ville about seven miles to the southwest. Centreville is a village of a few houses, mostly on the west side of a ridge running nearly north and south. The road from Centreville to Manassas Junction runs along this ridge, and crosses Bull Run about three miles from the former place. The Warrenton turnpike, which runs nearly east and west, goes over this ridge through the village, and crosses Bull Run about four miles from it, Bull Run having a course between the crossings from northwest to southeast.
The First Division (Tyler’s) was stationed as follows: One brigade on the north side of the Warrenton turnpike and on the eastern slope of the Centreville ridge; two brigades on the same road and a mile and a half in advance to the west of the ridge; and one brigade on the road from Centreville to Manassas where it crosses Bull Run at Blackburn’s Ford, where General Tyler had the engagement of the 18th ultimo.
The Second Division (Hunter’s) was on the Warrenton turnpike, one mile east of Centreville.
The Third Division (Heintzelman’s) was on a road known as the old Braddock road, which comes into Centreville from the southeast about a mile and a half from the village.
The Fifth Division (Miles’) was on the same road with the Third Division, and between it and Centreville.
A map, which is herewith, marked A,* will show these positions better than I describe them.

tents were ordered to be issued to the command, and the men required to have three days’ rations in their haversacks. (See appendix herewith, marked B.)
Saturday orders (copy herewith, marked C) were issued for the available force to march.
As reported to you in my letter of the 19th ultimo, my personal reconnaissance of the roads to the south had shown that it was not practicable to carry out the original plan of turning the enemy’s position on their right. The affair of the 18th at Blackburn’s Ford showed he was too strong at that point for us to force a passage there without great loss, and if we did, that it would bring us in front of his strong position at Manassas, which was not desired.
Our information was that the stone bridge over which the Warrenton road crossed Bull Bun to the west of Centreville was mined, defended by a battery in position, and the road on his side of the stream impeded by a heavy abatis. The alternative was, therefore, to turn the extreme left of his position.
Reliable information was obtained of an undefended ford about three miles above the bridge, there being another ford between it and the bridge, which was defended. It was therefore determined to take the road to the upper ford, and, after crossing, to get behind the forces guarding the lower ford and the bridge, and after occupying the Warren-ton road east of the bridge to send out a force to destroy the railroad at or near Gainesville, and thus break up the communication between the enemy’s forces at Manassas and those in the Valley of Virginia before Winchester, which had been held in check by Major-General Patterson.
Brigadier-General Tyler was directed to move with three of his brigades on the Warrenton road, and commence cannonading the enemy’s batteries, while Hunter’s division, moving after him, should, after passing a little stream called Cub Run, turn to the right and north, and move by a wood road around to the upper ford, and then turn south and get behind the enemy; Colonel Heintzelman’s division to follow Hunter’s as far as the turning-off place to the lower ford, where he was to cross after the enemy should have been driven out by Hunter’s division; the Fifth Division (Miles’) to be in reserve on the Centreville ridge.
I had felt anxious about the road from Manassas by Blackburn’s Ford to Centreville along this ridge, fearing that, whilst we should be in force to the front and endeavoring to turn the enemy’s position, we ourselves should be turned by him by this road. For if he should once obtain possession of this ridge, which overlooks all the country to the west to the foot of the spurs of the Blue Ridge, we should have been irretrievably cut off and destroyed. I had, therefore, directed this point to be held in force, and sent an engineer to extemporize some field works to strengthen the position.
The Fourth Division (Runyon’s) had not been brought to the front farther than to guard our communications by way of Vienna and the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. His advanced regiment was about seven miles in rear of Centreville.
The divisions were ordered to march at 2.30 o’clock a. m., so as to arrive on the ground early in the day, and thus avoid the heat which is to be expected at this season. There was delay in the First Division getting out of its camp on the road, and the other divisions were, in consequence, between two and three hours behind the time appointed—a great misfortune, as events turned out. The wood road leading from the Warrenton turnpike to the upper ford was much longer than we counted upon, the

general direction of the stream being oblique to the road, and we having the obtuse angle on our side.
General Tyler commenced with his artillery at 6.30 a. m., but the enemy did not reply, and after some time it became a question whether he was in any force in our front, and if he did not intend himself to make an attack, and make it by Blackburn’s Ford. After firing several times, and obtaining no response, I held one of Heintzelman’s brigades in reserve, in case we should have to send any troops back to re-enforce Miles’division. The other brigades moved forward as directed in the general order.
On reaching the ford at Sudley Springs, I found part of the leading brigade of Hunter’s division (Burnside’s) had crossed, but the men were slow in getting over, stopping to drink. As at this time the clouds of dust from the direction of Manassas indicated the immediate approach of a large force, and fearing it might come down on the head of the column before the division could all get over and sustain it, orders were sent back to the heads of regiments to break from the column, and come forward separately as fast as possible.
Orders were sent by an officer to the reserve brigade of Heintzelman’s division to come by a nearer road across the fields, and an aide-de-camp sent to Brigadier-General Tyler to direct him to press forward his attack, as large bodies of the enemy were passing in front of him to attack the division which had crossed over.
The ground between the stream and the road leading from Sudley Springs south, and over which Burnside’s brigade marched, was, for about a mile from the ford, thickly wooded, whilst on the right of the road for about the same distance the country was divided between fields and woods. About a mile from the ford the country on both sides of the road is open, and for nearly a mile farther large rolling fields extend down to the Warrenton turnpike, which crosses what became the field of battle, through the valley of a small water-course, a tributary of Bull Run.
Shortly after the leading regiment of the First Brigade reached this open space, and whilst the others and the Second Brigade were crossing to the front and right, the enemy opened-his fire, beginning with artillery and following it up with infantry.
The leading brigade (Burnside’s) had to sustain this shock for a short time without support, and did it well. The battalion of regular infantry was sent to sustain it, and shortly afterwards the other corps of Porter’s brigade and a regiment detached from Heintzelman’s division to the left forced the enemy back far enough to allow Sherman’s and Keyes’ brigades of Tyler’s division to cross from their position on the Warrenton road.
These drove the right of the enemy (understood to have been commanded by Beauregard) from the front of the field, and out of the detached woods, and down to the road, and across it, up the slopes on the other side. Whilst this was going on, Heintzelman’s division was moving down the field to the stream and up the road beyond. Beyond the Warrenton road, and to the left of the road down which our troops had marched from Sudley Springs, is a hill with a farm house on it. Behind this hill the enemy had early in the day some of his most annoying batteries planted. Across the road from this hill was another hill, or rather elevated ridge or table land. The hottest part of the contest was for the possession of this hill with a house on it.
The force engaged here was Heintzelman’s division, Willcox’s and Howard’s brigades on the right, supported by part of Porter’s brigade

and tlie cavalry under Palmer, and Franklin’s brigade of Heintzelman’s division, Sherman’s brigade of Tyler’s division in the center and up the road, whilst Keyes’ brigade of Tyler’s division was on the left, attacking the batteries near the stone bridge. The Rhode Island Battery of Burnside’s brigade also participated in this attack by its fire from the north of the turnpike. The enemy was understood to have been commanded by J. E. Johnston.
Ricketts’ battery, which did such effective service and played so brilliant a part in this contest, was, together with Griffin’s battery, on the side of the hill, and became the object of the special attention of the enemy, who succeeded four officers mistaking one of his regiments for one of our own, and allowing it to approach without firing upon it) in disabling the battery, and then attempted to take it. Three times was he repulsed by different corps in succession and driven back, and the guns taken by hand (the horses being killed) and pulled away. The third time it was supposed by us all that the repulse was final, for he was driven entirely from the hill, so far beyond it as not to be in sight, and all were certain the day was ours. He had before this been driven nearly a mile and a half, and was beyond the Warrenton road, which was entirely in our possession from the stone bridge westward, and our engineers were just completing the removal of the abatis across the road to allow our re-enforcements (Schenck’s brigade and Ayres’ battery) to join us.
The enemy was evidently disheartened and broken. But we had then been fighting since 10.30 o’clock in the morning, and it was after 3 o’clock in the afternoon. The men had been up since 2 o’clock in the morning, and had made what to those unused to such things seemed a long march before coming into action, though the longest distance gone over was not more than 9 J miles; and though they had three days’ provisions served out to them the day before, many, no doubt, either did not get them, or threw them away on the march or during the battle, and were therefore without food. They had done much severe fighting. Some of the regiments which had been driven from the hill in the first two attempts of the enemy to keep possession of it had become shaken, were unsteady, and had many men out of the ranks.
It was at this time that the enemy’s re-enforcements came to his aid from the railroad train (understood to have just arrived from the valley with the residue of Johnston’s army). They threw themselves in the woods on our right, and opened a fire of musketry on our men, which caused them to break and retire down the hill-side. This soon degenerated into disorder, for which there was no remedy. Every effort was made to rally them, even beyond the reach of the enemy’s fire, but in vain. The battalion of regular infantry alone moved up the hill opposite to the one with the house, and there maintained itself until our men could get down to and across the Warrenton turnpike on the way back to the position we occupied in the morning. The plain was covered with the retreating groups, and they seemed to infect those with whom they came in contact. The retreat soon became a rout, and this soon degenerated still further into a panic.
Finding this state of affairs was beyond the efforts of all those who had assisted so faithfully during the long and hard day’s work in gaining almost the object of our wishes, and that nothing remained on that field but to recognize what we could no longer prevent, I gave the necessary orders to protect their withdrawal, begging the men to form a line, and offer the appearance, at least, of organization and force.
They returned by the fords to the Warrenton road, protected, by my

order, by Colonel Porter’s force of regulars. Once on the road, and the different corps coining together in small parties, many without officers, they became intermingled, and all organization was lost.
Orders had been sent back to Miles’ division for a brigade to move forward and protect this retreat, and Colonel Blenker’s brigade was detached for this purpose, and was ordered to go as far forward as the point where the road to the right left the main road.
By referring to the general order it will be seen that while the operations were to go on in front, an attack was to be made at Blackburn’s Ford by the brigade (Bichardson’s) stationed there. A reference to his report, and to that of Major Hunt, commanding the artillery, will show that this part of the plan was well and effectively carried out.* It succeeded in deceiving the enemy for a considerable time and in keeping in check a, part of his force. The fire of the artillery at this point is represented as particularly destructive.
At the time of our retreat, seeing great activity in this direction, much firing, and columns of dust, I became anxious for this place, fearing if it were turned or forced the whole stream of our retreating mass would be captured or destroyed.
After providing for the protection of the retreat by Porter’s and Blenker’s brigades, I repaired to Bichardson’s, and found the whole force ordered to be stationed for the holding of the road from Manassas, by Blackburn’s Ford, to Oentreville, on the march, under orders from the division commander, for Oentreville. I immediately halted it, and ordered it to take up the best line of defense across the ridge that their then position admitted of; and subsequently, taking in person the command of this part of the Army, I caused such disposition of the forces, which had been added to by the First and Second New Jersey and the De Kalb Regiments, ordered up from Runyon’s reserve before going forward, as would best serve to check the enemy.
The ridge being held in this way, the retreating current passed slowly through Oentreville to the rear. The enemy followed us from the ford as far as Cub Run, and, owing to the road becoming blocked up at the crossing, caused us much damage there, for the artillery could not pass, and several pieces and caissons had to be abandoned. In the panic the horses hauling the caissons and ammunition were cut from their places by persons to escape with, and in this way much confusion was caused, the panic aggravated, and the road encumbered. Not only were pieces of artillery lost, but also many of the ambulances carrying the wounded.
By sundown most of our men had gotten behind Oentreville ridge, and it became a question whether we should or not endeavor to make a stand there. The condition of our artillery and its ammunition, and the want of food for the men, who had generally abandoned or thrown away all that had been issued the day before, and the utter disorganization and consequent demoralization of the mass of the Army, seemed to all who were near enough to be consulted—division and brigade commanders and staff—to admit of no alternative but to fall back; the more so as the position at Blackburn’s Ford was then in the possession of the enemy, and he was already turning our left.
On sending the officers of the staff to the different camps, they foffnd, as they reported to me, that our decision had been anticipated by the troops, most of those who had come in from the front being already on the road to the rear, the panic with which they came in still continuing and hurrying them along.

At — o’clock the rear guard (Blenker’s brigade) moved, covering the retreat, which was effected during the night and next morning.* The troops at Fairfax Station, leaving by the cars, took with them the bulk of the supplies which had been sent there. My aide-de-camp, Major Wadsworth, staid at Fairfax Court-House till late in the morning, to see that the stragglers and weary and worn-out soldiers were not left behind.
I transmit herewith the reports of the several division and brigade commanders, to which I refer for the conduct of particular regiments and corps, and a consolidated return of the killed, wounded, and missing, marked D. From the latter it will be seen that our killed amounted to 19 officers and 462 non-commissioned officers and privates, and our wounded to 64 officers and 947 non-commissioned officers and privates. Many of the wounded will soon be able to join the ranks, and will leave our total of killed and disabled from further service under 1,000.
The return of the missing is very inaccurate, the men supposed to be missing having fallen into other regiments and gone to Washington; many of the zouaves to Hew York. In one brigade the number originally reported at 616 was yesterday reduced to 174. These reductions are being made daily. In a few days a more correct return can be made.
Of course nothing accurate is known of the loss of the enemy. An officer of their forces, coming from them with a flag, admitted 1,800 killed and wounded, and other information shows this to be much under the true number.
The officer commanding the Eleventh Hew York (Zouaves) and Colonel Heintzelman say that the returns of that regiment cannot be relied on, as many there reported among the casualties have absented themselves since their return, and have gone to Hew York.
Among the missing are reported many of our surgeons, who remained in attendance on our wounded, and were, against the rules of modern warfare, made prisoners.
The issue of this hard-fought battle, in which certainly our troops lost no credit in their conflict on the field with an enemy ably commanded, superior in numbers, who had but a short distance to march, and who acted on his own ground on the defensive, and always under cover, whilst our men were of necessity out on the open fields, should not prevent full credit being given to those officers and corps whose services merited success if they did not attain it.
To avoid repetition I will only mention here the names of those not embraced in the reports of division and brigade commanders. I beg to refer to their reports for the names of those serving under their immediate orders, desiring that on this subject of persons, &c., they be considered as part of my own.
I claim credit for the officers of my staff and for those acting as such during the day. They did everything in their power, exposing themselves freely when required, and doing all that men could do, communicating orders, guiding the columns, exhorting the troops, rallying them when broken, and providing for them the best the circumstance^ admitted.
They are as follows:
First Lieut. II. W. Kingsbury, Fifth Artillery, A. D. C.
Maj. Clarence S. Brown, Hew York Militia, volunteer A. D. C.
Maj. James S. Wadsworth, Hew York Militia, volunteer A. D. C.
The latter (who does me the honor to be on my personal staff) had a horse shot under him in the hottest of the fight.

When I submitted to the General-in-Chief, in compliance with his

﻿324	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
verbal instructions, the plan of operations and estimate of force required, the time I was to proceed to carry it into effect was fixed for the 8th of July (Monday).*
Every facility possible was given me by the General-in-Chief and heads of the administrative departments in making the necessary preparations. But the regiments, owing, I was told, to want of transportation, came over slowly. Many of them did not come across until eight or nine days after the time fixed upon, and went forward without my ever seeing them and without having been together before in a brigade.
The sending re-enforcements to General Patterson by drawing off the wagons was a further and unavoidable cause of delay.
Notwithstanding the herculean efforts of the Quartermaster-General, and his favoring me in every possible way, the wagons for ammunition, subsistence, &c., and the horses for the trains and for the artillery, did not all arrive for more than a week after the time appointed to move.
I was not even prepared as late as the 15th ultimo, and the desire I should move became great, and it was wished I should not, if possible, delay longer than Tuesday, the 16th ultimo. When I did set out on the 16th I was still deficient in wagons for subsistence, but I went forward, trusting to their being procured in time to follow me.
The trains thus hurriedly gotten together, with horses, wagons, drivers, and wagon-masters all new and unused to each other, moved with difficulty and disorder, and was the cause of a day’s delay in getting the provisions forward, making it necessary to make on Sunday the attack we should have made on Saturday.
I could not, with every exertion, get forward with the troops earlier than we did. I wished them to go to Centreville the second day, which would have taken us there on the 17th, and enabled us, so far as they were concerned, to go into action on the 19th instead of the 21st ; but when I went forward from Fairfax Court-House beyond Germantown to urge them forward, I was told it was impossible for the men to march farther. They had only come from Vienna, about six miles, and it was not more than six and one-half miles farther to Centreville, in all a march of twelve and one-half miles; but the men were foot-weary, not so much, I was told, by the distance marched, as by the time they had been on foot, caused by the obstructions in the road and the slow pace we had to move to avoid ambuscades. The men were, moreover, unaccustomed to marching, their bodies not in condition for that kind of work, and not used to carrying even the load of u light marching order.*’
We crossed Bull Bun with about 18,000 men of all arms, the Fifth Division (Miles’) and Bichardson’s brigade on the left at Blackburn’s Ford and Centreville, and Schenck’s brigade of Tyler’s division on the left of the road near the stone bridge, not participating in the main action. The numbers opposed to us have been variously estimated. I may safely say, and avoid even the appearance of exaggeration, that the enemy brought up all he could which were not kept engaged elsewhere. He had notice of our coming on the 17th, and had from that time until the 21st to bring up whatever he had.
It is known that in estimating the force to go against Manassas I engaged not to have to do with the enemy’s forces under Johnston, then kept in check in the valley by Major General Patterson, or those kept engaged by Major-General Butler, and I knew every effort was made by the General-in-Chief that this should be done, and that even if Johnston joined Beauregard, it should be because he would be driven in and

followed by General Patterson. But, from causes not necessary for me to refer to, even if I knew them all, this was not done, and the enemy was free to assemble from every direction in numbers only limited by the amount of his railroad rolling-stock and his supply of provisions.
To the forces, therefore, we drove in from Pairfax Court-House, Fairfax Station, Germantown, and Centreville, and those under Beauregard at Manassas, must be added those under Johnston from Winchester, and those brought up by Davis from .Richmond and other places at the South, to which is to be added the levy en masse ordered by the Richmond authorities, which was ordered to assemble at Manassas. What all this amounted to I cannot say; certainly much more than we attacked them with.
I could not, as I have said, move earlier or push on faster, nor could I delay. A large and the best part, so considered, of my forces were three-months? volunteers, whose terms of service were about expiring, but who were sent forward as having long enough to serve for the purpose of the expedition.
On the eve of the battle the Fourth Pennsylvania Regiment of Volunteers and the battery of Volunteer Artillery of the Eighth New York Militia, whose term of service expired, insisted on their discharge. I wrote to the regiment as pressing a request as Pcould pen, and the honorable Secretary of War, who was at the time on the ground, tried to induce the battery to remain at least five days, but in vain. They insisted on their discharge that night. It was granted; and the next morning, when the Army moved forward into battle, these troops moved to the rear to the sound of the enemy’s cannon.
In the next few days, day by day I should have lost ten thousand of the best armed, drilled, officered, and disciplined troops in the Army. In other words, every day which added to the strength of the enemy made us weaker.
In conclusion, I desire to say in reference to the events of the 21st ultimo, that the general order tor the battle to which I have referred was, with slight modifications, literally conformed to; that the corps were brought over Bull Run in the manner proposed, and put into action as before arranged, and that, up to late in the afternoon, every movement ordered was carrying us successfully to the object we had proposed before starting—that of getting to the railroad leading from Manassas to the valley of Virginia, and going on it far enough to break up and destroy the communication, and interpose between the forces under Beauregard and those under Johnston; and could we have fought a day—yes, a few hours—sooner, there is everything to show that we should have continued successful, even against the odds with which we contended.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

The enemy has planted a battery on the Warrenton turnpike to defend the passage of Bull Run, has mined the stone bridge, and made a heavy abatis on the right bank to oppose our advance in that direction. The ford above the bridge is also guarded, whether with artillery or not is not positively known, but every indication favors the belief that he purposes defending the passage of the stream.
It is intended to turn the position, force the enemy from the road, that it may be reopened, and, if possible, destroy the railroad leading from Manassas to the valley of Virginia, where the enemy has a large force. As this may be resisted by all the force of the enemy, the troops will be disposed of as follows:
The First Division (General Tyler’s), with the exception of Richardson’s brigade, will move at 2.30 a. m. precisely, on the Warrenton turnpike, to threaten the passage of the bridge, but will not open fire until full daybreak.
The Second Division (Hunter’s) will move from its camp at 2 a. m. precisely, and, led by Captain Woodbury, of the Engineers, will, after passing Cub Run, turn to the right and pass the Bull Run stream above the lower ford at Sudley Springs, and then, turning down to the left, descend the stream and clear away the enemy who may be guarding the lower ford and bridge. It will then bear off to the right, to make room for the succeeding division.
The Third Division (Heintzelman’s) will march at 2.30 a. m. and follow the road taken by the Second Division (Hunter’s), but will cross at the lower ford after it has been turned as above, and then, going to the left, take place between the stream and Second Division.
The Fifth Division (Miles’) will take position on the Centreville heights. (Richardson’s brigade will for the time form part of his division, and will continue in its present position.) One brigade will be in the village and one near the present station of Richardson’s brigade. This division will threaten Blackburn’s Ford and remain in reserve at Centreville.
The commander will open fire with artillery only, and will bear in mind that it is a demonstration only he is to make. He will cause such defensive works, abatis, earthworks, &c., to be thrown up as will strengthen his position. Lieutenant Prime, of the Engineers, will be charged with this duty.
These movements may lead to the gravest results, and commanders of divisions and brigades should bear in mind the immense consequences involved. There must be no failure, and every effort must be made to

Colonel : My attention has been called by those interested to two omissions in my report of the battle of the 21st ultimo near Manassas, and I ask leave to make the following corrections, wishing that they be made part of my original report:
1.	In speaking of the retreat, I mentioned that it was covered by Colonel Blenker’s brigade. I should have said Colonel Bichardson’s and Colonel Blenker’s brigades. The former was on the left of the Centreville ridge, and the latter in front of it, on the Warrenton road. Each covered the retreat of those on the respective roads to the common point—Centreville} from there to the rear Colonel Bichardson was behind, and covered the main body.
2.	In speaking of the action on the left at Blackburn’s Ford, I mentioned Colonel Bichardson’s and Major Hunt’s reports as giving the account of what transpired in that direction. In this connection I omitted to mention Col. T. A. Davies’ report, and now beg to refer to it as necessary to a full account of this part of the battle. He was engaged to the left of Bichardson, and repulsed an attempt of the enemy to turn our left.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
IBVIN MCDOWELL, Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Washington, July 29,1861.
Sir : On the 18th of July, ^t about 9 a. in., I joined the commanding general about two miles beyond Fairfax Court-House, on the road to

THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.

Centreville. He was then about going to Sangster’s, and invited me to attend him. Kot understanding his journey to have the character of a reconnaissance, but as simply to communicate with the division of Colonel Heintzelman, I preferred accompanying the division of General Tyler to Centreville.
Proceeding to Centreville, I joined Captain Alexander, Engineers, a short distance out on the road leading to Blackburn’s Ford. He was at this time preparing to encamp his pioneer party, and it was my intention, as soon as the troops should be fixed in their positions, to propose to General Tyler to make a reconnaissance of the enemy’s position at Blackburn’s Ford.
It should be borne in mind that the plan of the campaign had been to turn the position of Manassas by the left ; that is to say, that from Fairfax Court-House and Centreville we were to make a flank movement towards Sangster’s and Fairfax Station, and thence to Wolf Bun Shoals, or in that direction. In my interview with the commanding general, just referred to, he said nothing to indicate any change of plan, but, on the contrary, his remarks carried the impression that he was more than ever confirmed in his plan, aud spoke of the advance on Centreville as a u demonstration.” In proposing, therefore, to recon-noiter the enemy’s position at Blackburn’s Ford, it was not with the slightest idea that this point would be attacked. But a reconnaissance would be but the carrying out of a demonstration.
While I was awaiting Captain Alexander, I encountered Mathias C. Mitchell, who was afterwards secured as a guide, representing himself as a Union man, and a resident of that vicinity. I was engaged questioning him, when intelligence was received that General Tyler had sent back for artillery and infantry, and that the enemy was in sight before him. Biding to the front, I joined General Tyler and Colonel Bicliardson. Proceeding with them a short distance farther, we emerged from the woods, and found ourselves at the point at which the road commences its descent to Blackburn’s Ford. The run makes here a curve or bow towards us, which the road bisects. The slopes from us towards it were gentle and mostly open. On the other side the banks of the run rise more abruptly, and are wooded down to the very edge of the run. Higher up a cleared spot could be seen here and there, and still higher—higher than our own point of view, and only visible from its sloping gently towards us—the elevated plateau (comparatively open) in which Manassas Junction is situated.
Although, owing to the thickness of the wood, little could be seen along the edge of the run, it was quite evident from such glimpses as we could obtain that the enemy was in force behind it. I represented to General Tyler that this point was the enemy’s strong position on the direct road to Manassas Junction; that it was no part of the plan to assail it. I did not, however, object to a demonstration, believing that it would favor what I supposed still to be the commanding general’s plan of compaign. The two 20-pounders Parrotts had been ordered up; they were opened upon the enemy’s position, firing in various directions, without our being able to perceive the degree of effect they produced. We had fired perhaps a half dozen rounds, when we were answered by a rapid discharge from a battery apparently close down to the run and at the crossing of the road. The 20-pounders continued their firing, directing at this battery, and Ayres’ battery was brought up and stationed on the left. The enemy’s batteries soon ceased answering. After ours had continued playing for about half an hour I thought it a useless expenditure of ammunition, and so stated to you (who

﻿330	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. TCiiap. IX.
arrived on the spot shortly before this), and presume that General Tyler concurred in this opinion, as the firing soon ceased. I supposed that this would be the end of the affair; but, perceiving the troops filing down towards the run, I thought it necessary to impress General Tyler with the fact that it was no part of the commanding generaPs plan to bring on a serious engagement. I directed Captain Alexander, Engineers, to state this fact to him, which he did in writing (having stated the same verbally before). At the same time I directed Lieutenant Houston to accompany the troops, and make such observations of the enemy’s position as he could. I remained on the heights, observing as well as I could the movements of the enemy’s forces. The affair becoming more serious than I expected, I was about to go down to the front when our troops retired, and I returned to Centreville with yourself to report to General McDowell.
It is proper to observe that before our artillery practice commenced movements of troops were observed on the road leading from Manassas to Blackburn’s Ford. As the road presented itself to the eye, those not very familiar with the locality might well feel some doubt, judging merely by the eye, whether these troops were advancing to or retiring from the position at Blackburn’s Ford. The impression seemed to be quite common among us that they were retiring. I was perfectly sure that they were columns moving up to meet us from Manassas.
At my interview with the commanding general that evening, he informed me that he had convinced himself that the nature of the country to the left or southward of Manassas was unfit for the operations of a large army; that he had determined to move by the right, turning the enemy’s left; that the provision trains were just coming in, arid that the troops would require the next day to cook their provisions for another march. I told him I would endeavor the next day to obtain such information as would enable him to decide on his future movement.
The next most prominent crossing of Bull Run above Blackburn’s Ford is the stone bridge of the Warrenton turnpike. Such a point could scarcely be neglected by the enemy. Information from various quarters gave good cause for believing that it was guarded by several thousand men; that at least four cannon were stationed to play upon it and the ford not far below, and, moreover, that the bridge was mined, and that extensive abatis obstructed the road on the opposite shore.
Two or three miles above the Warrenton Bridge is a ford, laid down on our maps as u Sudley Spring.” Reliable information justified the belief that the lord was good; that it was unfortified; that it was watched by only one or two companies, and, moreover, that the run above it was almost everywhere passable for wheeled vehicles. Midway between the stone bridge and Sudley Spring our maps indicated another ford, which was said to be good.
Notwithstanding our conviction of the practicability of these fords no known road communicated with them from any of the main roads on our side of Bull Run. We had information that a road branched from the Warrenton turnpike a short distance beyond Cub Run, by which, opening gates and passing through private grounds, we might reach the fords. It was desirable to assure ourselves that this route was entirely practicable. In company with Captain Woodbury, Engineers. and Governor Sprague, and escorted by a company of cavalry, I on the 19th followed up the valley of Cub Run until we reached a point west 10° north, and about four miles in an air line from Centreville, near which we struck a road which we believed to lead to the fords. Following it for a short distance, we encountered the enemy’s

331
patrols. As we were most anxious to avoid attracting the enemy’s attention to our designs in this quarter, we did not care to pursue the reconnaissance farther. We had seen enough to be convinced of the perfect practicability of the route. To make more certain of the fords, however, Captain Woodbury proposed to return at night, and, with a few Michigan woodsmen from Colonel Sherman’s brigade, to endeavor to find them.
On returning to camp it was determined to send Captain Wright and Lieutenant Snyder, Engineers, with Captain Woodbury. At the same time the commanding general directed Captain Whipple, Topographical Engineers, and Lieutenant Prime, Engineers, to make a night reconnaissance of the run between Warren ton Bridge and Blackburn’s Ford. Both these night expeditions failed. It was found the enemy occupied the woods too strongly on our side of the run to permit the reconnaissances to be accomplished. It was not our policy to drive in his pickets until we were in motion to attack. On laying before you the information obtained, the commanding general believed himself justified in adopting the following plan of attack, which was decided upon on the 20th:
1.	A false attack to be made by Bichardson’s brigade (temporarily attached to Miles’ division) on Blackburn’s Ford; the rest of that division remaining in reserve at Centreville.
2.	Tyler’s division to move from its camp at 3 a. m. (the 21st) towards the stone bridge of the Warrenton turnpike, to feign the main attack upon this point.
3.	The divisions of Hunter and Heintzeiman (in the order named) to leave their camps at 2.30 a. m. (they were encamped about two or three miles behind Tyler), and, following his movement, to diverge from the Warrenton turnpike at the by-road beyond Cub Bun, and take the road for Sudley Springs; or, rather, it was provided (if I mistake not) that Hunter’s division should proceed to Sudley Springs, and Heintzeiman to take the lower ford; these matters, however, to be regulated by circumstances.
It was intended that the head of Hunter’s division should be at the turn-off at early daylight or about 4 a. m., and that it should reach. Sudley by 6 or 7.
You are aware of the unexpected delay. The two leading brigades of Tyler had not cleared the road for Hunter to this point until 5.30, and our guide, alleging that a nearer route to the ford would bring our columns in sight of the enemy’s batteries, led them by so circuitous a way that Hunter did not reach Sudley until 9.30, or thereabouts. Accompanying the commanding general, wre, as you are aware, after waiting two or three hours at the turn-off, rode on to overtake the front of Hunter’s division. When we emerged from the woods (nearly northeast of Sudley) into the open country, from whence the course of the run and the slopes of the opposite shore could be seen, we could perceive the enemy’s columns in motion to meet us. The loss of time here in great measure thwarted our plan. We had hoped to pass the ford and reach the rear of the enemy’s defenses at Warrenton stone bridge before he could assemble a sufficient force to cope with us.
It now became necessary to have Tyler’s division force the passage of the bridge. It had always been intended that this division should pass at or near the bridge; but it was hoped, by taking its defenses in rear, it could be passed without force. The commanding general promptly sent orders to Tyler to press his attack with all vigor. I had yet much confidence that, though we had been anticipated (owing to

## p. 332 (#348) ############################################

﻿332	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. ICiiap. IX.
the delays mentioned), the enemy was not yet assembled to oppose us in great force (a confidence which I think the facts justified); that we might successfully attack him in front, while the division of Tyler should fall upon his flank and rear.
When we reached the front of Hunter’s column, the battle was just commencing. The events of the battle-field will be described in the reports you will receive from other quarters. I was near the commanding general until some time after the arrival of Sherman’s brigade on our left. Being accidentally separated, I saw yourself on the right, and, joining you, we observed for some time the action on the heights, where the enemy made his final and successful stand. As we were observing, the zouave regiment of Heintzelman was driven back, leaving Bicketts’ battery, upon which we observed the enemy charge.
You left me here, and I remained a few minutes longer, an anxious spectator, and for the first time beginning to anticipate a possible defeat. Two brigades of Tyler’s division had passed over the run, and I supposed (and believe the commanding general supposed) that the entire division was over. If so, the stone bridge was unguarded, and if we were defeated, our retreating columns might be cut off from Centreville by the detachments of the enemy crossing this bridge. I became so anxious on this point, that I sought you again and found you at some distance in the rear. After some consultation, you, on my assuming the responsibility, sent an order to Colonel Miles to move up two of his brigades to the stone bridge, and to telegraph the Secretary of War to send up all the troops that could be spared from Washington. While I was returning towards the front, intending to rejoin the commanding general, I saw our front give way, and it soon became evident that we were defeated.
I have stated that it was a part of the plan of the battle that Tyler’s division should pass at or near the stone bridge. Two of his brigades actually did pass, but not at the bridge (they finding fords a half mile higher up), and connected themselves with our left. In anticipation that the stone bridge would be blown up, Captain Alexander bad been instructed to prepare a trestle bridge to replace it. This he had on the spot, but there appear to have been no mines prepared under the bridge. Captain Alexander passed over his pioneers one by one, and set them to cutting away the abatis, 200 yards in extent, obstructing the road. This task was accomplished, and the way was opened for Schenck’s brigade to fall on the enemy’s right at the moment when our lines finally gave way in front.
It will be seen from the above that the combination, though thwarted by adverse circumstances, was actually successful in uniting three entire divisions, excepting the brigade of Schenck, which had just opened its way to fall on the enemy’s right at the moment when our lines finally gave way in front, upon the decisive point.
A fault, perhaps, it was that it did not provide earlier for bringing the two brigades of Miles (in reserve at Centreville) into action. One of his brigades (Bichardson’s) actually did participate, though not on the battle-field, and in its affair at Blackburn’s Ford probably neutralized at least an equal number of the enemy.
On retiring to Centreville, my opinion was asked as to maintaining our position, and I gave it in favor of a prompt retreat, for I believed the enemy was far superior in numbers, and that, elated by his victory, he would pursue, and I believed that a defeated army actually driven back on Washington before a pursuing enemy would endanger the safety of the capital.

Report of Capt. Daniel P. Woodbury, U. 8. Corps of Engineers.
Foet Coecoean, Ya., July 30,1861.
Majoe: In compliance with your request that I should furnish a report of my own services and observations at the unfortunate battle of Bull Bun, I have the honor to say that I accompanied the divisions of Colonel Hunter and Colonel Heintzelman, and, assisted by Captain Wright, directed their course around the headwaters of Bull Bun, leaving the Centreville and Warrenton road about one-third mile west of Cub Bun at 5.30 a. m., July 21, and arriving at the upper ford, or Sudley’s Mill, at 9.30 a. m. The distance between these points by our route is between five and six miles. We followed in the main an old road as laid down upon the map, halting occasionally to prepare the road for artillery. At Sudley’s Mill we lingered about an hour, to give the men and horses water and a little rest before going into action, our advance guard in the mean time going ahead about three-quarters of a mile. Besuming our march, we emerged from the woods about one mile south of the ford, and came upon a beautiful open valley about one and a quarter miles square, bounded on the right or west by a wooded ridge, on the east by the rough spurs or bluffs of Bull Bun, on the north by an open plain and ridge, on which our troops began to form, and on the south by another ridge, on which the enemy were strongly posted, with woods behind their backs. The enemy were also in possession of the bluffs of Bull Bun on our left.
The flankers of the advanced guard on the left of our road first received the fire of the enemy—a single regiment lying on the ground on the south side of the northern ridge of the valley. At the same time the enemy opened upon the head of our column, and particularly upon the road, with many pieces of artillery in prepared batteries and in the open field. These batteries were more than a mile off, and did little execution, but the shells falling continually somewhat intimidated our troops. It was evident at a glance that the enemy was fully prepared, and I suggested to Colonel Hunter, commanding the leading division,

## p. 334 (#350) ############################################

﻿334
OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA.
[Chap. IX.
that we should confine our operations mainly to our left flank, driving the enemy from the immediate vicinity of Bull Run, and securing a junction with General Tyler’s division, then to act according to circumstances as the commanding general might think best.
Colonel Hunter unfortunately was wounded at the very beginning of the action. He had gone forward to the very lines of the enemy to see better how to direct the attack, and was struck by the fragment of a shell. The loss of a chief, and so gallant a chief, at that moment was a great calamity. After this I reported to Colonel Porter, then in command, and afterwards to General McDowell, with whom I finally retired from the field.
It is not for me to give a history of the battle. The enemy was driven on our left from cover to cover a mile and a half. Our position for renewing the action the next morning was excellent; whence, then, our failure? It will not be out of place, I hope, for me to give my own opinion of the cause of this failure* An old soldier feels safe in the ranks, unsafe out of the ranks, and the greater the danger the more pertinaciously he clings to his place. The volunteer of three months never attains this instinct of discipline. Under danger, and even under mere excitement, he flies away from his ranks, and looks for safety in dispersion. At 4 o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st there were more than twelve thousand volunteers on the battle-field of Bull Run who had entirely lost their regimental organizations. They could no longer be handled as troops, for the officers and men were not together. Men and officers mingled together promiscuously; and it is worthy of remark that this disorganization did not result from defeat or fear, for up to 4 o’clock we had been uniformly successful. The instinct of discipline which keeps every man in his place had not been acquired. We cannot suppose that the troops of the enemy had attained a higher degree of discipline than our own, but they acted on the defensive, and were not equally exposed to disorganization.
Lieutenant Cross, of the Engineer Corps, who has been my assistant during the last two months, had immediate charge of a working party of sappers and miners on our march from this place to Bull Run, following in the rear of the advance guard and promptly clearing away all obstructions. He was on the field of battle, zealously seeking and reporting information.

fax Court-House having been examined by Colonel Miles, the pioneers of the Garibaldi Guard were directed to construct a [redoubt] with two embrasures, so as to sweep the old Braddock road, and resist any attempt to outflank us from the left, by Union Mills road or road from Gaines’ Ford. The road being still obstructed by the other columns, by order of Colonel Miles I started Colonel Davies’ brigade on the road to Blackburn’s Ford, reaching that road by a short cut across the fields. I then returned to Colonel Miles, and examined some positions for intrench men ts on the left of the Blackburn road. These positions having been chosen, I was directed to proceed towards Blackburn7s Ford with my tools. Beaching Colonel Bichardson’s brigade, I was informed that Colonel Davies was in command. I proceeded to the extreme left of the line and reported to him. I shortly after returned to the center, where Captain Hunt’s battery was stationed.
I was directed by Colonel Bichardson to remain near the battery and keep watch on the movements of the enemy. Colonel Bichardson proceeded to make an abatis to cover a road for infantry and artillery, which should connect with the left. This road was formed on the skirt of the wood by cutting down the trees necessary for the abatis. Considerable progress was made in a battery across the road with three embrasures. This had a log revetment for the interior slope, and some ten or twelve feet of dirt in front. Captain Hunt’s battery having been ordered to the left, Lieutenant Greene’s battery was advanced to replace it, two pieces being on the right of the road and two on the left. An excellent view could be obtained of the infantry, cavalry, and artillery, as they moved either towards or from the main battle-field, the road in many places passing over cleared ground.
One hundred and sixty skirmishers were directed to proceed by a ravine on our left to feel the enemy. I proceeded with them. On approaching the road near Bull Bun the enemy’s skirmishers fired upon them and they fell back, the orders being that no engagement should be brought on. Shortly afterwards I was directed by Colonel Miles to send my men and implements to Centreville, and to return with him, in order to attend to the defenses of that point. Shortly before reaching Centreville I was directed by Colonel Miles to put Colonel Blenker’s brigade in motion immediately for Warrenton Bridge. I did so, and on Colonel Miles’ arrival at Centreville I received orders to accompany the brigade and make a stand at Warrenton Bridge, or, if circumstances rendered it necessary, to countermarch and take a defensive position at Centreville.
The road was now thronged with a mingled mass of footmen, mounted men, wagons, &c. Before reaching the head of the column I received from an officer of high rank intelligence that the Army was in full retreat. I requested him to send the battery at the rear of the column back to Centreville. As I reached each regiment I had them deployed to the right and left to cover the retreat, with instructions to fall back slowly to Centreville. Colonel Blenker, with his leading regiment deployed in line of battle and covered with a line of skirmishers, asked for authority to move forward, so as to check any advance of the enemy’s cavalry. Deeming my instructions sufficient, I gave the necessary order in Colonel Miles’ name, and was glad to learn from Colonel Blenker next day that an advance of cavalry had been checked and some prisoners released. I then returned to Centreville for orders, and, finding Colonel Miles had been relieved of his command, reported to General McDowell. By his direction I proceeded towards the Union Mills to ascertain if there were any signs of the enemy in that direction. None

being found, I was, on my return, directed to post the Twenty-seventh Pennsylvania Eegiment on the right of the Blackburn Ford road. On returning from the discharge of this portion of my duty I was unable to find general headquarters. I remained with Greene’s battery until I was informed that the Army had been ordered to fall back to Fairfax Court-House and make a stand.
At 3.30 Monday morning I was at Fairfax Court-House with my wagon, ready to carry out such orders as I might receive. The troops continued to file through the town, and I ascertained from Colonel Blenker that new orders had been issued, directing the troops to fall back to their old positions on the south side of the Potomac. I started my wagon and detachment for the engineer depot at Fort Bunyon, and, at Colonel Bichardson’s request, acccompanied him and his rear guard of two Michigan regiments. These, I believe, were the last troops that left Fairfax Court-House, and covered the retreat as far as the cross-roads formed by the Alexandria turnpike and road through Arlington Mills. I shortly afterwards ordered an advance, reaching Alexandria about noon on Monday.
Before closing my report I wish to mention Sergeant Field and ten men from the Fourth New Jersey (three months’) Volunteers, who accompanied my tool wagon and brought it back in safety, being the most of the time separated from me.
Bespeetfully submitted.

Report of Capt. Henry F. Clarice, Commissary of Subsistence, U. S. Army, of the subsistence of the Army from July 15 to 21.
Arlington, Va., August 2,1861.
Captain: For the information of the general commanding the department, I have the honor to submit the following report in reference to the subsistence of the Army under his command during its recent operations in front:
On the 15th ultimo the commanders of divisions were directed to see that all the troops of their respective commands have cooked and in their haversacks by 3 p. m. the next day three days’ rations, and orders were given that five days’ additional subsistence should be loaded into wagon trains on the day of march, and follow the Army on the day succeeding, and that a specified number of beef cattle should be driven forward with each train.
Owing to the necessary number of wagons not being furnished in season to uninstructed and many worthless teamsters and green teams, and to some of the roads being bad, only one of the trains—that in charge of First Lieut. J. P. Hawkins, Second Infantry, A. C. S.—was able to overtake the Army on the morning of the 18th. It, with ninety head of beef cattle, by traveling all the previous night, arrived at Fairfax Court-House on the morning stated, before the Army had taken up its march. During the morning, while the Army was moving forward to Centre-ville, it was thought the other subsistence trains, in charge of First

Lients. G. Bell, First Artillery, and James Curtis, Fifteenth Infantry, intended for Colonel lleintzelman’s and General Tyler’s divisions, respectively, would not reach the Army in season, and I was directed to distribute the subsistence in;the train present as equally as possible amongst the several divisions. Fourteen wagons, containing about 17,000 rations, were sent, in charge of Lieutenant Hawkins, to the Fifth Division; the remaining wagons were directed to immediately proceed to Centreville, and I had made the best arrangements in my power to distribute the provisions they contained amongst the other three divisions.
Shortly after our arrival at Centreville I was officially informed that the train with sixty-live head of beef cattle, in charge of Lieutenant Curtis, was in the vicinity, and the train with seventy head of beef cattle, in charge of Lieutenant Bell, was at Fairfax Court-House. I then directed the first of these trains to come forward to Centreville and encamp for the night, and the second to come forward with as little delay as possible, and myself conducted the remaining wagons of Lieutenant Ha wkins’ train, and turned them over to the officer (Lieutenant Merrill) directed by General Tyler to receive and distribute to the First Division the subsistence stores they contained.
I endeavored to distribute the subsistence stores equally amongst the several divisions according to the strength of each; but in consequence of the necessity of breaking up the train in charge of Lieutenant Hawkins which was intended for the divisions of Colonels Miles and Hunter, and the late arrival of the others, difficulties arose, and I may not have succeeded in my object.
Making due allowance for all losses on the march, according to the reports of the officers conducting the trains and my own observation at least 160,000 complete rations were received by the Army at and in the vicinity of Centreville; sufficient for its subsistence for five days.
In a circular from department headquarters, dated at Centreville, July 20,1861, commanders of divisions were directed to give the necessary orders that an equal distribution of the subsistence stores on hand might be made immediately to the different companies in their respective commands, so that they should be provided with the same number of days’ subsistence, and that the same be cooked and put into the haversacks of the men; and they were informed that the subsistence stores ' then in possession of each division, with the fresh beef that could be drawn from the chief commissary, must last to include the 23d instant. The three days’ subsistence it was directed the troops should have in their haversacks by 3 p. m. on the 16th of July should have lasted them to the afternoon of the 19th. After the distribution made in compliance with the circular above referred to, I know of several instances in which subsistence stores remained in possession of division and brigade commissaries, and of others in which provisions were left on the ground of the encampments on the morning of the 21st of July.
From personal observation on the march on the morning of the 21st of July, I know that generally the haversacks of the men were filled— whether properly or not I do not know. Begimental officers should be held accountable for that. During the battle and following it I noticed many filled haversacks, canteens, blankets, and other property lying on the ground, their owners having doubtless thrown them away to get rid of the labor of carrying them on so hot a day and under such trying circumstances.
I beg leave to call your attention to the reports of Lieutenants Bell, Hawkins, and Curtis. The duties they performed were highly impor-22 r r—yol ii

Report of Lieut. George Bell, Acting Commissary Subsistence, U. S. Army, of the subsistence of the Army from July 16 to 22.
Washington, D. 0., August 1,1861.
Sir: In compliance with your instructions of the 31st ultimo, I have the honor to submit the following report:
On the 16th ultimo about fifty wagons arrived at Alexandria, Ya., for the transportation of subsistence stores for General McDowelPs command. On the following day you directed me to forward about sixty more, sufficient for the amount of stores. These were in a very incomplete condition for the road, very few of the horses being shod ; a large number of teamsters and wagon-masters very inexperienced; the horses new; a number of wagons requiring linchpins before they could be moved; also requiring hame-strings, extra traces, links, &c., necessary to produce a rapid and secure movement on the road. My whole attention was directed to putting them in proper condition, neglecting for a time my legitimate duties in the subsistence department. The recent establishment of the quartermasters depot in Alexandria, the constant and continued employment of the workmen for the volunteers, their limited number, besides its utter destitution of all the essentials of a quartermasters depot, compelled me to send to Washington for what requisites I could obtain.
Immediately after General McDowelPs presence there more energy was displayed. On the evening of the 17th and morning of the 18th 60,000 complete assorted rations, in parcels or sections of 15,000 each, were packed by me in about fifty-four wagons. I also attached one extra wagon to each section with the substantial parts of the ration. These wagons I turned over to Lieutenant Hawkins, U. S. Army, in a complete condition as far as the requirements of the Quartermasters Department were concerned. I then packed for myself, in a similar manner with the extra, 45,000 rations in about forty-eight wagons; all the hard bread in boxes. About 108,000 rations were taken by Lieutenant Hawkins and myself on the 18th ultimo. I also took seventy beef cattle.
On the 18th, with an escort of about two hundred men of the New Jersey Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, I left Alexandria for Colonel Heintzelman’s command. The only information I could obtain before their departure was, they intended taking the extreme left. I was informed by General Eunyon, commanding, that they had gone to Occoquan, and started on the road for that place. After having proceeded several miles, I was informed by an officer he had just left Colonel Heintzelman at Fairfax Station. I immediately changed my course, and proceeded direct to Fairfax Court-House, with

339
the intention of going from thence to the station. I arrived at the Court-House about 4.45 p. m., and finding no person there from whom I could obtain any information, parked temporarily my train, sent Mr. Burns forward to look for you for orders, and proceeded myself direct to Fairfax Station to see Colonel Heintzelman. I found he had left a place two miles from there, on the advance, a few hours previous. As the cattle were completely exhausted by the extreme heat and the horses much tired, I camped for the night, and at 4 o’clock a. m. on the 19th started for Centreville, joining you about 8 o’clock a. m. After assisting you in the distribution of my stores, I returned the same night with the above one hundred empty wagons to Alexandria, arriving there about 6 o’clock on the morning of the 20th.
Mr. Leech accompanied me as chief wagon-master. We commenced loading as soon as practicable. I directed Mr. Leech to forward to Cloud’s Mill all the wagons as soon as loaded, and wait there until the entire train was completed. By 4 o’clock on the afternoon of the 21st ultimo all were on the road. I loaded, in sections of complete assorted rations of 7,000 and 14,000, 70,000 rations, and thirty wagons with the substantial parts of the ration—bread, meat, sugar, coffee, &c. About twenty-five wagons, with forage, &c., accompanied the train, with a few empty wagons for contingencies, as about sixty were idle in Alexandria when we left.
Lieutenant-Colonel Moore, with about three hundred New Jersey Volunteers, again joined me at Cloud’s Mill, which we left in complete order, expecting to join the command before daylight on the morning of the 22d. I was at the head of the train, and turned off about eight miles from Alexandria on a road I had previously traveled to avoid the hills. After proceeding from three to five miles farther I met a gentleman, who informed me the Army was routed and in full retreat. I proceeded about half a mile farther, and met Lieutenant Stockton, of Colonel Hunter’s staff, with Colonel Hunter, wounded. He, in substance, told me the same. Believing that the presence of so large a train might embarrass the troops under any circumstances, and a delay of a few hours not materially affect them, I sent an express to General Bunyon, requesting him to telegraph to Washington for instructions, and commenced parking my train in different fields along the road in small sections in such a manner it could advance or retire with rapidity, all the sections moving simultaneously.
I found, by approaching the rear, that Mr. Leech had failed to follow me, and taken about forty-five or fifty-five wagons on the road I left. I immediately sent a messenger to stop his train where it was, and also any cattle that might be on the road advancing, and to await further orders from me. (He was about one and a quarter miles from me.) After closing up his train he came up. I then directed him to park his train in a grass field, so he could move rapidly in either direction. I directed an expressman to proceed at once to General McDowell’s staff, and obtain such orders from you, or any reliable officer of the staff, as would control me. Lieutenant McIntosh, of the New Jersey Volunteers, kindly volunteered, as also did Lieutenant-Colonel Moore. I also requested Lieutenant McIntosh to examine carefully everything he could with reference to the movements, and return without delay. The expressman from General Bunyon returned with the following order :
u General Scott directs you to halt, and govern your future movements by what you hear from the advance.”
About 3.30 a. m. on the 22d ultimo Lieutenant McIntosh returned, and

[Chap. IX.
said he had seen Lieutenant Hawkins, who told him the troops were retiring. He (Lieutenant McIntosh) went on, and met a member of General McDowelPs staff (whose name he heard, but forgot), who informed him the Army were retiring, and expected to be at Arlington by daylight, if not cut off, and to tell me to get the wagons out of the road, so as not to embarrass them. He said he met some drovers with cattle hurrying back rapidly by your orders. I immediately ordered Mr. Burns to direct Mr. Leech to start without delay for Alexandria with such wagons as were with him, and started off the train with me. Mr. Leech followed me at the distance of a few hundred yards. The entire train arrived safely in Alexandria, without the loss of a wagon, before 7.30 a. m. on the 22d ultimo. A number of the wagons in the rear were stopped on the outskirts of the city and their contents taken. Also, after their arrival, I understand, a number were taken by troops of Colonel Davies7 brigade, but of the command I have nothing definite. I know the provisions left the wagons after their return. I am confident all returned. As great disorder and confusion prevailed in Alexandria, I was apprehensive the wagons would be seized by the return ing troops. I immediately proceeded to Washington and reported the fact to the Subsistence Department, who very judiciously ordered the entire train to Washington, with the cattle, which had also returned in safety. I am satisfied this movement alone saved the provisions from an unavoidable seizure.
Lieutenant-Colonel Moore and Lieutenant and Adjutant McIntosh, of the hTew Jersey Volunteers, assisted in every possible manner, and kindly volunteered for any duty I might assign them to. The officers of Lieutenant-Colonel Moore’s command were also desirous of offering any aid in their power. Mr. Burns was invaluable to me as an assistant.
I have turned over all the stores in the train. The loss of hard bread was very heavy, from the inconvenience of transporting it and the breakage of the barrels.

Report of Lieut. James Curtis, Acting Commissary Subsistence, TJ. S. Army, of the subsistence of the Army from July 16 to 22.
Arlington House, Va., August 1,1861. Sir : In obedience to your order of the date of yesterday, I have the honor to submit the following report of my operations in conducting subsistence stores to the army of General McDowell during its recent advance to Centreville and Bull Run:
On the 16th day of July a train of fifteen wagons from the Maine regiments, under charge of one Graves, wagon-master, reported to me at the storehouse of Lieutenant Grey, Second Artillery, A. C. S., near Fort Corcoran. These teams were in excellent order and under good management. These wagons I loaded with stores that day. On the morning of the 17th July I received from Capt. O. H. Tillinghast, A. Q. M., U. S. A., fifty more wagons. Of these I loaded forty-nine the same day,

341
making in all a train of sixty-four wagons. These last teams were hastily put together, and not used to work, and were illy provided with extra materials to supply breakage, &c. The teamsters also were a great many of them utterly unfit for their business. In fact, the management of the train was a matter of great difficulty. One wagon, which was broken, I left behind in charge of Lieutenant Grey.
At 4 p. m. of the 17th I started for Falls Church with my train, intending to camp at that place for the night. But the teams worked so badly, and there was so little organization, that I was obliged to make frequent stops to keep together. There were some ten or twelve of the teams that were unable to pull one-half an ordinary load, and these caused me great trouble.
From 7 p. m. of the 17th instant until 3 a. m. of the 18th I was engaged in getting my train over the hill just beyond Camp Tyler, which is the worst on the whole road. I was obliged to change and double teams, and after getting over my teams were perfectly exhausted. I therefore stopped until daylight, to feed and give my train a few hours7 rest. At about 8 a. m. I moved on, reaching Vienna at 12 m., where I rested until 2.30 p. m.
In rear of my train I had sixty-five beef cattle. These I found no difficulty with. At 2.30 p. m. I moved on from Vienna with an escort of twenty men from the Hew Jersey regiment stationed there under Col. W. R. Montgomery. This was the first escort I had had. When near Fairfax Court-House I received an order to go by way of Germantown and to follow by the Centreville road. I came up with m37 train and cattle with the rear of the Army just after dark, and as it was impossible for my teams to pull farther that night, I camped, under the instructions of Captain Tillinghast, alongside of the road. There were at this time some ten or twelve of my wagons back on the road. I found that if I delayed to help these worthless teams over every little hill I should not be up in time with the mass of my stores, which I knew would be much needed. These teams, however, all joined me within two days, except one wagon, which was, I believe, turned over and badly broken, and left behind.
On the morning of the 19th, in obedience to your orders, I distributed the contents gf forty-nine wagons to the division of Colonel Heintzelman. I then had two forage wagons, making in all fifty-one wagons that had come up, or thirteen wagons still behind, which joined afterwards, as I have stated. I found the men in an almost starving condition, and it was impossible, under the circumstances, to make out papers or go through any formalities. I divided the provisions in my train as equally as possible, and, by your order, parked 1113" train near headquarters; the cattle near, and sixty-five in number, as when I started. Sxome of my other wagons having come up, I turned over six or seven with their stores to Lieutenant Hawkins, Second Infantry, A. C. S., by your order.
Having done this, you directed me to repair to Fairfax Station, to take charge of and forward all supplies for the Army. I arrived there at about 6 p. m. of the 19tli, and immediately took the necessary steps to prepare storehouses and clear the track of the obstructions which the rebels had placed upon it, and which were very formidable, they having filled the deep cut there with trees and earth at least ten or twelve feet in depth and for a space of about two hundred feet.
I had on the 20th received a lot of rifle-cannon ammunition and one hundred and fifty boxes of small-arm cartridges, directed to Lieutenant Strong, Ordnance. These I was obliged to unload below the cut, and about a half mile from the station. On the morning of the 21st Capt.

H. 0. Symonds, C. S., sent me about ten thousand rations. I also received from Capt. R. O. Tyler, A. Q. M., on this date, five wagons, complete, and three thousand pounds oats, and from the camp at Centre-ville about thirty boxes muskets (old). This was all I had on hand on the evening of the 21st.
During the day I had been engaged in telegraphing the War Department of the progress of the battle, as near as I could judge. When the retreat commenced I telegraphed the War Department, “ Shall I abandon this post, and by what road'?” The answer was, “No.” I then telegraphed, 641 have a large quantity of rifled-cannon and small-arm ammunition. Shall I send it in by train ? ” To this I got no answer. I then received a dispatch directing me to throw everything from cars and send them in for troops, which I accordingly did. I did not send back the ammunition, because they telegraphed their intention to send more men and hold the position, and I judged also that, after the severe fight, if our men made a stand, they would want it. I therefore retained it, with everything on hand, as I stated.
We remained at the station expecting the arrival of troops until about 3 a. m. of the 22d, when our pickets reported that the northeast road to Alexandria had been blocked up by felling trees across it, and that the rebel cavalry were making their appearance near us. Shortly after this the War Department ordered the abandonment of the position by way of the railroad track to meet the cars which were on the way. Colonel McCunn, of one of the New York regiments, was in command. The retreat was conducted in a quiet and orderly manner, every man being-in his place. But upon arriving at Burke’s Station, where the First New Jersey three months’ men were, the scene beggared description. They lined the track, crowded into and ahead of our ranks, and acted otherwise in the most disgraceful manner. I could see no officers, and it was a mere armed mob. In this shape, with our own ranks in good order, but surrounded by the citizen soldiers of New Jersey, we met the cars, upon which they speedily crowded, leaving us the best chances we could get after they had finished. I need not state what the result would have been had there been an attack upon us. The property which I had in charge at Fairfax Station I was obliged to leave, as I could not transport it. The twenty horses belonging to the wagons were mostly ridden in by teamsters and irresponsible persons, but the five wagons and three thousand pounds of oats were left behind. The teamsters were not willing to take them around by the roads at a time when we all supposed that the enemy was in full pursuit.
To sum up, there was left at Fairfax Station about 10,000 rations, 150 boxes small-arm cartridges, 87 boxes rifled-cannon ammunition, 30 boxes (about) old fire-arms, 5 wagons, and 3,000 pounds of oats. This is all I know of.
After reaching Alexandria I reported to Captain Symonds there, and to you in person near Arlington.

Report of Ideut. John P. Hawkins, Acting Commissary of Subsistence, TJ. S. Army, of the subsistence of the Army from July 10 to 22.
Washington, D. 0., August 2,1861.
Captain: I have the honor to make the following report on the part performed by myself in connection with the commissary department subsisting the Army recently in the field under Brigadier-General McDowell:
On the evening of the 17th July I procured from Captain Symonds, commissary of subsistence at Alexandria, Va., a lot of provisions equal in bulk to fifty-six wagon loads, being in the principal parts of the ration equal to 64,700 rations, and in coffee and sugar a little over 70,000 rations. After some delay in getting the train started, occa-‘ sioned by refractory teamsters, I at last got under way, and j>roceeded to join the main body of the Army at Fairfax Court-House, which I reached by 7 o’clock next morning, having traveled all night. Shortly after my arrival there the Army commenced the move towards Centreville, and its progress was so slow that the train was delayed there till evening before trying to make any move towards accompanying the troops. At this place Captain Clarke, C. S., relieved me from the charge of all the train excepting fourteen wagons with assorted loads, and with these, at about 4 p. in., I proceeded towards Centreville, via the Braddock road. The troops of my division (Fifth) were reached about 9 p. in., and as there was an immediate necessity for the distribution of the rations, they were divided out as rapidly as possible, without waiting for provision returns or any formal papers, beyond a return of the troops of the different organizations of the division, in order to give out to each its pro rata share of the whole amount. The troops marched on the 16th from the Potomac, carrying three days’ rations in their haversacks. The rations issued by me from my stores were for about two days and a half, commencing on the 19th. Subsequently, Lieutenant Curtis, of the Commissary Department, turned over to me additional stores sufficient to make a three days’ supply for the division, ending on the evening of the 21st..
In addition to the supplies in wagons, I took charge of, from Alexandria, ninety head of beef cattle, at estimated weight equal to 48,600 rations (deducting fifty per cent, gross). A portion of these was turned over to me for distribution to the Fifth Division and to Colonel Willcox’s brigade. On the evening of the 19th, by direction of Captain Clarke, C. S., I started on my return to Alexandria, with twenty-five wagons, to procure more supplies. I reached there on the morning of the 20th, but by reason of vexatious delays was unable to get the train loaded and on the way before 2 o’clock the next day, when I started with it to join the Army, and would have been able to have done so by 12 o’clock that night, but was ordered to return when within three miles of Centreville. The wagons all reached Alexandria safely on the morning of the 22d.
I have mentioned in my report that the troops started on the march with three days’ rations in their haversacks, but from that amount are to be deducted the coffee, sugar, beans, and rice, for the reason that, no transportation being allowed, the camp-kettles and mess-pans were not taken along. (I speak only of the Fifth Division, which obeyed the order literally.) So there were no means for the proper preparation of these parts of the ration, and they were in reality of but little account to the soldiers. In future marches without transportation, I would

respectfully recommend that the bread and meat rations be increased, or that the order for the march should prescribe a certain number of camp-kettles to be carried by hand by each company, sufficient to make coffee and soup in.

Report of Surg. William S. King, U. S. Army, Medical Director.
Arlington, Dep’t Northeastern Virginia,
July 26, 1861.
Sir : Being chief of the medical staff serving with the Army in the Department of Northeastern Virginia, I have the honor to make the following report of so much of the results of the action on the 21st at Bull Run as came within my charge. As the officers of the medical staff were attached to the different regiments and on duty with them, I deemed it proper to remain with and accompany the general commanding and staff from the beginning to the termination of the battle, in order that I might be present if any were wounded, and also that I might be enabled to visit in this way every part of the field where the killed and wounded might be found.
After the action had fairly commenced and the wounded and the dead were seen lying on the field in every direction, I dispatched Assist. Surg. D. L. Magruder to the rear, with directions to prepare a church (which I had observed as we passed before arriving at the scene of action) for the reception of our wounded, and also to send the ambulances forward as rapidly as possible to pick up the wounded and dead. In a very few minutes the ambulances made their appearance, and continued throughout the day to visit every part of the ground which was accessible, so as to be within reach of those parts of the field where the fighting was going on and wounded were to be found. It is due to the ambulance drivers to say that they performed their duties efficiently, and the results of their operations also show how absolutely necessary these means of conveyance are to the comfort and relief of the wounded, in giving them shelter and water when ready to perish with heat and thirst. By means of the ambulances also the men who go to the relief of their wounded comrades are separated but a short time from their companies, as, having deposited them in the ambulances, they can return to their proper positions.
As the general commanding visited almost every part of the ground during the conflict, with a view to encourage or direct the movements of the troops, my position as a member of his staff gave me every opportunity of seeing the results of the action. I therefore embraced the opportunity thus offered to give directions when needed to the drivers of the ambulances where to find the dead and wounded, and also to those carrying off the wounded where they could find the needed conveyances. The stretchers were found very useful and comfortable to the wounded, and were in constant requisition, conveying them to the nearest ambulances.

So far as I am informed, the medical staff belonging to the different volunteer regiments discharged their duties satisfactorily. I observed Acting Assistant Surgeon Miles busily engaged in dressing wounded men under the shade of a tree in a part of the field where the fire from the enemy was very hot. He addressed me a brief inquiry as I passed relative to the safety of his father, and then resumed Ins occupation. Surg. C. O. Keeney, of Colonel Hunter’s division, and Assist. Surg. D. L. Magruder, attached to the commanding general’s staff, did good service in the hospital church I have mentioned, and also in two houses near the church, where the wounded were placed after the church had been filled. These officers remained busily engaged in the discharge of their duties till the enemy’s cavalry made their appearance, and but narrowly escaped capture when they left. Drs. Swift and Winston, attached to the New York Eighth, remained with their sick, sacrificing all selfish considerations for their own safety in order that the wounded might not be neglected, and are now prisoners. I am informed that Assistant Surgeons Gray and Sternberg, of the Regular Army, and Drs. Homiston and Swalm, of the New York Fourteenth, also preferred to remain rather than abandon their charge. The conduct of these officers is worthy of all commendation.
It would be premature in me, in the absence of sufficient data—the reports of the regimental surgeons not yet being received—to express a positive opinion as to the number killed and wounded in the action on the 21st. There were, no doubt, many concealed from observation under cover of the woods and bushes 5 but, judging from the number that I saw in various parts of the field, and allowing a wide margin for those unobserved, I should think that the killed and wounded on our side did not exceed from 800 to 1,000.
The impossibility of making a careful survey of the field after the battle had ceased must be my apology for the briefness and want of detail in this report.

The artillery of the corps d’armee consisted of the following-named batteries: Ricketts’ light company, I, First Artillery, six 10-pounder Parrott rifle guns 5 Hunt’s light company, M, Second Artillery, four light 12-pounders 5 Carlisle’s company, E, Second Artillery, two James 13-pounder rifle guns, two 6-pounder guns 5 Tidball’s light company, A, Second Artillery, two 6-pounder guns, two 12-pounder howitzers) Greene’s company, G, Second Artillery, four 10-pounder Parrott rifle

guns; Arnolds company, D, Second Artillery, two 13-pounder James rifle guns, two 6-pounder guns; Ayres’ light company, E, Third Artillery, two 10-pounder Parrott rifle guns, two 12-pounder howitzers, two 6-pounder guns; Griffin’s battery, D, Fifth Artillery, four 10-pounder Parrott rifle guns, two 12-pounder howitzers; Edwards’ company, G, First Artillery, two 20-pounder and one 30-pounder Parrott rifle guns. The Second Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers had with it a battery of six 13-pounder James rifle guns; the Seventy-first Regiment New York Militia two of Dahlgren’s boat howitzers, and the Eighth Regiment New York Militia a battery of six 6-pounder guns. The men of this last-named battery having claimed their discharge on the day before the battle because their term of service had expired, the battery was thrown out of service.
The whole force of artillery of all calibers was, therefore, forty-nine pieces, of which twenty-eight were rifle guns. All of these batteries were fully horsed and equipped, with the exception of the two howitzers of the Seventy-first Regiment New York Militia, which were without horses, and were drawn by drag-ropes, manned by detachments from the regiment.
General McDowell’s disposition for the march from Centreville on the morning of the 21st instant placed Tidball’s and Greene’s batteries (eight pieces) in reserve, with the division of Colonel Miles, to remain at Centreville; Hunt’s and Edwards’ (six pieces), with the brigade of Colonel Richardson, at Blackburn’s Ford; and Carlisle’s, Ayres’, and the 30-pounder (eleven pieces), with the division of General Tyler, at the stone bridge; Ricketts’, Griffin’s, Arnold’s, the Rhode Island, and Seventy-first Regiment batteries (twenty-four pieces) accompanied the main column, which crossed Bull Run at Sudley Springs. As soon as this column came in presence of the enemy, after crossing Bull Run, I received from General McDowell, in person, directions to superintend the posting of the batteries as they severally debouched from the road and arrived upon the field.
The Rhode Island Battery came first upon the ground, and took up, at a gallop, the position assigned it. It was immediately exposed to a sharp fire from the enemy’s skirmishers and infantry posted on the declivity of the hill and in the valley in its immediate front, and to a well-sustained fire of shot and shell from the enemy’s batteries posted behind the crest of the range of hills about one thousand yards distant. This battery sustained in a very gallant manner the whole force of this fire for nearly half an hour, when the howitzers of the Seventy-first New York Militia came up, and went into battery on its left. A few minutes afterwards Griffin brought up his pieces at a gallop, and came into battery about five hundred yards to the left of the Rhode Island and New York batteries.
Ricketts’ battery came up in less than half an hour afterwards, and was posted to the left of and immediately adjoining Griffin’s.
The enemy’s right, which had been wavering from the moment Griffin opened his fire upon it, now began to give way throughout its whole extent and retire steadily, his batteries limbering up rapidly, and at a gallop taking up successively two new positions farther to his rear. The foot troops on our left, following up the enemy’s retiring right, soon left our batteries so far in our rear that their fire was over the heads of our own men. I therefore directed the Rhode Island Battery to advance about five hundred yards in front of its first position, accompanied it myself, and saw it open fire with increased effect upon the enemy’s still retiring right.

Beturning to the position occupied by Bicketts’ and Griffin’s batteries, I received an order from General McDowell to advance two batteries to an eminence specially designated by him, about eight hundred yards in front of the line previously occupied by our artillery, and very near the position first occupied by the enemy’s batteries. I therefore ordered these two batteries to move forward at once, and, as soon as they were in motion, went for and procured as supports the Eleventh (Fire Zouaves) and the Fourteenth (Brooklyn) New York Begiments. I accompanied the former regiment, to guide it to its proper position, and Colonel Heintzelman, Seventeenth IT. S. Infantry, performed the same service for the Fourteenth, on the right of the Eleventh. A squadron of IT. S. cavalry, under Captain Colburn, First Cavalry, was subsequently ordered as additional support. We were soon upon the ground designated, and the two batteries at once opened a very effective fire upon the enemy’s left.
The new position had scarcely been occupied when a troop of the enemy’s cavalry, debouching from a piece of woods close upon our right flank, charged down upon the New York Eleventh. The zouaves, catching sight of the cavalry a few moments before they were upon them, broke ranks to such a degree that the cavalry dashed through without doing them much harm. The zouaves gave them a scattering fire as they passed, which emptied five saddles and killed three horses. A few minutes afterwards a regiment of the enemy’s infantry, covered by a high fence, presented itself in line on the left and front of the two batteries at not more than sixty or seventy yards’ distance, and delivered a volley full upon the batteries and their supports. Lieutenant Bam say, First Artillery, was killed, and Captain Bicketts, First Artillery, was wounded, and a number of men and horses were killed or disabled by this close and well-directed volley. The Eleventh and Fourteenth Begiments instantly broke and fled in confusion to the rear, and in spite of the repeated and earnest efforts of Colonel Heintzelman with the latter, and myself with the former, refused to rally and return to the support of the batteries. The enemy, seeing the guns thus abandoned by their supports, rushed upon them, and driving off the cannoneers, who, with their officers, stood bravely at their posts until the last moment, captured them, ten in number. These were the only guns taken by the enemy on the field.
Arnold’s battery came upon the field after Bicketts’, and was posted on our left center, where it performed good service throughout the day, and by its continued and well-directed fire assisted materially in breaking and driving back the enemy’s right and center.
The batteries of Hunt, Carlisle, Ayres, Tidball, Edwards, and Greene (twenty-one pieces), being detached from the main body, and not being under my immediate notice during the greater portion of the day, I respectfully refer you to the reports of their brigade and division commanders for the record of their services.
The Army having retired upon Centreville, I was ordered by General McDowell in person to post the artillery in position to cover the retreat. The batteries of Hunt, Ayres, Tidball, Edwards, Greene, and the New York Eighth Begiment (the latter served by volunteers from Willcox’s brigade),* twenty pieces in all, were at once placed in position, and thus remained until 12 o’clock p. in., when, orders having been received to retire upon the Potomac, the batteries were put in march, and, covered by Bichardson’s brigade, retired in good order and without haste, and early next morning reoccupied their former camps on the Potomac.

In conclusion, it gives me great satisfaction to state that the conduct of the officers and enlisted men of the several batteries was most exemplary. Exposed throughout the day to a galling fire of artillery and small-arms, several times charged by cavalry, and more than once abandoned by their infantry supports, both officers and enlisted men manfully stood by their guns with a courage and devotion worthy of the highest commendation. Where all did so well it would be invidious to make distinctions, and I therefore simply give the names of all the officers engaged, viz : Major Hunt, Captains Carlisle, Ayres, Griffin, Tidball, and Arnold; Lieutenants Platt, Thompson, Ransom, Webb, Barriger, Greene, Edwards, Dresser, Wilson, Throckmorton, Cushing, Harris, Butler, Puller, Lyford, Hill, Benjamin, Babbitt, Hains, Ames, Hasbrouck, Kensel, Harrison, Reed, Barlow, Noyes, Kirby, and Elderkiu.

Reports of Brig. Gen. Daniel Tyler, Connecticut Militia, commanding First
Division.
Hdqrs. 1st Diy. Dep’t Northeastern Virginia,
Washington City, July 27, 1861.
General : In obedience to Orders, No. 22, dated Centreville, July 20, Sherman’s, Schenck’s, and Keyes’ brigades of this division—Richardson’s brigade having been left in front of Blackburn’s Ford—moved at 2.30 a. m. on the 21st instant to threaten the passage of the Warren-ton turnpike bridge on Bull Run. I arrived in front of the bridge with Schenck’s and Sherman’s brigades and Ayres’ and Carlisle’s batteries about 6 a. m., Keyes’ brigade having been halted by your order to watch the road coming up from Manassas, and about two miles from the run. After examining the position, and posting Sherman’s and Schenck’s brigades and the artillery, I fired the first gun at 6.30 a. m., as agreed upon, to show that we were in position.
As my orders were to threaten the passage of the bridge, I caused Schenck’s brigade to be formed into line, its left resting in the direction of the bridge and the battery which the enemy had established to sweep the bridge and its approach, so as to threaten both. Sherman’s brigade was posted to the right of the Warrenton turnpike, so as to be in position to sustain Schenck or to move across Bull Run in the direction of Hunter’s column. The 30-pounder gun attached to Carlisle’s battery was posted on the Warrenton turnpike, with Ayres’ battery considerably in its rear. Carlisle’s battery was posted on the left of Sherman’s brigade. In this position we awaited the appearance of Hunter’s and Heintzelman’s columns, as ordered, until such time as the approach to the bridge should be carried, and the bridge rebuilt by Captain Alexander, of the Engineers, who had on the spot the necessary structure tor that purpose.
Soon after getting into position we discovered that the enemy had a heavy buttery, with infantry in support, commanding both the road and bridge approaches, on which both Ayres and Carlisle at different

times tried the effect of their guns without success, and a careful examination of the banks of Bull Bun satisfying me that they wTere impracticable for the purpose of artillery, these batteries had to remain comparatively useless until such time as Hunter’s column might clear the approach by a movement on the opposite bank. During this period of waiting the 30-pounder was occasionally used with considerable effect against bodies of infantry and cavalry, which could be seen from time to time moving in the direction of Hunter’s column and out of the range of ordinary guns. Using a high tree as an observatory, we could constantly see the operations of Hunter’s and Heintzelman’s column from the time they crossed Bull Bun, and through one of my staff, Lieutenant O’Borke, of the Engineers, I was promptly notified as to any change in the progress of their columns up to the time when it appeared that the heads of both were arrested, and the enemy seemed to be moving heavy re-enforcements to support their troops.
At this time I ordered Colonel Sherman, with his brigade, to cross Bull Bun and to support the two columns already in action. Colonel Sherman, as appears by his report, crossed the run without opposition, and after encountering a party of the enemy hying before Hunter’s forces, found General McDowell, and received his orders to join in the pursuit. The subsequent operations of this brigade and its able commander having been under your own eye and direction, I shall not follow its movements any further, but refer you to Colonel Sherman’s report, which you will find herewith.
So soon as it was discovered that Hunter’s division had been arrested, I ordered up Keyes’ brigade, which arrived just as the left of Sherman’s was crossing the run, and having satisfied myself that the enemy had not the force nor the purpose to cross Bull Bun, I ordered Keyes’ brigade to follow Sherman, accompanying the movement in person, as I saw it must necessarily place me on the left of our line and in the best possible position, when we should have driven the enemy off, to join Schenck’s brigade and the two batteries left on the opposite side.
I ordered Colonel Keyes to incline the head of his column a little to the right of the line of march taken by Sherman’s brigade, to avoid the fire of a battery which the enemy had opened. This movement sheltered the men to a considerable degree, and resulted in closing on the rear of Sherman’s brigade, and on reaching the high ground I ordered Colonel Keyes to form into line on the left of Sherman’s brigade, which was done with great steadiness and regularity. After waiting a few moments the line was ordered to advance, and came into conflict on its right with the enemy’s cavalry and infantry, which, after some severe struggles, it drove back until the further march of the brigade was arrested by a severe fire of artillery and infantry, sheltered by some buildings standing on the heights above the road leading to Bull Bun. The charge was here ordered, and the Second Maine and Third Connecticut Begiments, which were opposed to this part of the enemy’s line, pressed forward to the top of the hill until they reached the buildings which were held by the enemy, drove them out, and for a moment had them in possession. At this point, finding the brigade under the fire of a strong force behind breastworks, the order was given to march by the left flank across an open field until the whole line was sheltered by the right bank of Bull Bun, along which the march was conducted, with a view to turn the battery which the enemy had placed on the hill below the point at which the Warrenton turnpike crosses Bull Bun. The march was conducted for a considerable distance below the stone bridge, causing the enemy to retire, and gave

Captain Alexander an opportunity to pass the bridge, cut out the abatis which had been placed there, and prepared the way for Schenck’s brigade and the two batteries of artillery to pass over.
Before the contemplated movement could be made on the enemy’s battery it was removed, and placed in a position to threaten our line; but before the correct range could be obtained, Colonel Keyes carried his brigade by a flank movement around the base of the hill, and was on the point of ascending it in line to get at the battery, when I discovered that our troops were on the retreat, and that unless a rapid movement to the rear was made we should be cut off, and through my aide, Lieutenant Upton, Colonel Keyes was ordered to file to the right, and join the retreating column. The order was executed without the least confusion, and the brigade joined the retreating column in good order. When this junction was made I left Keyes’ brigade, and rode forward to ascertain the condition of Schenck’s brigade and the artillery left this side of Bull Run, and, on arriving there, found Ayres’ battery and Lieutenant Hains’ 30-pounder waiting orders. I immediately ordered Lieutenant Hains to limber up and move forward as soon as possible. This was promptly done, and the piece moved on towards Centreville. I then went into the wood where the ammunition wagon of this piece had been placed, out of reach of fire, and found that the driver had deserted and taken away part of the horses, which made it impossible to move it. I then returned to Ayres’ battery, which I found limbered up, and ordered it to move forward and cover the retreat, which was promptly done by its gallant officers, and when the cavalry charge was made, shortly afterward, they repulsed it promptly and effectively. I then collected a guard, mainly from the Second Maine Regiment, and put it under the command of Colonel Jameson, with orders to sustain Captain Ayres during the retreat, which was done gallantly and successfully until the battery reached Centreville.
Before ordering Colonel Jameson to cover Ayres’ battery, I passed to the rear to find General Scheuck’s brigade, intending, as it was fresh, to have it cover the retreat. I did not find it in the position in which I had left it, and supposed it had moved forward and joined the retreating column. I did not see General Schenck again until near Cub Run, where he appeared active in rallying his own or some other regiments. General Schenck reports that the two Ohio regiments left Bull Run after the cavalry charge, and arrived at Centreville in good order.
In closing this report, it gives me great pleasure to express my admiration of the manner in which Colonel Keyes handled his brigade, completely covering it by every possible accident of the ground while changing his positions, and leading it bravely and skillfully to the attack at the right moment; to which the brigade responded in every instance in a manner highly creditable to itself and satisfactory to its commanding officers. At no time during the conflict was this brigade disorganized, and it was the last off the field, and in good order.
Colonel Keyes says: “ The gallantry with which the Second Maine and Third Connecticut Regiments charged up the hill upon the enemy’s artillery and infantry was never, in my opinion, surpassed, and the conduct of Colonels Jameson and Chatfield, in this instance and throughout the day, merits the highest commendation. Colonel Terry rendered great assistance by his gallantry and excellent conduct. Lieutenant Hascall, acting assistant adjutant-general, Lieutenants Walter and Ely, rendered gallant and effective assistance.” It gives me pleasure to be able to confirm the above from personal observation, and to express my personal satisfaction with the conduct of this brigade.

ticulars as to gallant conduct of individuals, I beg leave to refer you to the reports of commanders of brigades, hereunto attached. Colonel Sherman speaks highly of Colonel Coon, of Wisconsin, and Lieutenants Piper and McQuesten, all on his personal staff.

Notes on original return:
* “Eighteen others slightly.”
t Colonel Tompkins reports 140 others missing, without giving names. As this regiment did not cross Bull Bun, they must have been accurately informed as to their killed and wounded. This, taken in connection with the fact that, three of the officers are reported as deserters, known to he in New York City, leads to the belief that, their officers having set the example, the men were not slow to follow it. XThis number reported as “killed and missing.”

its subsequent movements be noticed up to the time the different brigades reached a stopping place. On reaching Centreville, we found Richardson’s brigade in line, ready to support us or cover the retreat. This brigade returned in good order to Arlington. After the order was given to retreat, and each brigade was ordered a to proceed to the position from which it started and by the route by which it arrived,” I communicated this order to the commander of each brigade, and with Keyes* brigade proceeded at once to Falls Church, intending to secure the camp equipage of the four regiments left standing there, which I knew, if we fell back on the fortifications in front of Washington, the enemy would at once seize.
Colonel Keyes, with the three Connecticut regiments, arrived at Falls Churcb about 5 a. m. on the 22d instant, and proceeded at once to strike their tents and those of the Maine regiment, and sent them to Fort Corcoran. This work, without rations, was continued throughout the entire day, the men being exposed to a severe storm of rain. By night the entire camp equipage was safely removed. Colonel Keyes then fell back to the camp of Schenck’s brigade, which had been entirely deserted, and after using those tents for the night struck them the next morning, and sent the entire Government property to Fort Corcoran and Alexandria, and at 7 p. m. on Tuesday I saw the three Connecticut regiments, with 2,000 bayonets, march under the guns of Fort Corcoran in good order, after having saved us not only a large amount of public property, but the mortification of having our standing camps fall into the hands of the enemy. I know, general, that you will appreciate this service on the part of a portion of my division and give credit to whom credit is due. All the brigades, except Schenck’s, obeyed the order to retire to their original positions. By some misunderstanding, which has not been satisfactorily explained, this brigade proceeded directly to Washington, one regiment, as I understand, passing through the camp they left on the 16th instant.

General: I inclose herewith the originals of Carlisle’s and Ayres7 reports of the operations of their respective batteries on the 21st instant [Nos. 20 and 27]. As these reports are full, you will see whether they do not require more consideration than they have received in my report. All the officers attached to these batteries, so far as their conduct fell under my personal observation until 12 o’clock, behaved like gallant gentlemen, and it was, in my opinion, the effect of their fire that held the enemy in front of the bridge in check and interfered seriously with the movements of his column in the direction of Colonel Hunter’s attack. The loss of Captain Carlisle’s battery is.to be attributed to the want of that infantry support which he had a right to expect, or to his halting too long before he moved forward towards Centreville.

THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.

No. 17.
Report of Col. Erasmus D. Keyes, Eleventh U. S. Infantry, commanding First Brigade, First JJivision.
Headquarters First Brigade, First Division,
Camp on Meridian Hill, Washington, July 25, 1861.
Sir : In compliance with the orders of Brigadier-General Tyler, I have the honor to report the operations of the First Brigade, First Division, in the action of the 21st instant, at Bull Bun, and during the two succeeding days.
Leaving my camp near Centreville at 2 o’clock a. m. I took my place in the First Division as a reserve. At 9.15 o’clock a. m., at the distance of half a mile from Bull Bun, I was ordered by General Tyler to incline the head of my column to the right, and direct it through an open field to a ford about 800 yards above the stone bridge. Before the whole brigade had entered upon the new direction the enemy opened fire from a battery across the run, and threw upon the First and Second Begi-ments Connecticut Volunteers some twenty-five or thirty rounds of shot and shell, which caused a temporary confusion and wounded several men. Order was shortly restored, and the brigade closed up on Sherman’s column before passing the ford.
After crossing, I marched at once to the high ground, and, by order of General Tyler, came into line on Sherman’s left. The order to advance in line of battle was given at about 10 o’clock a. m., and from that hour until 4 p. m. my brigade was in constant activity on the field of battle. The First Begiment Connecticut Volunteers was met by a body of cavalry and infantry, which it repelled, and at several other encounters of different parts of the line the enemy constantly retired before us. At about 2 o’clock p. m. General Tyler ordered me to take a battery on a height in front. The battery was strongly posted, and supported by infantry and riflemen, sheltered by a building, a fence, and a hedge. My order to charge was obeyed with the utmost promptness. Colonel Jameson, of the Second Maine, and Colonel Chatfield, Third Connecticut Volunteers, pressed forward their regiments up the bare slope about one hundred yards, when I ordered them to lie down at a point offering a slight protection and load. I then ordered them to advance again, which they did, in the face of a movable battery of eight pieces and a large body of infantry, towards the top of a hill. As we moved forward we came under the fire of other large bodies of the enemy, posted behind breastworks, and on reaching the summit of the hill the fire became so hot that an exx>osure to it of five minutes would have annihilated my whole line. As the enemy had withdrawn to a height beyond, and to the support of additional troops, I ordered the Maine regiment to face by the left flank and move to a wooded slope across an open field, to which point I followed them. The balance of the brigade soon rejoined me, and after a few moments’ rest I again put it in motion and moved forward to find another opportunity to charge.
The enemy had a light battery, which he maneuvered with extraordinary skill, and his shot fell often among and near us. I advanced generally just under the brow of the hills, by a flank movement, until I found myself about half a mile below the stone bridge. Our advance caused the Confederates to retire from the abatis, and enabled Captain Alexander, of the Engineers, to clear it away. In a short time the enemy moved his battery to a point which enabled him to enfilade my 23 R R—VOL II

whole line; but as he pointed his guns too far to the right, and only improved his aim gradually, I had time to withdraw my brigade by a flank movement around the base of a hill in time to avoid a raking fire.
At this time a lull in the discharges of our artillery, and an apparent change of position of the enemy’s left flank, made me apprehensive that all was not right. I continued my march, and sent my aide, Lieutenant Walter, to the rear to inquire of General McDowell how the day was going. The discontinuance of the firing in our lines becoming more and more apparent, I inclined to the right, and after marching six hundred or seven hundred yards farther, I was met by Lieutenant Upton, aide to General Tyler, and ordered to file to the right, as our troops were retreating. I moved on at an ordinary pace, and fell into the retiring current about one hundred and fifty yards in the rear of General McDowell and staff. Before crossing Bull Bun, and until my brigade mingled with the retreating mass, it maintained perfect freedom from panic, and at the moment I received the order to retreat, and for some time afterwards, it was in as good order as in the morning on the road. Half an hour earlier I supposed the victory to be ours.
The gallantry with which the Second Begiment of Maine Volunteers and the Third Begiment of Connecticut Volunteers charged up the hill upon the enemy’s artillery and infantry was never, in my opinion, surpassed. I was with the advancing line, and closely observed the conduct of Colonels Jameson and Chatfield, which merits in this instance, and throughout the day, the highest commendation.
I also observed throughout the day the gallantry and excellent conduct of Colonel Terry, Second Begiment Connecticut Volunteers, from whom I received most zealous assistance. At one time a portion of his regiment did great execution with their rifles from a point of our line which was thin, and where a few of our men were a little tardy in moving forward.
Colonel Terry, in his report, calls attention to the coolness, activity, and discretion of Lieutenant-Colonel Young and Major Colburn. The latter, with the adjutant of the regiment, Lieut. Charles L. Bussell, showed conspicuous gallantry in defending their regimental colors during the retreat, this side of Bull Bun, against a charge of cavalry. Colonel Terry also commends the devotion of Drs. Douglas and Bacon to the wounded while under the hottest fire of artillery. Private Arnold Leech is also highly praised for having spiked three abandoned guns with a ramrod and then bringing away two abandoned muskets.
Colonel Jameson, of the Second Maine Begiment, gives great credit in his report to Lieut. Col. C. W. Boberts, Maj. George Varney, and Adjutant Beynolds for their coolness and courage on the field. Sergeant G. W. Brown, of Company F; A. J. Knowles and Leonard Carver, of Company D; A. P. Jones and Henry W. Wheeler, Company A, and Peter Welch, Company I, he mentions for their noble conduct in accompanying him to remove the dead and wounded from the field under a very heavy fire of artillery and musketry. He mentions, also, Captain Foss, Sergeant Samuel Hinckley, of Company A, and Corporal Smart, Company H, for important extra services during the day. He also speaks in high praise of Sergeant W. J. Dean, who was mortally wounded while in the advance of the line, bearing the beautiful stand of colors which was presented the day before on the .part of ladies from Maine residing in San Francisco, Cal. Capt. E. N. Jones, of the same regiment, fell mortally wounded while exhibiting great courage in rallying his men to the charge.
Lieutenant-Colonel Speidel, of the First Begiment Connecticut Volunteers, was set upon by three of the enemy, who undertook to make

him a prisoner. The lieutenant-colonel killed one and drove off the other two of his assailants and escaped. I observed the activity of Captains Hawley and Chapman, Adjutant Bacon, and Lieutenant Drake on the field.
Colonel Chatfield, of the Third Regiment Connecticut Volunteers, gives special credit to Major Warner and Adjutant Duryee for their coolness and energy in assisting to keep the men in line and in urging them forward into action. The men of the Third Regiment brought off in the retreat two of our abandoned guns, one caisson, and several baggage wagons, and behaved with great coolness in the retreat, and the bulk of the regiment was present to repel the charge of cavalry this side of Bull Run.
I received during the day and on the retreat the most gallant and efficient assistance from Lieutenant Hascall, Fifth U. S. Artillery, A. A. adjutant-general; Lieutenant Walter, First Connecticut Volunteers; Lieutenant Gordon, Second U. S. Cavalry, aides, obeyed my orders on the field with alacrity; and Lieutenant Ely, First Connecticut Volunteers, brigade commissary, assisted me zealously. Lieutenants Walter and Gordon are both missing. The former I sent to the rear at about 4 p. m. to ascertain from General McDowell how the day was going, since which time I have not seen him nor do I know his fate. Lieutenant \ Gordon was with me two miles this side of Bull Run on the retreat, • where I saw him the last time. I trust he will yet be found. My two mounted orderlies, Cooper and Ballou, were both with me until near the end of the conflict, and are both missing. My brigade being far in advance, and the ground very hilly and interspersed with patches of woods, rendered it difficult to avoid being enveloped by the enemy. The last individuals probably missed their way and were killed or captured.
I have delayed this report of the action until all the wanderers could be gathered in, and the following may therefore be taken as a very close approximation to the actual casualties in my brigade. Those reported missing are supposed to be killed or taken prisoners.*
In addition to the reported loss of the Second Maine Regiment, Lieutenant Skinner, Surgeon Allen and his son, while assisting the wounded, were taken prisoners. The aggregate loss of this gallant regiment was therefore 174 out of 640, which was the complete strength on going into action.
It was impossible to obtain exact returns of my brigade on the morning of the 2.1st, but I am certain its aggregate strength was about 2,500 men. We captured fifteen of the enemy and brought six prisoners to Washington.
In concluding the account of the battle, I am happy to be able to add li that the conduct of the First Brigade, First Division, was generally ex- - ’ cellent. The troops composing it need only instruction to make them as good as any in the world.
I take the liberty to add, in continuation of this report, that the Third Connecticut Regiment and a part of the Second Maine Volunteers, of my brigade, left their camps near Centreville at about 10 o’clock a. m. by order of General Tyler, and arrived at Camp McDowell, six and a half miles from the Potomac, at dawn of day the morning after the battle. The camps of my four regiments and that of one company of cavalry were standing, and during the day I learned that the Ohio camp, a mile and a quarter this way, was vacant of troops, and the camp of

the New York Second had only a guard of fifty or sixty men left in it. Not wishing the enemy to get possession of so many standing tents and such an abundance of camp equipage, I ordered my brigade to retreat no farther until all the public property should be removed.
The rain fell in torrents all day the 22d. The men were excessively fatigued, and we had only eleven wagons. Brigade Quartermaster Hodge made two journeys to the city to obtain transportation, but with four or five exceptions the drivers refused to come out. Our eleven wagons were kept in motion, and at nightfall the troops were drenched to the skin and without shelter. So, leaving guards at the regimental camps of my brigade, I moved forward with the bulk of the Third Connecticut Regiment, and by 11 o’clock at night the majority were housed in the Ohio and New York camps.
We kept good watch through the night, and early in the morning of the 23d instant Quartermaster-General Meigs sent out long trains of wagons, and Brigade Quartermaster Hodge walked six miles to Alexandria and brought up a train of cars, and the work of removal proceeded with vigor. As early as 5.30 o’clock p. m. the last thing of value had been removed and sent forward, to the amount of 175 four-horse wagon loads. The order to fall in was then given, and the brigade marched in perfect order, every man with his firelock, and at sunset bivouacked near Fort Corcoran.
I acknowledge great indebtedness to Brigade Quartermaster Hodge. But for his untiring exertions in procuring the means of transportation nearly all the public property must have been abandoned. The men of the different regiments labored with extraordinary zeal, considering their great fatigue, and they merit the highest praise. I had given permission to about one hundred sick and lame to limp forward in advance, and about an equal number of cowards and recreants had fled without permission. The balance of my brigade, faithful and laborious, stood by, and they may claim the right to teach that it is unmanly to destroy the public property, and base to abandon it to the enemy, except in cases of the extremest necessity.
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,

Lieut. John Skinner, Company C, was taken prisoner while assisting Captain Jones to the hospital. Surgeon Allen remained in care of the wounded, and was also taken, together with his son. Chaplain J.

for with few exceptions they obeyed every order promptly, and maintained their position under a most severe fire of artillery and small-arms until ordered to fall back.
Great credit is due Lieut. Col. C. W. Boberts, Maj. George Varney, and Adjutant Keynolds for their coolness and courage on the field under the heavy fire that was thinning our ranks.
Capt. E. N. Jones fell mortally wounded w hile exhibiting great courage in rallying his men to the charge. Sergeant William J.

Report of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Sclienck, U. S. Army, commanding Second Brigade, First Division.
2b Brig., 1st Div., Dep’t Northeastern Virginia,
July 23, 1861.
General : I have the honor to submit this report of the movements and service of my brigade in the battle of Bull Bun, on the Gainesville road, on the 21st instant:
Leaving my camp, one mile south of Centreville, at 2.30 a. m. of that day, I marched at the head of your division, as ordered, with my command in column, in the following order: The First Begiment of Ohio Volunteers, Colonel McCook; the Second Ohio, Lieutenant Colonel Mason; the Second New York State Militia, Colonel Tompkins, and Captain Carlisle’s battery of light artillery, six brass guns. To Captain Carlisle’s command was also attached the large Parrott gun (30-pounder), under direction of Lieutenant Haius, of the Artillery Corps.
Proceeding slowly and carefully, preceded by five companies of skirmishers of the First and Second Ohio, which I threw out on either side of the road, we approached the bridge over Bull Bun, beyond which the rebels were understood to be posted and intrenched, and to within a distance, perhaps, of three-fourths of a mile of their batteries on the other side of the stream. In obedience to your command, on first discovery of the presence of the enemy’s infantry forming into line on the hill-side beyond the Bun, I deployed my three regiments of infantry to the left of the road, and formed them in line of battle in front of his right. Thus my command was constituted—the left wing of our division, Colonel Sherman’s brigade, coming up and taking position to the right of the road.

[Chap. IX.
After the fire had been opened by discharge of the large Parrott gun from the center in the direction of the enemy’s work, I moved my extended line gradually forward at intervals, taking advantage of the ground, until I had my force sheltered partly in a hollow, covered by a ridge and wood in front, and partly by the edge of the timber lying between us and the run. Here we lay, in pursuance of your orders, for, perhaps, two and a half or three hours, with no evidence of our nearness to the enemy except the occasional firing of musketry by our skirmishers in the wood in front, answered by the muskets or rifles of the enemy, to whom our presence and position were thus indicated, with a view to distract his attention from the approach of Colonel Hunter’s force from above and in his rear. At this time I received your notice and order announcing that Hunter was heard from, that he had crossed, and was coming down about two miles above us, and directing that if I saw any signs of a stampede of the enemy in front I should make a dash with the two Ohio regiments, keeping the New York regiment in reserve. For this movement I immediately formed and prepared. Soon after, and when, by the firing of artillery and musketry in front at the right, it appeared that the rebels were actively engaged in their position by our forces on the other side of the stream, I received your order to extend my line still farther to the left, sending forward Colonel McCook’s regiment to feel the battery of the enemy, which was ascertained to be on the hill covering the ford, half a mile below the bridge, and supporting him with my two other regiments. This was immediately done. Colonel McCook advanced in that direction along the road, which we found to be a narrow track through a pine wood, thick and close with undergrowth, and flanked on either side by ambuscades of brush-work, which were now, however, abandoned. Reaching the head of this narrow road where it opened upon the stream, Colonel McCook found the battery to be a strong earthwork immediately opposite, mounted with at least four heavy guns, and commanding the outlet from the wood. An open space of hollow ground lay between, with a corn-field to the left, the direct distance across to the enemy’s battery being about three hundred and fifty yards. Behind this battery, and supporting it, were discovered some four regiments of the rebel troops, while rifle-pits were seen directly in front of it. The First Regiment was then deployed to the left in the edge of the woods and into the corn-field, one company (Captain Kell’s) being thrown forward towards the run up to within perhaps twenty yards of the battery.
While this was done I advanced the Second Ohio, followed by the Second New York, toward the head of the road, in supporting distance from the First Ohio, Lieutenant-Colonel Mason’s regiment filing also to the left. Receiving Colonel McCook’s report of the battery, and that it would be impossible to turn it with any force we had, I immediately dispatched a message to the center to bring up some pieces of artillery, to engage the enemy from the head of the road. In the mean time the enemy, discovering our presence and position in the woods, and evidently having the exact range of the road we were occupying, opened on us with a heavy fire of shells and round and grape shot. To avoid the effect of this as much as possible, I ordered the men to fall back into the woods on each side of the road, and was presently re-enforced by two guns of Ayres’ battery, under Lieutenant Ransom, which passed to the head of the road. A brisk cannonading was then opened, but a very unequal one, on account of the superior force and metal of the enemy. While this continued, I left my horse and passed through the woods, and remained some time by our guns, to be satisfied whether we

were making any impression on the enemy’s work. I soon found that it was not thus to be carried, and such also was the opinion of the officer in charge of the guns. Retiring, I tound that the most of my two regiments in the rear had*fallen back out of range of the hot and constant lire of the enemy’s cannon, against which they had nothing to oppose. The suffering from this fire was principally with the Second New York, as they were in the line where most of the shell and shots fell that passed over the heads of the Second Ohio.
Taking with me two companies of the Second Ohio, which were yet in the woods maintaining their jmsition, I returned to cover, and brought away Ransom’s guns. It was just at this place and point of time that you visited yourself the position we were leaving. I must not omit to speak with commendation of the admirable manner in which these guns of ours were handled and served by the officers and men having them in charge; and I may notice the fact also that, as we were withdrawing from this point, we saw another heavy train of the enemy’s guns arrive and move up the stream on the other side of their battery with which we had been engaged along what we supposed to be the road from Manassas towards where the battle was raging with our troops on the right.
My three regiments being all called in, then returned and rested in good order at the center of the front, near the turnpike. Here I was informed by Colonel McCook that you had crossed the run above with other portions of our division, and left with him an order for me to remain with my infantry in that position supporting Carlisle’s battery, which was posted close to the road on the right. This was about 1 o’clock p. m. Captain Carlisle, while we thus rested, was playing with much apparent effect upon the enemy’s works across the run with his two rifled pieces, as was also Lieutenant Hains with the large Parrott gun. Soon after, having successive and cheering reports, confirmed by what we could observe, of the success of our Army on the other side of the run, I discovered that bodies of the enemy were in motion, probably retreating to their right. To scatter these and hasten their flight I ordered into the road toward the bridge the two rifled guns, and had several rounds fired, with manifest severe effect. This, however, drew from the enemy’s batteries again a warm and quick fire of shell and with rifled cannon on our position in the road, which continued afterwards and with little intermission, with loss of some lives again in my New York regiment, until the close of the fight.
While this was going on, Captain Alexander, of the Engineer Corps, brought up the company of pioneers and axmen, which, with its officers and sixty men, had been entirely detailed from the regiments of my brigade, to open a communication over the bridge and through the heavy abatis which obstructed the passage of troops on our front beyond the run. To support him while thus engaged, I brought and placed on the road towards the bridge McCook’s and Tompkins’ regiments, detailing also and sending forward to the bridge a company of the Second New Yorkers, to cover the rear while cutting through the enemy’s abatis. A second company from Lieutenant-Colonel Mason’s command was also brought forward with axes afterwards, to aid in clearing the obstructions, and thus in a short time Captain Alexander succeeded in opening a passage.
Captain Carlisle’s battery was now posted on the hill side in the open field to the left of the road toward the bridge. Very soon after, some reverse of fortune appearing to have taken place with our troops on the other side, who were falling back up the run, it was discovered and reported to me that a large body of the enemy had passed over the stream

﻿360	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. LChap. IX.
below the bridge, and were advancing through a wood in the low grounds at our left, with an evident purpose to flank us. To intercept this movement, I ordered forward into the road still lower down two of Carlisle’s brass howitzers, a few rounds from which, quickly served, drove the rebels from the wood and back to the other side of the stream. It was not long after this that the unpleasant intelligence came of our Army being in retreat from the front across the ford above, and the order was given to fall back on Centreville. The retreat of my brigade, being now in the rear of our division, was conducted in the reverse order of our march in the morning, the Second New York moving first, and being followed by the Second Ohio and First Ohio, the two latter regiments preserving their lines in good degree, rallying together and arriving at Centreville with closed ranks, and sharing comparatively little in the panic which characterized so painfully that retreat, and which seemed to me to be occasioned more by the fears of frightened teamsters, and of hurrying and excited civilians (who ought never to have been there), than even by the needless disorder and want of discipline of straggling soldiers.
Near the house which was occupied as a hospital for the wounded, about a mile from the battle-ground, a dashing charge was made upon the retreating column by a body of secession cavalry, which was gallantly repelled, and principally by two companies of the Second Ohio, with loss on both sides. Here also, in this attack, occurred some of the casualties to the Second New York Eegiment. From this point to Centreville a portion of the First Ohio was detailed, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Parrott, and acted efficiently as a rear guard, covering the retreat.
Arrived at Centreville, I halted the two Ohio regiments on the hill, and proceeded to call on General McDowell, whom I found engaged in forming the reserve of the Army and other troops in line of battle to meet an expected attack that night of the enemy at that point. I offered him our services, premising, however, that unfed and weary troops, who had been seventeen hours on the march and battle-field, might not be very effective, unless it were to be posted as a reserve in case of later emergency. General McDowell directed me to take them to the foot of the hill, there to stop and encamp. This I did, establishing the two regiments together in the wood to the west of the turnpike. Alter resting here about two hours, I was notified tl^at your division, with the rest of the forces under the general commanding, were leaving Centreville, and received your order to fall back on Washington. I took the route by Fairfax Court-House, and thence across to Vienna, arriving at the latter place at 3.30 a. m. of the 22d, and there resting the troops for two hours in an open field. During the march we did what was possible to cover the rear of the scattered column then on the road.
Two miles, or less, this side of Vienna, Colonel McCook, with the main body of his regiment, turned upon the road leading to the Chain Bridge over the Potomac, thinking it might be a better way, and at the same time afford by the presence of a large and organized body protection to any stragglers that might have taken that route. Lieutenaut-Colonel Mason, with the Second Ohio, marched in by the way of Falls Church and Camp Dpton.
The return of the Ohio regiments to Washington was made necessary by the fact that, their term of service having expired, they are at once to be sent home to be mustered out of service.
Not having been able to obtain yet complete or satisfactory returns

During the day we were under a most severe fire from the enemy’s batteries, and succeeded in completely silencing one of them, composed of six pieces. The sections of my battery acting separately during a great part of the day, the separate reports of the officers commanding these sections are herewith respectfully submitted. Throughout the entire day the officers and men under my command behaved in the most creditable manner. Lieutenant Wilson, Second Artillery, with the rifled guns, was frequently detached,

Report of Lieut. John M. Wilson, Second U. S. Artillery.
Fort Corcoran, Va., July 24,1861. 4
Sir: In obedience to your order, I beg leave to make the following report of our attack and retreat at the battle of Bull Eun:
By order of General Schenck, we prepared to move forw ard at exactly 2 a. m. Sunday, July 21, but owing to the infantry not being ready, our departure was delayed nearly an hour. Our brigade led off, our position being just behind the New York Second Eegiment, who were preceded by the Ohio First and Second.
We moved forward slowly, experiencing little difficulty, except at the bridge across a small brook, the ford of the brook being obstructed by fallen trees. The difficulty arose from the weakness of the bridge, we fearing it would break under the weight of the 30-pounder gun. We passed over, however, without accident, and moved forward on the road, the troops taking position in line of battle, skirmishers in front.
At 5 a. m. exactly the first gun was fired by Captain Carlisle, who fired three times from the 30-pounder rifled gun without eliciting any reply from the enemy, who could be seen in crowds in the adjacent woods. Our battery then moved forward, and by order took up position on the brow of a small hill, facing down a ravine, with heavy woods immediately in rear of us. At the suggestion of Major Barry, of the artillery, I opened fire from my rifle section upon the enemy, immediately in rear of an abatis a short distance off, and dislodged them at the first fire; this was about 8.30 a. in. Colonel Hunter’s column having moved to the right to go over Bull Eun, the enemy advanced out to meet them, w hen I again opened from my rifle guns, with what execution I could not tell. The firing on the right soon after became very severe. A regiment now attempted to cross Bull Eun, when a battery behind a hill in front of us opened upon them, and they fell before it, breaking rapidly.
Our battery now opened upon the enemy in the most gallant style, firing with the greatest rapidity shot, shell, spherical case, and canister, and silenced their battery in a short time, we being under a very severe fire of solid shot and Hotchkiss shell. On inspecting their position afterwards it was found that they had been literally cut to pieces.
We then opened on a battery much farther off, and with the 30-pounder gun (rifled), and were replied to with such accuracy as to take off half the splinter-bar of the limber, and some of the shell which fell among us proved to be from the Parrott gun. A short time before this our infantry support was withdrawn, and we were left entirely alone. Soon after, we were ordered from this position, and I moved forward alone with my section to cover the position where a bridge was to be thrown

363
over Bull Rub, we being supported by the First Ohio Regiment and some other. By order of the commanding general of the brigade, I took position in an open road, and fired at a house and into the woods. A battery, which could not be seen, now opened upon us with remarkable precision. I continued to fire for some time, until I was ordered to move farther down towards the run. I limbered up, and was about to move off, when vast columns of the enemy were seen coming over the hill, and though evidently beyond the range of my guns I fired at them by order of the commanding general of the brigade, again coming into battery, still being under a severe fire from the battery which we could not see.
In a few moments, having run out of ammunition, with the exception of one shell for each gun, I retired, by order of Colonel McCook, and took position with the rest of the battery, under Captain Carlisle, on the brow of a hill about one hundred yards from the position I then occupied. Here again we were under fire from some unseen source, and the shot and shell rained in among us. Our battery then again opened, the section under Lieutenant Fuller having been operating upon the enemy while Lieutenant Lyford and myself were absent with our sections. Lieutenant Lyford had moved just to my front and left, by order, and was also under a galling fire. On his return, we limbered up and moved slowly off to the road for a new position. We halted in the road, and a few moments after, by order of Captain Carlisle, I moved forward to get a proper position.
Just as I started, an orderly brought me an order from the commanding general of the brigade to halt. I halted, but soon after Captain Carlisle, by order, ordered us forward again, but it wras too late. We were charged by cavalry in a road where we could not come into action—woods on each side of us and we in column. The infantry fell back precipitately in the woods. We moved forward at a gallop. Our men were shot down and sabered. The wheels broke down in all the pieces and caissons of my section. I halted to see if they could be fixed, amidst a perfect shower of pistol bullets, but finding they could not be, moved forward with the pieces on a jump without wheels until every trace broke. The men behaved gallantly and the non commissioned officers with great coolness and bravery. I halted at Centreville, where an attempt was made to make a stand, but soon after moved on with dispatches from Colonel Sherman to Fairfax Court-House, arriving there about dark, and telegraphing the dispatch to Washington. With what men I could gather, and as many horses as I could get, I moved on the following day to Fort Corcoran, where my company is now being reorganized. Our loss is still unknown, as the horses and men are constantly coming in.

Being attached to General Sclienck’s brigade, we joined the division

﻿364	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
under the command of General Tyler, and at about 2 o’clock in the morning of July 21, our brigade leading the column, our battery was preceded by the First and Second Ohio Volunteers and the Second Nfew York Volunteers in the above-mentioned order. We arrived in view of the enemy’s position about 5 a. m., and immediately opened lire with the 30-pounder rifled gun attached to our battery, under the immediate command of Lieutenant Hains, U. S. Army. This fire not being responded to, it was soon discontinued, and our brigade was ordered to take up a position in order of battle to the right and left of the main road, our battery being placed in the skirts of the woods on the right, with a hill immediately in our rear. The ground in front was entirely open, extending to the creek, on the farther side of which the enemy had constructed an abatis. Three regiments of volunteers were placed near us to support our battery. We then a waited the advance of the columns under Colonels Hunter and Heintzelman, who were to attack the enemy in flank. These troops advanced into position about 9 a. m., and immediately opened the attack, which was continued with great warmth on both sides. Several regiments from General Tyler’s division being ordered to cross the creek to their support, one of these regiments attempted to cross the open ground in front of our division, when a battery of the enemy opened lire upon them. This regiment was instantly dispersed in all directions. We replied to this fire so successfully that in a short time the battery was completely silenced, and, from the accounts of persons who afterwards visited their position, we found that only some ten or twelve of their men remained unhurt.
The section under my command, being composed of one 6-pounder gun and one 12-pounder howitzer, made use of shell, spherical case, and solid shot, ending with a few rounds of canister. Our supports in the mean time had disappeared, and from this time no regular support was sent to us. Without using our field guns for some time we continued the fire with the 30-pounder at intervals. In the afternoon, probably about 2 o’clock, we were ordered to a new position to counterbatter the enemy’s batteries, which were at such a distance that they could not be reached by our guns. We were here exposed to a most galling fire without being able to reply with success. The section commanded by Lieutenant Wilson having been ordered to a new position, and being actively engaged, I was ordered to place my section in a position to be designated by a captain of the Massachusetts volunteers, where, according to his statement, the ranks of the enemy could be much damaged by my fire. Upon advancing down the road for a quarter of a mile, under the fire of two of the enemy’s batteries, this place was pointed out by the captain, but not liking the position, I considered it advisable to halt my section, and proceed alone to examine the ground. On examination, I found that I should be directly under the fire of two batteries, without any support, and where, to obtain an elevation necessary to throw projectiles three hundred yards, it would be necessary to sink the trails of our carriages in the ground. In addition to this, there was nothing to use artillery against, and no troops whatever to support us. Taking these circumstances into consideration, I did not think that I should be justified in placing my guns in such a position, and consequently returned to my starting point.
Shortly after this our battery moved to the rear into the woods, and there remained in the road, the battery being in column of pieces. We remained in this position for some little time, when an order was given to move still farther to the rear. On emerging from the woods, we encountered a charge of cavalry. When my section was made aware of

the enemy’s approach, the cavalry was not fifteen yards distant. The command u Gallop” was then given, and the rout was made in the greatest confusion. Previous to our encounter, several regiments had passed us at a run, completely routed, without our being aware that we had lost the day. Had there been any support for our battery, had one company of infantry stood fast, the cavalry could easily have been repulsed, and the shameful consequences avoided. Our battery moving at a gallop, the carriages one by one broke down, and the pieces one by one were scattered along the road. I rode with my section till I saw that all was lost, and, after receiving a ball in my horse’s neck, I continued on in your company to Centreville. From Oentreville I rode with dispatches to General Scott, and arrived at Fort Corcoran at daylight on Monday morning. After partaking of refreshments, I rode back to Vienna, to pick up the stragglers belonging to our company. Throughout the day the non-commissioned officers and privates of my command behaved with the utmost coolness and gallantry.
I am, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,

Report of Lieut. Edward B. Hill, First U. S. Artillery.
July 26,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on Sunday, the 2ist day of July, at 2.30 a. m., we left our camp at Centreville to proceed to Bull Run. At 5 o’clock we opened the action by firing the heavy rifled gun attached to our battery, eliciting no response. We then moved forward to the foot of* the hill, and took a position in the woods on the right. A battery of the enemy presenting itself opposite us, doing much injury to one of our regiments, we opened upon it, and after an hour’s sharp firing completely destroyed it. We then used the heavy rifled gun with great advantage. In the afternoon we took a position on the left with Captain Ayres’ battery, but found it untenable on account of masked batteries of the enemy, the precise situation of which we could not ascertain. We then moved up the hill and halted. The enemy fired shell into this jiosition, and we were ordered to go farther on. We then halted for a few moments, and soon after moved on over the hill. I was detained in the rear of the battery attending to one of the caissons which had lost a wheel. In the mean time Captain Ayres’ battery passed by me, so as to come between myself and our battery in front.
When I was ready to move on, I found Captain Ayres’ battery preparing for action at the brow of the hill. 1 then learned that our battery had been attacked by a body of secession cavalry, and all cut to pieces. Captain Ayres then advised me to attach my caisson, battery-wagon, and forge to his battery, and that I should go on and try to discover what had become of our own. On riding ahead I found a complete scene of destruction ,* wheels, limber-boxes, guns, caissons, dead and wounded men and horses were scattered all along the road. I was enabled, however, to find two pieces which I could bring along, and two men, Corporal Callaghan and Private Whitenech. I applied

to the division commander for a detail of men to assist in bringing oft these pieces, which he seemed indisposed to grant. Captain Ayres, on my applying to him, furnished me with men to act as teamsters, and placed my two pieces in his battery.
We thus arrived at the foot of the hill, when the enemy opened a fire of musketry upon us, which created the utmost confusion in our already retreating column. My men were obliged to leave the battery -wagon, forge, and caisson. At Centreville the retreating column made a stand, and I reported myself to Major Barry, chief of artillery, who attached me to Lieut. O. D. Greene’s battery at my request. My two pieces were then placed in position with the rest of the artillery to resist an attack. Colonel Jackson, of the New York Eighteenth Regiment, most kindly lent me a number of men to aid me as teamsters in place of those of Captain Ayres, whom I returned. We soon after received an order to retreat to Fairfax. Owing to the inexjierience of my men I did not get my horses harnessed in time, and consequently when I started was nearly half a mile in rear of the whole retreating column. I finally caught up to Major Hunt’s battery, and was advised by him to push ahead, which I did. At Fairfax I received an order to proceed immediately to Washington. I reached Fort Albany, opposite Washington, at 11 o’clock Monday morning, July 22, where Lieutenant Cook, of the Twenty-fifth Regiment, kindly received me, and gave me all that was necessary to restore me after the fatigues of the march.
I feel particularly indebted to Captain Ayres and to the officers of his battery—Lieutenant Greene, Colonel Jackson, and Major Hunt—for their valuable aid through the difficulties and embarrassments of the retreat from Bull Run to Washington.
I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,

Report of Lieut. William D. Fuller, Third U. S. Artillery.
Fort Corcoran, Va., July 24,1861.
Sir : In obedience to your order, I beg leave to make the following report of the battle of Bull Run :
Leaving our camp near Centreville about 2.30 a. m. Sunday, the battery marched in rear of General Schenck’s brigade, immediately preceded by a 30-pounder rifled gun of Parrott’s make. The brigade, feeling its way, with skirmishers and flankers thrown out, arrived about 6 a. m. within two miles of Bull Run, across which the enemy were understood to be in position. At this point the road descends rapidly for three-quarters of a mile towards Bull Run. The 30-pounder rifled gun was placed in position in the road three-fourths of the way from the top to the foot of the hill, and fired tw ice at the supposed position of the enemy, without any effect of importance. Our battery having gone to the loot of the hill, almost down to the run, was countermarcbed, and formed into park on the top of the hill, behind and under cover of the woods.
Soon after, the battery was ordered and proceeded at once down the road, turned to the right near the foot of the hill, and came in battery

in tlie edge of the wood. A party of the enemy having been observed to enter an abatis near the bridge, and just across Bull Run, Lieutenant Wilson fired two percussion shells from his rifled section, the first of which struck and burst in the abatis, scattering the enemy from it in. all directions. More shots were fired from the 30-pounder rifled gun, and it was afterwards brought from the road and placed immediately on our right. The movements of the enemy were now and during the whole day studiously concealed under cover of woods or undulations of the ground.
At about 8.30 the column of Colonel Hunter was seen approaching across Bull Bun and on our right. A movement of the troops of our division now began towards the right, and with the intention of cross* ing Bull Bun. One of these regiments attempted to cut diagonally over the open field in front of our battery. When half way across, a light battery of six guns of the enemy galloped down, came in battery just across the run, and opened a rapid and unexpected fire of canister on this regiment which was marching by the right flank, and scattered it in confusion.
Captain Carlisle at once ordered the battery to open a fire of spherical case and shell on the enemy’s pieces, wdiich at once ceased firing at our volunteer regiment, and began a rapid fire of shell and solid shot on us. After fifteen minutes of rapid firing on our part the fire of the enemy’s battery slackened. We then fired solid shot, and ended with a round of canister, the enemy having ceased firing, and retreated with heavy loss in men and horses, as we afterwards learned. My section consisted of a 6-pounder smooth-bore gun and a 12-pounder howitzer. But for the hot fire from our battery, under the direction of Captain Carlisle, the regiment which was within canister range of the enemy’s battery must have been cut to pieces. The timely diversion caused by the fire of our battery only saved them. A deliberate fire from the 30-pounder rifled gun was kept up with short intervals during the day, and evidently annoyed the enemy, who fired several rifled percussion shells at this piece with great precision.
Late in the afternoon the battery was directed to leave its position and go down near the bridge over Bull Bun. While down there, Lieutenant Wilson, with his rifled section, and Lieutenant Lyford, with his section, were ordered out to take a position in front nearer the run, and both of these officers were under a heavy fire of shot and shell from batteries they could not reach with their guns. During their absence, being in command of the center section, by order of Captain Carlisle, I fired several rounds of spherical case and canister into the woods occupied by the enemy’s troops. On the return of the other sections, the battery was drawn just back of the brow of a small hill, to be covered from a fire of Hotchkiss and Parrott shell thrown from masked batteries in position. A Parrott shell which had not exploded fell near me, and on examination proved to be of excellent make, and must, from j>ecu-liarities in its construction, have been made by machinery similar to that of Captain Parrott, at the Cold Spring Foundry at West Point. A number of volunteers were killed by these projectiles in my vicinity.
Our battery w as finally ordered up the hill a short distance to the rear, to place it and the troops under cover. Accurate information of our movements must have reached the enemy, as they changed the direction of their fire at once, and threw rifled projectiles all around us. After waiting in this road the battery was ordered up the hill, and directed to find a safe position just beyond it. Proceeding up the road in column of pieces, we were unexpectedly charged by cavalry, and from the

position we could not come into action. Our cannoneers and drivers were shot or sabered. While moving at a gallop our wheels came oft* of each piece in my section. Our efforts to repair this damage were unavailing, and amidst a shower of pistol bullets we dragged our pieces until the traces broke. The men and non-commissioned officers behaved with gallantry. I halted at Centreville and attempted to join my brigade, but unsuccessfully. Learning that the regiments of the brigade were marching to Fairfax Court-House, I followed them with as many men and non-commissioned officers of my company as I oould collect. An order being issued after this for the troops to retire to Washington, I proceeded with a sergeant, four enlisted men, and five horses to Fort Corcoran, where the baggage of the company was stored, and arrived there about 8 o’clock Monday morning.

Report of Col. William T. Sherman, Thirteenth TJ. S. Infantry, commanding Third Brigade, First Division.
Hdqrs. Third Brigade, First Division,
Fort Corcoran, July 25, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit this my report of the operations of my brigade during the action of the 21st instant. The brigade is composed of the Thirteenth New York Volunteers, Colonel Quinby; Sixty-ninth New York, Colonel Corcoran; Seventy ninth New York, Colonel Cameron; Second Wisconsin, Lieutenant-Colonel Peck, and Company E, Third Artillery, under command of Capt. R. B. Ayres, Fifth Artillery.
We left our camp near Centreville, pursuant to orders, at 2.30 a. m., taking place in your column next to the brigade of General Schenck, and proceeded as far as the halt before the enemy’s position near the stone bridge at Bull Run. Here the brigade was deployed in line along the skirt of timber, and remained quietly in position till after 10 a. m. The enemy remained very quiet, but about that time we saw a regiment leave its cover in our front and proceed in double-quick time on the road toward Sudley Springs, by which we knew the columns of Colonels Hunter and Heintzelman were approaching. About the same time we observed in motion a large force of the enemy below the stone bridge. I directed Captain Ayres to take position with his battery near our right and open fire on this mass, but you had previously detached the two rifled guns belonging to this battery, and finding the smoothbore guns did not reach the enemy’s position we ceased firing, and I sent a request that you should send to me the 30-pounder rifled gun attached to Captain Carlisle’s battery. At the same time I shifted the New York Sixty-ninth to the extreme right of the brigade.
Thus we remained till we heard the musketry fire across Bull Run, showing that the head of Colonel Hunter’s column was engaged. This firing was brisk, and showed that Hunter was driving before him the

enemy till about noon, when it became certain the enemy had come to a stand, and that our forces on the other side of Bull Bun were all engaged—artillery and infantry. Here you sent me the order to cross over with the whole brigade to the assistance of Colonel Hunter. Early in the day, when reconnoitering the ground, I had seen a horseman descend from a bluff in our front, cross the stream, and show himself in the open Held, and, inferring we could cross over at the same point, I sent forward a company as skirmishers, and followed with the whofe brigade, the Kew York Sixty-ninth leading. We found no difficulty in crossing over, and met no opposition in ascending the steep bluff* opposite with our infantry, but it was impassable to the artillery, and 1 sent word back to Captain Ayres to follow if possible, otherwise to use his discretion. Captain Ayres did not cross Bull Bun, but remained with the remainder of your division. His report, herewith, [No. 27], describes his operations during the remainder of the day.
Advancing slowly and cautiously with the head of the column, to give time for the regiments in Succession to close up their ranks, we first encountered a party of the enemy retreating along a cluster of pines. Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty, of the Sixty-ninth, without orders, rode out and endeavored to intercept their retreat. One of the enemy, in full view, at short range, shot Haggerty, and he fell dead from his horse. The Sixty-ninth opened fire upon this party, which was returned; but, determined to effect our junction with Hunter’s division, I ordered this fire to cease, and we proceeded with caution toward the field, where we then plainly saw our forces engaged. Displaying our colors conspicuously at the head of our column, we succeeded in attracting the attention of our friends, and soon formed the brigade in rear of Colonel Porter’s. •Here I learned that Colonel Hunter was disabled by a severe wound, and that General McDowell was on the field. I sought him out, and received his orders to join in the pursuit of the enemy, who was lulling back to the left of the road by which the Army had approached from Sudley Springs. Placing Colonel Quinby’s regiment of rifles in front, in column by divisions, I directed the other regiments to follow in line of battle, in the order of the Wisconsin Second, New York Seventy-ninth, and New York Sixty-ninth.
Quinby’s regiment advanced steadily down the hill and up the ridge, from which he opened fire upon the enemy, who had made another stand on ground very favorable to him, and the regiment continued advancing as the enemy gave way, till the head of the column reached the point near which Bicketts’ battery was so severely cut up. The other regiments descended the hill in line of battle under a severe cannonade; and the ground affording comparative shelter against the enemy’s artillery, they changed direction by the right flank and followed the road before mentioned. At the point where this road crossed the ridge to our left front, the ground was swept by a most severe fire of artillery, rifles, and musketry, and we saw in succession several regiments driven from it, among them the zouaves and battalion of marines.
Before reaching the crest of this hill the roadway was worn deep enough to afford shelter, and I kept the several regiments in it as long as possible; but when the Wisconsin Second was abreast of the enemy, by order of Major Wadsworth, of General McDowell’s staff, I ordered it to leave the roadway by the left flank, and to attack the enemy. This regiment ascended to the brow of the hill steadily, received the severe fire of the enemy, returned it with spirit, and advanced delivering its fire. This regiment is uniformed in gray cloth, almost identical with that of the great bulk of the secession army, and when the regiment fell 24 n E—VOL II

[Chap. IX.
into confusion and retreated toward the road there was an universal cry that they were being fired on by our own men. The regiment rallied again, passed the brow of the hill a second time, but was again repulsed in disorder.
By this time the New York Seventy-ninth had closed up, and in like manner it was ordered to cross the brow of the hill and drive the enemy from cover. It was impossible to get a good view of this ground. In it there was one battery of artillery, which poured an incessant fire upon our advancing columns, and the ground was very irregular, with small clusters of pines, affording shelter, of which the enemy took good advantage. The fire of rifles and musketry was very severe. The Seventy-ninth, headed by its colonel (Cameron), charged across the hill, and for a short time the contest was severe. They rallied several times under fire, but finally broke and gained the cover of the hill.
This left the field open to the New York Sixty-ninth, Colonel Corcoran, who in his turn led his regiment over the crest, and had iu full open view the ground so severely contested. The firing was very severe, and the roar of cannon, muskets, and rifles incessant. It was manifest the enemy was here in great force, far superior to us at that point. The Sixty-ninth held the ground for some time, but finally fell back in disorder.
All this time Quinby’s regiment occupied another ridge to our left, overlooking the same field of action and similarly engaged.
Here, about 3.30 p. m. began the scene of confusion and disorder that characterized the remainder of the day. Up to that time all had kept their places, and seemed perfectly cool and used to the shells and shot that fell comparatively harmless all around us) but the short exposure to an intense fire of small-arms at close range had killed many, wounded more, and had produced disorder in all the battalions that had attempted to destroy it. Men fell away talking and in great confusion. Colonel Cameron had been mortally wounded, carried to an ambulance, and reported dying. Many other officers were reported dead or missing, and many of the wounded were making their way, with more or less assistance, to the buildings used as hospitals.
On the ridge to the west we succeeded in partially reforming the regiments, but it was manifest they would not stand, and I directed Colonel Corcoran to move along the ridge to the rear, near the position where we had first formed the brigade. General McDowell was there in person, and used all possible efforts to reassure the men. By the active exertions of Colonel Corcoran we formed an irregular square against the cavalry, which were then seen to issue from the position from which we had been driven, and we began our retreat towards that ford of Bull Bun by which we had approached the field of battle. There was no positive order to retreat, although for an hour it had been going on by the operation of the men themselves. The ranks were thin and irregular, and we found a stream of people strung from the hospital across Bull Bun and far towards Centreville. After putting in motion the irregular square, I pushed forward to find Captain Ayres* battery. Crossing Bull Bun, I sought it at its last position before the brigade crossed over, but it was not there ; then, passing through the woods where in the morning we had first formed line, we approached the blacksmith-shop, but there found a detachment of the secession cavalry, and thence made a circuit, avoiding Cub Bun Bridge, into Centreville, where I found General McDowell. From him I understood it was his purpose to rally the forces, and make a stand at Centreville. But, about 9 o’clock at night, I received, from General Tyler in person

the order to continue the retreat to the Potomac. This retreat was by night, and disorderly in the extreme. The men of different regiments mingled together, and some reached the.river at Arlington, some at Long Bridge, and the greater part returned to their former camps at or near Fort Corcoran. I reached this point at noon the ne£t day, and found a miscellaneous crowd crossing over the Aqueduct and ferries. Conceiving this to be demoralizing, I at once commanded the guard to be increased, and all persons attempting to pass over to be stopped. This soon produced its effect; men sought their proper companies and regiments, comparative order was restored, and all were posted to the best advantage.
I herewith inclose the official report of Captain Kelly, the commanding officer of the Sixty-ninth New York $ also full lists of the killed, wounded, and missing. Our loss was heavy, and occurred chiefly at the point near where Ricketts’ battery was destroyed. Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty was killed about noon, before we effected a junction with Colonel Hunter’s division. Colonel Cameron was mortally wounded leading his regiment in the charge, and Colonel Corcoran has been missing since the cavalry charge near the building used as a hospital.* #*#*##*
Lieutenants Piper and McQuesten, of my personal staff, were under fire all day, and carried orders to and fro with as much coolness as on parade. Lieutenant Bagley, of the Sixty-ninth New York, a volunteer aide, asked leave to serve with his company during the action, and is among those reported missing. I have intelligence that he is a prisoner and slightly wounded. Colonel Coon, of Wisconsin, a volunteer aide, also rendered good service during the day.

Sir : I have the honor, in the absence of Colonel Corcoran, missing, and Acting Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty, killed in action, to report to you that on Sunday morning, July 21, at 8.30 o’clock a. m., under orders of Major General McDowell, and the immediate command of Brigadier^ General Tyler, the Sixty-ninth Regiment New York State Militia moved forward from their camp at Centreville, and proceeded by steady march to within a mile and a half of the enemy’s battery, situated on the south bank of the creek or ravine known as Bull Run. At this point we halted, Colonel Corcoran commanding, Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty being second in command, Capt. Thomas Francis Meagher acting as major, and Capt. John Nugent as adjutant. The regiment numbered one thousand muskets, and was attended by one ambulance only, the other having broken down. The Sixty-ninth had good reason to complain that whilst regiments of other divisions were permitted to have

baggage and provision wagons immediately in the rear, the regiment I have the honor to command was peremptorily denied any facilities of the sort. The consequence was that the Sixty-ninth arrived in the field of action greatly fatigued and harassed, and but for their high sense of duty and military spirit would not have been adequate to the terrible duties of the day.
Under your orders, the Sixty-ninth deployed into line of battle on the left, and, occupying the woods in that direction, there awaited the attack of the skirmishers of the enemy, who were reported in advance upon our right. Ko change was effected in our position on the left of the road leading to the battery of the enemy, which position, in conformity with your orders, we determined to maintain at every cost, and whatever the consequences might be, until orders were given for our regiment to advance by close column by division, and take the enemy in rear and flank. This they did with the utmost alacrity and precision, advancing through every obstacle until the regiment reached Bull Bun. Here they crossed the stream and ravine in single file, and, ascending to the meadow where the enemy lay close and thick, poured in by successive companies an effective fire upon the rebels. The regiment, having formed in the meadow, marched in two-rank formation until the command “Front” was given, when they halted in line of battle, and steadily awaited the order to charge upon the batteries in front.
In the mean while Acting Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty was killed by a Louisiana zouave, whom he pursued as the latter was on his retreat with his regiment into the woods, and several of our men were severely wounded.
After sustaining and repelling a continuous fire of musketry and artillery, directed on us from the masked positions of the enemy, our regiment formed into line directly in front of the enemy’s battery, charged upon it twice, were finally driven off, owing principally to the panic of the regiment which preceded us, and then, under a desperate fire, retired to the line from which we had advanced on the battery, and then endeavored to reform. The panic was too general, and the Sixty-ninth had to retreat with the great mass of the Federals.
In this action I have to record, with deep regret, the loss of Colonel Corcoran (supposed to be wounded and a prisoner), Acting Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty, and others, of whom a corrected list will be speedily forwarded.

of the enemy’s position. The battery operated from this position at times upon the enemy’s batteries and troops as occasion offered. About noon I started with the brigade, as ordered, to cross the open ground, the run, and to rise the bluff, with a portion of the battery, one section being detached at this time, operating upon a battery to the left. On arriving at the run it at once was apparent that it was impossible to rise the bluff opposite with the pieces. I sent an officer immediately to report the fact to Colonel Sherman and ask instructions. I received for reply that I should use my discretion.
I immediately returned to the central position. I remained at this point, operating upon the enemy’s guns and infantry, till ordered by General Tyler to cover the retreat of the division with the battery.
A body of cavalry at this time drew up to charge the battery. The whole battery poured canister into and demolished them. # The battery moved slowly to the rear to Centreville.*
^ ^ ^ ^
I will add, that the coolness and gallantry of First Lieut. Dunbar E. Eansom on all occasions, and particularly when under fire of three pieces, with his section at short range, when the battery was about to be charged by a large body of cavalry, and also when crossing a broken bridge in a rough gully, and fired upon in rear by the enemy’s infantry, were conspicuous. The good conduct of First Lieut. George W. Dresser, Fourth Artillery, was marked, especially when threatened by cavalry, and at the ravine referred to above. Second Lieut. H. E. Noyes, cavalry, was energetic in the performance of his duties.
I lost four horses killed on 18th; two horses wounded on 18th; seven horses on 21st; three caissons, the forge, and a six-mule team and wagon (excepting one mule), on the 21st. I sent all these caissons, &c., ahead when preparing for the retreat, to get them out of the way. The fleeing volunteers cut the traces and took the horses of the caissons.

of the command on the following day—that is, I was to defend the position which I then occupied in front of the enemy, called Blackburn’s Ford, and about one mile in his front, where we had been for the last three days, I was also ordered to consider myself under the command of Col. D. S. Miles, U. S. Army, who was to command his own brigade at Centreville, my own, and that of Colonel Davies, midway between the two, these three brigades constituting what was then called the reserve.
Attached to my brigade was the field battery of Major Hunt, U. S. Army, and also the rifled battery of 10-pounders, under Lieutenant Greene, U. S. Army. I wTas ordered to open fire on the enemy for the purpose of making a diversion, not before, but soon after, hearing the report of General Tyler’s cannonade on my right, to carry out which purpose I made the following disposition of the brigade: Two batteries I placed on tfie ridge of a hill, in view of the enemy; the Third Michigan Infantry on the left of the road, in line of battle. Still farther, six hundred yards to the left, on a commanding eminence, I had placed the day before two companies of the First Massachusetts Regiment, for the purpose of holding the log barn and the frame barn, which companies pushed, picket style, farther to our left for the security of that point, which I considered a gcod position for artillery. In a ravine half way between the two positions I placed also a company of the First Massachusetts Regiment, which pushed pickets down the ravine to its front; and on the extreme right of all I placed the balance of the Massachusetts regiment in line of battle, with two companies of that regiment pushed four hundred yards to the right and front, w7hich two companies again threw pickets in advance. The New York and Second Michigan Regiments I placed in the road five hundred yards in rear of the line as a reserve.
Soon after making these arrangements, which I did on hearing the report of artillery on our right, Colonel Davies’ brigade made its appearance, with him at its head. Inquiring of me the date of my commission, he found that he ranked me by ten days, and he assumed the command. That officer wished a good position for artillery to open, and I immediately proposed the position on our left, near the log house, from which a good view of a large stone barn, called by the people of the country the enemy’s headquarters, could be obtained. Colonel Davies brought up with him the rifled 20-pounder battery of Lieutenant Benjamin, and ordered it to open fire immediately * He directed, also, Hunt’s battery to his assistance, and I ordered Greene’s battery to open its fire at the same time. The enemy appeared to have withdrawn his guns from that position, as he returned no fire, or he might have been reserving his fire for the last attack. An hour’s cannonading, however, brought in view a column of the enemy’s infantry, which I observed with my glass. There were at least twenty-five hundred men; and soon after two other bodies of men, of at least a regiment each, who soon occupied the lines on the other side of the run, which lines already appeared full to overflowing. Supposing now that they intended to make a push across our front in column, or would endeavor to turn our left, about 11 o’clock a. m. I began to fortify my position by throwing up an earthen parapet, with embrasures across the road for three guns, and commenced an abatis of timber, by felling trees, pointing outwards, between this battery and the log house to the left.
About this time the enemy on the opposite side appeared to be falling back in confusion from our right attack, which continued for some time, and then the tide changed, and they seemed to be returning in large masses.

During the interval between these two extremes I was ordered by Colonel Miles to throw forward skirmishers and feel the enemy, and accordingly two companies of the Third Michigan Eegiment were sent forward and down the ravine, to cover our front and advance; these were supported by Captain Brethschneider’s light infantry battalion, which also advanced down the ravine, accompanied by Lieutenant Prime, Corps of U. S. Engineers, who went for the purpose of ascertaining the enemy’s position, he volunteering his services for that particular purpose. Colonel Davies also threw forward a company of skirmishers on his right. The enemy’s skirmishers were in force in the woods in front, and covered themselves with trees and rifle-pits which had been thrown up before. Our two advance companies were driven back; the enemy pursued, and were in turn driven back by the spherical case shot of Greene’s battery, and I ordered back the light infantry and also the two companies to their former position. The company in front of Colonel Davies’ command retired about the same time.
By 5 o’clock p. m. I had the battery and the abatis nearly completed, making my defenses as secure as the short time and few implements used would permit. No enemy appeared in force at my front with a disposition to assault, but about this time a heavy column of infantry appeared to the left of Colonel Davies, in a ravine, moving up to the attack. This brigade opened a heavy fire upon them, and gallantly drove them back, as he informed me afterwards. During this firing, which was soon after 5 o’clock, I received orders from Colonel Miles, through one of his staff, to retreat upon Centreville, and endeavor to hold that position. I immediately collected together my brigade, and put it in motion on the road towards Centreville, when a staff* officer proposed to me to throw my regiment in line, face towards the enemy between the house occupied the night before by Hunt’s battery and the Union and Centreville road, in which road the enemy wras supposed to be advancing. I had gained a xiosition near the desired point when I was met by Colonel Davies, vrho informed me that he had beaten the enemy handsomely in front. I told him I had been ordered back to Centreville by Colonel Miles; that the rest of my brigade had gone on; that I had been directed to go to that point with my regiment for the purpose of facing the enemy there, which I had done, and Colonel Davies returned, as I supposed, to his brigade. Soon after this I was met by a staff* officer of General McDowell’s, who told me to put my brigade in position on the left of the road from Centreville to Blackburn’s Ford, and stretching towards the Union and Centreville road, facing the enemy. Other troops had also fallen back to this point, distant about a mile from Centreville.
At about 0 o’clock p. m. Captain Alexander, of the Corps of Engineers, directed me, by the order of General McDowell, to take the general arrangement of the troops at that point in my own hands, he suggesting as a good line of defense a line between a piece of woods on the right and one on the left, the line facing equally towards the enemy, who were supposed to be coming either on the Union or Blackburn road. I immediately formed that line as I best could of the regiments nearest the position, placing the men in the ravines and the artillery as much as possible on the hills in rear of the infantry.
Before Captain Alexander gave me this last direction, I learned that Colonel Miles had altered the position of some regiments wffiich I had placed before, especially the Third Michigan Eegiment, which I had ordered to form close column by division, to remain as a reserve, and

await further orders from me. The officer in command of the regiment at that time, Lieutenant-Colonel Stevens (Colonel McConnell being unwell, but on the ground), immediately executed that order, and put his regiment in close column. I went to another part of the field, and on returning found this regiment deployed in line of battle, and in another position. I inquired of Colonel Stevens the reason of their position being altered. He told me that Colonel Miles had directed this movement. I asked him why. Colonel Stevens replied, u I do not know, but we have no confidence in Colonel Miles.” I inquired the reason, and Colonel Stevens replied, “ Because Colonel Miles is drunk.” That closed the conversation. I sent Colonel Stevens back with his regiment to form close column by division, as at first. I then reported to Captain Alexander that I had been interfered with in my disposition of the troops during the day, and I could not carry out General McDowell’s orders as long as I was interfered with by a drunken man. Captain Alexander then said that General McDoweil now rested the whole disposition of the troops with me, and that I must use my own judgment. I went to place another battalion in line, when I was met by Colonel Miles, who ordered me to form that regiment in another direction. I replied that I should obey no more orders that he might see fit to give me. Colonel Miles then said, u Colonel Bichardson, 1 shall pat you in arrest.” I told him 1 never should obey his arrest, and that he never could put me in that x>osition. Colonel Miles answered that he u did not understand this.” I made no reply, and went on with the further disposition of the forces, which was done according to the inclosed diagram.*
As soon as the line of battle was well formed the enemy’s cavalry made his appearance on the Centreville and Manassas road. I ordered Lieutenant Benjamin to open his rifled cannon upon them, which he did, and the cavalry disappeared after a few shots. It was now nearly dark, and the troops encamped in their present position. About 10 o’clock General McDowell informed me that a retreat was resolved upon ; that the troops must be started on the road to Fairfax as soon as possible, and ordered me to move last and cover the retreat of the Army with my brigade. I told the general I would do so, and would stand by him as long a& any man would. 1 left with my brigade at 2 o’clock a. m., after all the other regiments and batteries had retired. On reaching Fairfax I found it abandoned by our troops, and I covered the rear, bringing up my brigade in good order, the .New York regiment in front, then the Massachusetts regiment, the two Michigan regiments in rear of the whole. Arrived at Arlington at 2 o’clock p. m. on Monday after the action.

My brigade in general behaved itself nobly, and always stood firm. Of my staff, Mr. Eastman, first lieutenant, TJ. S. Army, did his duty to my satisfaction. Lieutenant Bright^, U. S. Army, was sick and unable to perform much duty, but did all he could. Cadet John B. Meigs, U. S. Military Academy, acted as my volunteer aide, carried my orders promptly, and a braver and more gallant young man was never in any service. I most earnestly recommend him to be appointed at once a

Captain : Permit me to correct an unintentional error that has crept into Brigadier-General McDowell’s official report of the engagement of 21st July.
By command of Brigadier-General McDowell, given me in presence of Colonel Jackson, Eighteenth New York Volunteers, and of Captain Whipple, of the Engineer Corps, to conduct the retreat and to cover the retreat with my brigade, I did so cover the retreat from Centreville. I brought up the rear with my brigade in the following order: Twelfth New York leading, followed by First Massachusetts 5 the Third Michigan, taking up position, kept in the rear and followed by the Second Michigan. About one mile this side of Centreville we were obliged to halt on account of other regiments, and the Second Michigan then took the position of the Third Michigan, and thus marching in good order we reached Arlington about 4 o’clock on Monday, the 22d, and went into camp, having moved in rear of all other regiments and batteries. At Fairfax we were so far in rear that no troops (of our own forces) were in sight. Will you do my brigade the credit of this correction ?
Truly,

Light Battery M, Second Artillery,
Camp near Fort Albany, July 25, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit a report of the operations of my battery on the 21st instant.
The company arrived at New York on the 12th instant from Fort Pickens, Fla., with its battery, but without horses. A large portion of the men were recruits, and no opportunity for instruction as field artillery had been afforded them. The company reached Washington by rail on Sunday, 14th, and on Wednesday evening the battery, which came by sea, was received at the arsenal. Necessary repairs and refitting were at once commenced, ammunition and other stores drawn and packed, horses procured, and on Friday, the 19th, we marched from Capitol Hill to Colonel Richardson’s position in front of the enemy’s works at Blackburn’s Ford, a distance of twenty-eight miles. Saturday was devoted to instructing the recruits, shoeing horses, &e., and on that evening Lieutenant Platt’s section was detached to join the advanced

guard. On Saturday night Lieutenant Edwards, Third Artillery, reported to me with a section of two heavy rifled guns. On Sunday morning, the 21st, Lieutenant Thompson’s section was placed in position oil the right of the main road, overlooking the ford, and commanding the road by which the enemy’s advance was expected. A few shells were, by direction of Colonel Richardson, dropped into the woods and amongst the buildings which were supposed to contain the enemy, but no answer was returned, and the firing ceased. Soon after this an infantry column was seen pushing into the wood skirting Bull Run. Lieutenant Thompson moved forward a piece, and after a few rounds they disappeared.
At about 10 a. m. Colonel Miles ordered both sections of my battery to the extreme left, occupied by Davies’ brigade. Edwards’ section had been sent early in the morning to that position, from which he had opened his fire upon the woods and houses in front. I transmit herewith his report of the operations of his section, in which he describes the nature of the ground.
The firing was continued at intervals by the whole battery u as a demonstration,” but produced little or no effect, as there was no definite object, except when the enemy’s moving columns came from time to time within our range. We were supported by two infantry battalions, drawn up in line behind the battery. On inquiry, made immediately after my arrival on the ground, I was informed that a brigade of infantry was posted in the Tvood to our left and rear, commanding a deep and wide ravine on our left flank, and watching the road beyond it, which leads from below the ford to Centreville; and as we had skirmishers pushed forward into the ravine, I felt no apprehension of danger from that quarter, but still requested, as a precaution, that the battalion on the left should be formed on the brink of the ravine and in column, so that it might be readily deployed to front in any direction. ISTo attention was paid to this request, and the regiment remained in line.
About 4.30 or 5 p. m., after the battle was apparently gained on the right, and whilst large re-enforcements of infantry and cavalry were observed hurrying up from the direction of Manassas, a strong force of infantry and some cavalry, variously estimated at from 2,500 to 5,000 men in all, appeared on our left, approaching parallel to our front by the lateral openings into the great ravine on our flank. The infantry only was first seen, and as they approached without any apparent attempt at concealment, preceded by our skirmishers, they were supposed to be our own troops. As the number increased, I rode down the ravine with my first sergeant to reconnoiter them. Some of our skirmishers stated that they had seen no troops ; others said they were the Thirty-first [*?] ]Srew Yorkers coming in. They carried no colors, and their numbers increasing to an alarming extent, I hurried back and changed the front of the battery, so as to command all the openings into the ravine and the approaches to our position. Colonel Davies at the same time detached a couple of companies into the ravine as skirmishers. The latter had scarcely deployed, when a sharp rattle of musketry removed all doubts as to the character of the advancing troops. We had been surprised, and the enemy was close upon us in large force. Our infantry regiments had changed front with the battery, but unfortunately closed their intervals behind it. Precious time was now lost in getting them on our flanks. Had they remained in our rear they would have been unnecessarily exposed to the fire directed on the battery, and in case of a determined charge for our capture, which I confidently expected, they would have been apt to fire through us, destroying men and horses and crippling the guns. At length they were moved

to the right and left, and ordered to lie down and await the approach of the enemy, who by this time were closing up in apparently overwhelming numbers. I now directed the gunners to prepare shrapnel and canister shot, and in case the enemy persisted in his advance not to lose time in sponging the pieces—for minutes were now of more value than arms—but to aim low, and pour in a rapid fire wherever the men were thickest or were seen advancing.
The enemy having by this time completed his preparations and driven in our skirmishers, now rushed forward and opened a heavy musketry fire on the battery, but from the shortness of range, or from aiming upwards as they ascended the ravine, their shot mostly passed over us. The command was then given to the battery to commence firing. Under the directions of Lieutenants Platt and Thompson, Second Artillery, and Edwards, Third Artillery, commanding sections, the most rapid, well-sustained, and destructive fire I have ever witnessed was now opened. The men took full advantage of the permission to omit sponging, yet no accident occurred from it. The guns were all of large caliber (two 20-pounder Parrott rifle guns and four light 12-pounders), and they swept the field with a perfect storm of canister. No troops could stand it, and the enemy broke and fled in every direction, taking refuge in the woods and ravines ; and in less than fifteen minutes not a living man could be seen on the ground which so recently had swarmed with them. The infantry regiments had not found it necessary to fire a single shot.
Believing now there was no support on our left (original rear), I executed a flank movement, so as to bring the left of the battery close to the wood and in front of the lateral road by which it had reached the ground. This movement threw the regiment on our left into the wood, and thus secured its possession. The fire was now reopened, the rifled guns throwing shell and the others round shot, so as to sweep the woods and search the ravines into which the enemy had been driven. In a few minutes orders were given to retreat, and I sent an officer to Colonel Davies to inquire if such were his directions; that the enemy were defeated, and that they would be unable to reform. The answer returned was “ to retire at once on Centreville.” The pieces were limbered up, and, Lieutenant Edwards’ guns leading, moved off.
Scarcely was the column fairly in the road when a scattering fire was opened on the rear, doubtless by those who, having taken refuge in the woods, observed the withdrawal of our troops. The cry to the battery to “trot” was now clamorously raised from the rear, and confusion was fast spreading, when I directed a deliberate walk should be maintained, and pushed forward myself to the place where the ambulances and wagons were standing in the main road. The teamsters had taken the alarm from the rapid firing and the cries, and a panic was rapidly growing, when my assurance of our having beaten the enemy, and that there was no necessity for hurry, together with the appearance of the head of the battery emerging at a walk from the wood, reassured them and calmed the excitement.
The whole column now retired in good order, and was formed, together with all the disposable field artillery, in front of Centreville, under the immediate direction of General McDowell in person, and in so imposing an attitude as to deter the enemy from any advance in that direction, and to hold him completely in check.
During the night the troops were put in motion for their former camps on the Potomac. Barry’s battery, under Lieutenant Tidball, and my own were the last we could perceive on the ground. Just as I was

leaving I received a message from Colonel Richardson, stating that his brigade was drawn up in column on the road, and that he wished me to pass him with the battery, but to remain near him, and that we would constitute the rear guard. This was accordingly done, but a mass of stragglers collected around the guns, and could not be prevailed upon to pass them or move without them. I was thus constrained to move forward until some 2,000 or 3,000 men interposed between us, when I received a message from Colonel Richardson, stating that a force of the enemy’s cavalry and horse artillery was in our rear and threatening an attack. I now drew up at the side of the road—to turn back in such a crowd was impossible—and only by representing that the rear was about being attacked could I urge them forward. On Colonel Richardson’s coming up, he stated that the demonstration of the enemy was very feeble, and we saw them no more. It is but just to say that the disorder and mob-like mixture of the volunteers did not appear to proceed from fear, but from sheer fatigue. They were footsore, lame, hungry, and tired, but seemed to be in good heart, and on my representing that it was important that a certain position in our advance should be occupied, some of Blenker’s German and of Montgomery’s New Jersey regiments formed in good order and took the position indicated. Had we been attacked by any force, I have little doubt that a stout resistance would have been made.
The officers of the battery (Lieuts. E. R. Platt and James Thompson, Second Artillery, commanding sections) performed all the duties devolving upon them with promptness, skill, and gallantry. Their labors in bringing the battery into good condition had been untiring, and to the thoroughness of the instruction they had imparted to their sections before they were dismounted in Texas is mainly attributable the efficiency with which the pieces were served on the field and the successful result of the action.
First Lieut. Presley O. Craig, Second Artillery, on sick leave on account of a badly-sprained foot, which prevented his marching with his own company, having heard of the sickness of my second lieutenant, volunteered for the performance of the duties, and joined the battery the day before it left Washington. He was constantly and actively employed during the night preceding and on the day of the battle, and his services were very valuable. When the enemy appeared he exerted himself in perfecting the preparations to receive him, and conducted himself with the greatest gallantry when the onset was made. He Ml early in the action, whilst in the active discharge of his duty, receiving a shot in the forehead, and dying in a few minutes afterwards. This was the only casualty in the battery.
Cadet John R. Meigs, of the U. S. Military Academy, being in Washington on furlough, also volunteered his services, and was employed actively from the time he joined at Washington until the close of the battle. On the death of Lieutenant Craig, Cadet Meigs performed his duties until the close of the action with spirit and intelligence, and was very useful, after the affair was over, in conveying orders, observing the enemy, and rallying our troops.
Lieutenant Edwards commanded his section with skill and efficiency, and I can indorse the favorable report he makes of his lieutenants, Benjamin and Babbitt, and of the conduct of his men.
The behavior of the men of my battery was all that could be desired. They were cool, collected, prompt, and obedient, and not an instance of misconduct or neglect occurred during the action in the whole battery.

The first sergeant, Terrence Reily, was very efficient, as were also the chiefs of pieces—Sergeants Smith, Pfeifer, Flood, and Relinger.
A detachment of twenty recruits, under Lieutenant Brisbin, had been dispatched from Carlisle Barracks to fill up my company. Lieutenant Brisbin did not reach Washington until after we had left, but he followed us up, and sought us on the field. He did not succeed in finding the battery, but employed his men usefully in endeavoring to stop the retreat of our forces and in resisting the pursuit of the enemy. In the performance of these duties he was twice wounded. He speaks favorably of the services of Sergeants Bowman and Rogers, of his detachment.

Report of Lieut. John Edwards, Third U. S. Artillery.
Fort Albany, Ya., July 27,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report with reference to the part taken by Light Company G, First Artillery, in the late engagement at Bull Run:
At about 5 a. m. on the morning of July 21 I left camp with my battery, consisting of two 20-pounder rifled cannon, and proceeded to the camp of Colonel Richardson. By his order was halted on the road about two hours. At the expiration of that time Colonel Davies, who was accompanied by Colonel Richardson, directed me to follow them with my guns. The general direction of the road taken was southeasterly, and winding through a heavily-timbered country. After a march of a mile, came to an open space on the brow of a range of high hills. This seemed to be a position on the extreme left of the line, and from it there \fas a good view of the valley of Bull Run and the wooded heights beyond. I was directed to open fire upon a white house in front, partially concealed by trees, and from which a secession flag was flying. The distance was about 2,000 yards. Immediately after the firing of the first shell a flight of men, wagons, and horses took place from that locale. The direction of their flight was up the ridge to the left. Their speed being hastened by other shots, they soon disappeared in the forests. About a half hour thereafter large bodies of troops debouched from the woods at the same point where those who fled had disappeared. They marched across an open space some three miles from my position, and were then lost to sight in the woods, but the direction of their march could be traced by the dust.
Near the summit of the chain of hills, on the opposite side, a large brick house could be seen by the aid of a glass. Towards this these troops moved. By columns of dust thrown up on the right troops were judged to be approaching this direction also. This house on the summit must have been a central rallying point. I kept up an irregular fire from my guns, dropping shell occasionally into the wooded ravines below us and throwing solid shot and shell at columns of dust within range raised by rebel troops. My position being somewhat exposed,

[Chap. IX.
and having no adequate support, the battery was temporarily withdrawn to the rear, and subsequently reordered to take the same position. I applied to General Miles to have some lighter guns near me, to throw canister, in case of a demonstration on our flank. Hunt’s battery afterwards came up, and took its position in the same field.
After the retreat of the right and center a strong body of rebel infantry appeared on our flank. I placed my guns in position, and opened on it with canister at a distance of two hundred and fifty yards, and as the force fell back into the ravines beyond continued the fire with shell. The enemy being no longer in sight, Colonel Davies said, “Now we have driven them back, we’ll retire upon Centreville.” I proceeded to the rear with my guns. A regiment was drawn up in the woods by the roadside in such a manner that my battery was forced to pass closely in its front. It was the most dangerous position occupied during the day. One gun was fired over the battery, and there was a simultaneous movement of muskets along the line, as if to continue the fire. Fortunately it was not followed up. I left Centreville at about 9 p. m. and proceeded to the Potomac, reaching Arlington between 8 and 9 a. m. on the 22d. Lieutenants Benjamin and Babbitt performed their several duties with gallantry, coolness, <and spirit. The enlisted men, though unpracticed in the drill—the company having been hastily mounted—remained unshaken in the conflict.

Sir : Having had the honor to command the Second Division of the Army before Manassas, on the 21st of July, 1861, and having been wounded .early in the action, the command, as well as the duty of making the division report, devolved on Col. Andrew Porter, of the U. S. Army. I deem it, however, a duty I owe to the gallant gentlemen of my staff briefly to mention their services:
The Hon. Isaac N. Arnold, of the U. S. House of Representatives, one of my volunteer aides, was with me on the field till I received my wound, and then devoted himself to having the wounded removed and to alleviating their sufferings.
Capt. D. P. Woodbury, chief engineer of the division, fearlessly exposed himself in front of the skirmishers during our whole advance, and determined with great judgment the route of the division.
Capt. William D. Whipple, A. A. G.; Captain Cook, of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Cross, of Engineers, and Lieut. D. W. Flagler, Ordnance, aide-de-camp, all performed their duties to my entire satisfaction. They were absent conveying orders during the short time I was in the field.

Bejport of Col. Andrew Porter, Sixteenth TJ. S. Infantry, commanding Second Division and First Brigade, Second Division.
Hdqrs. First Brigade, Second Division, , Arlington, Va., July 25,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following account of the operations of the First Brigade, Second Division, of the Army, in the battle before Manassas, on the 21st instant.* The brigade was silently paraded in light marching order at 2 o’clock in the morning of that day, composed as follows, viz: Griffin’s battery; marines, Major Reynolds; Twenty-seventh New York Volunteers, Colonel Slocum; Fourteenth New York State Militia, Colonel Wood; Eighth New York State Militia, Colonel Lyons; battalion regulars, Major Sykes$ one company Second Dragoons, two companies First Cavalry, four companies Second Cavalry, Major Palmer. Total strength, 3,700. The marines were recruits, but through the constant exertions of their officers had been brought to present a fine military appearance, without being able to render much active service. They were therefore attached to the battery as its permanent support through the day.
Owing to frequent delays in the march of troops in front, the brigade did not reach Centreville until 4.30 a. m., and it was an hour after sunrise when the head of it was turned to the right to commence the flank movement. The slow and intermittent movements of the Second Brigade (Burnside’s) were then followed through the woods for four hours, which brought the head of our division to Bull Run and Sudley’s Mill, where a halt of half an hour took place, to rest and refresh the men and horses. From the heights on this side of the run a vast column of the enemy could be plainly descried, at the distance of a mile or more on our left, moving rapidly towards our line of march in front. Some disposition of skirmishers was then directed to be made at the head of the column by the division commander, in which Colonel Slocum, of the Second Rhode Island Regiment, was observed to bear an active part. The column moved forward, however, before they were completed, and in about thirty minutes emerged from the timber, when the rattle of musketry and occasional crash of round shot through the leaves and branches of the trees in our vicinity betokened the opening of battle.
The head of the brigade was immediately turned slightly to the right, in order to gain time and room for deployment on the right of the Second Brigade. Griffin’s battery found its way through the timber to the fields beyond, followed promptly by the marines, while the Twenty-

seventh took direction more to the left, and the Fourteenth followed upon the trail of the battery, all moving up at a double-quick step. The enemy appeared drawn up in a long line, extending along the War-renton turnpike from a house and haystacks upon our extreme right to a house beyond the left of the division. Behind that house there was a heavy masked battery, which, with three others along his line on the heights beyond, covered the ground upon which we were advancing with all sorts of projectiles. A grove in front of his right wing afforded it shelter and protection, while the shrubbery along the road, with fences, screened somewhat his left wing. Griffin advanced to within a thousand yards, and opened a deadly and unerring fire upon his batteries, which were soon silenced or driven away. Our right was rapidly developed by the marines, Twenty-seventh, Fourteenth, and Eighth, with the cavalry in rear of the right, the enemy retreating with more precipitation than order as our line advanced.
The Second Brigade (Burnside’s) was at this time attacking the enemy’s right with, perhaps, too hasty vigor. The enemy clung to the protecting wood with great tenacity, and the Bhode Island Battery became so much endangered as to impel the commander of the Second Brigade to call for the assistance of the battalion of regulars. At this timfe I received the information through Capt. W. D. Whipple, A. A. G., that Colonel Hunter was seriously wounded, and had directed him to report to me as commander of the division ; and in reply to the urgent request of Colonel Burnside, I detached the battalion of regulars to his assistance. For an account of its operations I would respectfully beg a reference to the inclosed report of its commander, Major Sykes [No. 35].
The rebels soon came flying from the woods towards the right, and the Twenty-seventh completed tlieir rout by charging directly upon their center in the face of a scorching fire, while the Fourteenth and Eighth moved down the turnpike to cut off the retiring foe, and to support the Twenty-seventlq which had lost its gallant colonel, but was standing the brunt of the action, with its ranks thinning in the dreadful fire. Now the resistance of the enemy’s left was so obstinate that the beaten right retired in safety.
The head of Lleintzelman’s column at this moment appeared upon the field, and the Eleventh and Fifth Massachusetts Begiinents moved forward to the support of our center, while staff officers could be seen galloping rapidly in every direction, endeavoring to rally the broken Eighth; but this laudable purpose was only partially attained, owing to the inefficiency of some of its field officers.
The Fourteenth, though it had broken, was soon rallied in rear of Griffin’s battery, which soon took up a position farther to the front and right, from which his fire was delivered with such precision and rapidity as to compel the batteries of the enemy to retire in consternation, far behind the brow of the hill in front. At this time my brigade occupied a line considerably in advance of that first occupied by the left wing of the enemy. The battery was pouring its withering fire into the batteries and columns of the enemy whenever they exposed themselves. The cavalry were engaged in teeling the left flank of the enemy’s positions, in doing which some important captures were made—one by Sergeant Sacks, of the Second Dragoons, of a General George Steuart, of Baltimore. Our cavalry also emptied the saddles of a number of the mounted rebels.
General Tyler’s division was engaged with the enemy’s right. The Twenty-seventh was resting in the edge of the woods, in the center, covered by a hill, upon which lay the Eleventh and Fifth Massachusetts,

occasionally delivering a scattering fire. The Fourteenth was moving to the right flank. The Eighth had lost its organization. The marines were moving up in fine style in rear of the Fourteenth, and Captain Arnold was occupying a height on the middle ground with his battery. At this juncture there was a temporary lull in the firing from the rebels, who appeared only occasionally on the heights in irregular formations, but to serve as marks for Griffin’s guns.
The prestige of success had thus far attended the efforts of our inexperienced, but gallant, troops. The lines of the enemy had been forcibly shifted nearly a mile to their left and rear. The flags of eight regiments, though borne somewhat wearily, now pointed towards the hill from which disordered masses of rebels had been seen hastily retiring.
Griffin’s and Bicketts’ batteries were ordered by the commanding general to the top of the hill on our right, supporting them with Fire Zouaves and marines, while the Fourteenth entered the skirt of woods on their right, to protect that flank, and a column, composed of the Twenty-seventh New York, Eleventh and Fifth Massachusetts, First Minnesota, and Sixty ninth New York, moved up towards the left flank of the batteries ; but so soon as they were in position, and before the flanking supports had reached theirs, a murderous fire of musketry and rifles, opened at pistol range, cut down every cannoneer and a large number of horses. The fire came from some infantry of the enemy, which had been mistaken for our own forces, an officer on the field having stated that it was a regiment sent by Colonel Heintzelman to support the batteries.
The evanescent courage of the zouaves prompted them to fire perhaps a hundred shots, when they broke and fled, leaving the batteries open to a charge of the enemy’s cavalry, which took place immediately. The marines also, in spite of the exertions of their gallant officers, gave way in disorder; the Fourteenth on the right and the column on the left hesitatingly retired, with the exception of the Sixty-ninth and Thirty-eighth Yew York, who nobly stood and returned the fire of the enemy for fifteen minutes. Soon the slopes behind us were swarming with our retreating and disorganized forces, whilst riderless horses and artillery teams ran furiously through the flying crowd. All further efforts were futile; the words, gestures, and threats of our officers were thrown away upon men who had lost all presence of mind and only longed for absence of body. Some of our noblest and best officers lost their lives in trying to rally them.
Upon our first position the Twenty-seventh was the first to rally, under the command of Major Bartlett, and around it the other regiments engaged soon collected their scattered fragments. The battalion of regulars, in the mean time, moved steadily across the field from the left to the right, and took up a position where it held the entire forces of the rebels in check until our forces were somewhat rallied. The commanding general then ordered a retreat upon Centreville, at the same time directing me to cover it with the battalion of regulars, the cavalry, and a section of artillery. The rear guard thus organized followed our panic-stricken people to Centreville, resisting the attacks of the rebel cavalry and artillery, and saving them from the inevitable destruction which awaited them had not this body been interposed.
Among those who deserve especial mention I beg leave to place the following names, viz:
Captain Griffin, for his coolness and promptitude in action, and for the handsome manner in which he handled his battery.

Lieutenant Ames, of the same battery, who, after being wounded, gallantly served with it in action, and being unable to ride on horseback, was helped on and off a caisson in changes of position.
Captain Tillinghast, A. Q. M., who was ever present where his services were needed, carrying orders, rallying troops, and serving with the batteries, and finally, I have to state with the deepest sorrow, was mortally wounded.
Major Sykes and the officers of his command, three of whom (Lieutenants Latimer, Dickinson, and Kent) were wounded, who by their discipline, steadiness, and heroic fortitude, gave eclat to our attacks upon the enemy, and averted the dangers of a final overthrow.
Major Palmer and the cavalry officers under him, who by their daring intrepidity made the effectiveness of that corps all that it could be upon such a field in supporting batteries, feeling the enemy’s position, and covering our retreat.
Major Reynolds, marines, whose zealous efforts were well sustained by his subordinates, two of whom, Brevet Major Zeilin and Lieutenant Hale, were wounded, and one, Lieutenant Hitchcock, lost his life.
Col. EL W. Slocum, who was wounded while leading his gallant Twenty-seventh Kew York to the charge, and Maj. J. J. Bartlett, who subsequently commanded it, and by his enthusiasm and valor kept it in action and out of the panic. His conduct was imitated by his subordinates, of whom two, Capt. H. C. Rodgers and Lieut. H. C. Jackson, were wounded, and one, Ensign Asa Park, was killed.
In the last attack Col. A. M. Wood, of the Fourteenth Kew York State Militia, was wounded, together with Capts. R. B. Jordan and C. F. Baldwin, and Lieuts. J. A. Jones, T. R. Salter, R. A. Goodenough, and C. Scholes, and Adjutant Laidlaw.
The officers of the Fourteenth, especially Maj. James Jourdan, were distinguished by their display of spirit and efficiency throughout the action.
Surg. Charles C. Keeney, of the medical department, who by his professional skill, promptitude, and cheerfulness made the condition of the wounded of the Second Division comparatively comfortable. (He was assisted to a great extent by Dr. Rouch, of Chicago, a citizen.)
During the entire engagement I received extremely valuable aid and assistance from my aides-de-camp, Lieuts. C. F. Trowbridge and F. M. Bache, both of the Sixteenth Infantry.
Lieut. J. B. Howard, Fourteenth Kew York State Militia, A. A. Q. M. for the brigade, who by zealous attention to his duties succeeded in safely bringing the wagons of my brigade to Arlington.
The staff officers of the Second Division commander, viz, Capt. W. D. Whipple, Lieutenants Cross and Flagler, served with me after the fall of Colonel Hunter, and I am indebted to them for gallant, faithful services during the day. Captain Whipple had his horse killed under him by a cannon ball.
Acting Asst. Adjt. General Lieut. W. W. Averell sustained the high reputation he had before won for himself as a brave and skillful officer, and to him I am very greatly indebted for aid and assistance, not only in performing with the greatest promptitude the duties of his position, but by exposing himself most fearlessly in rallying and leading forward the troops, he contributed largely to their general effectiveness against the enemy. I desire to call the attention of the commanding general particularly to him.
In conclusion, I beg leave to submit the inclosed return of killed, wounded, and missing in my brigade.* Since the above reports were

The inclosed report of Colonel Burnside, [No. 39], commanding Second Brigade, was sent to me after the above report was written. While respectfully calling the attention of the general commanding to it, I would also ask leave to notice some misconceptions under which the colonel commanding the Second Brigade seems to haye labored at the time of writing his report, viz: Of his agency in the management or formation of the Second Division on the field 5 2d, of the time that his brigade was entirely out of the action, with the exception of the New Hampshire Regiment; 3d, of the position of his brigade in the retreat, and particularly of the position of the Seventy-first New York, as he may have mistaken the rear guard, organized under my direction by your orders, for the enemy.
Captain Arnold’s battery and the cavalry were directed and placed in their positions by my senior staff officer up to the time when Colonel Heintzelman ordered the cavalry to the front of the column.

On arriving on the ground, I was ordered to form line of battle on the right of the Fourteenth Regiment. We were then ordered to advance

to a fence a short distance in front; then moved by the right along the road. We here received a destructive fire from the enemy, which caused a temporary break. We ascended the hill, and were called upon by Major Wadsworth, of General McDowell’s staff, to charge the woods on our right. Three companies on the right (Captain Burger, Captain Gregory, and Captain Johnson) dashed forward in the woods, dislodging the enemy. We then left the woods, and immediately formed line in face of the enemy on the brow of a hill. We here received a fire from the enemy, and returned it. The fire now became so hot that the men were ordered to fall back in the woods. One company of the left wing did not come into action up to this time.
I was now called upon to aid the Twenty-seventh Regiment, and rallied what force could be gathered at the time under direction of Quartermaster Cornell. I then collected the remaining portions of the regiment on the skirts of the woods, and with them I tried to form a junction with the Fourteenth Regiment, which was well on the right. The force under Major Sykes made a charge. A portion of my regiment became entangled with them, and moved forward with them. I called on Major Wentworth to rally the men, which was found impossible to do, they were so scattered. At this time the retreat was sounded, and we left the field.
I cannot close this communication without calling your attention to the valuable assistance rendered by Major Wentworth and Quartermaster Cornell, and the gallant conduct of Captain Johnson and his command, and the handsome and self-sacrificing conduct of Surgeon Foster Swift, Asst. Surg. G. A. Winston, and Asst. Surg. C. S. De Graw, by declining to leave the wounded, and were consequently made prisoners.
Respectfully,

Hdqrs. Twenty-seventh Reoiment N. Y. V., Camp Anderson, Washington, J). (7., July 23,1861.
Sir : Pursuant to orders, I hereby submit for your consideration a report of the operations of the Twenty-seventh Regiment New York State Volunteers, under command of Col. H. W. Slocum, in the battle at Bull Run, on July 21, 1861.
At precisely 2 o’clock a. m. we formed in column for march in rear of the Marine Corps, commanded by Major Reynolds. After an exhausting march of eight hours, the enemy were discovered to be in force on our front and left. Fifteen minutes after their appearance we were hurried on at double-quick time for the distance of at least one mile, and formed in line of battle by the left flank on the brow of the hill commanding a part of the enemy’s position. Without coming to a halt, we were ordered to charge the enemy by a road leading to the valley beneath us, where they were in numbers strongly positioned in and about a large stone house, with a battery of six mounted howitzers commanding the

approach. The men, though greatly fatigued and exhausted, gallantly attacked and drove the enemy from the house, who retired in disorder behind their battery, leaving a large number of killed and wounded on the held. The battery was next attacked, and after receiving eleven rounds hastily retired, taking up another position about one hundred and fifty yards on our left and front.
We were immediately attacked on our right flank by a large force, who approached by a ravine under cover of a thick growth of bushes, and in the front by about 1,500, who had been driven from their position on the hill commanding our left, and whom we mistook for the Eighth New York Regiment coming to our support. By this mistake we lost many killed and wounded, besides the opportunity of capturing a large number of prisoners. We were now engaged by more than twice our own numbers, and fired upon from concealed positions, and receiving the fire of the battery from its new point of attack. Perceiving the necessity of support, I rallied about 200 of the Eighth New York Regiment on the brow of the hill commanding the enemy, and the colonel withdrew the regiment to the top of the hill in a perfectly exhausted condition, formed, and marched them into the woods for rest.
During our retreat Colonel Slocum received a wound from a musket ball in the right thigh, which rendered it necessary for him to retire from the field, which he did, placing the command in my hands. After remaining half an hour in this position I w as commanded by Captain Averell, aide-de-camp to the colonel commanding, to join a united charge to be made against the enemy’s strongest position by all the regiments not actually engaged at that moment. I marched in four ranks, under fire of the battery commanding the road, to the creek, and filed to the right, under protection of its banks, to await the general assault. Seeing our forces engage the enemy by small detachments, and not in the order in which the attack was commanded to be made, that they were repulsed and driven back in disorder, and believing that no assistance I could render would avail in restraining the troops or stay their flight, I withdrew my command in perfect order to the heights above the stream, and formed in line of battle, facing the enemy, and remained in position until thousands of troops had passed to our rear in flight and confusion. I then, at the urgent solicitation of the line officers, marched to the rear in direction of the retreat, and again formed, by command of General McDowell, in line of battle, facing the enemy, that he might have a nucleus to form the division upon once more. The attempt proving ineffectual, I again marched to the rear, and by his command formed tn line a third time. It being impossible to form in any force upon our lines, I withdrew the regiment from the field, and after a short rest joined the retreating column.
In the retreat to Washington we lost two sergeants, believed to have been cut off* from the regiment at the bridge which was fired upon by the enemy, and many men from exhaustion.
I am happy to report that during the whole day the men of the regiment behaved coolly and gallantly, promptly obeying every order, and that they never once retreated or gave way before the enemy without a positive command.

Major, Commanding.]

Report of Maj. George Sykes, Fourteenth U. $. Infantry, commanding battalion of Regulars.
Headquarters Battalion of Regulars,
Camp Turnbull, Va., July 24, 1861.
Captain : In compliance with yonr circular of the 23d instant, I have the honor to report the following casualties that occurred in my command during the recent battle before Manassas: Three commissioned officers wounded; one assistant surgeon missing; 13 rank and file killed, 17 wounded, 12 of whom are missing; 42 missing. A list is inclosed.* Many of the latter are supposed to have taken the Alexandria road by mistake, and will no doubt rejoin their colors to-day.
This battalion, composed of two companies of Second U. S. Infantry, five companies of the Third IJ. S. Infantry, and one company of the Eighth Infantry, left its camp near Centreville about 3.30 a. m. on the 21st instant, and after a circuitous march of ten or twelve miles arrived on the enemy’s left, and was immediately ordered to support the force under Colonel Burnside, which was suffering from a severe fire in its front. Our line was rapidly formed, opening fire, and a column under Colonel Heintzelman appearing at the same moment on our left, the enemy fell back to the rising ground in his rear. My battalion was then advanced to the front, and took a position on the edge of a wood immediately opposite a masked battery and a large force of the secessionists posted about a house and the fences and trees around it. My three left companies were deployed as skirmishers under Captain Hodge, Eighth Infantry, and did great execution among their ranks. At this time the whole battalion became actively engaged, and a Rhode Island battery coming into action on my right, and having no support, at the request of its commanding officer, and seeing myself the necessity of the case, I remained as a protection to his guns. For more than an hour the command was here exposed to a concentrated fire from the batteries and regiments of the enemy, which seemed doubled when the guns of the Rhode Islanders opened. Many of my men assisted in working the latter battery.
As the attack of our Army became more developed on the right, and the necessity for my staying with the guns ceased, I moved my battalion in that direction, passing through crowds of retiring troops, whom we endeavored in vain to rally. Taking a position on the extreme right, in front of several regiments of the enemy, I opened an effective fire upon them, and held my ground until all our troops had fallen back and my flank was turned by a large force of horse and foot. I then retired a short distance in good order, and facing to the enemy on the crest of a hill, held his cavalry in check, which still threatened our flank.
At this stage of the action, my command was the only opposing force to the enemy, and the last to leave the field. By taking advantage of woods and broken ground, I brought it off without loss, although the guns of our opponents were playing on our line of march from every height. While thus retiring, I received an order from the brigade commander to cover the retreat of that portion of the Army near me, which I did as well as I was able, remaining in rear until all of it had passed me.
After crossing Bull Run my command was threatened by a large force of cavalry, but its order and the regularity of its march forbade

any attack. We reached our camp beyond Centre ville at? 8 p. m. It is but proper to mention that our officers and men were on their feet from 10 p. m. on the 20th until 10 a. m. on the 22d. Without rest, many without food, foot-sore, and greatly exhausted, they yet bore the retreat cheerfully, and set an example of constancy and discipline worthy of older and more experienced soldiers. My officers, nearly all of them just from civil life and the Military Academy, were eager and zealous, and to their efforts is due the soldierly retreat and safety of the battalion, as well as of many straggling volunteers who accompanied my command. The acting major, Capt. N. H. Davis, Second Infantry, rendered essential service by his coolness, zeal, and activity. Captain Dodge, Eighth Infantry, commanding the skirmishers on the left, was equally efficient, and to those gentlemen and all my officers I am indebted for cordial co-operation in all the movements of the day. Lieutenant Kent, although wounded, endeavored to retain command of his company, but a second wound forced him to give it up. He and Lieutenant Dickinson, acting adjutant, wounded, and Dr. Sternberg, U. S. Army, are believed to be in the hands of the enemy.
I beg to call the attention of the brigade.commander to the services of Sergeant-Major Devoe, of the Third Infantry, who was conspicuous for his good conduct on the field. The arms and equipments of my command are in good condition, but the men are destitute of blankets, and in want of necessary clothing.

Report of Maj. John G. Reynolds, commanding battalion of TJ. 8. Marines.
Marine Barracks Headquarters,
Washington, July 24, 1861.
Captain : I have the honor to report the movements and operations of the battalion of marines under my command detailed to co-operate with the Army.
The battalion left the barracks at headquarters in time to reach the Virginia end of the Potomac Long Bridge at 3 p. m. July 16, and proceeded up the Columbia turnpike until an officer, purporting to be the assistant adjutant-general of Colonel Porter’s brigade, came up and assigned us position in the line of march, which placed us immediately in. the rear of Captain Griffin’s battery of flying artillery. This assign ment was continued up to the period of the battle at Bull Bun.
On reaching the field, and for some hours previously, the battery’s accelerated march was such as to keep my command more or less ?n double-quick time; consequently the men became fatigued or exhausted in strength. Being obliged at this period to halt, in order to afford those in the rear an opportunity of closing up and taking their proper place in line, the battery was lost to protection from the force under my command. This I stated to Colonel Porter, who was ever present, watching the events of the day. The position of the battery was

pointed out, and I was directed to afford the necessary support. In taking this position the battalion was exposed to a galling tire. Whilst holding it General McDowell ordered the battalion to cover or support the Fourteenth New York Regiment, which was about to be engaged. The battalion, in consequence, took the position indicated by the general, but was unable to hold it, owing to the heavy fire which was opened upon them. They broke three several times, but as frequently formed, and urged back to their position, where finally a general rout took place, in which the marines participated. No effort on the part of their officers could induce them to rally.
I am constrained to call your attention to the fact that, when taking into consideration the command was composed entirely of recruits— not one being in service over three weeks, and many had hardly learned their facings, the officers likewise being but a short time in the service— their conduct was such as to elicit only the highest commendation.
Of the three hundred and fifty officers and enlisted men under my command, there were but two staff officers, two captains, one first lieutenant, and nine non-commissioned officers and two musicians who were experienced from length of service. The remainder were, of course, raw^ recruits, which being considered, I am happy to report the good conduct of officers and men. The officers, although but little experienced, were zealous in their efforts to carry out my orders.
In the death of Lieutenant Hitchcock the corps has been deprived of a valuable acquisition. On the field he was ever present and zealous. He sought and won the approbation of his commanding and brother officers.
Inclosed please find a return of the battalion, showing its present strength, with casualties, &c.*
The abrupt and hasty retreat from the field of battle presents a deplorable deficiency in both arms and equipments.
The rout being of such a general character, the men of all arms commingled, the only alternative left was to hasten to the ground occupied by the brigade to which we were attached on the morning of the day of the battle. On my way thither I had the good fortune to fall in with General Meigs, whose consternation at the disastrous retreat was depicted upon liis countenance. He was of the opinion the Army should hasten to Arlington, fearing otherwise the enemy wmuld follow up their successes and cut us off on the road. My men being weary and much exhausted, without blankets and other necessaries, I determined to strengthen such as should pass the wagons by hot coffee, and move on to headquarters at Washington City, where their wants could be supplied. But few came up; others continued on to the Long Bridge, where, on my arrival, I found some seventy or more, who, at my urgent solicitation, were permitted to accompany me to the barracks.
In assuming the responsibility of the return to headquarters, I trust my course will meet the approbation of authority.
Blankets were thrown aside by my order on entering the field, which from force of circumstances we were afterwards unable to recover.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major, Commanding Battalion Marines.

Report of Maj. Innis AT. Palmer, Second TJ.. $. Cavalry, commanding
battalion.
Cavalry Camp, near Arlington, July 23, 1861.
Sir : In obedience to circular from brigade headquarters of this date, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command during the battle before Manassas on the 21st instant.
My command consisted of one company of the Second Dragoons, Capt. F. C. Armstrong commanding, two companies of the First Cavalry, under Capt. A. V. Colburn, and four companies of Second Cavalry, under Capts. A. G. Brackett, W. W. Lowe, J. E. Harrison, and First Lieutenant Drummond.
At the commencement of the action the whole cavalry force was ordered to the front, and it took a position on the extreme right of the line. From this point portions were detached from time to time, to support the different batteries and to examine the ground on the left of the enemy’s line. While they were thus engaged, a small body of the enemy’s cavalry, which had charged through the Yew York Zouave Regiment, came within short distance of my command, and I directed a small party, under Sergeant Sachs, of the Second Dragoons, to pursue them. He succeeded in capturing several prisoners, among them General George Steuart, of Maryland.
During the entire action the cavalry, sometimes together and sometimes in detachments, moved by the direction of the commanding general to various points in the field, where there was a prospect of their being able to act to advantage. When the force on the right of our attacking line first gave way, all of my officers, assisted by Governor Sprague, of Rhode Island, endeavored to rally them, and I found it necessary to deploy the cavalry to oppose the retreat of these men. They were, however, totally demoralized, and a galling fire, opened suddenly from the woods in front of us, made all our efforts unavailing.
When the retreat from the field became general, the whole of the cavalry, excepting those killed, wounded, or dismounted by loss of horses, was together, and in good condition. I was directed to cover the retreat, assisted by a section of Arnold’s battery. The enemy rapidly advanced upon the rear, and at the crossing of Bull Run it was necessary to form my command to receive their cavalry. Two shots from the guns of Arnold caused them to retire, and soon after I received orders to push on as rapidly as possible in order to save my command. I reached Centreville about 8.30 p. m., and this place at 5.30 a. m. the next morning.
The conduct of officers and men throughout the day was in the highest degree praiseworthy.*
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Report of Capt. Charles Griffin, Fifth U. S. Artillery.
Camp near Arlington, Va., July 23,1861.
Colonel : In compliance with your instructions, I have the honor to report that Battery D, Fifth Begiment of Artillery, arrived on the battle-field near Manassas at about 11.30 a. m. on the 21st instant, after a march of near twelve miles. The battery immediately opened on the enemy’s battery at about one thousand yards’ distance, and continued firing until his battery was silenced or forced to retire. The battery then advanced about two hundred yards, and opened upon a regiment of infantry formed upon the right of their line, causing it to fall back. The battery then changed position to the right and front, and opened upon a regiment formed near the enemy’s right and a little in front of the one first referred to, doing deadly execution, and causing it to retreat in much confusion.
An order was then received through Major Barry, Fifth Artillery, to advance to the brow of the hill, near the position occupied by the enemy’s battery when we first arrived on the field. The battery opened upon the enemy’s battery amidst a galling fire from his artillery, and continued firing for near half an hour. It then changed position to the right and fired two rounds, when it was charged by the enemy's infantry from the woods on the right of our position. This infantry was mistaken for our own forces, an officer on the field having stated that it was a regiment sent by Colonel Heintzelman to support the battery. In this charge of the enemy every cannoneer was cut down and a large number of horses killed, leaving the battery (which was without support except in name) perfectly helpless. Owing to the loss of men and horses, it was impossible to take more than three pieces from the field. Two of these were afterwards lost in the retreat, by the blocking up of the road by our own forces and the complete exhaustion of the few horses dragging them. The same thing happened with reference to the battery-wagon, forge, and one caisson. All that is left of the battery is one Parrott rifle gun and one 12-pounder howitzer limber.
Of the 95 men who went into action 27 are killed, wounded, and missing, and of 101 horses 55 are missing.*

I would also mention Captain Tillinghast, A. Q. M., who gallantly served with the battery, pointing a piece and rendering valuable assistance.

Hdqrs. Second Brigade, Second Division,
Major-General McDowell’s Column,
Washington, July 24, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the brigade under my command, in common with the rest of the division, left Washington at 3 o’clock p. m. on Tuesday, July 15; encamped that night at Annandale; occupied Fairfax Court-House, and encamped there on Wednesday. On Thursday, July 17, proceeded to Centreville, where we remained till Sunday morning, July 21, when the whole Army took up its line of march to Bull Run.
Nothing of moment occurred till the arrival of the division at the crossing of Bull Run, about 9.30 o’clock, when intelligence was received that the enemy was in front with considerable force. The brigade was ordered to halt for a supply of water and temporary rest. Afterwards an advance movement was made, and Colonel Slocum, of the Second Rhode Island Regiment, was ordered to throw out skirmishers upon either flank and in front. These were soon confronted by the enemy’s forces, and the head of the brigade found itself in presence of the foe. The Second Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers was immediately sent forward with its battery of artillery, and the balance of the brigade was formed in a field to the right of the road.
At this time, much to my sorrow, I met you retiring from the field, severely wounded, and was requested to take charge of the formation of the division in the presence of the enemy. Finding that the Second Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers was closely pressed by the enemy, I ordered the Seventy-first Regiment New York Militia and the Second Regiment New Hampshire Volunteers to advance, intending to hold the First Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers in reserve. But owing to delay in formation of the two former regiments, the First Rhode Island Regiment was at once ordered on the field of action. Major Balch, in command, gallantly led the regiment into action, where it performed most effective service in assisting its comrades to repel the attack of the

enemy’s forces. The Second Rhode Island Regiment of Volunteers had steadily borne the enemy’s attack, and had bravely stood its ground, even compelling him to give way. At this time Colonel Slocum fell mortally wounded, and soon after Major Ballou was very severely injured by a cannon ball, that killed his horse and crushed one of his legs. The regiment, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wheaton, continued gallantly to hold its position.
Soon after, Colonel Martin, of the Seventy-first Regiment New York State Militia, led his regiment into action, and planting the two howitzers belonging to the regiment upon the right of his line, worked them most effectively against the enemy’s troops. The battery of the Second Rhode Island Regiment, on the knoll upon the extreme right, was used in silencing the heavy masked battery of the enemy in front, occasionally throwing in shot and shell upon the enemy’s infantry, six regiments of which were attempting to force our position. Captain Reynolds, who was in command of this battery, served it with great coolness, precision, and skill.
The Second Regiment New Hampshire Volunteers, under Colonel Marston, was now brought into the field, and rendered great service in defending the position. Colonel Marston was wounded early in the action, and Lieutenant-Colonel Fiske ably directed the advance of the regiment.
Thus my whole brigade was brought into the engagement at the earliest possible moment, and succeeded in compelling the enemy to retire. We were wholly without support, bearing the brunt of the contest, until relieved by Major Sykes, of the Third [Fourteenth] Infantry, U. S. Army, who formed his battalion most admirably in front of the enemy, and pouring in a destructive fire upon his lines, assisted in staggering him. At that moment, after the fight had continued an hour or more, Colonel Heintzel-man’s division was seen marching over the hill opposite our left flank, and attacking the enemy at that point, the opposing force was soon dispersed. This point being gained, and the enemy retiring in confusion before the successful charge of Colonel Heintzelman’s division, I withdrew my brigade into the woods in rear of the line, for the purpose of supplying the troops with ammunition, which had become well-nigh exhausted. The Second Regiment New Hampshire Volunteers was sent forward to assist one of Colonel Heintzelman’s brigades, at that time three-quarters of a mile distant, and driving the enemy before them. The battery of the Second Rhode Island Volunteers changed its position into a field upon the right, and was brought to bear upon the force which Colonel Porter was engaging. The enemy’s infantry having fallen back, two sections of Captain Reynolds’ battery advanced, and succeeded in breaking the charge of the enemy’s cavalry, which had now been brought into the engagement.
It was nearly 4 o’clock p. m., and the battle had continued for almost six hours since the time when the Second Brigade had been engaged, with everything in favor of our troops and promising a decisive victory, when some of the regiments engaging the enemy upon the extreme right of our line broke, and large numbers passed disorderly by my brigade, then drawn up in the position which they last held. The ammunition had been issued in part when I was ordered to protect the retreat. The Seventy-first Regiment New York State Militia was formed between the retreating columns and the enemy by Colonel Martin, and the Second Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers by Lieutenant-Colonel Wheaton. The First Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers moved out into the field at the bottom of the gorge near the ford, and remained for fifteen min-

utes, until a general retreat was ordered. The regiment then passed on to the top of the hill, where it was joined by the remainder of the brigade, and formed into column. Large bodies of stragglers were passing along the road, and it was found impossible to retain the order which otherwise would have been preserved. Yet the brigade succeeded in retiring in comparatively good condition, with Arnolds battery of artillery and Captain Armstrong’s company of dragoons bringing up the rear.
The retreat continued thus until the column was about emerging from the woods and entering upon the Warren ton turnpike, when the artillery and the cavalry went to the front, and the enemy opened fire upon the retreating mass of men. Upon the bridge crossing Cub Kun a shot took effect upon the horses of a team that was crossing. The wagon was overturned directly in the center of the bridge, and the passage was completely obstructed. The enemy continued to play his artillery upon the train, carriages, ambulances, and artillery wagons that filled the road, and these were reduced to ruin. The artillery could not possibly pass, and five pieces of the Rhode Island Battery, which had been safely brought off the field, were here lost. Captain Reynolds is deserving of praise for the skill with which he saved the lives of his men. The infantry, as the files reached the bridge, were furiously pelted with a shower of grape and other shot, and several persons were here killed or dangerously wounded. As was to be expected, the whole column was thrown into confusion, and could not be rallied again for a distance of two or three miles. The brigade reached Centreville at 9 o’clock p. m., and entered into the several camps that had been occupied the night before, where the brigade rested until 10 o’clock, when, in pursuance to orders from the general commanding, the retreat was continued. The column reached Washington about 9 a. m. Monday morning, when the several regiments composing the brigade repaired to their respective encampments.
In the movements of my brigade upon this unfortunate expedition I was greatly assisted and advised by his excellency Governor Sprague, who took an active part in the conflict, and who was especially effective in the direction and arrangement of the battery of light artillery attached to the Second Rhode Island Volunteers. It would be invidious to mention officers of the different corps who distinguished themselves upon the field for coolness and bravery. Where all performed their duty so well, I cannot feel justified in specifying particular instances of fidelity. The officers and men were prompt, steady, and brave, and performed the several parts assigned to them in the most gallant manner.
Our loss has been very severe. The Second Regiment particularly suffered greatly. The death of Colonel Slocum is a loss not only to his own State, which mourns the death of a most gallant and meritorious officer, who would have done credit to the service, while his prominent abilities as a soldier would have raised him high in the public estimation. He had served with me as major of the First Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers, and when he was transferred to a more responsible position I was glad that his services had been thus secured for the benefit of his country. His associate, Major Ballou, of the same regiment, was deserving of the highest commendation as a brave soldier and a true man.
Captain Tower, of the Second Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers, received his death-wound at the very commencement of the battle. He was young, a brave and i>romising officer, who is deeply lamented by his comrades and friends. Captain Smith, of the Second Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers, was known among us for his many good qualities of

head and heart. Lieutenant Prescott, of the First Rhode Island Regiment, was also killed in the early part of the action, while gallantly encouraging his company. He was a noble-hearted Christian man, whose memory will be ever fresh in the hearts of his friends.
Among those who are missing I have to mention the names of Lieutenant Knight, of the First Regiment Rhode Island Volunteers, and Dr. Janies Harris, of the same regiment. Both were men wdiom we can hardly afford to lose, and I trust that some measures may be taken by which their fate may be known. Dr. Harris was especially active upon the field of battle in dressing the wounds of the disabled soldiers, and, knowing no distinction between friend and foe, treated the enemy’s wounded men with the same kindness and consideration as those of our own troops. He is probably a prisoner.
Other officers might be mentioned had I the data at hand to specify, but I have not yet received reports from the Seventy-first New York and Second New Hampshire Volunteers. I append a list of casualties so far as reports have been received.*
It is a sad duty to record a defeat accompanied with the loss of so many valuable lives. But defeat should only make us more faithful still to the great cause of humanity and civilization, in order that every disaster should be more than compensated for by an enduring victory.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
A. E. BURNSIDE, Colonel3 Commanding Brigade.
Colonel Hunter, Commanding Second Division.
Providence, August 3,1861.
Colonel : You will observe that my report of the movements of my brigade at Bull Run on the 21st untimo is dated July 24, but three days after the battle. It was made out in the rough on that day, and the next morning (25th) orders came to my camp directing me to get my First Rhode Island Regiment in readiness to leave for Providence on the 7 p. m. train. The work incident to moving a regiment with its baggage so occupied me that I had no time to revise my report, but sent it in as it was, intending at my leisure to make a supplementary one. It will not seem strange that many omissions and some inaccuracies should have occurred, which I now hope to correct.
I stated that after Colonel Hunter was wounded he directed me to u take charge of the formation of the division in the presence of the enemy,” when I should have said, that part of the division in presence of the enemy. I, of course, knew that you commanded the division by virtue of your superior rank$ but you were at that time, as you will remember, in command of your brigade, which you were just bringing into action.
In another part of my report I mention the arrival of Colonel Heint-zelman’s division bn our left. It was Sherman’s brigade, with the Sixty-ninth New York Militia in advance, that arrived at about 12.30 o’clock, and by a most deadly fire assisted in breaking the enemy’s lines, and soon after 1 o’clock the woods on our front, which had been so obstinately held, were cleared of the enemy. My brigade had now been engaged since about 10.30 o’clock.
In my first report I mentioned the opportune arrival of Major Sykes’ battalion. I beg to again mention the bravery and steadiness mani-

fested by Colonel Martin and his entire regiment, Seventy-first, both on the field and during the retreat. Colonel Marston, of the Second New Hampshire, was badly wounded in the shoulder, but, notwithstanding, he remained in the saddle under fire after his wound was dressed, his horse being led by his orderly. The regiment under charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Fiske conducted itself most gallantly. Both officers and men deserve great praise.
Of the two Bhode Island regiments I have already spoken more fully, but cannot close this without again attesting to the admirable conduct of Lieutenant-Colonel Wheaton, of the Second Begiment, and Majors Balch and Goddard, of the First, with the staff and company officers and men of both regiments. No troops could have behaved better under fire.
By an omission in copying my first report the name of Capt. William L. Bowers, quartermaster First Bhode Island Begiment, who is reported missing, was not mentioned. He was a brave and efficient officer, whom I could ill afford to lose. I have good reason to hope that he is alive in the hands of the enemy, and well cared for. Since my original report I have learned that some others of our missing are in Bichmond ; among them Lieutenant Knight and Dr. Harris, of the First Bhode Island Begiment.
I beg to supply an important omission in my first report, by attesting to the courage and efficiency of my personal staff, Chaplain Woodbury, of the First Bhode Island Begiment, aide-de-camp ; Lieutenant and Adjutant Merriman, First Bhode Island Begiment, A. A. A. G., and Lieutenant Beaumont, IJ. S. Cavalry, aide-de-camp, who were all active in their assistance on the field. Lieutenant Beaumont being in the regular service, I beg to recommend him to the notice of the commanding general as a most gallant and deserving young officer. Captain Curson, Seventy-first New York, division quartermaster, and Captain Goodhue, Second New Hampshire, division commissary, rendered most efficient service in their departments. Captain Beynolds’ battery did such good service in so many parts of the field that it has a place in several reports, which renders it unnecessary for me to make further mention of it.
I have the honor to be, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Notwithstanding a fatiguing march of seven to eight hours, we maintained the position assigned us, and the general commanding conceded to Rhode Island, upon the field, the honor of not only frustrating the attempts of a vastly superior force to outflank our left, but driving back in confusion their right flank.
In the retreat resulting from the turning of the right flank of our Army by the enemy, the regiment was brought off in good order, with the brigade to which it was attached, without further serious casualty other than the excessive fatigue arising from and natural to a march of some forty miles in fifteen to sixteen hours.

Report of Lieut. Col. Frank S. Fiske, Second New Hampshire Infantry.
Hdqrs. Second Regiment NT. H. Volunteers,
Camp Sullivan, wmr Washington,	27,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the movements of the Second Regiment New Hampshire Volunteers during the march and battle on the 21st instant. I give the time of our different movements as nearly as possible:
The regiment left its camp near Centreville at 2 o’clock a. in., and immediately took its place in the column of the Second Brigade, under Colonel Burnside. We continued in the column of the brigade until near the field of battle. On arriving at the battle-field (10.30) we were ordered up to support the Rhode Island Battery. Before arriving at the place indicated we were ordered on to the crest of a hill, in a field considerably to the right, exposed to the fire of the enemy’s batteries. We here fired upon some battalions said to be Georgia troops, who retired to the shelter of the woods opposite. After they retired the regiment was withdrawn under the shelter of the brow of the hill. We were then ordered to the left to support the Rhode Island Battery. The men took their position and fired several volleys. Colonel Marston was wounded here and carried to the rear (11.30 a. m.).
We were moved from here to a position on the left and in advance of the Rhode Island Battery, where we fired a few shots at the retreating enemy. After remaining here an hour, more or less, we were ordered to report ourselves to Colonel Heintzelman (1 o’clock p. in.). The regiment moved to a position near his column, and I sent the sergeant-major there several times to report the regiment ready to render any succor or support they were able to afford. The sergeant-major was unable to meet with Colonel Heintzelman or his staff. After remaining in our position some time I received an order (2.30 p. m.) to advance to a position indicated, which was to the left and a quarter of a mile in advance of the troops engaged in that part of the field. The enemy were screened from our sight. As the men were exposed to fire from a battery and from musketry, I ordered them to lie down, and fire whenever any of the enemy were exposed.
After a short time we were ordered to withdraw. The men retired leisurely and in perfectly good order, halting once under the shelter of some woods. On our way to join our brigade we were ordered by an officer of dragoons, whose regiment was in advance in the retreat, to make haste, or we should be cut off by the enemy’s cavalry. Our column • was formed again in the brigade, but before the formation was complete the retreat began, and continued, with a short rest at our former camp, near Centreville, to Washington.
The men obeyed orders with coolness and precision during the whole day. They took every position they were ordered to, and never wavered or retired until ordered to do so, and were among the last, if not the last, to leave the field. Their retreat on the whole route to their camp was unattended by tumult or any disorder further than leaving their ranks. Their conduct throughout the day inspires me with entire confidence in their courage and steadiness, and I hope will meet your commendation.

Report of Col. Samuel P. Heintzelman, Seventeenth U. S. Infantry, commanding Third Division.
Hdqrs. 3d Div. Dep’t NTortheastern Virginia,
Washington, July 31, 1861.
Sir : In obedience to instructions received on the 20tli instant, the division under my command was under arms in light marching order, with two days’ cooked rations in their haversacks, and commenced the march at 2.30 a. m. on the 21st, the brigade of Colonel Franklin leading, followed by those of Colonels Willcox and Howard. At Centreville we found the road filled with troops, and were detained three hours to allow the divisions of General Tyler and Colonel Hunter to pass. I followed with my division immediately in rear of the latter. Between two and three miles beyond Centreville we left the Warrenton turnpike, turning into a country road on the right. Captain Wright, of the Engineers, accompanied the head of Colonel Hunter’s column, with directions to stop at a road which turned in to the left to a ford across Bull Run, about half way between the point where we turned off from the turnpike and Sudley Springs, at which latter point Colonel Hunter’s division was to cross. No such road was found to exist, and about 11 a. m. we found ourselves at Sudley Springs, about ten miles from Centreville, with one brigade of Colonel Hunter’s division still on our side of the run.
Before reaching this point the battle had commenced. We could see the smoke rising on our left from two points, a mile or more apart. Two clouds of dust were seen, showing the advance of troops from the direction of Manassas. At Sudley Springs, whilst waiting the passage of the troops of the division in our front, I ordered forward the First Brigade to fill their canteens. Before this was accomplished the leading regiments of Colonel Hunter’s division became engaged. General McDowell, who, accompanied by his staff, had passed us a short time before, sent back Captain Wright, of the Engineers, and Major McDowell, one of his aides, with orders to send forward two regiments to prevent the enemy from outflanking them. Captain Wright led forward the Minnesota regiment to the left of the road which crossed the run at this place. Major McDowell led the Eleventh Massachusetts Regiment up the road. I accompanied this regiment, leaving orders for the remainder of the division to follow, with the exception of Arnold’s battery, which, supported by the First Michigan, was posted a little below the crossing of the run as a reserve.
At a little more than a mile from the ford we came upon the battlefield. Ricketts’ battery was posted on a hill to the right of Hunter’s division and to the right of the road. After firing some twenty minutes at a battery of the enemy placed just beyond the crest of a hill on their extreme left, the distance being considered too great, it was moved forward to within about one thousand feet of the enemy’s battery. Here it was exposed to a heavy fire of musketry, which soon disabled the battery. Franklin’s brigade was posted on the right of a woods near the center of our line, and on ground rising towards the enemy’s position. In the mean time I sent orders for the zouaves to move forward, to support Ricketts’ battery on its right. As soon as they came up I led them forward against an Alabama regiment, partly concealed in a clump of small pines in an old field. At the first fire they broke, and the greater portion fled to the rear, keeping up a desultory firing over the heads of

their comrades in front. At the same moment they were charged by a company of secession cavalry on their rear, who came by a road through two strips of woods on our extreme right. The fire of the zouaves killed four and wounded one, dispersing them. The discomfiture of this cavalry was completed by a fire from Captain Colburn’s company of U. S. cavalry, which killed and wounded several more. Colonel Farnham, with some of his officers and men, behaved gallantly, but the regiment, as a regiment, did not appear again on the field. Many of the men joined other regiments, and did good service as skirmishers.
I then led up the Minnesota regiment, which was also repulsed, but retired in tolerably good order. It did good service in the woods on our right flank, and was among the last to retire, coming off the field with the Third IJ. S. Infantry. Next was led forward the First Michigan, which was also repulsed, and retired in considerable confusion. They were rallied, and helped to hold the w oods on our right. The Brooklyn Fourteenth then appeared on the ground, coming forward in gallant style. I led them forward to the left, where the Alabama regiment had been posted in the early part of the action, now disappeared. We soon came in sight of the line of the enemy, drawn up beyond the clump of trees. Soon after the firing commenced the regiment broke and ran. I considered it useless to attempt to rally them. The want of discipline in these regiments was so great, that the most of the men would run from fifty to several hundred yards to the rear and continue to fire— fortunately for the braver ones, very high in the air—compelling those in front to retreat. During this time Ricketts’ battery had been taken and retaken three times by us, but was finally lost, most of the horses having been killed) Captain Bicketts being wounded, and First Lieut. D. Ramsay killed. Lieutenant Kirby behaved with great gallantry, and succeeded in carrying off one caisson.
Before this time heavy re-enforcements were distinctly seen approaching by two roads, extending and outflanking us on the right. Colonel Howard’s brigade came on the field at this time, having been detained by the general as a reserve at the point where we left the turnpike. It took post on a hill on our right and rear, and for some time gallantly held the enemy in check. I had one company of cavalry attached to my division, which was joined during the engagement by the cavalry of Colonel Hunter’s division. Major Palmer, who commanded them, was anxious to engage the enemy. The ground being unfavorable, I ordered them back out of range of fire.
Finding it impossible to rally any of the regiments, we commenced our retreat about 4.30 p. m. There was a fine position a short distance in rear, where I hoped to make a stand with a section of Arnold’s battery and the U. S. cavalry, if I could rally a few regiments of infantry. In this I utterly failed, and we continued our retreat on the road we had before advanced in the morning. I sent forward my staff officers to rally some troops beyond the run, but not a company would form. I stopped back a few moments at the hospital, to see what arrangements could be made to save the wounded. The few ambulances that were there were filled, and started to the rear. The church which was used as a hospital, with the wounded and some of the surgeons, soon after fell into the hands of the secession cavalry, who followed us closely. A company of cavalry crossed the run, and seized an ambulance full of wounded. Captain Arnold gave them a couple of rounds of canister from his section of artillery, which sent them scampering away, and kept them at a respectful distance during the remainder of our retreat.
At this point most of the stragglers were in advance of us. Having

every reason to fear a vigorous pursuit from the enemy’s fresh troops, I was desirous of forming a strong rear guard, but neither the efforts of the officers of the Eegular Army nor the coolness of the regular troops with me could induce them to form a single company. We relied entirely for our protection on one section of artillery and a few companies of cavalry. Most of the road was favorable for infantry, but unfavorable for cavalry and artillery.
About dusk, as we approached the Warrenton turnpike, we heard a firing of rifled cannon on our right, and learned that the enemy had established a battery enfilading the road. Captain Arnold, with his section of artillery, attempted to run the gauntlet, and reached the bridge over Cub Eun about two miles from Centreville, but found it obstructed with broken vehicles, and was compelled to abandon his pieces, as they were under the fire of those rifled cannon. The cavalry turned to the left, and, after passing through a strip of woods and some fields, struck a road which led them to some camps occupied by our troops in the morning, through which we regained the turnpike. About 8 p. m. we reached the camps we had occupied in the morning. Had a brigade from the reserve advanced a short distance beyond Cub Eun near one-third of the artillery lost might have been saved, as it was abandoned at or near this crossing.
Such a rout I never witnessed before. No efforts could induce a single regiment to form after the retreat was commenced. Our artillery was served admirably, and did much execution. Some of the volunteer regiments behaved very well, and much excuse can be made for those who fled, as few of the enemy could at any time be seen. Eaw troops eannot be expected to stand long against an unseen enemy. I have been unable to obtain any report from the zouaves, as Colonel Farnham was wounded, and is sick in the hospital. I have only the list of the killed and wounded. Since the retreat more than three-fourths of the zouaves have disappeared. The brigade and regimental reports, with the lists of the killed and wounded, are inclosed herewith.
I beg leave to express my obligations to the officers of my staff, viz: Capt. Horatio G-. Wright, Lieut. G. W. Snyder, and Lieut. Francis U. Farquhar, of the Engineers; Capt. Chauncey McKeever, assistant adjutant-general ) Lieut. John J. Sweet, Second Cavalry, and Lieut. John D.

Report of Col. William B. Franklin, Twelfth U. 8. Infantry, commanding First Brigade, Third Division.
Headquarters First Brigade, Third Division,
Department Northeastern Virginia, July 28, 1861.
Captain : I have the honor to make the following report on the operations of the brigade under my command in the action at Bull Bun on the 21st instant:
The brigade consisted of Light Battery I, First Artillery, Capt. J. B. Ricketts; the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment, Colonel Lawrence; the Eleventh Massachusetts Regiment, Colonel Clark, and the First Minnesota Regiment, Colonel Gorman. The Fourth Pennsylvania Regiment had been attached to the brigade until the morning of the 21st instant, but as its term of service expired on that day it refused to go forward, and when the remainder of the brigade marched forward it marched to the rear. The brigade left camp near Centreville at 2.30 a. m., in the following order: 1st, Minnesota regiment; 2d, Ricketts’ battery; 3d, Fifth Massachusetts Regiment; and, 4th, Eleventh Massachusetts Regiment, The Minnesota regiment was arranged with the two front companies ready to act as skirmishers; the next three companies as the advanced guard, and the remainder of the regiment formed the head of the column. The men were furnished with three days’ provisions in their haversacks.
At Centreville a delay of more than two hours took place, to enable General Tyler’s and Colonel Hunter’s columns to pass Colonel Heint-zelman’s. The march then recommenced, and continued without inter-

ruption until the brigade reached Bull Run, about 11 o’clock a. m., after a march of about twelve miles.
Colonel Hunter’s column had by this time become engaged with the enemy, and Ricketts’ battery was immediately ordered to cross the run and hold itself in readiness for action. The Minnesota regiment was ordered to cross to support the battery, and was, by a subsequent change in the order, placed in position on the left of the field. The Fifth and Eleventh Massachusetts Regiments were, for a very short time, held in reserve on the left bank of the run. Ricketts’ battery was directed to take position in a field towards the extreme right of our line, and commenced firing at a battery of the enemy placed just beyond the crest of a hill on our left. After firing for about twenty minutes at this point, the battery was moved to a point about one thousand feet from the enemy’s battery, where it was immediately subjected to an incessant fire of musketry, at short range, disabling it almost immediately. Here Captain Ricketts was severely wounded, and First Lieut. D. Ramsay was killed. The battery also lost, in the course of a few minutes, eleven non-commissioned officers and men killed, and fourteen wounded. Many horses were also killed, so that the battery was entirely crippled, and its remains were drawn off the field, all of the guns being left on the field.
While the battery was in its first position, the Fifth and Eleventh Massachusetts Regiments were brought to the field, and took position just behind the crest of a hill about the center of the position. Here they were slightly exposed to the fire of the enemy’s battery on the left, and were consequently thrown into some confusion. This was shown by the difficulty of forming the Eleventh Regiment, and by wild firing made by both regiments. They fired without command, and in one or two instances, while formed in column, closed in mass.
From this point both regiments were ordered to proceed to the vicinity of the point where Ricketts’ battery was disabled, to try to get back the guns. They went there, and, with the help of some other regiments on their right, the enemy was driven from the guns three times. It was impossible, however, to get the men to draw off the guns, and when one or two attempts were made, we were driven off by the appearance of the enemy in large force with heavy and well-aimed volleys of musketry.
The First Minnesota Regiment moved from its position on the left of the field to the support of Ricketts’ battery, and gallantly engaged the enemy at that point. It was so near the enemy’s lines that friends and foes were for a time confounded. The regiment behaved exceedingly well, and finally retired from the field in good order. The other two fegiments of the brigade retired in confusion, and no efforts of myself or staff were successful in rallying them. I respectfully refer you to Colonel Gorman’s report* for the account of his regiment’s behavior and of the good conduct of his officers and men.
Colonel Hartranft, of the Fourth Pennsylvania Regiment, whose regiment refused to march forward that morning, accompanied me to the field as aide-de-camp. His services were exceedingly valuable to me, and he distinguished himself in his attempts to rally the regiments which had been thrown into confusion.
I respectfully recommend to your favorable consideration the officers of my staff— Capt. Walworth Jenkins, First Artillery, acting assistant adjutant-general) Lieut. J. P. Baker, First Dragoons, aide-de-camp, and Lieut. C. H. Gibson, Second Dragoons, acting quartermaster and commissary of the brigade. Their efforts were unremitting in carrying orders and in attempting to rally the dispersed troops.

I cannot refrain from paying a tribute to the gallantry of Captain Ricketts and Lieutenant Ramsay. The service has sustained a serious loss in the temporary removal of Captain Ricketts from duty, and the cool and determined bravery of Lieutenant Ramsay was admired by all who witnessed it. It may be a consolation to his friends to know that he unflinchingly died a soldier’s death, regretted by all.
I transmit with this a list of the killed, wounded, and missing of the brigade.*
It is my firm belief that a great deal of the misfortune of the day at Bull Run is due to the fact that the troops knew very little of the principles and practice of firing. In every case I believe that the firing of the rebels was better than ours. At any rate I am sure that ours was very bad, the rear files sometimes firing into and killing the front ones. It is to be hoped that practice and instruction will have corrected this evil by the time that we have another battle.

Report of Lieut. Edmund Kirby, First U. S. Artillery.
Washington, D. C., July 23,1861.
Sir : I submit the following report :
On Sunday, July 21, Capt. J. B. Ricketts was ordered to place his battery in position at about one thousand five hundred yards from the enemy. An order was afterwards received to advance about one thousand yards, which was executed at a trot, and where we remained in battery, firing as fast as possible, until obliged to retreat, leaving six rifled guns on the field.
Capt. J. B. Ricketts was severely wounded at this critical moment, and First Lieut. Douglas Ramsay was killed.
Lieut. W. A. Elderkin conducted the limbers and caissons to the rear, as I was separated from the battery at the moment the retreat became general. I joined the battery soon after and continued the retreat, but was obliged to abandon everything at Bull Run except three limbers and fifty-six horses.
The non-commissioned officers and privates acted with great bravery, and remained on the field as long as possible.
Our casualties are: Left on the field, 6 rifled guns and 49 horses; abandoned on the road, 6 caissons, 3 limbers, 1 battery-wagon, and 1 forge. Killed: 1 officer and 11 men: wounded, 1 officer and 14 men. Total, 27.t

Report of Col. 0. B. Willcox, First Michigan Infantry, commanding Second Brigade, Third Division.
Detroit, Mich., September 3,1862.
General : My brigade, the Second, of Heintzelman’s division, marching in rear of Franklin’s brigade, arrived at the Sudley Ford at about 12.30 p. m., July 21, 1861. The brigade now consisted of the First Michigan, Eleventh New York (Fire Zouaves), Thirty-eighth New York, and Arnold’s battery. The Fourth Michigan had been left at Fairfax Station and Fairfax Court-House by the order of General McDowell. Halting for rest and water, I obeyed the general’s orders to post Arnold’s battery on a hill commanding the ford, with the First Michigan for support, and at 1 o’clock pushed forward with my two remaining regiments up the Sudley and Brentsville road. We marched about two miles, and came upon the left of what I supposed to have been Franklin’s line, near the junction of the Warrenton and Sudley roads. The troops on our left were engaged in a desultory fire with the enemy, posted in the thicket and ravine across the Warrenton road, not far from the Kobinson house. The Thirty-eighth New York was quickly formed in order of battle, and the zouaves were hastening into line, when I received an order to detach a regiment for the support of Bicketts’ battery (of Franklin’s brigade), posted on a hill a quarter of a mile to our right and front, near Dogan’s house. I led up the zouaves for this important service, leaving the Thirty-eighth under its gallant and experienced colonel, Hobart Ward. Bicketts was soon ordered to take a new position near the Bobinson house. The zouaves followed in support, and finally formed line on the right flank of the battery, with two companies in reserve.
Up to this time the enemy had fallen back, but now he formed the remains of his brigades engaged with Hunter in the morning, viz, Bee’s, Barton’s, and Evans’, in a new line, upon Jackson’s brigade of fresh troops, making altogether 6,500 infantry, 13 pieces of artillery, and Stuart’s Cavalry, according to General Beauregard’s report. This force was posted in the belt of woods which skirted the plateau southwardly, and lying in the angle formed in that direction, between the Warrenton and Sudley roads, about a mile from the Warrenton road, and with its left resting on the Brentsville and Sudley road.
Bicketts’ battery had crossed the Sudley road from its post near Dogan’s house, and was within musket-range of the woods, which stretched from that road around from his right towards his front, and forming a pocket, which almost enveloped the battery, with its support.
The enemy were first discovered by Colonel Heintzelman lining the woods in our front. He ordered up the zouaves, commanded by Colonel Farnham. The ground was slightly rising before us, and the enemy opened a heavy but not destructive fire as we reached the crest. The zouaves returned the fire, but immediately fell back, bewildered and broken. Stuart’s Cavalry charged upon them from the woods on the right, but were scattered by a fire from the two reserve companies, with a loss (ascertained from the Southern papers) of twenty-nine killed and wounded. Meantime Bicketts’ cannoneers were being picked off. With Colonel Heintzelman’s approval, and a promise of re-enforcements, I collected some one hundred zouaves, and, with Captain Downey and others of their officers, made a dash into the woods on our right, and killed, wounded, and captured about thirty of the enemy. Beturning in a few minutes, I found the field cleared of both friends aud foe, except

409
the killed and wounded. The horses, men, and two officers of Ricketts’ battery lay stretched upon the ground, but the enemy had not yet seized it. Recrossing the Sudley road, I met the First Michigan, Major Bid-well commanding, and, marching back with this regiment, we found the enemy now drawn up in a thin line across the field and in possession of the battery. Advancing to the fence on the roadside, the First Michigan opened fire. The right wing fell back to reload, owing to a blundering order, but the left stood firm, expelled the enemy, and retook the battery. The troops here opposed to us I believe to have been the Seventh Georgia. Colonel Heintzelman now came up, and ordered us promptly forward, and, with the promise of another regiment, it was my design to turn the enemy’s left. The left wing of the First Michigan recrossed the field, struck into the woods beyond the zouaves, succeeded in destroying and capturing a small number of the enemy, and pushing back his extreme left out of that part or point of the woods adjacent to the Sudley road.
Meantime the right wing of the First Michigan reformed, and advanced in good order. I met it, and we pushed on towards the next point of woods. From this point I found the enemy’s left discovered us by our fire, and we became engaged with their rear rank, their front being occupied by the advancing troops of Franklin’s or Sherman’s brigade. The officers and men of the First Michigan stood up bravely at this critical moment, holding on anxiously for re-enforcements. But, from all I can learn, the Thirty-eighth, which was ordered up to me, wras directed to the left of the Robinson house (instead of to the right and along the Sudley road), came in contact with the enemy’s center, and never reached me.
It was now 4 o’clock. General Beauregard had been gathering new re-enforcements. General Kirby Smith had joined him with a portion of Johnston’s army. Our scattered troops were contending in fractions against the enemy’s army, in position and massed on the plateau, with his artillery sweeping every approach. General Johnston was bringing fresh troops to turn our own right. The Twenty-eighth Virginia attacked my own handful from the rear in the woods, and I had the ill-fortune to be wounded, and a few moments afterwards captured. But I was spared witnessing the disaster which further pursued our arms.
In this report I have only endeavored to supply partly the information that was not known or found in any other report, in consequence of my capture. Permit me to add, further, that the Thirty-eighth Xew York was distinguished for its steadiness in ranks, and for gallantly repelling a charge made upon it by the Xew Orleans Tigers. The zouaves, though broken as a regiment, did good service, under my own eyes, in the woods, and detachments of them joined other regiments in the fight. The First Michigan deserves the credit of advancing farther into the enemy’s lines than any other of our troops, as their dead bodies proved after the battle.
I only regret that, from the fact of my separation from Arnold’s battery, I cannot add any testimony of my own to the well-known gallantry with which he and his command conducted themselves.
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, vours,
O. B. WILLCOX,
Brigadier-General, late Colonel First Michigan Infantry.

Washington, D. C., July 21,1865.
This report is respectfully forwarded. It gives some details not in previous reports. The Thirty-eighth New York, Colonel Ward, was in the rear and a little to the right of the Robinson house, and did not get up as far as the house. After the zouaves, I led up the First Minnesota and then the First Michigan, and both were repulsed. They, however, rallied and passed to the right into the woods, and the First Michigan, on the extreme right, held the most advanced position we occupied that disastrous day. My division, when I marched from Alexandria, had an aggregate of 9,463 men, but from detachments made by the commanding general at different times, I went into action with less than 5,000 men. The Third Brigade, Colonel Howard, did not arrive on the field until late in the day, about the time the panic commenced. He was detached soon after we crossed Cub Run, early in the day, by General McDowell. I did not see the brigade until some half hour after I was wounded and after the Brooklyn Fourteenth gave way.
In consequence of the wounding and capture of Captain Ricketts, I have no report of his battery. His first lieutenant, Douglas Ramsay, I saw late in the day doing his duty faithfully and well. A few moments later he was shot dead, and soon after we lost the battery.
The accompanying report from Fairfax Station, dated July 17,1861, properly belongs to this report.

Report of Col. J. H. Hobart Ward, Thirty-eighth New York Infantry, commanding Second Brigade, Third Division.
Hdqrs. Second Brigade, Third Division,
Camp near Shooter’s Hill, July 29, 1861.
Sir : The temporary command of this brigade having devolved uxion me in consequence of the mishap to Colonel Willcox, I have the honor to transmit herewith the following report; also, the regimental reports of a portion of the brigade, viz: From the First Michigan Regiment, the Scott Life Guard (Thirty-eighth Regiment New York State Volunteers), containing detailed accounts of their action during the engagement near Bull Run, on Sunday, 21st instant ; the remaining regiments of the brigade, viz, the Fire Zouaves (Eleventh Regiment New York State Volunteers) and Arnold’s battery having already rendered their reports to division headquarters.
This brigade commenced the action under command of Colonel Willcox, of Michigan, who was wounded while gallantly leading his command, and whose bravery could not have been excelled, and who is now a prisoner in the hands of the enemy. While I deeply deplore the circumstances by which it became my duty to forward this report, yet it affords me much gratification to speak in terms of the highest commendation of the brave and officer-like conduct of the gentlemen composing his staff, viz, Lieutenants Woodruff, Parker, and Edie, in their efforts to bring order out of chaos under a most galliug and deadly fire

from the enemy. Having myself been in command of the Thirty-eighth Regiment (Scott Life Guard) New York State Volunteers during the action, I am unable to speak as particularly as could be desired of other regiments of the brigade from personal observation, and respectfully refer you to their respective reports. The reports of killed and wounded furnish sufficient evidence of their fidelity and courage. But of the field officers of the Fire Zouaves I can speak in terms of unqualified praise. Colonel Farnharu, Lieutenant-Colonel Cregier, and Major Leoser were incessant in their exertions in rallying and encouraging their men. The officers and men of the First Michigan nobly discharged their duty to their country, and well may their State feel proud of her defenders. The officers and men of the Thirty-eighth being under my own supervision, I can only corroborate the report rendered by Lieu, tenant-Colonel Farnsworth. Where all acted so well it would appear invidious to make comparisons; but in the case of Lieutenant-Colonel Farnsworth, Thirty-eighth Regiment, I cannot find words to express my admiration of his conduct. He was confined to a sick bed for several days previous to the engagement, and arrived on the scene of action in an ambulance; and the fact of his rising from a sick bed and entering the field with his regiment, and his courage and coolness during the day, entitle him to the highest commendation.
In conclusion, I most respectfully submit that the duty of making this report devolving upon me at so late a day—intelligence of the absence of Colonel Willcox not having reached me until the day after the battle—renders it impossible to give a more detailed statement.
My duty as commander of the brigade being ended with this report, I am, sir, your obedient servant,

Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the First Regiment Michigan Infantry, on the 21st instant, at the battle of Bull Run:
At 2.30 o’clock of that morning the regiment left its bivouac, and was in position, with the other regiments of Colonel Willcox’s brigade, prepared for the advance. At 6 o’clock the forward movement commenced, and about 12 o’clock noon, after a long, rapid march over roads thick with dust, and where but a scant supply of water could be obtained, the regiment was halted with the brigade in a field to the right of the road leading from Centreville, and on the right of the enemy’s entrenchments. After a brief rest, the regiment, together with Arnold’s battery, moved across the road and took position in a wheat-field, the other regiments composing the brigade having moved towards the battle-field. But a short time elapsed when the regiment was ordered forward, and at a double-quick was hastened to the scene of action to support the Fire

Zouaves, who had charged and fallen hack. Moving in column by platoon along the slope of the hill under the tire of the enemy’s batteries we lost one color-bearer and several of our men. The regiment was here filed to the left along a ravine, then marched up the hill, and formed in line of battle near its summit, directly in front of the enemy’s position. The regiment was at once ordered to charge, and moved gallantly on, exposed to a sharp fire, up to a fence intervening between it and the enemy’s works. Here some little confusion occurred, the position of the enemy not being clearly understood, so rapid had been our movements, and the regiment halted, firing and loading under the cover of the fence. An order given at this time not clearly heard, a portion of the line fell back to reload. They were at once rallied back to the fence, when the regiment was reformed in line of battle and led on by Colonel Willcox in advance of our center, the regiment, responding to the wave of his cap with a cheer, cleared the fence, and charged down the slope upon the enemy’s battery.
A heavy and well-directed fire was at once opened upon us from his batteries and by his infantry, screened by the woods on both our flanks. The regiment moved bravely on, the fire becoming very destructive. The enemy being hid from view, and their fire coming from every direction, the line was broken, and the men in detachments, guided by their officers, when the enemy could be distinguished, loaded and fired with the utmost coolness and precision. At this time heavy masses of the enemy advanced along the road near their battery to our right, and, flanking us, their fire became actually murderous. The men stood it coolly, and advancing, divided as they were, into the line of woods, answered his fire. The enemy’s fire being continuous from every quarter, their infantry advancing on us through the wood in great force, our officers and men falling all about us, the regiment unsupported in rear or flank, there was but one thing to be done, and, gathering what we could about the colors, we fell back and reascended the acclivity to the spot from whence our first charge was made. Here we rallied as many of the men of the regiment as was possible, and endeavored to collect stragglers from other regiments.
In the hope that we could more successfully stop fugitives by retiring more from the line of fire, we fell back and continued our efforts to reform. The enemy now appearing in overwhelming strength on the right, we moved on to our bivouac of the morning, near Centre ville, which was occupied by the regiment in comparatively good order.
After two or three hours’ rest, in obedience to orders, the regiment took up the line of march in good order for Washington.
Inclosed I transmit a list of the casualties of the day.* The loss is heavy, and occurred mostly in front of the enemy’s batteries. The loss of the officers is very large proportionately to the men, and is sufficient proof not only of their gallantry, but of the murderous fire that the regiment sustained. Xo troops could have maintained their formation for any length of time under such a fire. Hurried into action after a march of twelve miles over an exceedingly dusty road, with but little water and no time for. rest and refreshment, our fatigued men evinced a courage, coolness, and endurance that entitle them to the highest praise.
The regiment went into the action four hundred and seventy-five men and twenty-five commissioned officers strong, and returned with a loss of nine officers and one hundred and eight men killed, wounded, and

missing; being a proportion of loss of one-third of the officers and one-fifth of the men lost or injured in the vicissitudes of the day.
Of the fate of Colonel Willcox there is no certain information. It is known, however, that his horse was shot under him, and that he received a wound in the arm while advancing upon the enemy’s battery at the head of the regiment, and it was while engaged in the act of binding up his wound, as is believed, that Captain Withington, of Company B, who was acting as major, received a wound and fell on the field.
Captain Butterworth, Company C, was also shot, and has not since been heard from. Captain Lum, of Company A, acting as lieutenant-colonel, was wounded in the knee, and is now in Washington, as is also Captain Graves, of Company K. Lieutenants Casey, Company G, Mauch, of Company F, and Parks, of Company H, were also wounded, and have not been heard from. Lieutenant Warner, of Company I, also wounded, is now in Washington. Of those brave men who have met their fate in the engagement I cannot speak in too high terms. The regiment will cherish the memory of their gallantry. Nor can I refrain from referring with highest commendation to the valuable services, bravery, and good conduct of all the officers on the field. Where all performed acts of gallantry and valor, it would be invidious to particularize, and I trust that all will alike find in the terrible proportion of their loss the best record of individual worth.

Hdqrs. Thirty-eighth Begiment, N. Y. Y.,
(Second Scott Life Guard),
Camp Scott, near Alexandria, Va., July 29,1861.
Sir : In compliance with my duty, I respectfully submit the following report of the operations of my regiment during the recent battle at or near Bull Bun, on the 21st July, 1861:
On the morning of the 21st, in obedience to brigade orders, the regiment was formed, the men equipped in light marching order, and prepared to leave its bivouac at or near Centreville. The march, however, was not commenced until 6 o’clock a. m., when the regiment, with others constituting the brigade, advanced towards the scene of future operations.
After a fatiguing march over dusty roads, and at times through dense woods, the men suffering greatly from the intense heat and a great lack of water, and submitting to the same with a true soldierly spirit, the regiment, with others of the brigade, was halted in a field, in full view of the enemy, on the right of his line of intrenchments, and within range of his artillery. After a very brief rest the regiment was formed in line of battle, and ordered by Colonel Willcox, the commandant of the brigade, to advance to a slight eminence fronting the enemy’s batteries

﻿414	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
and about half a mile distant, to the support of Griffin’s battery, which was then prepared to take up a position at that point. This order was promptly executed, the men, led by yourself and encouraged by the gallantry of their officers, moving forward in gallant style in double-quick time, subjected a greater portion of the way to a terrible and deadly fire of grape and canister and round shot from the enemy’s works on our front and right flank. Arriving at the brow of the eminence in advance of the battery which it was intended to support the regiment was halted, and commenced, in fact, the attack of Colonel Heintzelman’s division on the right flank of the enemy, engaging a large force of his infantry, and by a well-directed fire completely routing an entire regiment that was advancing in good order and driving it into a dense woods in the distance.
After remaining in this position for some time, finding that the enemy’s artillery was telling with fearful effect upon our ranks, subjected as we were to a direct and flank fire from his batteries, the regiment was ordered to retire down a slight declivity, wffiich was done in good order, affording it for a time partial protection from tho enemy’s fire.
At this time Griffin’s battery was moving to a position on our right, and the regiment was ordered by Colonel Heintzelman, in person, to advance to its protection. Advancing by the flank under a galling fire, the regiment was halted within supporting distance of Griffin’s battery, which had now opened upon the enemy, and properly formed to resist a threatened attack from the enemy’s cavalry and infantry, which had shown themselves in large numbers on the borders of a grove to the right and front. In this position my regiment, under a spiteful and destructive fire from the enemy’s batteries, remained until forced to retire, and its presence not being deemed requisite because of the fact that Griffin’s battery had been compelled to leave the field. Retiring to a road about one hundred yards distant, my regiment was again formed in line of battle, and under the eye of the commander-in-chief, General McDowell, the men, inspired by his presence upon the field and led by yourself, it dashed gallantly up the hill towards a point where Ricketts’ battery had been abandoned, in consequence of its support, the First Fire Zouaves and First Michigan Regiment, having previously been compelled to retreat in the face of superior numbers and a great loss in their ranks.
Before arriving at the brow of the hill we met the enemy in large force 5 one of his infantry regiments, apparently fresh upon the field, advancing steadily towards us in line of battle. A large number of the men of this regiment had advanced in front of their line, and had taken possession of Ricketts’ battery, and were endeavoring to turn the guns upon us. A well-directed and destructive fire was immediately opened upon the enemy by my regiment and a portion of another that had rallied on our left (I think the Fourteenth New York State Militia), and after a sharp conflict he was forced to retreat in disorder and with great loss, seeking shelter in the wqods from whence he had previously emerged.
The enemy not succeeding in taking with him Ricketts’ battery, which seemed to have been the chief object of his attack, it fell into the hands of my regiment, by whom three of its guns were dragged a distance of three hundred yards, and left in a road, apparently out of the reach of the enemy. Another rally was then again made by my regiment, the gallant men readily responding to the orders of their

officers. Advancing in double-quick time to the right and front towards a dense woods, in which the enemy had been concealed in large force during the day, and from which evidences of a retreat were now visible, my regiment, with detached portions of others of our force, became engaged in a sharp and spirited skirmish with the enemy’s infantry and cavalry, and we appeared for a time to have complete possession of the field.
This was the last rally made by my regiment. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the enemy, re-enforced by fresh troops, literally swarming the woods, poured in upon us a perfect shower of lead from his musketry; his batteries reopened upon us with terrible effect, and a panic at this moment seeming to have taken possession of our troops generally, a retreat was ordered, and my regiment in comparatively good order commenced its march towards Oentreville, wdiere a greater portion of it arrived about 9 o’clock that night. Here, on the same ground that we had bivouacked previous to the battle, the regiment was halted. After a rest of about two hours it again resumed its march, joining in the general movement made by the Army towards this place. After a forced and wearisome march of seven hours, the men suffering from the great fatigue of the previous fifteen hours, without food for that length of time, with scarcely water enough to moisten their parched tongues, many of them wounded, sick, and otherwise disabled, my regiment, with the exception of about fifty who had straggled from their respective companies and joined the mass that were thronging to the capital, halted at its original camp-ground near Alexandria, the only regiment of the brigade that did so—the only regiment, in fact, that was under fire during the previous day that returned to and occupied their old camp-grounds previous to their advance towards the field of battle. It is with great pride, sir, that I mention this fact, evincing, as it emphatically does, a degree of subordination commendable in any regiment, and reflecting great credit upon the gallant officers and men of my own, particularly under the extraordinary circumstances connected with the occasion.
From the time my regiment was ordered in the field until forced to retire therefrom—a period of four hours—it was almost constantly under fire from the enemy’s batteries and engaged with the infantry 5 and to your coolness and courage alone during that time, your frequent orders for the men to lie down when the enemy’s fire was the hottest, and your constant efforts to protect them as far as possible at all times, was the regiment saved from presenting a larger number of casualties than its large list now shows.
Of the courage displayed by the men generally on the field during the entire day$ of the readiness of the gallant fellows to obey at all times all orders, I cannot speak in too high terms or express in words my admiration. During all my experience in a former campaign and presence on many a battle-field, I have never witnessed greater bravery or more soldierly requisites than were displayed by the men of my own regiment during the entire battle.
The conduct of the officers generally I cannot speak too highly of. Always at their posts cheering on their men by their soldierly examples, and displaying marked gallantry under the trying circumstances, I acknowledge my inability to do them justice in words. Major Potter was disabled during the early part of the engagement while gallantly performing his duty, and subsequently fell into the hands of the enemy. The brave Captain McQuaide, while cheering on his men, fell from a se-

vere wound in the leg. Lieut. Thomas S. Hamblin, a gallant young officer, also received a wound in his leg while discharging his duty, and he, with the former officer, subsequently fell into the hands of the enemy. Captains McGrath and Allason both received injuries during the engagement, the‘former by being run down by the enemy’s cavalry (from the effects of which he is now suffering) and the latter by a slight musket-shot. Lieut. John Brady, jr., while bravely participating in the fight, was severely wounded in the arm. Asst. Surg. Stephen Griswold was on the field and under a heavy fire, at all times humanely and fearlessly discharging his duties to the wounded. He and Quartermaster Charles J. Murphy, who was assisting the wounded, were also taken prisoners.
In conclusion, I again assert my inability to do justice to the gallant conduct of the officers generally, and while it would afford me great pleasure to mention the names of many whose conduct fell under my personal observation, I must refrain from doing so, lest by omitting others I should do injustice to many equally as meritorious. Annexed is a list of the casualties in my regiment.*

Report of Capt. Richard Arnold, Fifth U. S. Artillery.
Washington, D. C., July 25,1861. Sir : In compliance with your order, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of Light Company D, Second Artillery, in the battle of the 21st instant, at Bull Bun:
The brigade to which my battery was attached halted, on arriving to the right and rear of the enemy to rest the men and prepare for action, and the battery was placed under cover in a ravine to await further orders. As soon as the brigades in advance became engaged, I was ordered to place my battery to the left and rear, to guard well that flank, and prevent its being turned and the enemy gaining our rear. Scarcely was this position reached when orders came to move forward as quickly as possible to the support of Captain Ricketts, then warmly engaged in front and in great peril. The pieces were immediately limbered, and the battery run up under whip and spur, and placed in position about eight hundred yards from the enemy’s lines, to support and give confidence to the volunteers. A rapid and incessant fire was kept up for one hour and a half, throwing at least four hundred rounds of shot, shell, spherical case, and some canister, and I was informed did good execution. Their loss from artillery must have been very heavy. During all this time the battery was exposed to a severe and most accurate artillery fire.

Owing to the great loss of horses, the exhaustion of the men, and the fear that I should not be able to bring my pieces off the field, the volunteers supporting me having left the position assigned them very soon after 1 commenced firing, I was induced, after consultation with my officers, to withdraw to the left and rear, when Lieutenant Barriger was dispatched to Colonel Heintzelman. He returned without finding him. I then, in the absence of any superior officers, moved to the right, where I thought I could be of great service, and at once received orders from Captain Fry to cover the retreat, as I was informed the order to retreat had been given.
During the rest of the day I commanded the left section and brought up the rear, the right section, under Lieutenant Barriger, being in advance of the regular cavalry. At one time a body of the enemy’s cavalry threatened our rear, but two rounds of canister dispersed them, and we were not again threatened until we arrived near Cub Run, when the battery was exposed to a severe flank and enfilading fire from artillery and infantry to a bridge across that stream, which had been destroyed or broken in by the advanced trains and artillery. Seeing at once that it was impossible to push forward or extricate the guns, I gave orders to spike them and clear as many horses as possible. Had my battery not been detailed in the rear, it might have been saved; but it was sacrificed to prevent a total rout and great loss, which would certainly have ensued had not the display of cavalry and artillery given the impression that the Army was retiring in good order.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the officers of my company, Lieutenants Barriger and Throckmorton, for their gallantry and efficiency during the action. The non-commissioned officers and privates alt to a man stood to their posts and performed their duties most gallantly.
From fifteen to twenty horses were killed and wounded on the battlefield and at Cub Run.
The following is a list of the killed, wounded, and missing.*

The column was formed at 2.30 a. m. in rear of Colonel Willcox’s brigade, about a mile this side of Centreville. Here we waited till the sun was an hour high, when the rear of Colonel Willcox’s column began to move. We followed with the usual baitings along the War-

renton turnpike till we turned into the narrow road to the right. Here we found General McDowell. As soon as my leading regiment had passed him he halted the brigade. We waited in this place till near noon, when the order to rejoin your division was received. We had marched near a mile, when Captain Whipple met us, and conducted us along the same road that you had passed. We turned to the left, and took a cross road before reaching the road you took.
When we came into the open plain we were met by my brigade quartermaster, Lieutenant Burt, who had preceded us on to the field of battle. He said, 44 Colonel Heintzelman orders you to move at double-quick.” I gave the order, and we marched nearly a mile at this pace, when I found the men so much exhausted that they could march so no longer. The rear of the column, having lost distances, moved much of the time at double-quick. The last two miles the head of the column marched at quick time. Many dropped out and fainted from exhaustion.
As soon as we reached the second open space past the hospital for wounded men, your aide met me and ordered that I should move across the plain into the valley to our left, and there form line and march up through the thicket, to support a battery. Captain Fry also reiterated the same instructions. In the manner indicated, I formed the first line, composed of the Fourth Maine, Colonel Berry, and the Second Vermont, Colonel Whiting. This line I marched up the hill. When we cleared the thickets, we found one caisson, and Lieutenant Kirby, with his face covered with blood, on a horse that had been shot through the nose. My line passed this caisson, and just as the Vermont Second gained the crest of the hill the order to fire was given. The Fourth Maine, which was delayed a little by the thicket, then came up into line, and commenced firing. The enemy’s battery on the left, and the one on the right, that soon came into position, with the showers of musket balls from the front, made it rather warm work for new men; but they stood wrell, or rallied to fire between twenty and thirty rounds per man.
After the first line had been formed, and was well at work, I returned and brought up the second line. A remnant of the Fifth Maine and the Third Maine composed this line. A part of the Fifth had retreated, as near as I can learn, they having been discomfited by our own cavalry and by a cannon ball striking their flank. Major Staples, with the Third Maine, replaced the Vermont Second; the Fourth Maine continued on the field, and the Fifth Maine (what was left—I should judge about the strength of four companies) took the extreme right. Soon this line began to break and fall back, an order for a wing to retire being understood for the whole. Major Mekerson I noticed then. He asked me if I had given the order to retire, and I shook my head. He aided me especially, as he always has done, in rallying the command. Colonel Dunnell said he was entirely exhausted and could hold out no longer. Many officers strove to reform ranks, but we could not under fire, so I gave the order to retire under cover and form. The order to retreat came to my ears before I left the field.
There was very little organization before we reached Centreville, where we halted for an hour. At Centreville I learned that you were to retreat. I marched at the head of my brigade in good order to Fairfax Court-House. Here we lay on our arms till morning, and not being able to ascertain what orders were intended for us from conflicting statements, I continued my march towards Alexandria, halted at Clermont, and were taken to Alexandria by cars sent out for the purpose.
As to conduct on the field, I myself noticed Colonel Berry, Lieutenant-Colonel Marshall, and Major Mekerson, whom I have already noticed;

also Major Staples and my quartermaster, Lieutentant Burt, who had volunteered with the Third Maine. They were at their posts and doing their duty. Colonel Whiting was at his post when I left for the second line, and I refer to his report for notice of his field and other officers. They were not wanting. Colonel Dunnell I have previously mentioned. I noticed Major Hamilton trying to rally and encourage his men. I wish particularly to speak of the ready and fearless manner in which my aides, Lieutenants Buel and Mordecai, assisted me.
My brother, Charles H. Howard, gave no little assistance in the midst of danger, and my orderly, John Zantish, followed me closely, fearless of exposure. I shall trust to the commanders of regiments to do justice to the officers and soldiers of their commands. The fallen have given their lives, and deserve the highest praise for their good conduct, which is all we can send of comfort to their stricken families at home. The readiness of these soldiers to sacrifice themselves for their country deserved a better result. God grant it be different in the future.

Clermont) Fa., July 27,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the operation of the regiment under my command, Third Maine Volunteers, at the battle at Bull Bun, Sunday, July 21,1861. My regiment left camp at Centreville at 2.30 o7clock on the morning of the 21st, with the Third Brigade, under your order. After a tedious march, we arrived at Bull Bun, to within half a mile of the enemy’s battery. At 2 o’clock p. m. at this place the regiment was halted under cover of the woods in front, to recover from their fatigue. After remaining in this position some fifteen minutes we were ordered into line of battle, and proceeded to engage the enemy. They were marched to the top of the hill, one-fourth of a mile from their resting place, when the enemy’s battery opened upon us from the right with terrible effect. The men stood firm in their position, firing in volleys about twenty rounds with good effect, when they retired to the foot of the hill, reformed, and returned to the encounter. Finding we were wholly unsupported, there being ft one of our troops in sight and no batteries to assist us, we again retired, after a desperate struggle of about fifteen minutes, under a raking fire from the batteries of the enemy. My regiment retired from the field over the plain, in full view of the enemy, in good order, but on reaching the

woods became somewhat scattered. They soon rallied, however, and marched in retreat at route step to their camp at Centreville.
I would take this opportunity to mention the heroic conduct of several officers of the regiment, and particularly of Capt. E. Burt, of the brigade staff, who met me on the way and tendered his valuable services to act in capacity of adjutant. He deserves the hearty support and good-will of the entire regiment.
Captain Hesseltine, before leaving camp with his company, engaged in prayer, and was heard to say to his men, u Trust in God, stand by the flag, and you will know no fear.” They did stand by, one and all, and the captain cared not for his own comfort, but ministered to the wants of the wounded, and conducted a part in safety to the camp.
Captains Sawyer, Heath, Lakeman, and Lieutenants Hatch, Hall, Wiggin, Colson, Johnson, Watson, Savage, and Harvey evinced true courage, kept their positions during the engagement till ordered to retire, and administered to the wants of the suffering.
The report of the killed, wounded, and missing, as far as can be ascertained,, is as follows.*

Sir : I have the honor to report to you my regiment now in quarters at this post. The engagement with the enemy on Sunday, and the long march incident thereto, have exhausted my men, and some time must necessarily elapse before the regiment will be fitted for active duties. As near as can be ascertained, the loss in killed in the engagement at Bull Bun consists of two commissioned officers, Lieutenant Clark, of Company G (Wiscasset), and Lieutenant Burd, of Company F. Two commissioned officers wounded, Captain Bean and Lieutenant Huxford. Sergeant-Major Chapman killed; twenty-eight privates killed and thirty-three wounded, t This indeed has been an unfortunate affair for this regiment.
I herewith hand you report of wants for regiment, in accordance with order so to do. In doing so, I must beg leave to say that my men have no confidence whatever in the kind of arms with which we are now partially supplied. Had they been properly armed, the result of Sunday’s loss would have been somewhat different. It will take some time to bring the regiment up to that sfete of confidence in the managers of this war that it had prior to last Sunday’s affair. I mention these things

Report of Col. Marie H. Bunnell, Fifth Maine Infantry.
Alexandria, Ya., July 26,1861.
Sir : The Fifth Regiment of Maine Volunteers is now in quarters in this city. It came to this place with the rest of your brigade on Monday. The other reports which have been called tor, and the condition of the regiment, have not allowed me time to report the action of the regiment on the field July 21, and as you were an eye-witness of its action, I have not deemed it necessary to make so great haste in the preparation of this report. I deem it due to many of the officers of my regiment to make a report.
The rapid movement of our men for many miles before the commencement of the action completely unfitted them for the labor of the action. None but an immediate eye-witness can fully realize the real sufferings of the men during the march. The best, stoutest, and bravest men failed, and fell by the roadside. The colonel, major, and surgeon were on the field, and took part in the action by a discharge of their respective duties. Captain Scammon, Company H; Captain Thompson, Company D$ Captain Thomas, Company G; Captain Sherwood, Company F ; Captain Goodwin, Company B, and Captain Heald, Company A, were each with their respective companies, and with marked courage and self-possession discharged their duties. Captain Noyes was under arrest. Captain Tobie was absent on furlough, and Captain Sawyer and Captain Edwards were absent by reason of exhaustion caused by the march. Lieutenant Barrows, of Company C ; Lieutenant Buckman, of Company K; Lieutenant Walker, of Company G; Lieutenant Munson, of Company H$ Lieutenant Sawyer, of Company G 5 Lieutenant Walker, of Company F, and Lieutenant Millett, of Company A, were the only lieutenants in their companies at the time of the action, and these officers deserve much praise for the heroic manner in which they met duty. Company B was fully officered at the time of the action. Captain Goodwin and Lieutenants Stevens and Pillsbury were all present, and it is to be reported that not one of Company B was killed or mortally wounded. Captain Sherwood was badly wounded in the left arm by a musket ball. Lieutenant Kenniston, Company I), was wounded and then taken prisoner. Dr. Buxton, surgeon, and hospital stewards were taken by the enemy.
The officers and privates of the regiment are in great need of rest, and, when fully recruited, will, I doubt not, be ready to meet any of the demands which may be made upon their endurance or their courage.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Got. Henry Whiting, Second Vermont Infantry.
As we approached the field we met many ambulances and litters with the dying and wounded. We were greeted by the crowds of returning stragglers, telling us to hurry on ; that they had driven them a mile. Meanwhile, the fact that we saw no infantry organized gave us a good deal to think of till we came to where the rifled cannon balls fell around. Then, not hearing any artillery from our side, the fact burst upon us that all of the troops, except our brigade, in the neighborhood were routed.
The Second Vermont was ordered to form on the left of the Maine Fourth. vLine was formed; we marched up the hill-side, and about half the distance to the next eminence, about two hundred yards in front, where the infantry and artillery of the rebels were stationed in force. The Vermont Second formed in line, and deliberately fired with rapidity from fifteen to twenty rounds. The enemy retreated before the fire, upon which, and the fact that a body of troops came up to fire over our heads, the commands were given by the colonel, “Cease firing! By the right flank, right face! Forward, march!” but on account of the talk and the confusion created by others coming up in the rear, the command was not heard far from the right. The right company marched to the right a short distance, when it was discovered that a battery of rifled cannon was so planted as nearly to enfilade our regiment, when a retreat was ordered, or, in other words, to file right, which would have brought us off the field; but, so great seemed the desire to continue the fight for a time, my directions were either misunderstood or delayed in execution, [which] kept the regiment on the field a short time longer than I wished it to have remained.
As to the conduct of the officers and men in the presence of the enemy, they exhibited the utmost coolness and bravery. The Bennington company, with its excellent rifles, was very effective. Lieutenant-Colonel Stannard stood square up to the work, as well as Major Joyce and Adjutant Ladd. Captain Hope, notwithstanding he was in the rear during the forced march with his company, worked very effectively to the last. Indeed, all of the officers and men on the field behaved well; and though some gave out by the wayside through inability to proceed, which, when one considers the trip, would wonder that so many could proceed, and none but those in good health could possibly have made the march.
Yours, very truly,

consequence of the route being obstructed. Fn route we had some three or four skirmishes, the last one being within three miles of our present camp.
In this, so far as is ascertained, one officer and one private were slightly and one private seriously wounded. I will report more particularly as to this when the official returns reach me.
The obstructions on my route consisted of barricades, some of them quite extensive, caused, by felling trees across the road. Within a mile of my present position we came upon quite an extensive earthwork, badly constructed, but capable of considerable defense. The i>arapet was about six feet thick, revetted with poles, with a command of several feet. The line was four hundred or five hundred yards in length. We found this work deserted. At the location of our present camp I found the camp of the Fifth Eegiment Alabama troops, which had just been deserted.

not be able to report the operations of my division on the 21st instant before Bull Run. Believing, besides, that commanders of brigades are directed to report to headquarters, I offer the following for the consideration of the general commanding:
Pursuant to instructions, the brigades of Blenker and Davies, soon after daylight, were in readiness to march and take position, but were prevented from so doing by other divisions blocking up the road. I discovered, however, that Davies7 brigade could be passed to the left and west through fields to Blackburn’s Ford. Lieutenant Prime, Engineer officer, conducted the brigade, and as soon as possible it joined Colonel Richardson before the crossing of this ford on Bull Run. Fire was then opened by Hunt’s battery, supported by Richardson’s brigade on the right. Edwards’ 20-pounder rifled guns were posted on the left, about six hundred yards from Richardson’s position, and sustained by a portion of Davies’ brigade. Blenker’s brigade took position at Centreville, and commenced throwing up intrenchments—one regiment being located at the former work of the enemy, one to the west of the town on the Warrenton road, and two on the heights towards Bull Run. With these last regiments were first placed Tidball’s and Greene’s batteries, Greene’s afterwards being removed to Richardson’s position, in consequence of notification being sent by that officer that about 2,000 of the enemy w ere about to attack him, and that he required more artillery.
I may here remark that some difference existed in the order given Lieutenant Prime and myself in regard to the defensive works to be thrown up, and also as to the quantity of tools he was to receive; my orders being, by the lieutenant’s advice, to intrench Centreville; his, from Major Barnard, to throw up works at Blackburn’s Ford. ISTo tools came forward but the small amount Lieutenant Prime had of his own. These he took to Richardson’s position, commenced a battery, and made several hundred yards of abatis. Blenker, with his pioneers, improved and extended the works at Centreville left by the enemy.
It was soon reported that the Fourth Pennsylvania Regiment had left at its encampment a battery of field guns. For this Colonel Blenker offered to organize a company of experienced European artillerists, which I accepted. The captain’s name, I regret, I have forgotten, as I should recommend his having permanent command of the guns in question. He is an efficient officer.*
So soon as I completed my arrangements with Blenker I visited Colonel Richardson; found him in proper position, and effectively at work, Hunt’s and Edwards’ batteries being in good position. There was no evidence of the enemy immediately about the ford until after the first opening of the fire, when he fled from barns and houses in the vicinity. I then, after ordering proper supports for the batteries and placing a reserve force in position, returned to Centreville, finding all quiet and the troops at work. Remaining here some time, I returned to Richardson when it was surmised that there was no enemy at that place, and found the ammunition of the batteries rapidly diminishing. I ordered from the brigades a few skirmishers to go forward and examine the ford, determined, if I could cross, to do so, and endeavor to cut the line of travel pursued by retreating and advancing detachments of the enemy. The line of skirmishers had barely entered the woods when a large force of the enemy was discovered concealed by breast-
*This paragraph refers to the field battery belonging to the Eighth New York State Militia, which was manned by detachments from the Eighth and Twenty-ninth New York Infantry, under Capt. Charles Bookwood, of the latter regiment. (See Colonel Blenker’s report, p. 426.)

works. He opened fire, which was handsomely returned. In this affair three of the Sixteenth New York Volunteers were wounded. The skirmishers report the force of the enemy greatly damaged by Greene’s battery. I made no other attempt on this ford, my orders being on no account to get into a general engagement.
As I was again returning to Blenker’s position, I received the notice to telegraph to Washington, whichlfound hadbeendone by Lieutenant Men-dell, topographical engineer, on my staff, and who was compelled by Illness to remain at my headquarters. It was at this time the order was received to post two brigades on the Warrenton turnpike at the bridge. I without delay sent a staff officer to order forward Davies’ brigade, but whilst this officer was executing my instructions Davies sent word he wanted a reserve regiment forward—that the enemy, some 3,000, was attempting to turn his flank. The staff officer, therefore, properly suspended the giving of my order, and immediately reported the fact to me, and this caused me to advance but the one brigade (Blenker’s) to the position on the Warrenton pike. Blenker’s advance to that point was soon impeded by fugitives from the battle-field. When these were passing my headquarters I endeavored to rally them, but my efforts were vain.
The attack on Davies’ position caused painful apprehension for the safety of the left flank of the Army, and deeming it of the first importance that my division should occupy the strongest position, I sent instruction to Davies and Biehardson to have their brigades fall back on Centreville. I then followed Blenker’s brigade to see if it was in position, when I was informed the commanding general had passed. I then returned to Centreville, and found Davies’ and Eichardson’s brigades arriving, and commenced placing them in position—Eichardson’s brigade, with Greene’s battery, being placed about one-half mile in advance of Centreville heights, his line of battle facing Blackburn’s Ford. In rear of Eichardson’s I posted two regiments behind fences as a support for the first line, and still farther in rear and on the heights I placed Hunt’s and Edwards’ batteries, two of Davies? regiments being in reserve to support these. I then followed Blenker; found Tidball’s battery in admirable position, supported by the Garibaldi Guard, Blenker, with three remaining regiments and the Fourth Pennsylvania Battery,* being in advance. Having great confidence in his judgment and troops, I returned to Centreville heights to await events, when I found all my defensive arrangements changed. Not knowing who had done this, and seeing Colonel Eichardson giving different positions to my troops, I asked by what authority he was acting, when he told me he had instructions from my superior officer. I soon thereafter met the commanding general, and complained of this change. The general’s arrangements were completed, and left me without further control of the division. At the time the attack was made on Davies’ flank the regiments of the brigade engaged performed their duty gallantly. The batteries of Hunt and Edwards, opening fire, did great damage to the advancing troops of the enemy, soon repulsing them. I am grieved that in this engagement a brave and accomplished young officer, Lieut. Presley O. Craig, of the Second Eegiment Artillery, and who was attached to Hunt’s battery, was almost instantly killed. Several of the New York volunteers were wounded. I have not the reports relative thereto.
Blenker’s brigade, whilst on the Warrenton road, was charged by cavalry, but by a prompt and skillful fire he emptied several saddles, and relieved himself from further annoyance. This summary embraces the operations of my division up to the evening of the 21st.

Before closing permit me to name and do justice to my staff, whose assiduity in the performance of their duties and untiring exertions throughout the day deserve all the commendation I am able to bestow, viz: Captain Vincent, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Prime, Engineer; Lieutenant McMillan, adjutant Second Infantry and acting inspector-general; Assistant Surgeon Woodward, medical director; and Major Bitchie, New York Volunteers, my aide-de-camp. Lieutenant Mendell, Topographical Engineers, was quite ill during the day and thereby prevented from being with me. Lieutenant Hawkins, Second Infantry, division quartermaster, and Lieutenant Cushing, Second Infantry, my aide, were absent on detached service for supplies, &c., and had performed their duty, and were within two miles of Centreville when they met our Army crowding the road. My brigade commanders, Blenker, Davies, and Bichardson, admirably performed their respective duties. My remarks apply also to their officers and men. The batteries of Major Hunt, Captain Tidball, and Lieutenants Edwards and Greene handsomely executed all required of them.
In closing this report I would make a personal allusion to my condition during the day. I had lost my rest the two nights previous, was sick, had eaten nothing during the day, and had it not been for the great responsibility resting on me should have been in bed.

operations of the First Brigade, Fifth Division, during and after the action near Bull Bun, on the 21st ultimo:
Pursuant to the orders of Colonel Miles, the brigade advanced from the camp and took their assigned position on the heights east of Cen-treville about daybreak: The Eighth Begiment New York State Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Stahel, on the left of the road leading from Centreville to Fairfax Court-House; the Twenty-ninth Begiment New York State Volunteers, commanded by Colonel Stein wehr, on the right of the same road, both fronting towards the east; the Garibaldi Guard, commanded by Colonel Utassy, formed a right angle with the Twenty-ninth Begiment, fronting to the south. The artillery attached to the brigade occupied the following positions: The battery of Captain Tidball stood in front of the left wing of the Garibaldi Guard; three pieces left in Centreville were placed near the right wing of the Twenty-ninth Begiment; three others on the left wing of the Eighth Begiment, where intrenchments were thrown up by the pioneers attached to the brigade. The last-named six pieces were served by experienced artillerists detached from the Twenty-ninth and Eighth Begiments. The Twenty-seventh Begiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, Colonel Einstein, was detached to the village of Centreville for the protection of the headquarters and hospital. Four companies of the Twenty-ninth Begiment were detached in front of our position towards the road from Union Mills, to prevent the enemy from outflanking, unobserved, the left wing of the Army.
During this time I received the order to disarm one company of the Twelfth Begiment, which was promptly executed by two companies of the Eighth Begiment New York State Volunteers. In this position the brigade remained until about 4 o’clock p. m., when I received orders to advance upon the road from Centreville to Warrenton. This order was executed with great difficulty, as the road was nearly choked up by the retreating baggage wagons of several divisions, and by the vast numbers of flying soldiers belonging to various regiments. Nevertheless, owing to the coolness of the commanding officers and the good discipline of the men, the passage through the village was successfully executed and the further advance made with the utmost jirecision, and I was thus enabled to take a position which would prevent the advance of the enemy and protect the retreat of the Army. The Eighth Begiment took position one and a half miles south of Centreville, on both sides of the road leading to Bull Bun. The Twenty-ninth Begiment stood half a mile behind the Eighth, en ecliiquier by companies. The Garibaldi Guard stood as reserve in line behind the Twenty-ninth Begiment.
The retreat of great numbers of flying soldiers continued till 9 o’clock in the evening, the great majority in wild confusion, but few in collected bodies. Soon afterwards several squadron^ of the enemy’s cavalry advanced along the road and appeared before the outposts. They were challenged by “Who comes there0?” and remaining without any answer, I being just present at the outposts, called, “Union forever.” Whereupon the officer of the enemy’s cavalry commanded, uEn avant; en avant. Knock him down.” Now the skirmishers fired, when the enemy turned around, leaving several killed and wounded on the spot. About nine prisoners, who were already in their hands, were liberated by this action. Afterwards we were several times molested from various sides by the enemy’s cavalry.
At about midnight the command to leave the position and march to Washington was given by General McDowell. The brigade retired in perfect order, and ready to repel any attack on the road from Centre-

ville to Fairfax Court-House, Annandale to Washington. Besides the six guns which were mounted by our men, and thereby preserved to our Army, the Eighth Begiment brought in safety two Union colors left behind by soldiers on the field of battle. The officers and men did their duty admirably, and the undersigned commander deems it his duty to express herewith officially his entire satisfaction with the conduct of his brigade. The three regiments (the Eighth, Twenty-ninth, and Garibaldi Guard) arrived in Washington in good order at 6 o’clock last night, after a fatiguing march of nineteen hours. The loss of the brigade amounts to fifteen or twenty killed and wounded at the outposts. Thus far my report of the action taken by my brigade in the engagement on the unfortunate day at Bull Bun in a military point of view. It was my intention, although there were in some instances prominent features of action on the part of officers and men, to defer a final report of these facts for a better and more suitable opportunity, on account of the very unfortunate result of the battle. I have read since so many reports in newspapers, where many a high commanding officer pretends to have been in the very rear with his brigade or regiment at the retreat, that I am obliged to repeat in the most absolute terms that, according to my order, all regiments, artillery, and stragglers had passed my arriere guard at Centreville and the last artillery at Fairfax Court-House, and that the brigade under my command not until order was received by General McDowell marched across Long Bridge into Washington.
1 have to add, in conclusion, that the Twenty-seventh Begiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, with the exception of Company K, Captain Men-ninger, which was on guard duty in Centreville village at headquarters and under order to escort Colonel Miles’ train, retired from Centreville at about 11 o’clock without any orders from me, and proceeded to Washington.

Sir : In accordance with circular of the 23d instant, Headquarters Troops Department Northeastern Virginia, I have the honor of reporting the proceedings of the Second Brigade, Fifth Division, at the battle of Blackburn’s Ford, six miles from the battle of Bull Bun, on the 21st instant. The Fifth Division, under the command of Colonel Miles, consisting of the First and Second Brigades, Bichardson’s brigade, and Greene’s and Hunt’s light batteries, formed the left wing of the troops in action. The First Brigade, Colonel Blenker, occupied during the day the heights of Centreville, and were not engaged with the enemy. The Second Brigade, under my command, was in readiness to march from camp at 2.30 a. m., but the road was so blocked with moving troops that my brigade shortly after daylight took a parallel route through the

fields, Greene’s battery in advance, till it struck the road leading to Blackburn’s Ford, about one mile south of Gentreville. At this point Colonel Miles gave me directions to assume the command of Bichard-son’s brigade, and to take position in front of the batteries at Blackburn’s Ford on and near the battle ground of the 18th instant, and make the demonstration of attack, in pursuance of General McDowell’s orders. I immediately ordered forward the two 20-pounder rifled guns of Hunt’s battery, commanded by Lieutenant Edwards, into an open field, about eighty yards east of the road from Gentreville to Bull Bun and on a line with the place where our batteries were playing on the 18th instant, and about fifteen hundred yards from the enemy’s batteries at Blackburn’s Ford, and commenced a rapid firing. I ordered the Eighteenth Begiment forward as a protection to this battery, in the open field, and formed line of battle facing the enemy, the Thirty-second Begiment being held in reserve on the road just in rear.
Having ascertained from my guide that there was a road without obstruction leading from the Gentreville road to the east, and then bearing off toward the south in the direction of the enemy’s position, and which could be seen about half a mile distant to the east from Lieutenant Edwards’ battery, I ordered the Sixteenth and Thirty-first Begiments New York Volunteers on to this road at its junction with the Centreville road ; one regiment deployed along the road a considerable distance, and the other remaining in column to protect two guns of Hunt’s battery whieh I ordered to be stationed at that point. I then gave orders to Colonal Bichardson to make such arrangements with regard to the defense of the position in front of the enemy’s batteries at Blackburn’s Ford (the immediate battle-ground of the 18th instant) as in his judgment the emergency of the moment might require. At this juncture, being about 10 o’clock a. m., and finding the ammunition for the 20-pounder rifle guns was fast running out, and having accomplished, in my judgment, from the movement of the troops opposite, which we could plainly see, the demonstration ordered, I ordered Lieutenant Edwards to cease firing.
About 11 o’clock Colonel Miles came on the ground, informing me that he had ordered forward the Sixteenth and Thirty-first Begiments from the positions in which I had previously placed them, and also the two guns commanded by Lieutenant Platt, and had also ordered forward the other two guns of Hunt’s battery into the open field where Lieutenant Edwards’ guns had been firing, and ordered the Eighteenth Begiment back out of the open field into the woods on the Gentreville road as a reserve. The Thirty-second Begiment, by Colonel Miles’ order, remained as a reserve in column on the Gentreville road, about three-quarters of a mile in rear. Colonel Miles then ordered me to continue the firing without regard to ammunition, which I did till I received an order to stop, about two hours later. As soon as Golonel Miles left me again in command I sent back the brigade corps of pioneers to the back road, whence the two regiments had been removed, with instructions to fell trees and completely block the road, which they effectually did. We had during the afternoon unmistakable evidence that a large column of cavalry and infantry had attempted to take us in rear by means of this road, for when they were returning, having been stopped by the fallen trees, Major Hunt, with his howitzers, and Lieutenant Greene and Lieutenant Edwards, with their rifled guns, poured a heavy fire into their column, the effect of which we could not ascertain, but it must have been destructive, as the distance was only from a half to three-quarters of a mile.

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA.
[Chap. IX.
In tlie course of the day two companies, and later four companies, of the Thirty-first and two of the Sixteenth were, by Colonel Miles’ order, thrown forward to feel the enemy’s strength to the front and left in the direction of Bull Run. They found the enemy posted in the woods, and were recalled. They reported having killed several of the rebel scouts.
The afternoon, till about 4 o’clock, was passed in great inactivity, except the firing by the rifled cannon at moving columns of the enemy at great distances. I had seen unmistakable evidences in the afternoon, by clouds of dust, &c., of the concentration of the enemy’s troops on our left, but received peremptory orders from Colonel Miles to hold the position and remain there all night. He then left me in command for the night, and I immediately began to prepare for an attack. I threw out two companies of skirmishers in the woods to our rear, and ordered the Thirty-second forward to support them.
About 4 o’clock we saw the enemy approaching down a gorge leading into a valley which lay directly to our left, about five hundred yards distant. The field in which I was ordered to remain was inclosed on two sides by dense woods, and covered by light bushes on the side toward the said valley on the left. After the enemy was discovered filing into the valley, no movement was made for some time. When it was supposed from the appearance of things that the last of the column was entering the valley, I ordered all the artillery (six pieces) to change front to the left, but not to fire till the rear of the column showed itself. I placed the artillery with a company of infantry between each piece, and changed the battle front of the two regiments (the Sixteenth and Thirty-first) supporting the artillery to the left, and on a line with the artillery, and ordered every man to lie down and reserve his fire. During the whole time that this order was being carried out the enemy’s troops were still advancing down the hill, four abreast and at right shoulder shift. I gave orders to Lieutenant Edwards, when I saw the rear of the column, to give it a solid 20-pounder shot, which he did, knocking a horse and his rider into the air, and starting on a double-quick the rear of the column into the valley. I then ordered the whole artillery to pour grape and canister into the valley, and at every fire there went up a tremendous howl from the enemy. During all this time the enemy poured volleys of musketry over the heads of our prostrate men. This firing continued from twenty-five to thirty minutes. A portion of the enemy rushed into a barn, and well-directed shots brought out what was left in great haste. The whole force of the enemy, consisting, as nearly as I could estimate from the time of their passage at one point and from what I can find out, of 3,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, was utterly dispersed. A small number of the dispersed troops came up into the edge of the field in the bush (from the number of shots fired, amounting probably to about fifty), and fired five volleys at our prostrate men, but did not succeed in drawing a shot from them in return.
It having been ascertained that the enemy had left the field, from their having ceased firing, and from seeing them run through the bushes in every direction, and hearing at the same time that our troops were falling back on Centreville, I received orders by an aide from Colonel Miles, who was in Centreville, to fall back on Centreville and encamp. I immediately went over to give the same order to Richardson’s brigade on the Centreville road, and also to Greene’s battery, but found they had left some time before by Colonel Miles’ order through an aide. The Thirty-first Regiment, under Colonel Pratt, filed out of the field in rear of the artillery, and the Sixteenth followed, under Lieutenant-Colonel

Marsh, each in perfect order, not having fired a gun at the enemy. The Eighteenth and Thirty-second Regiments were ordered by me to fall back on Centreville, which they did in good order, and my entire brigade, together with Hunt’s battery, fell back on Centreville heights without the least confusion and in perfect order, and assumed positions under the direct command of General McDowell, who sent a major, an aide, to me, directing that my regiments should fall in in accordance with his express orders. The entire left wing was then in complete order, and every man in his place. Having received this order from General McDowell, I left my command, and went to Centreville Centre to look after the sick and wounded and my own baggage train. I returned immediately to my command, and found that Colonel Miles had been superseded, and received an order from General McDowell to take command of the left wing, which I did, encamping on the ground, when the order came for a retrograde movement to fall back on Fairfax Court-House. I formed my brigade, the Sixteenth first, Greene’s battery next, the Eighteenth, Thirty-first, and Thirty-second following, and marched them towards Fairfax Court-House. I found Blenker’s brigade about two miles on the road, in order on each side of it, at “ parade rest.” I communicated with Colonel Blenker, and found that he had received direct orders from General McDowell to bring up the rear and prevent any attack by the enemy. My brigade then continued its march, and arrived in camp at Alexandria, and were in perfect condition on Monday, every regiment, as I understand, having an evening parade, and prepared for duty. Greene’s battery went on to Arlington, from which place I recalled it here yesterday, and the brigade now stands complete as before the battle, with the exception of the list of casualties herewith inclosed, amounting to Lieutenant Craig, of Hunt’s battery, killed, and two privates wounded (one seriously and one slightly), and one private taken prisoner.
In respect to the conduct of the officers under my command on the 21st, I cannot say too much of the practical and industrious perseverance of Colonel Richardson, who commanded his brigade on the Centreville road, who made important impromptu defenses in felling trees, and by temporary fortifications across the road, which, although they were not required from the direction of the attack, would have proved of immense value under other circumstances. His persevering energy during the day was untiring, and I am indebted to him for valuable suggestions as to positions and defense.
To Major Hunt and Lieutenant Edwards, who commanded the batteries on the left, any words that I can use will fall far short of expressing the beauty with which they handled their pieces and the rapidity and precision of their fire. It was the most surprisingly beautiful display of skill ever witnessed by those present.
As to Lieutenant Greene, who had charge of the rifled guns on the right, and was more immediately under the eyes of Colonel Richardson, I can state, from my own observations, that the cool and deliberate manner in which he commanded his battery on that and on previous occasions assure me that he is entitled to more praise than his modest report, which I herewith inclose, would induce [NTo. 61].
As to Colonel Jackson, commanding the Eighteenth Regiment, I can state that during the morning, while he was in the face of the enemy, discharging picket duty, and in line of battle, he and his command behaved with coolness and bravery, and was relied upon in the afternoon as a reserve with great confidence.

Colonel Marsh, commanding the Sixteenth Regiment, ordered into line of battle by Colonel Miles on the field, and in previous picket duty, showed superior drill and discipline, and to their strict obedience or orders in reserving their fire, under the most provoking circumstances, while they were supporting the artillery, may be attributed the safety of the latter, and probably the safety of the left wing.
Colonel Matheson performed various evolutions during the day under orders, at one time protecting one road, at another time another, and then as a reserve in column; and the patience of himself and command, while so acting within sound of fire, is entitled to great credit. Adjutant Howland, Sixteenth Regiment, my acting aide-de-camp, rendered me valuable services in changing the position of the troops from time to time, and, in general, doing all of his duties thoroughly, and much appertaining to others.
To Brevet Second Lieutenant Bradford, acting brigade commissary, and to Acting Quartermaster Woolsey R. Hopkins and Acting Asst. Adjt. Gen. F. H. Cowdrey much praise is due for the gallant manner in which they delivered orders, sometimes under heavy fire.
Surgeon Crandall and Surgeon’s Mate Moore, Sixteenth Regiment, performed their duties with great fidelity and skill, dressing the wounds of many not under my command.
Surgeon Hamilton, of the Thirty-first Regiment, dressed the wounds of over two hundred men at Centreville.
To the teamsters of ordnance and baggage wagons credit is due for having returned all the wagons and teams, and public property of every description intrusted to them, safely to camp.
Joseph B. Rodden, Company K, Sixteenth Regiment, remained on the field at Centreville till the morning after the fight, and drove into camp, with the aid of a negro whom he pressed into his service, thirty head of cattle belonging to the Government, afid arrived at Alexandria on Tuesday morning.	- ; ■ _

Report of Lieut. Col. Samuel Marsh, Sixteenth New York Infantry.
Headquarters Sixteenth Regiment,
Near Alexandria, Va., July 24, 1861.
Sir : The Sixteenth Regiment Flew York State Volunteers, under the immediate command of Lieutenant-Colonel Marsh, left camp near Alexandria, on Tuesday, July 16, in obedience to orders, and proceeded toward Fairfax Court-House as far as Annandale, where the regiment bivouacked for the night. On Wednesday, at daybreak, we resumed our march, having filed off to the left and taken the old Braddock road. At 8.30 a. m. we came upon barricades and obstructions, which had been placed across the road by the rebels to impede our progress. The Sixteenth Regiment led the advance, preceded by Companies A and K of the Eighteenth Regiment and Companies A and B of the Sixteenth Regiment, as skirmishers. About three miles from Fairfax our skirmishers fell in with the first rebel outposts, and exchanged shots with them, when they hastily fell back without doing us any injury. We continued our march for a mile farther as rapidly as the roads could be cleared, when we again came upon a strong force, upon which the outposts had fallen back. Here a brisk skirmish took place. The regiment was promptly formed in line and placed in position. While this was being; done, two wounded men of the Eighteenth Regiment were brought in.. The regiment was advanced in line of battle for about half a mile through the woods in good order, supported on the left by the Eighteenth Regiment, when we came upon a battery and extensive intrenchments which had been secretly abandoned. We then proceeded by the road without further difficulty to within half a mile of Fairfax Court-House, when we came to the abandoned camp of the Fifth Alabama Rifles, who had fled at our approach. Learning here that General McDowell had already occupied Fairfax, we halted for the night. On Thursday morning we resumed our march toward Centreville, and halted near there until Sunday morning, the 21st instant. At 2.30 o’clock a. m. of that day we advanced with the main body towards Bull Run.
The position assigned to the regiment was on the left wing, to support the batteries commanded by Major Hunt, to defeat any flank movement on the part of the rebels. Here the regiment remained in position from 10 o’clock a. m. until 4 o’clock p. m., during which time there was. no appearance of the enemy in our neighborhood, with the exception of a small detachment who fired on Companies B and G, which had been thrown forward in the direction of Bull Run to act as skirmishers. In this skirmish Lieutenant Hopkins received a slight wound in the heel. At 5 p. m. a large force of the enemy, since ascertained to have numbered 3,000 rifles and 2,000 cavalry, were seen rapidly advancing down a deep and well-protected ravine on our left. The position of the regiment was immediately changed by your order to front this, advance,.

and the batteries were brought into position so as to rake the ravine. When the batteries opened their fire the enemy were thrown into con fusion and disorder, but rallied in a moment and poured in three or four volleys, which passed over our heads.
During the operations of the day, it is but just to add that the Thirty-first Begiment, under Colonel Pratt, was stationed on our left, and acted in conjunction with our regiment with coolness and bravery. The Sixteenth Regiment was the last to quit the field, and retired in good order, falling back on the heights of Oentreville. During the night of the 21st, in obedience to orders, the regiment, in connection with the entire force, fell back to Fairfax Court-House, and on the succeeding day returned to its camp near Alexandria.

Camp near Alexandria, Ya., July 22, 1861.
Sir : In accordance with paragraph 723 of General Regulations for the II. S. Army, I have the honor to report the operations of my regiment during the engagement of yesterday.
In obedience to your order, the regiment was ready to march from camp near Centreville at 2.30 a. m. While proceeding to the field I was detached from my regiment and ordered to take command of the Sixteenth and Thirty-second Regiments New York Volunteers, to support Lieutenant Platt’s battery. I turned over the command of the Thirty-first Regiment to Lieut. Col. William H. Browne, and took command as directed; made a reconnaissance in company with Colonel Matheson, of the Thirty-second, Lieutenant-Colonel Marsh, of the Sixteenth, and Lieutenant Platt, of the artillery, and placed said regiments in proper position. I afterwards threw out as skirmishers of the Thirty-second a
company under Captain Chalmers, and a platoon under Lieutenant-----,
of the Sixteenth, and sent them about a mile to the front and left of our position, to guard a road leading from the enemy’s right to our left and rear. In about one hour I was ordered by Col. Dixon S. Miles, the division commander, to proceed with the two regiments and the battery to the front, where I was relieved from command of them and resumed charge of my own regiment. Soon afterwards, by directions of Colonel Miles, I proceeded to the extreme left of our division and supported Major Hunt’s battery. Having thrown out Captain Heiss with his company as skirmishers in the defiles about a quarter of a mile on our left, T rested the remainder of my regiment on the skirt of a wood in rear of the artillery.
About the same time Lieutenant-Colonel Browne, with two companies, was detailed by me to reconnoiter a ravine and wood where it was suspected the enemy was concealed. After deploying and penetrating the ravine to a considerable distance, all at once a smart fire of rifles was opened upon him from a force concealed in the thick timber. He returned the fire and continued skirmishing, assisted by a detachment of

Massachusetts Volunteers, until his men were safely covered. The desired effect of compelling our adversaries to discover themselves having thus been attained, Eichardsoffs battery opened upon them a destructive fire of case-shot and shell. The skirmishers were recalled, and Lieutenant-Colonel Browne reported having discovered a masked battery and a force of at least a thousand men.
Soon afterwards it was discovered that a force of infantry and cavalry, variously estimated at from 2,500 to 4,000 men, were marching on our left through the woods and defile to turn our flunk.
Pursuant to your order, the line of battle was changed to our left flank, and four companies were detached from my regiment, and thrown into the left and rear as skirmishers, under command of Frank Jones, acting major, who held the enemy in check. He received a fire of five volleys of rifles, and retired from the wood, but they did not succeed in drawing our fire, which was reserved for the advance to take our batteries.
At about 6.30 p. m. the order was received to retire upon Centreville. My regiment remained to allow the battery to precede us, being the last except the Sixteenth to quit a field that had successfully been held against tremendous odds.
I deem it to be a duty to give the names of the officers of my regiment who were engaged in the battle, and to whose coolness and judgment I am indebted for the success that attended my regiment:
Lieut. Gol. William H. Browne; Acting Maj. Frank Jones; Acting Adjutant Edward Frossard; Volunteer Aides A. L. Washburn and Frank Hamilton, jr.; Maj. Frank H. Hamilton, M. D., surgeon; Lucien Damainville, M. D., assistant surgeon; George Marvin, acting assistant surgeon; Edward A. Brown, acting assistant surgeon.

Company I—Capt. John A. Eue, Chaplain S. W. Waldron (acting first lieutenant), Second Lieut. Hamilton Hair.
Company K—Capt. John H. Watts, First Lieut. William Maitland, Second Lieut. F. E. Waldron.
Among those not soldiers who rendered effective and gallant service among the skirmishers was John M. Pierce, who with his rifle killed a field officer and one soldier of the advancing foe.
To conclude, the non-commissioned officers and soldiers of my command behaved with such gallantry that it were invidious to make distinctions until the time for promotion shall actually have arrived.

Sir : In compliance with your circular order of this date, just received, I have the honor to report that, on the morning of the 21st instant, my battery was placed in position in reserve near Centreviiie by Colonel Miles, commanding division, in person. Shortly afterwards, I received an order to hasten to the front with it, at Bull Run, as the enemy were there in force, and supposed to be attempting to turn our left flank. I took it forward as rapidly as possible, and came into action on the crest of a hill about six hundred yards from the enemy’s line of skirmishers. I opened fire immediately upon a fixed battery partially masked by the woods, at a distance of about fifteen hundred yards, and also upon a point where it was known another masked battery was placed. The enemy were congregated in considerable force inside of the first battery, but as soon as I got the range the spherical case shot dispersed them and they disappeared from that position for nearly three hours. I then ceased firing, while skirmishers were thrown to the front from Colonel Richardson’s brigade to feel the strength of the enemy in the edge of the woods in front of us. They were found to be in overwhelming force, and as our skirmishers retired theirs advanced in very strong force, but incautiously presented their flank to my battery. I threw in canister and spherical case as rapidly as possible, killing and wounding several, the first shot knocking over three. I kept up this fire for about five minutes, when I supposed the enemy were driven from that immediate vicinity. I then turned the fire of the battery upon columns of dust seen rising above the woods and indicating the march of troops in mass. Whether any effect was produced or not by this fire I cannot say.
At this time Lieutenant Prime, of the Engineers, directed my attention to a group of thirty or forty horsemen, evidently officers, on the plateau opposite, who, with maps on their horses’ necks, were apparently taking a view of our position and strength at a safe distance. By digging a hole under the trail I got two pieces bearing upon them at an angle of twenty-five or thirty degrees. The distance must have been two and one half or three miles, but the first shot sent the center figure of the group to the rear ; the second scattered the remainder in all directions. Firing was then ordered to cease at all the guns, for some time nothing appearing worth attention, until finally a cloud of dust was seen approaching our position from the direction of Manassas upon a road that was entirely concealed by woods from our sight except at one bare spot within our best range, and the range of this point we had got accurately before. The guns were all prepared with shell and spherical case, and pointed upon this spot. When the head of the column appeared it proved to be a battery of light artillery. I opened fire upon it instantly, and fired with the utmost rapidity. The smoke of the guns obscured my sight, so that I saw none of the effect produced, but Colonel Richardson, who was looking with a glass, informed me afterwards that I cut them up badly, and forced them to turn back. We saw them no more. Shortly after this one of my men called my attention to the battery we first fired upon. The enemy were endeavoring to plant a field piece, the horses of which were just passing to the rear as I looked with my glass. I opened upon them with spherical case, firing several rounds. When the smoke cleared away there was no gun to be seen, and the battery gave me no more trouble during the day.
About this time heavy re-enforcements commenced being sent into the

main action from Manassas, passing along the plateau opposite, and at about two miles distance. I fired upon them as often as large masses could be seen to justify firing at such a distance. Not much effect was produced, so far as I could see. One column of cavalry was, however, scattered in all directions by a solid shot. Very little firing was done by us for the next two hours, at which time we were ordered to Cen-treville to protect our left flank and our retreat. I chose a position on the crest of a hill, which from its shape gave me command of the ground to our left, and also of the road along which our division was retiring. From the position I could perfectly sweep with my fire 180° front right and left down a gentle slope. Four regiments were placed as my supports, and the force at the point could have stopped double its number.
At this time an unauthorized person gave the order to retreat. I refused to obey the order, but all my supporting regiments but one (Colonel Jackson’s Eighteenth New York) moved off to the rear. Colonel Jack-son most gallantly offered his regiment as a support for the battery, saying “ that it should remain by me as long as there was any fighting to be done there.” The above-mentioned unauthorized person again made his appearance at this time and again ordered me to retreat, and ordered Colonel Jackson to form in column of division on my right and retreat with me, as all was lost. The order was, of course, disregarded, and in about two minutes the head of a column of the enemy’s cavalry came up at a run, opening out of the woods in beautiful order. I was prepared for it, and the column had not gone more than a hundred yards out of the woods before four shells were burst at their head and directly in their midst. They broke in every direction, and no more cavalry came out of the woods. Shortly after my battery was ordered to fall a little farther to the rear, to form in a park of artillery. At that point the battery remained until about 12 o’clock at night, when it was ordered to take up the line of march for Washington, which point it arrived at in perfect order, although much exhausted, men and horses having been hard at work for thirty hours, almost without food and water and without sleep.
My officers, Lieutenants Cushing, Harris, and Butler, were coolly and assiduously attentive to their duties during the day. The accuracy of our fire was mainly owing to their personal supervision of each shot. The men of the company behaved well, and every one seemed to try and do his duty in the best possible manner. My only trouble was to keep the drivers from leaving their horses to assist at the guns.
To Lieutenant Prime, of the Engineers, and Colonel Biehardson, of the Third Michigan Begiment, I am indebted for the most valuable assistance in securing the best effect from the firing.
One of the officers and one of the men were struck by spent balls, but I am happy to sa> we had no loss either in men or horses.

[Chap. IX.
General Runyon, commanding Fourth Division, Northeastern Virginia, with fifteen companies, seven of the First (my own), and eight of the Second (McLean’s) New Jersey Volunteers, I left Vienna and marched to join you at Oentreville. On the march we encountered your retreating forces, which, by personal authority, exertions of officers, men, and the bayonet, we endeavored, though ineffectually, to rally and turn back. We took position in rear of your camps and immediately in front of the enemy, then proceeded in person to your headquarters, and received your instructions to assume command of my own and McLean’s regiments, and hold our position. On sending for the latter regiment it was ascertained it had retired and was on the retreat, and continued to do so, for reasons doubtless its colonel will duly explain.
About 2 o’clock in the morning, having ascertained that the forces had retreated, and my command left entirely unsupported, I deemed it proper to retire, leaving your hospitals in charge of Surgeon Taylor, of my regiment, who nobly volunteered for that purpose with my sanction, to the mercy of the enemy.
I kept on and covered the rear of our retreating forces till we reached Fairfax Court-House, when, finding a regiment encamped but preparing to take up its march, I notified its commander he would be in rear, and the probability of the enemy’s Black Cavalry annoying him. We continued our march in rear of other forces, finally joined and escorted Hunt’s battery to this point, where, during the storm of yesterday, I disposed of my regiment as I best could. When we marched from Vienna four companies, two of each regiment, were on detached duty, and one other was left to hold the place till the former companies should ret urn, then the whole to proceed to join us. They marched accordingly, but were met on the way and turned back, and those of the Second joined us here. To-day we are employed in getting in our camp equipage from Camp Trenton.

A court of inquiry, instituted by Special Orders, No. 67, of August 10, 1861 [following] from headquarters Department Northeastern Virginia, upon the application of Col. D. S. Miles, Second Infantry, to examine into certain allegations made against him as stated in his letter to the assistant adjutant general at the headquarters of said department, dated July 25, 1861, did, after mature deliberation upon the testimony adduced, agree upon the following
statement of facts.
m
1. That Col. I. B. Richardson was justified in applying the term drunkenness to Col. D. S. Miles’ condition about 7 o’clock p. m. on the 21st July last.

2. That the evidence is clear that Colonel Miles had been ill for several days before July 21 last—was ill on that day; that the surgeon had prescribed medicines for him, and on the day of the battle had prescribed for him small quantities of brandy.
The court, however, considers his illness as a very slight extenuation of the guilt attached to his condition about 7 p. m. on July 21 last.
OPINION.
The court is of opinion that evidence cannot now be found sufficient to convict Colonel Miles of drunkenness before a court-martial $ that a proper court could only be organized in this Army with the greatest inconvenience at present, and that it will not be for the interests of the service to convene a court in this case.
The court is therefore of opinion that no further proceedings in the case are necessary.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
Hdqrs. First Corps, Army of the Potomac,
Manassas, August —, 1861.
General : With the general results of the engagement between several brigades of my command and a considerable force of the enemy in the vicinity of Mitchell’s and Blackburn’s Fords, at Bull Run, on the 18th ultimo, you were made duly acquainted at the time by telegraph, but it is my place now to submit in detail the operations of that day.
Opportunely informed of the determination of the enemy to advance on Manassas, my advanced brigades, on the night of the 16th of July, were made aware from these headquarters of the impending movement, and in exact accordance with my instructions (a copy of which is appended, marked A), their withdrawal within the lines of Bull Run was effected with complete success during the day and night of the 17th ultimo, in face of and in immediate proximity to a largely superior force, despite a well-planned, well-executed effort to cut off the retreat of Bonham’s brigade first at Germantown and subsequently at Centreville, whence he withdrew by my direction after midnight without collision, although enveloped on three sides by their lines. This movement hacl the intended effect of deceiving the enemy as to my ulterior purposes, and led him to anticipate an unresisted passage of Bull Run.
As prescribed in the first and second sections of the paper herewith, marked A, on the morning of the 18th of July, my troops, resting on Bull Run from Union Mills Ford to the stone bridge, a distance of about eight miles, were posted as follows :
Ewell’s brigade occupied a position in vicinity of the Union Mills Ford. It consisted of Rodes’ Fifth and Seibels’ Sixth Regiments of Alabama, and Seymour’s Sixth Regiment Louisiana Volunteers, with four 12-pounder howitzers of Walton’s battery, and Harrison’s, Green’s, and Cabell’s companies of Virginia Cavalry.
D. R. Jones’ brigade was in position in rear of McLean’s Ford, and consisted of Jenkins’ Fifth South Carolina and Burt’s Eighteenth and Featherston’s Seventeenth Regiments of Mississippi Volunteers, with two brass 6-pounder guns of Walton’s battery, and one company of cavalry.
Longstreet’s brigade covered Blackburn’s Ford, and consisted of Moore’s First, Garland’s Eleventh, and Corse’s Seventeenth Regiments Virginia Volunteers, with two 6-pounder brass guns of Walton’s battery.
Bonham’s brigade held the approaches to Mitchell’s Ford. It was composed of Kershaw’s Second, Williams’ Third, Bacon’s Seventh, and Cash’s Eighth Regiments South Carolina Volunteers; of Shields’ and Del. Kemper’s batteries, and of Flood’s, Radford’s, Payne’s, Ball’s, Wickham’s, and Powell’s companies of Virginia Cavalry, under Colonel Radford.
Cocke’s brigade held the fords below and in the vicinity of the stone bridge, and consisted of Withers’ Eighteenth, Lieutenant-Colonel Strange’s Nineteenth, and R. T. Preston’s Twenty-eighth Regiments,

441
with Latham’s battery, and one company of cavalry, Virginia Volunteers.
Evans held my left flank, and protected the stone bridge crossing, with Sloan’s Fourth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, Wheat’s special battalion Louisiana Volunteers, four 6-pounder guns, and two companies of Virginia Cavalry.
Early’s brigade, consisting of Kemper’s Seventh and Early’s Twenty-fourth Regiments Virginia Volunteers; Hays’ Seventh Regiment Louisiana Volunteers, and three rilled pieces of Walton’s battery—Lieutenant Squires—at first were held in position in the rear of and as a support to Ewell’s brigade, until after the development of the enemy in heavy offensive force in front of Mitchell’s and Blackburn’s Fords, when it was placed in rear of and nearly equidistant between McLean’s, Blackburn’s, and Mitchell’s Fords.
Pending the development of the enemy’s purpose, about 10 o’clock a. m. I established my headquarters at a central point (McLean’s farmhouse), near to McLean’s and Blackburn’s Fords, where two 6-pounders of Walton’s battery were in reserve, but subsequently during the engagement I took post to the left of my reserve.
Of the topographical features of the country thus occupied it must suffice to say that Bull Run is a small stream, running in this locality nearly from west to east to its confluence with the Occoquan River, about twelve miles from the Potomac, and draining a considerable scope of country from its source in Bull Run Mountain to a short distance of the Potomac at Occoquan. At this season habitually low and sluggish, it is, however, rapidly and frequently swollen by the summer rains until unfordable. The banks for the most part are rocky and steep, but abound in long-used fords. The country on either side, much broken and thickly wooded, becomes gently rolling and open as it recedes from the stream. On the northern side the ground is much the highest, and commands the other bank completely. Roads traverse and intersect the surrounding country in almost every direction. Finally, at Mitchell’s Ford the stream is about equidistant between Centre ville and Manassas, some six miles apart.
On the morning of the 18th, finding that the enemy was assuming a threatening attitude, in addition to the regiments whose positions have been already stated, I ordered up from Camp Pickens as a reserve, in rear of Bonham’s brigade, the effective men of six companies of Kelly’s Eighth Regiment Louisiana Volunteers and Kirkland’s Eleventh Regiment Korth Carolina Volunteers, which, having arrived the night before en route for Winchester, I had halted in view of the existing necessities of the service. Subsequently the latter was placed in position to the left of Bonham’s brigade.
Apx)earing in heavy force in front of Bonham’s position, the enemy, about meridian, opened fire with several 20-pounder rifled guns from a hill over one and a half miles from Bull Run. At the same time Kemper, supported by two companies of light infantry, occupied a ridge on the left of the Centre ville road, about six hundred yards in advance of the ford, with two 6-pounder (smooth) guns. At first the firing of the enemy was at random, but by 12.30 p. m. he had obtained the range of our position, and poured into the brigade a shower of shot, but without injury to us in men, horses, or guns. Prom the distance, however, our guns could not reply with effect, and we did not attempt it, patiently awaiting a more opportune moment.
Meanwhile a light battery was pushed forward by the enemy, whereupon Kemper threw only six solid shot, with the effect of driving back

﻿442	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
both the battery and its supporting force. This is understood to have been Ayres’ battery, and the damage must have been considerable to have obliged such a retrograde movement on the part of that officer. The purposes of Kemper’s position having now been fully served, his pieces and support were withdrawn across Mitchell’s Ford to a point previously designated, and which commanded the direct approaches to the ford.
About 11.30 o’clock a. m. the enemy was also discovered by the pickets of Longstreet’s brigade advancing in strong columns of infantry with artillery and cavalry on Blackburn’s Ford. At meridian the pickets fell back silently before the advancing foe across the ford, which, as well as the entire southern bank of the stream for the whole front of Longstreet’s brigade, was covered at the water’s edge by an extended line of skirmishers, while two 6-pounders of Walton’s battery, under Lieutenant Garnett, were advantageously placed to command the direct approach to the ford, but with orders to retire to the rear as soon as commanded by the enemy.
The northern bank of the stream in front of Longstreet’s position rises with a steep slope at least fifty feet above the level of the water, leaving a narrow berme in front of the ford of some twenty yards. This ridge formed for them an admirable natural parapet, behind which they could and did approach under shelter in heavy force within less than one hundred yards of our skirmishers. The southern shore was almost a plain, raised but a few feet above the water for several hundred yards; then rising with a very gradual, gentle slope and undulations back to Manassas. On the immediate bank there was a fringe of trees, but with little if any undergrowth or shelter, while on the other shore there were timber and much thick brush and covering. The ground in rear of our skirmishers and occupied by our artillery was an old field, extending along the stream about one mile, and immediately back for about half a mile to a border or skirting of dense second-growth pines. The whole of this ground was commanded at all points by the ridge occupied by the enemy’s musketry, as was also the country to the rear for a distance much beyond the range of 20-pounder rifled guns by the range of hills on which their batteries were planted, and which it may be further noted commanded also all our approaches from this direction to the three threatened fords.
Before advancing his infantry the enemy maintained a fire of rifled artillery from the batteries just mentioned for half an hour; then he pushed forward a column of over three thousand infantry to the assault, with such a weight of numbers as to be repelled with difficulty by the comparatively small force of not more than twelve hundred bayonets with which Brigadier-General Longstreet met him with characteristic vigor and intrepidity. Our troops engaged at this time were the First and Seventeenth and four companies of the Eleventh Regiments Virginia Volunteers. Their resistance was resolute, and maintained with a steadiness worthy of all praise. It was successful, and the enemy was repulsed. In a short time, however, he returned to the contest with increased force and determination, but was again foiled and driven back by our skirmishers and Longstreet’s reserve companies, which were brought up and employed at the most vigorously-assailed points at the critical moment.
It was now that Brigadier-General Longstreet sent for re-enforcements from Early’s brigade, which I had anticipated by directing the advance of General Early with two regiments of infantry and two pieces of artillery. As these came upon the field the enemy had advanced a third

443
time with heavy d umbers to force Longstreet’s position. Hays’ regiment, Seventh Louisiana Volunteers, which was in advance, was placed on the bank of the stream under some cover to the immediate right and left of the ford, relieving Corse’s regiment (Seventeenth Virginia Volunteers). This was done under a heavy fire of musketry with promising steadiness. The Seventh Virginia, under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, was then formed to the right, also under heavy fire, and pushed forward to the stream, relieving the First Regiment Virginia Volunteers. At the same time two rifled guns brought up with Early’s brigade were moved down in the field to the right of the road, so as to be concealed from the enemy’s artillery by the girth of timber on the immediate bank of the stream, and there opened fire, directed only by the sound of the enemy’s musketry.
Unable to effect a passage, the enemy kept up a scattering fire for some time. Some of our troops had pushed across the stream, and several small parties of Corse’s regiment, under command of Captain Marye, met and drove the enemy with the bayonet; but as the roadway from the ford was too narrow for a combined movement in force. General Longstreet recalled them to the south bank. Meanwhile the remainder of Early’s infantry and artillery had been called up; that is, six companies of the Twenty-fourth Regiment Virginia Volunteers, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hairston, and five pieces of artillery, one rifled gun, and four 6-pounder brass guns, including two 6-pounder guns under Lieutenant Garnett, which had been previously sent to the rear by General Longstreet. This infantry was at once placed in position to the left of the ford, in a space unoccupied by Hays, and the artillery was unlimbered in battery to the right of the road, in a line with the two guns already in action. A scattering fire of musketry was still kept up by the enemy for a short time, but that was soon silenced.
It was at this stage of the affair that a remarkable artillery duel was commenced and maintained on our side with a long-trained professional opponent, superior in the character as well as in the number of his weapons, provided with improved munitions and every artillery appliance, and at the same time occupying the commanding position. The results were marvelous, and fitting precursors to the artillery achievements of the 21st of July. In the outset our fire was directed against the enemy’s infantry, whose bayon'ets, gleaming above the tree-tops, alone indicated their presence and force, This drew the attention of a battery placed on a high, commanding ridge, and the duel began in earnest. For a time the aim of the adversary was inaccurate, but this was quickly corrected, and shot fell and shells burst thick and fast in the very midst of our battery, wounding in the course of the combat Captain Eshleman, five privates, and the horse of Lieutenant Richardson. From the position of our pieces and the nature of the ground their aim could only be directed at the smoke of the enemy’s artillery. How skillfully^ and with what execution this was done can only be realized by an eye-witness. For a few moments their guns were silenced, but were soon reopened. By" direction of General Longstreet, his battery- was then advanced by hand out of the range now ascertained by the enemy, and a shower of spherical case, shell, and round shot flew over the heads of our gunners. But one of our pieces had become liors de combat from an enlarged vent.
From the new position our guns fired as before, with no other aim than the smoke and flash of their adversaries’ pieces, renewed and urged the conflict with such signal vigor and effect, that gradually the fire of the enemy slackened, the intervals between their discharges grew longer

## p. 444 (#460) ############################################

﻿444	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
and longer, finally to cease, and we fired a last gun at a baffled, flying foe, whose heavy masses in the distance were plainly seen to break and scatter in wild confusion and utter rout, strewing the ground with castaway gunsr hats, blankets, and knapsacks as our parting shell were thrown among them. In their retreat one of their pieces was abandoned, but from the nature of the ground it was not sent tor that night, and under cover of darkness the enemy recovered it.
The guns engaged in this singular conflict on our side were three 6-pounder rifled pieces and four ordinary 6-pounders, all of Walton’s battery, Washington Artillery, of New Orleans. The officers immediately attached were Captain Eshleman, Lieuts. C. W. Squires, Bichard-son, Garnett, and Whittington. At the same time our infantry held the bank of the stream in advance of our guns, and the missiles of the combatants flew to and fro above them, as cool and veteran-like for more than an hour they steadily awaited the moment and signal for the advance.
While the conflict was at its height before Blackburn’s Ford, about -1 o’clock p. in., the enemy again displayed himself in force before Bonham’s position. At this time Colonel Kershaw, with four companies of his regiment (Second South Carolina) and one piece of Kemper’s battery, were thrown across Mitchell’s Ford to the ridge which Kemper had occupied that morning. Two solid shot and three spherical case thrown among them with a precision inaugurated by that artillerist at Vienna effected their discomfiture and disappearance, and our troops in that quarter were again withdrawn within our lines, having discharged the duty assigned.
At the close of the engagement before Blackburn’s Ford I directed General Longstreet to withdraw the First and Seventeenth Begiments, which had borne the brunt of the action, to a position in reserve, leaving Colonel Early to occupy the field with his brigade and Garland’s regiment.
As a part of the history of this engagement I desire to place on record ♦that on the 18th of July not one yard of intrenchments nor one rifle pit sheltered the men at Blackburn’s Ford, who, officers and men, with rare exceptions, were on that day for the first time underfire, and who, taking and maintaining every position ordered, cannot be too much commended for their soldierly behavior.
Our artillery was manned and officered by those who but yesterday were called from the civil avocations of a busy city. They were matched with the picked light artillery of the Federal Regular Army—Company E, Third Artillery, under Captain Ayres, with an armament, as their own chief of artillery admits, of two 10-pounder Parrott rifled guns, two 12-pounder howitzers, and two 6-pounder pieces, aided by two 20-pounder Parrott rifled guns of Company G, Fifth Artillery, under Lieutenant Benjamin. Thus matched, they drove their veteran adversaries from the field, giving confidence in and promise of the coming efficiency of that brilliant arm of our service.
Having thus related the main or general results and events of the action of Bull Bun, in conclusion it is proper to signalize sogie of those who contributed most to the satisfactory results of that day. Thanks are due to Brigadier-Generals Bonham and Ewell and to Colonel Cocke and the officers under them for the ability shown in conducting and executing the retrograde movements on Buil Bun directed in my orders of the 8th of July—movements on which hung the fortunes of this Army.
Brigadier-General Longstreet, who commanded immediately the troops engaged at Blackburn’s Ford on the 18th, equaled my confident expec-

445
tations, and I may fitly say that by his presence at the right place at the right moment among his men, by the exhibition of characteristic coolness, and by his words of encouragement to the men of his command, he infused a confidence and spirit that contributed largely to the success of our arms on that day.
Colonel Early brought his brigade into position and subsequently into action with judgment, and at the proper moment$ he displayed capacity for command and personal gallantry.
Colonel Moore, commanding the First Virginia Volunteers, was severely wounded at the head of his regiment, the command of which subsequently devolved upon Major Skinner, Lieutenant-Colonel Fry having been obliged to leave the field in consequence of a sun-stroke.
An accomplished, promising officer, Maj. Carter II. Harrison, Eleventh Begiment Virginia Volunteers, was lost to the service while leading two companies of his regiment against the enemy. He fell, twice shot, mor* tally wounded.
Brigadier-General Longstreet, while finding on all sides alacrity, ardor, and intelligence, mentions his special obligations to Colonels Moore, Garland, and Corse, commanding severally regiments of his brigade, and to their field officers, Lieutenant-Colonels Fry, Funsten, Munford, and Majors Brent and Skinner, of whom he says, “They displayed more coolness and energy than is usual among veterans of the old service.” General Longstreet- also mentions the conduct of Captain Marye, of the Seventeenth Virginia Volunteers, as especially gallant on one occasion, in advance of the ford.
The regiments of Early’s brigade were commanded by Colonel Harry Hays and Lieutenant-Colonels Williams and Hairston, who handled their commands in action with satisfactory coolness and skill, supported by their field officers, Lieutenant-Colonel He Choiseul and Major Penn, of the Seventh Louisiana, and Major Patton, of the Seventh Virginia Volunteers.
The skill, the conduct, and the soldierly qualities of the Washington Artillery engaged were all that could be desired. The officers and men attached to the seven pieces already specified won for their battalion a distinction which I feel assured will never be tarnished, and which will ever serve to urge them and their corps to high endeavor. Lieutenant Squires worthily commanded the pieces in action. The commander of the battalion was necessarily absent from the immediate field, under orders in the sphere of his duties, but the fruits of his discipline, zeal, instruction, and capacity as an artillery commander were present, and must redound to his reputation.
On the left, at Mitchell’s Ford, while no serious engagement occurred, the conduct of all was eminently satisfactory to the general officers in command.
It is due, however, to Col. J. L. Kemper, Virginia forces, to express my sense of the value of his services in the preparation for and execution of the retreat from Fairfax Court-House on Bull Bun. Called from the head of his regiment, by what appeared to me an imperative need of the service, to take charge of the superior duties of the quartermaster’s department with the advance at that critical juncture, he accepted the responsibilities involved, and was eminently efficient.
For further information touching officers and individuals of the First Brigade, and the details of the retrograde movement, I have to refer particularly to the report of Brigadier-General Bonham, herewith [NTo. 66].
It is proper here to state that while from the outset it had been de-

termined on the approach of the enemy in force to fall back and light him on the line of Bull Run, yet the position occupied by General EwelPs brigade, if necessary, could have been maintained against a largely superior force. This was especially the case with the position of the Fifth Alabama Volunteers, Colonel Rodes, which that excellent officer had made capable of a resolute protracted defense against heavy odds. Accordingly, on the morning of the 17th ultimo, when the enemy appeared before that position, they were checked and held at bay with some confessed loss in a skirmish in advance of the works, in which Major Morgan andCaptain Shelley, Fifth Regiment Alabama Volunteers, acted with intelligent gallantry, and the post was only abandoned under general, but specific, imperative orders, in conformity with a long-conceived established plan of action and battle.
Capt. E. P. Alexander, Confederate States Engineers, fortunately joined my headquarters in time to introduce the system of new field signals, which under his skillful management rendered me the most important service preceding and during the engagement.
The medical officers serving with the regiments engaged were at their proper posts and discharged their duties with satisfactory skill and zeal, and on one occasion at least, under an annoying fire, when Surgeon Cullen, First Regiment Virginia Volunteers, was obliged to remove our wounded from the hospital, which had become the special target of the enemy’s rifled guns, notwithstanding it was surmounted by the usual yellow hospital flag, but which, however, I hope for the sake of past associations was ignorantly mistaken for a Confederate flag. The name of each individual medicai officer I cannot mention.
On the day of the engagement I was attended by my personal staff, Lieut. S. W. Ferguson, aide-de-camp, and my volunteer aides-de camp, Colonels Preston, Manning, Chesnut, Miles, Chisolm, and Hayward, of South Carolina, to all of whom I am greatly indebted for manifold essential services in the transmission of orders on the field and in the preliminary arrangements for the occupation and maintenance of the line of Bull Run.
Col. Thomas Jordan, assistant adjutant-general; Capt. C. H. Smith, assistant adjutant-general; Col. S. Jones, chief of artillery and ordnance ; Major Cabell, chief quartermaster; Capt. W. H. Fowle, chief of subsistence department; Surg. Thomas H. Williams, medical director, and Assistant Surgeon Brodie, medical purveyor, of the general staff, attached to the Army of the Potomac, were necessarily engaged severally with their responsible duties at my headquarters at Camp Pickens, which they discharged with an energy and intelligence for which I have to tender my sincere thanks.
Messrs. McLean, Wilcoxen, Kinchelo, and Brawner, citizens of this immediate vicinity, it is their due to say, have placed me and the country under great obligations for the information relative to this region, which has enabled me to avail myself of its defensive features and resources. They were found ever ready to give me their time without stint or reward.
Our casualties, in all sixty-eight killed and wounded, were fifteen (including two reported missing) killed, and fifty-three wounded, several of whom have since died. The loss of the enemy can only be conjectured. It was unquestionably heavy. In the cursory examination, which was made by details from Longstreet’s and Early’s brigades, on the 18th of July, of that part of the field immediately contested and near Blackburn’s Ford, some sixty-four corpses were found and buried. Some few wounded and at least twenty prisoners were also picked up,

besides one hundred and seventy-five stand of arms, a large quantity of accouterments and blankets, and quite one hundred and fifty hats.
The effect of this day’s conflict was to satisfy the enemy he could not force a passage across Bull Run in the face of our troops, and led him into the flank movement of the 21st of July and the battle of Manassas, the details of which will be related in another paper.
Herewith I have the honor to transmit the reports of the Several brigade commanders engaged and of the artillery $ also a map of the field of battle.#
The rendition of this report, it is proper to say in conclusion, has been unavoidably delayed by the constantly engrossing administrative duties of the commander of an army corps composed wholly of volunteers, duties vitally essential to its well being and future efficiency, and which I could not set aside or postpone on any account.

Report of Brig. Gen. M. L. Bonham, C. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, of retreat from Fairfax Court-House and skirmish at MitchelVs Ford.
Hdqrs. First Brig., First Corps, Army of the Potomac,
Camp Gregg, July 31,1861.
General : In making, in obedience to your orders, a report of the operations of my brigade on the 18th instant, I beg leave to make a brief statement of the events immediately preceding that day, and which are closely connected with it.
On the morning of the 17th instant, at Fairfax Court-House, the advance forces of the Army of the Potomac under my command consisted of the Second Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, Colonel Kershaw; Third, Colonel Williams; Seventh, Colonel Bacon; Eighth, Colonel Cash; the Eighteenth Virginia Volunteers, Colonel Withers, temporarily attached; part of Colonel Radford’s cavalry; Captains Wickham’s, Ball’s, Powell’s, and Payne’s troops of cavalry, and the batteries of Captains Kemper and Shields. Early that morning I received from my scouts confirmation of what I had been hearing many hours previous, viz, that the enemy would probably advance upon me that morning by the Alexandria, Flint Hill, and, it was said, the Falls Church roads.
In obedience to your orders, which I had previously received, to fall back on the approach of an enemy to attack my position in “superior force,” I ordered my baggage and supply wagons to be put in immediate motion, and to be parked in rear of Bull Run, Mitchell’s Ford. This was promptly and successfully accomplished by Colonel Kemper, assisted by Lieutenant Washington, quartermaster, and Major Kennedy, commissary for the command, with but little loss.
Between 8 and 9 o’clock I heard the report and saw the smoke of the enemy’s artillery at Flint Hill, about two miles off, and learned at the same time that my pickets were being driven in. I immediately ordered the troops to their trenches, their places having been previously designated, which order was obeyed with the greatest alacrity and enthusiasm, the body of the troops not knowing that they were to fall back at all. My plan of falling back on Bull Run, based upon your instructions, I had previously explained to the commanding officers of corps, assigning each his position on the march at Centreville and at Bull Run in a confidential order, which I did not deliver till on the march.
Finding the enemy did not seem to be approaching by the Falls Church road, I ordered the pickets to be withdrawn from that road. About 9 o’clock the enemy made his appearance in large force on the Flint Hill slope, and, deploying his columns, moved down toward the Court-House, his lines extending a great distance across the open fields, stretching out from Flint Hill to the Court-House. I awaited his ap-29 R R—VOL II

proacli till a part of liis force bad arrived witbin a half mile of my works, to be satisfied that bis force was sucb u superior force” as I bad beard it would be and as came witbin tbe intent of your order.
Having satisfied myself that be was concentrating around me a force many times my number—in three columns, from Alexandria upon my right, upon my left at Germantown, from tbe same place, and having sent word to General Ewell that I was about to begin my movement—I ordered my regiments to take up the line of march according to my prearranged plan, and directed Kershaw’s regiment (which, with Kemper’s battery and Wickham’s and Floyd’s troops of cavalry, constituted my rear guard) to file, as they retired, through the trenches as the preceding regiments filed out. The column thus fell back in perfect order to Cen-treville, the enemy not venturing to attack my rear guard. At dark our pickets were within a few hundred paces of each other.
At midnight, Major Khett having returned from a personal interview with yourself, I resumed the march, in obedience to your orders, and at daylight put my command in position at Mitchell’s Ford, on Bull Bun, the place previously assigned me, placing two pieces of Kemper’s battery six hundred yards in front of my center, on Kemper’s Hill, supported by two companies of light troops, in order to give the enemy’s advancing column a few shots before retiring to the position assigned those pieces behind the run. The Eleventh Korth Carolina Volunteers, Colonel Kirkland, and the Eighth Louisiana Battalion, Colonel Kelly, reported to me during the morning. The former, having been kept for a while in reserve, was placed on the extreme left; the latter was held in reserve in rear of the center of my position.
At about 12 m. the enemy, following up his movements of the day previous, opened a heavy cannonade on my position, which was kept up most of the day, throwing shell and shot into every portion of my command, but fortunately without injury to the troops. As the range of his guns and the weight of his metal were greater than my own, Captain Kemper’s two pieces, with the two supporting companies, were withdrawn to their position in the rear of the run, but not till some effective shots had been made at the enemy. In the course of a few hours he attacked the position of General Longstreet at Blackburn’s Ford, a short distance to my right, from which he was most gallantly .repulsed. He then began to show his troops in some force in my front. By your leave I ordered Colonel Kershaw, with four companies of his regiment and one piece of Kemper’s battery, to move forward to Kemper’s Hill, and open fire upon that force. It was promptly and gallantly executed, three or four effective shots being thrown into the grove near Butler’s house, doing some execution and scattering the enemy in every direction.
I cannot too highly commend the conduct and bearing of all the officers and men under my command. Everything that characterizes a gallant people prepared to perish before a superior force, if necessary, for the defense of their homes, was exhibited by them throughout the trying and fatiguing operations of the 17th and 18th of July. Inclosed I send reports of officers of my command as far as received.
I am, sir, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
M. L. BOKHAM, Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Report of GoL J. B. Kershaw, Second South Carolina Infantry, of retreat from Fairfax Court-House and skirmish at MitclieWs Ford.
Hdqrs. Second Palmetto Beg’t, South Carolina Yols.,
Vienna, Fa., July 26, 1861.
General : In obedience to your order, as soon as I could obtain the proper materials, I proceed to report the operations of my command from the 17th to 21st instant, inclusive, in two separate reports:
In accordance with your orders I had jirepared my command to cover the movement of the advance forces from Fairfax Court-House to Bull Bun whenever it should be ascertained that the enemy were approaching our position in overwhelming force. On the morning of the 17th, at an early hour, the drums of the enemy announced their movement towards Fairfax Court-House, and soon after sunrise one of the pickets stationed on the road from Flint Hill to the Falls Church road, midway between the two points, was seen rapidly retreating across the field, having two pickets of fifty men each, consisting of Captain Haile’s company and a part of Captain Bhett’s, all under the command of Captain Haile, stationed on the Falls Church road, one-half under Lieutenant Canty, two miles distant from camp, the remainder about a mile farther at the barricades, under Captain Haile in person, whose orders required that they should engage the enemy when he appeared and fall back fighting.
I at once apprehended that they would be flanked and cut off, since their left was entirely uncovered by the retreat of the picket first mentioned. Accordingly, accompanied by Mr. A. E. Hoby, of my staff, I visited the pickets, instructing them to fall back one upon the other, and both to retire together so soon as it was ascertained that the enemy had passed them to the left. Hearing firing in the direction of Flint* Hill, I rode to the point whence the picket had retreated, and found the enemy’s skirmishers occupying the open ground, as far as could be seen in the direction of the Vienna road, with a heavy column occupying the woods in their rear, but not at that time advancing. I returned to Captain Haile’s picket, renewed my caution, caused a barricade to be erected at the position of my nearest picket, and ordered them forward to the intersection of the Flint Hill road, to support Captain Haile and to observe the approach of the enemy along that road. Having made these dispositions I returned to camp, and found my regiment drawn up on their i>arade ground, tents and baggage packed and sent off as far as transportation had been provided for them, and ready for movement.
At this time I received your order in person directing me to recall the pickets, and immediately dispatched Mr. Edward Wallace, of my staff, for that purpose. I posted the companies of Captains Hoke and Cuthbert in the woods to the right of the Falls Church road, Captain Casson in reserve in front of my camp upon the road, Captain Bhett, with the remainder of his company, in front in the log-house on the road, Captain Perryman’s rifles in a wood in front of the left of the trenches, Kemper’s battery, with two pieces, occupying the trenches. By this time the enemy, after firing a few cannon shot, had deployed their line of battle directly in front and to the left of Captain Perryman’s position, and it was announced to me that the movement to Bull Bun had already been commenced by the withdrawal of Colonel Williams from his original position on the Alexandria road. I placed in position at the entrance of that into Fairfax Court-House three companies of infantry, under

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA.
command of Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, and threw Captain Casson’s company on the hill on the left of the road at the hospital, placing a section* of Kemper’s battery in position at the Court-House.
Receiving your orders to fall back, anxious for the safety of my picket,, who had not yet returned, the enemy being now far in the rear of the position where the pickets had been posted, I went forward with Captain Hoke’s company and Captain Rhett’s to the hill near Wilcoxson’s, where I awaited their arrival. Shortly after they appeared, and my movement commenced. Withdrawing all the companies and Kemper’s^ battery from the Falls Church road, I occupied with them, alternating: with the detachment of Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, each successive in-trenchment from that point to the Germantown road as they were severally vacated by the regiments in charge of them, having in the mean time been re-enforced by the arrival of Captain Wickham’s squadron of cavalry, composed of his own and Captain Flood’s company.
Arrived at the fork of the road, I moved one battalion towards Germantown to replace Colonel Cash, and took position on the Centreville road on the hill commanding the village of Fairfax with two pieces of artillery and the other battalion, directing the other two pieces to take position in the rear at the intersection of the cross-road from Germantown, to which the first battalion had been directed to proceed. So soon as Colonel Cash had advanced sufficiently on his march I moved the whole command in good order to Centreville without interference, where we took position, much fatigued from the excessive heat of the day, at Artillery Hill.
At midnight I was informed that the march had been resumed to Bull Run, and so soon as all the troops had left the village of Centreville I put my command in motion in the following order: First, the cavalry;; second, Kemper’s battery; third, infantry, with a small cavalry vedette a short distance in the rear. In this order we marched without interruption to Mitchell’s Ford, Bull Run, where my regiment resumed the-position which they had occupied some weeks before in the intrench-ments of their own construction. Two pieces of Kemper’s battery were* placed in position in the trenches on the left of the road, the remaining two placed under direction on Kemper’s Hill north of the run, also on the left of the road. The cavalry were directed to return to their regiment.
On the 18th instant Captain Wallace’s company was stationed at Butler’s, on the Centreville road, to observe the approach of the enemy* While there an officer of the enemy, or employe in their quartermaster’s* department, O’Brien by name, rode up to Captain Wallace and asked for General McDowell. Immediately perceiving his mistake he drew his pistol and turned to make his escape, but was immediately killed by Captain Wallace’s men. Later in the day the enemy appeared in force,, and Captain Wallace withdrew his company. Captains Perryman and Cuthbert were thrown out in the morning with their companies to support Kemper’s half battery on the hill, which was commanded by Captain Kemper in person.
About noon a heavy artillery fire was opened upon our lines from the enemy’s artillery posted near Rough’s, which continued for some time without response on our part; but the range of Captain Kemper’s position having been ascertained by the enemy, and their fire becoming more threatening, Captain Kemper fired a half dozen apparently most eifective shots and retired in safety to the trenches, covered by Captains Perryman’s and Cuthbert’s rifles. After a few shots at this retreating party the enemy turned their attention almost exclusively to the troops

posted to the right of our brigade. During the day there were many narrow escapes in the trenches occupied by my regiment, and the bravery and spirit of my whole command was strikingly displayed in their contempt of the danger and their eagerness for a nearer approach of the enemy.
About 4 o’clock in the afternoon, by your direction, I detached the companies of Captains Hoke, Cutkbert, Casson, and Haile, and assuming the command myself, with one piece of Captain Kemper’s artillery, under his own command, reoccupied Kemper’s Hill. Reconnoitering with Messrs. Doby and Wallace, of my staff, it was ascertained that the enemy occupied in force the graveyard near Holden’s and the ravine between Holden’s and Roberts’ house with skirmishers in the open field on their right. After three shots from Kemper’s battery, which produced evident confusion in the enemy’s ranks, I received an order from General Beauregard to return immediately, which was promptly obeyed. Soon after the enemy ceased firing and withdrew. About sunset, by your order, my regiment moved with Captain Kemper’s battery and took position on the left of your command, where we remained without incident until Sunday, the 21st instant.
One unpleasant feature of the abandonment of Fairfax Court-House was the loss of much private baggage, some tents, knapsacks, and camp kettles, and all the hospital stores, for the want of sufficient transportation, which this regiment has never had. The knapsacks of Captains Rhett’s and Haile’s companies were lost in consequence of those companies being on picket guard when the movement commenced, and time was not afforded them to recover them.

Report of Col. J. H. Williams, Third South Carolina Infantry, of retreat from Fairfax Court-House and skirmish at MitchelVs Ford.
Camp Gregg, Vienna, Van August 2,1861.
I have the honor to report that I occupied the advanced position on the main turnpike road leading from Fairfax Court-House to Alexandria when the enemy appeared in movement on the morning of the 17th upon the advanced forces at Fairfax. My baggage train, which had been kept in readiness, was immediately forwarded in the direction of Bull Run, carrying everything of value. My two companies on picket at the barricade across the Alexandria turnpike road, three miles from camp, and therefore in danger of being cut off by the column of the enemy advancing along the Flint Hill road, were cailed in, and my regiment marched through Fairfax to a position on the right of the road in front of Colonel Bacon’s camp, the right wing of the battalion being stationed behind the intrenchments, the left wing drawn up under the hill to the left of the works. When the line of march was taken up I followed in rear of Colonel Withers as far as Centreville, and arriving at that place deployed my regiment on the right, occupying the village.

This position I held until ordered to Ball Run, following in rear of the artillery. Arriving there, I deployed along the right bank of the stream, my right resting on the left of the intrenched works, my left extending up the stream across the road which leads from Mitchell’s Ford along the right bank. My men, though much fatigued and in want of sleep, completed by 10 o’clock a. m. temporary breastworks of timber and brushwood, and awaited under arms the attack of the enemy, who soon after appeared in heavy force in our front and opened a brisk cannonade upon our whole line. One of my companies (Captain Jones’, on picket across the stream at Roberts’ house) received several well directed fires of the enemy, but retired under orders without loss. The enemy’s fire was kept up at intervals until 5 o’clock p. m., many of their missiles passing above and falling around us, but without doing any damage.
My regiment was not engaged in the musketry fire on the right in the afternoon of the 18th, being kept in position in expectation of an attack upon the center of our general line.
I must here express my high appreciation of the soldierly qualities and bearing of the troops under my command exhibited in the march from Fairfax, which was certainly a dangerous and trying one, and of their conduct while under fire. Of their fortitude, courage, and the prompt execution of all orders under such unfavorable circumstances I cannot speak too highly. On every occasion I received the active cooperation of all the field and staff officers and all the officers and men under my command.

Early on the morning of the 18th July the enemy appeared on a high hill about twelve hundred yards from the intrenchments in which the Seventh South Carolina Regiment was placed, on the northwest side of the road leading from Mitchell’s Ford over Bull Run to Centreville. By 9 a. m. of that day they had located their batteries, and forthwith commenced firing upon the embankments behind which we were situated, throwing both shot and shell. Random firing was kept up during the day against this and adjacent points until the close of the battle fought by General Longstreet’s brigade, situated below and to the right of the Seventh Regiment. The batteries were rifled and 6-pounder cannon, throwing 6-pound round shot and 12 pound conical shell. No injury

Hdqrs. Eighth Reg’t South Carolina Vols.,
Camp Victory, Vienna, Fa., Jwh/ 29, 1861.
In obedience to General Orders, No. —, from headquarters First Brigade, Army of the Potomac, I ask leave to report the operations of the Eighth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers from the morning of the 17th to the 18th instant, inclusive, during which time, in consequence of the illness of Colonel Cash, the command devolved upon me.
At a very early hour on the morning of the 17th repeated and rapid discharges of artillery and musketry were reported at a distance of from two to three miles to my right. This proved to be an attack by the advance guard of the enemy’s columns upon pickets stationed on the Falls Church and Alexandria roads. These pickets having been driven in, orders from brigade headquarters required me to take position behind the intrenchments which had been thrown up at a distance of three hundred yards in front of my camp on both sides of the road leading from Germantown towards the Flint Hill school-house, and known as the Old Georgetown road. A gun from Captain Shields’ howitzer battery had been previously placed in position on the right of this road, and was in charge of Lieutenant McCarthy. For the protection of this piece I threw Company G, Captain Harrington, into the trenches on the right, and detailed Company C, Captain Coit, to operate as skirmishers in the woods on the extreme right of the earthworks. Company D, Captain Miller, was deployed at a distance of one hundred and fifty yards in front and on the left of my position. Company A, Captain Hoole, was on picket at a barricade one and a quarter miles in advance, on the Flint Hill road, and Captain Hough, of Company B, with part of his command, was on picket at a point on the Fox Mill road about one mile to the left of Captain Hoole. The remainder of Company B, under Lieutenant Johnson, was stationed at a stone bridge one and a quarter miles from Germantown, on the Little River turnpike, in the direction of Centreville. These pickets had been placed overnight, and received orders at a very early hour from brigade headquarters to dispute every inch of ground if driven in during the day.
The firing which had been first heard upon the right gradually inclined towards the left, indicating a movement towards my front. A few minutes before 8 o’clock the enemy appeared in large force, advancing upon the barricade behind which Captain Hoole was stationed—his skirmishers beating the woods on both sides and far to the left. Captain Hoole retired upon the nearer approach of the column, and fell back upon the line of skirmishers in my front. The noise of axes at the barricades.

and the words of command given by those wlio were in charge of the party by whom it was cut away were distinctly heard by Captain Coit at his advanced position. I had as yet received no orders to draw in my pickets, although the enemy could now be plainly seen deploying across the road at a distance of four hundred to five hundred yards in front of my line. The delay on the part of the enemy in advancing immediately upon my position led me to suspect a flank movement was intended upon my left, and this, if successful, would have necessarily involved the sacrifice of Captain Hough’s command. My surmise was soon confirmed by the rapid movement of the enemy’s skirmishers to the left in squads of four or five, while his advance still bore slowly down on my front.
Although I had been advised of the original purpose of the commanding general to fall back upon Centreville and Bull Run, the apparent impossibility of now withdrawing in safety from the immediate presence of a largely superior force led me to suppose that there had been a change in the plan of operations, and that it was expected a stand should be made in our present position. I communicated this supposition to the men of my command, and it is due them to say that the degree of alacrity with which they assumed the positions assigned them severally and the coolness with which they prepared to meet the overwhelming numbers immediately opposing them entitle them to most honorable mention. At this critical juncture, and as he was on the point of opening fire upon the advancing enemy, Lieutenant McCarthy received orders to withdraw his gun from position and rejoin his battery. My command was thus left unsupported, while I was every instant expecting my skirmishers to engage those of the enemy. The distance between the enemy’s advance and my skirmishers was reduced to less than one hundred yards before I received orders to withdraw my command and take position in the retreating column. I immediately dispatched two of the mounted staff to the relief of the skirmishers and pickets, and filed out of the trenches, retiring in good order through Germantown to the Centreville road, where the column had been halted and awaited my coming. I was for some time fearful that the detached companies which I had been compelled to leave on duty would be cut off before they could rejoin the regiment, and this would certainly have been the case but for the personal exertions of Col. R. D. Howard, volunteer aide-de-camp to the colonel, and Capt. J. C. McClenaghan, regimental quartermaster, who at the imminent peril of their own safety sought and conducted across the fields the skirmishing parties and pickets, and overtook the column near Centreville. Two shots were fired upon Captain Hough’s command as it passed through Germantown, but without effect.
At Centreville the column was halted, and my regiment assigned to position on the crest of the hill on the left of the road leading to Fairfax Court-House and behind the Brown Church. Here I was ordered to remain in line of battle, with my right next the road and fronting the approach from Fairfax Court-House. I detailed Company H, Captain Singletary, to take position as picket in the woods about one mile in front of my line, and Companies I, Captain Stackhouse, and G, Captain Harrington, were deployed as skirmishers at a distance of two hundred yards in front, extending from the turnpike to the Chantilly road.
At 12 o’clock p. m. my picket came in and reported the presence of the enemy in the woods near their late position. This was communicated to brigade headquarters, and at 1 o’clock I was ordered to draw in my outposts and join the column retiring towards Manassas. This was quietly done, my skirmishers reporting the sound of the tramp of

men in the woods immediately in their front. At daybreak the column reached Bull Bun. I left two companies, K, Captain McLeod, and D, Captain Miller, on the north side of the run, to picket the Centreville road until the rear guard should come in, and, crossing at Mitchell’s Ford, I was ordered into position on the extreme left, my right resting on Colonel Williams’ Third Begiment South Carolina Volunteers, and my left extending to the distance of one mile above the ford. The regiment still occupying this position, Colonel Cash appeared in the lines early on Thursday and resumed command.

In obedience to orders from the general commanding the First Brigade, Armyof the Potomac, I beg leave to submit the following report of the operations of the Eighth Begiment South Carolina Volunteers during the 18th, 19th, and 20th July instant:
Having sufficiently recovered from a serious attack of sickness I assumed command of my regiment on the morning of the 18th, and found it posted on the south side of Bull Bun, on the extreme left, my right resting on the left of Colonel Williams’ Third Begiment South Carolina Volunteers. On the 18th there was heavy cannonading to the right of my position, and occasionally balls and shells were thrown very near my lines. On the 19th and 20th my position was strongly fortified by voluntary labor from my regiment. On the 19th Colonel Kershaw’s regiment was posted upon my left, and with it Captain Kemper’s battery of light artillery.
I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

consequence of which he was compelled to abandon a portion of his baggage. A squadron, composed of the companies of Captains Wickham and Flood, was ordered to report to Colonel Kershaw, to form a part of the rear guard of the advanced forces.
A squadron under Colonel Munford and three companies under my own command were stationed in central positions, so as to operate as might be deemed necessary. Lieutenant-Colonel Munford acted during the retreat with Colonel Bacon’s regiment, and the companies under my own command with Colonel Cash’s regiment.
The only loss sustained by the cavalry during the retreat was of Privates William Mallow and John Mays, of the company under Captain Pitzer, who were on picket duty on a very advanced post, and are supposed to have been taken prisoners by the enemy. The retreat was conducted in perfect order and to my entire satisfaction, bringing off everything, with the exception of the articles left by Captain Ball. At Centreville a halt of several hours was made, when Captains Payne and Powell were ordered with their companies to watch the movements of the enemy. Two strong pickets, under command of Lieutenants Halsey and Brocker, were also sent on the roads occupied by the enemy. A detail of five men was also made to go, during the night of the 17th instant, wfith Colonel Lipscomb to reconnoiter on the cross-roads leading into the Braddock road.
While making the reconnaissance this party was fired into by a scouting party of the enemy, and Private William Walton’s horse shot under him, in consequence of which he was forced to leave him with all his equipage. The party returned without further accident, and my command left Centreville at midnight for Mitchell’s Ford, on Bull Bun, and took a position immediately in rear of General Bonham’s headquarters.
On the 18th instant the cavalry under my command were under fire from the enemy’s cannon for two hours, and wrere then ordered to occupy the position between the brigades of Generals Cocke and Bonham* After the firing had ceased 1 was ordered, with my command, to examine all of the fords on Bull Bun and to scour the country. We continued to watch the fords until the morning of the 21st instant.

at once placed in battery in front of Colonel Williams’ regiment, or the Alexandria turnpike, and two in front of Colonel Kershaw’s position, on the Falls Church road. At 8 o’clock the enemy came in sight on the Flint Hill road, and orders were received to fall back. In conjunction with Colonel Kershaw’s regiment and Captain Wickham’s; troop I enjoyed the privilege of covering this retreat, the rear guard being under Colonel Kershaw’s command, to whose report [No. 67] I beg to refer for any additional details. The enemy seemed not disposed to press us closely, and we reached Centreville without incident worthy of note about 12 m., and rested until midnight, when the march was resumed to Bull Bun.
We arrived at Mitchell’s Ford a little before daybreak on the morning of the 18th. Two of my guns were posted on the hill in front of the trenches at Mitchell’s Ford; the others in the trenches. At 12 m. (Thursday, 18th) the enemy opened fire from one or more rifled guns in front of our position at a distance of one and one-half miles. This firing was completely at random until 12.30 o’clock, when they obtained the range of my position and fired many rounds of case and solid shot at us, but without injury to us, while a light battery moved up toward us. I then opened fire upon the latter, firing six solid shot, and had the satisfaction of driving back the battery and its supports. I have since understood that this was Sherman’s battery, and that the amount of damage done them was considerable. We at once retired to the trenches in obedience to your orders.
Late in the evening, about 4 o’clock, I was ordered to accompany,, with one gun, Colonel Kershaw’s regiment to the hill which we had before occupied, in front of Mitchell’s Ford, for the purpose of driving a body of infantry and cavalry from the cover of the hills beyond. Two solid shot and three spherical case having accomplished this object to Colonel Kershaw’s satisfaction, we returned to our respective positions in and behind the trenches. We were inactive listeners to the* heavy firing on our right, and about dusk were ordered to move with Colonel Kershaw’s regiment to the left of the intrenchments.
I am glad to be able to add that no member of my command suffered any injury during these operations.

On the night before the retreat referred to I sent Captain Shelley’s company (E) armed with rifled muskets, to sustain my advance guard-

﻿460	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
This company had remained at the outpost on Braddock’s old road, some three and one-half miles from the regiment, until 7 a. m. on the morning of the 17th instant, when they returned towards camp to get provisions, having been sent off in such a hurry as to prevent their making preparations for breakfast, and had gotten within three-fourths of a mile of camp before the approach of the enemy was announced to them by one of my couriers coming in with a prisoner, who had been taken by a sentinel (Private Wethered, of Company H). The outpost and guard fell back fighting, not very severely, but killing several of the enemy. One of the guard (Kennedy, of Company H) killed two, having taken two deliberate musket-shots from the same spot at four of the Federalists, all of whom fired at him.
Shelley’s company, having advanced again to sustain the guard, had a sharp skirmish with them. This skirmish took place four hundred yards in advance of our breastworks, which are three-quarters of a mile east, of our encampment, and which were by this time occupied by the main body of my command. Our skirmishers, being completely outflanked, retired in good order to their station in the barricades. The enemy did not follow them then, nor had they followed them twenty minutes after, when an officer of the regiment, Captain Fowler, returned to the breastworks.
They had outflanked my position to the right during the skirmish, for they could be seen crossing the clearing along the edge of which we were posted in large numbers. Up to and after the close of the skirmish I had received no definite orders to retreat, but had learned that General Bonham’s command was retreating, and that the troops at Fairfax Station were about to retreat. I had sent a courier to General Ewell for instructions, and an officer, Capt. J. D. Webb, to General Bonham, with orders to remain with him until his troops began to fall back. Captain Webb found the general’s command had already evacuated their positions at the Court-House, and were on the Centreville road, and, upon telling General Bonham his instructions from me, received from him the reply, u Tell Colonel Bodes to commence his retreat immediately, and inform General Ewell of it.” General Ewell had already advised me, but after Captain Webb left me, of General Bonham’s movements.
As soon after the message from General Bonham as I could assemble the companies on the center of our line of defenses our retreat began. We retreated without molestation and in good order to McLean’s Ford, where I reported to General Jones, marching the regiment, except one company, across Bull Bun. Just before sunset I was ordered by General Beauregard, through Colonel Chisolm, to move down to Union Mills. In obedience to this order, the regiment at once recrossed the run, and joined the main body of General Ewell’s command at the mills.
The result of the skirmish may be summed up thus: On our side two men wounded slightly—one in the leg, the other in the ear ,* on the side of the enemy, one prisoner and at least twenty killed and wounded. This estimate I consider safe. Two prisoners taken in the battle of the 21st, who state that they were in the column which advanced along Braddock’s road, stated the loss as much heavier—one, fifty killed and wounded; the other, seventy. These reports come to me from men of this regiment who conversed with said prisoners. In our retreat we lost eight or ten tents and two barrels of crackers; but this, in the case

In obedience to instructions conveyed by circular of the 1st of August,, instant, I have the honor to submit the following report of my brigade,, at that time composed of the Fifth South Carolina Eegiment and Seventeenth and Eighteenth Eegiments of Mississippi Volunteers, for the 18th day of July, during the battle fought on that day at Blackburn’^ Ford, on Bull Bun:
My command was placed in position at McLean’s Ford, on Bull Bunr and did not participate in the engagement of that date. The enemy in some force occupied a position on Eocky Eun, about one mile and a half in front and to the left of my position, and were prevented from making a nearer reconnaissance of our lines by the vigilance of my pickets, which were kept well in advance.

Report of Brig. Gen. James Longstreet, C. S. Army, of action at Black-

Sir : I have the honor to report that in obedience to the orders of the general commanding I took my position at this ford on the 17th instant, my brigade being composed of the First, Eleventh, and Seventeenth Eegiments of Virginia Volunteers. My line of defense being quite extended, I threw out a line of skirmishers to the water’s edge, covering my entire front, holding strong reserves in readiness to defend with the bayonet any point that might be violently attacked.
At 11.30 o’clock a. m. on the 18th my pickets reported the enemy advancing upon the ford in heavy columns of infantry and a strong artillery force. At 12 m. the pickets retired without firing. My artillery (two pieces) were placed in convenient position, with orders to retire the moment it was ascertained that our pieces were commanded by those of the enemy. The first shot from his batter^ discovered the advantage of

his position, and our artillery was properly withdrawn. A fire from the artillery of the enemy was kept up about half an hour, when their infantry was advanced to the attack. He made an assault with a column of three or four thousand of his infantry, which, with a comparatively small force of fresh troops, was with some difficulty repelled. A second and more determined attack was made after a few minutes, which was driven back by the skirmishers, and the companies of the reserve thrown in at the most threatened and weakest points. I then sent a staff officer to Colonel Early for one of the reserve regiments of his brigade. Before the arrival of that regiment a third, though not so severe, attack was made and repulsed. Colonel Hays, Seventh Begiment Louisiana Volunteers, came in and promptly took position in time to assist in driving back the enemy the fourth time, when I ordered the advance, and called on Colonel Early for the balance of his brigade. The passage of the stream was so narrow and difficult, however, that I soon found it would be impossible to make a simultaneous movement, and ordered the troops that had succeeded in crossing to return to their positions. A few small parties, under command of Captain Marye, Seventeenth Begiment Virginia Volunteers, who behaved with great gallantry, met parties of the enemy on the other side of the stream with the bayonet, and drove them back. Colonel Early, with the balance of his brigade, Seventh Begiment Virginia Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, and the Twenty-fourth Begiment Virginia Volunteers, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Hairston, arrived in time to receive the fire of the last attack, but had not been placed in a position where they could fire with effect upon the enemy.
The presence of these regiments probably intimidated the enemy as much as the fire of the troops that met him. Immediately after this attack the enemy’s infantry retired, and his artillery was opened upon us. The battery under Captain Eshleman was called for, and flew into position—four 6-pounders and three rifled guns. The action was thus continued for one hour, when the enemy fell back upon Centreville, some three miles. I am pleased to say that our young artillerists proved themselves equal, if not superior, to the boasted artillerists of the enemy.
Captain Eshleman was severely wounded early in the action. We lost under their artillery six—one killed, five wounded, and one horse wounded; whilst we have reason to believe that the loss of the enemy during the same fire was very much greater. Our loss from the various attacks of the infantry columns was sixty-three killed and wounded. We have no means of learning positively the probable loss of the enemy. Prisoners taken then and since report it from nine hundred to two thousand. These statements were made to myself and members of my staff by the prisoners—the first estimate by a private, the latter by a lieutenant.
I have had command of the brigade so short a time, and have been so busily occupied during that time, that I have been able to make the acquaintance of but few of the officers ,• I am, therefore, unable to mention them by name, as I would like to do, and must refer you to the detailed reports of the regimental commanders. The officers seemed to spring in a body to my assistance at the only critical moment. To discriminate in such a body may seem a little unjust, yet I feel that I should be doing injustice to my acquaintances were I to fail to mention their names—not that I know them to be more distinguished than some others, but that I know what I owe them. Colonel Moore, First Begiment Virginia Volunteers, severely wounded; Colonel Garland, Eleventh Begiment Virginia Volunteers, and Colonel Corse, Seventeenth Begi-

xnent Virginia Volunteers; Lieutenant-Colonels Fry, Funsten, andMun-ford; Majors Harrison (twice shot and mortally wounded), Brent, and Skinner, displayed more coolness and energy than is usual amongst veterans of the old service. I am particularly indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Munford and Major Brent, who having a spare moment and seeing my great need of staff officers at a particular juncture, offered their assistance. Surgeons Cullen, Thornhill, and Davis, Assistant Surgeons Murray, Snowden, and Chalmers, were in the heat of the action much oftener than their duties required, and were exceedingly active and energetic. Lieut. F. S. Armistead, acting assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut. P. T. Manning, aide-de-camp, were very active and gallant in the discharge of their duties. Capt. Thomas Walton and Capt. Macon Thompson, volunteer aids, under their first fire and in their first service, are worthy of their newly-adopted profession. Under a terrific fire these staff officers seemed to take peculiar delight in having occasion to show to those around them their great confidence in our cause and our success.
I inclose the reports of the different commanders, and refer to them for the names of the killed and wounded of their commands.

Report of Col. Jubal A. Early, Tic enty fourth Virginia Infantry, of action
at Blackburn’s Ford.
Hdqrs. Sixth Brigade, Army of the Potomac,
July 31,1861.
Colonel : I submit the following report of the operations of my brigade on the 18th instant in the engagement at Blackburn’s Ford or* Bull Bun, in which our troops were commanded by Brigadier-General Longstreet:
In the morning of that day I marched with my brigade, composed of the Seventh Virginia Volunteers, Colonel Kenqper’s regiment, com-manded by Lieutenant-Colonel Williams; the Seventh Louisiana Volunteers, commanded by Col. Harry T. Hays; six companies of the Twenty-fourth Virginia Volunteers, my own, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Hairston, and three pieces of artillery from the Washington Battalion of New Orleans, under the command of Lieutenant Squires, to Camp Walker, from whence it was moved by direction of General Beauregard into the road leading from Camp Walker to the gate in front of McLean’s farm, where it remained until about 12 o’clock, at which time a large cloud of dust was observed on the high ridge north of Black, burn’s Ford, at which General Longstreet’s brigade was stationed. This cloud of dust proved to be produced by the enemy’s columns moving in that direction, and in a few minutes the cannonading was commenced by the enemy, directed first upon General Bonham’s position at Mitchell’s Ford and subsequently upon the farm-house of McLean and the hospital in his barn, over winch was floating the hospital flag.
As soon as the cannonading commenced my brigade was moved by order of the general to the cover of the pines to tne left of the road

﻿464	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
leading from McLean’s house to Blackburn’s Ford, where it was joined by two more pieces of artillery from the Washington Battery, under Captain Eshleman. At this position it remained for the purpose of supporting either General Bonham at Mitchell’s Ford, General Long-street at Blackburn’s Ford, or General Jones at McLean’s Ford, as occasion might require. After the first cannonading had ceased, and General Beauregard with his staff had passed towards Mitchell’s Ford, a fire of musketry began at Blackburn’s Ford, which became very animated, and was continued for some time, when one of General Long-street’s aides came to inform me that he had repulsed the enemy’s charge* but desired re-enforcements. I immediately put my whole brigade in motion, including the five pieces of artillery, to which, by his own request, was joined Lieutenant Garnett, of the same battery, with twe pieces that had been sent to the rear by General Longstreet before the action commenced.
After my column was put in motion I received an order from General Beauregard to support General Longstreet with two regiments and two pieces of artillery. I therefore proceeded with the Seventh Louisiana Begiment and Seventh Virginia Begiment and two pieces of artillery under charge of Captain Eshleman, to the support of General Longstreet. Upon arriving at Blackburn’s Ford I found the greater part of General Longstreet’s command under cover on the banks of the stream engaged with the enemy, who were under cover on the hill-sides on the opposite banks. Colonel Hays’ regiment, which was in advance, was then placed on the banks of the stream under cover to the right and left of the ford, relieving the Seventeenth Virginia Begiment, under Colonel Corse. This regiment proceeded to its position under quite a brisk fire of musketry.
The Seventh Virginia Begiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, as it arrived, was formed to the right of the ford under a heavy fire of musketry from the enemy, evidently directed at the regiment. It was momentarily thrown into confusion by this fire, and discharged many of its own guns over a portion of our own troops in front; fortunately, however, doing them no damage, as I believe. The regiment was soon rallied, and proceeded to the banks of the stream, relieving the First Virginia Begiment. The two pieces of artillery under Captain Eshleman, w hich followed the Seventh Virginia Begiment, were moved down in the open field on the right of the road, so as to be concealed from view of the enemy’s artillery by the timber on the banks of the stream r where they opened a fire upon the enemy on the opposite side, directed only by the sound of their musketry. As soon as the Seventh Virginia Begiment advanced to the banks of the stream, as above stated, I sent back for the companies of the Twenty-fourth Begiment and the remainder of the pieces of artillery, and they were brought up; the companies of the Twenty-fourth were placed in position in good order to the left of the ford in a space not occupied by Colonel Hays’ regiment, and the remaining guns of the Washington Artillery (five in number) were unlimbered on a line with the first two pieces and to the right of the road. A scattering fire of musketry was kept up for some time, but the enemy finally ceased firing, and evidently retired to the hills, where their artillery guns were placed, having no doubt observed the position of our pieces of artillery, for a fire was soon commenced on them by the enemy’s-artillery, which was responded to by ours, and the cannonading was-continued for a considerable time with great briskness on both sides, the balls and shells from the enemy’s battery being directed with considerable accuracy upon ours, but the enemy finally ceased firing, and did

not renew the attack with musketry. During all this firing, when the balls and shells were passing over the heads of the men on the banks of the stream, they remained at their posts, coolly awaiting the renewal of the attack with musketry.
The affair closed late in the afternoon, and about dusk General Long-street, by direction of General Beauregard, retired with the two regiments of his brigade that had been engaged in the early part of the action to the pines from which I had gone to re-enforce him, leaving my brigade on the ground for the night.
When I first arrived on the ground I joined General Longstreet, being actively engaged in the thickest of the fire in directing and encouraging the men under his command, and I am satisfied he contributed very largely to the repulse of the enemy by his own personal exertions.
The officers and men belonging to the Washington Battery behaved very handsomely indeed under a well-directed and galling lire of the enemy, displaying great coolness and skill in the management of their pieces. The regiments of my brigade came for the first time under fire, and while one regiment was thrown for a few minutes into confusion, without retiring it rallied under fire on the same ground, and took the position assigned it and retained it. Some parties sent across the stream after the close of the fight reported about forty of the enemy found dead on the ground occupied by their infantry during the fight. We were not able to examine the ground occupied by their battery and the regiments of infantry supporting it, because it was evident that a large force was in the neighborhood, and the whole of next day the men were engaged in throwing up embankments to strengthen our position, which was on ground lower than that occupied by the enemy. About one hundred muskets were picked up on the hill sides, with a large number of hats and other articles. From all indications the enemy’s loss must have been much larger than our own. The ranks of the Seventh and Twenty-fourth Virginia Begiments were much thinned by sickness, and the whole number of my brigade did not exceed fifteen hundred men. I have already furnished Brigadier-General Longstreet with a list of the killed and wounded. Capt. Fleming Gardner, my aide and acting assistant adjutant-general, and Capt. George E. Dennis, assistant commissary to the Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiment, who acted as aide during the engagement, discharged their duties to my entire satisfaction.

on Thursday, July 18, I have the honor to report that during the night of the 16th of July I was informed by letters that my batteries might be required on the following day, to be distributed according to the following order:
Distribution of Major WaltonJs Battalion, July 15, 1861.
Second Brigade, General Ewell, in advance of Union Mills Ford, two 12-pounder howitzers, two rilled guns; Third Brigade, General Jones, at McLean’s Ford, one 6-pounder, one 12-pounder howitzer; Fourth Brigade, General Longstreet, at Blackburn’s Ford, two 6-pounders; Fifth Brigade, Colonel Early, at or near Union Mills Ford, one 12-pounder howitzer, one rifled gun; position of Union Mills Ford, one 6-pounder; total number of pieces, 11.
By command of General Beauregard:
THOS. JORDAN, Assistant Actjutant- General.
Subsequently, on the morning of the 17th of July, I was instructed, through Captain Ferguson, your aide-de-camp, to send immediately, via Camp Walker, to the farm house on the hill just this side of the encampment of the company then holding Union Mills Ford, the pieces of my battalion designated for the brigades of Ewell and Early and the one for the defense of said ford, and enter into communication with General Ewell and Colonel Early and await their orders. The other parts of my battalion and my command it was ordered should take post at or near McLean’s farm, and await orders. In obedience to these instructions I at once, upon receipt of the last orders, moved my whole command to the positions indicated, and reported to the officers of the brigades respectively. A battery of four guns, two 12-pounder howitzers and two rilled guns, under command of Lieutenants Bosser, Lewis, and Slocomb, were sent to Union Mills Ford, and reported to General Ewell. A section of a battery—one rilled 6-pounder and one 12-pounder howitzer— under Lieutenant Squires, commanding, and Lieutenant Bichardson reported to Colonel Early near Union Mills Ford. The other parts of my battalion, 6-pounder guns and one 12-pounder howitzer, under my immediate command, took position on McLean’s farm, commanding McLean’s Ford, there awaiting your further orders. About 6 o’clock p. m. 17th ultimo I received from yourself in person orders to go at an early hour in the morning to Union Mills Ford with one 12-pounder howitzer in addition to the battery I had previously ordered to that position upon the road.
Whilst crossing Camp Walker I encountered Colonel Early, in command of his brigade, who communicated to me an order to exchange two rifled guns of Bosser’s battery for two howitzers, one of Squires’ section and one I was conducting to Union Mills Ford, which was promptly accomplished. The distribution of the batteries and command then was as follows:
Four 12-pounder howitzers, Lieutenant Bosser, Union Mills Ford; three 6-pounder rifled guns, Lieutenant Squires, with Colonel Early’s brigade; two 6-pounders, under Lieutenant Whittington and Lieutenant Adam, at McLean’s farm house 5 two 6-pounders, under Lieutenant Garnett, at Blackburn’s Ford ; two 6-pounders, under Captain Miller, at McLean’s Ford.
Subsequently the two 6-pounders of Lieutenant Garnett and the two of Lieutenant Whittington were joined with the three rifled guns of Lieutenant Squires, making his command seven guns, which were all of the battalion of the Washington Artillery actually engaged in the action of the 18th ultimo. The two guns under Captain Miller, with

Jones’ brigade, though frequently in position and under fire, did not become engaged. The battery under Lieutenant Rosser, with which I remained, under the orders received on the evening of the 17th ultimo, was constantly in position during the day, in momentary expectation of an attack on that point from the enemy, who had been seen the evening before and during the entire day reconnoitering our position, small squads frequently emerging from the woods on the other side of the ford near the railroad. This battery, however, had no opportunity of firing a gun, thus disappointing as brave and efficient a command as any in the engagement on that memorable day.
In consequence of my absence from that part of the field where the engagement took place I am obliged to refer you to the annexed copy of the report of Lieutenant Squires, who commanded the seven guns engaged in the action, from which, general, you will be enabled to estimate the gallant services which that small xiortion of my command rendered in that artillery duel against the odds of more than two to one. My loss in this engagement was six wounded—Captain Eshle-man, Fourth Company 5 Privates Zebel, Tarleton, and G. W. Muse, of First Company, and Privates Baker and Tully, of Third Company. Private Muse died during the night from the effect of his wounds.
I would ask your attention to the report of Lieutenant Squires in relation to the brave conduct of the officers and non-commissioned officers especially named by him, and avail myself of the opportunity afforded me to confirm hite report of the gallant conduct of all the officers and the rank and file who were so fortunate as to be engaged on that day.
To Lieutenant Squires is due great credit for his coolness, skill, and daring under the peculiar circumstances by which he was surrounded. Never before having been under fire, and having under his command guns and men other than those of his own company, he on all hands is acknowledged, assisted by the devotion and courage of the brave officers and men who acted with him, to have done much towards the accomplishment of a wonderful victory, as honorable to his State and his corps as gratifying to his companions and valuable to his country.
I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

Report of Lieut. C. W. Squires, Washington Artillery, of action at Black-
hum1 s Ford.
Camp Louisiana, August 1,1861. Sir : I have the honor to make the following report:
Early on the morning of the 18th ultimo the three x>ieees of artillery under my command were ordered to march in the direction of Blackburn’s Ford with Col. Jubal A. Early’s brigade. On reaching McLean’s farm house we were joined by two more xiieces of our battalion, under command of Lieut. J. B. Whittington and L. A. Adam. We were directed by the commanding officer (Colonel Early) to form one battery and act together. We were ordered to take position behind a piece of woods within a short distance of Bull Run, and place the command in

[Chap. IX.
such a position as would enable us to move in any direction. We had not been in this position ten minutes before the enemy began firing rifled shell and round shot at the hospital which was on our right, but did little or no execution. Soon after we heard the firing of our infantry, which was apparently returned by the enemy with musketry and cannon. We now received orders to take our battery to an open ground within a half mile of Blackburn’s Ford, where we were again halted, with instructions to follow behind the Seventh Louisiana Regiment with two rifled cannon, holding one rifled and two 6-pounders in reserve with Colonel Kemper’s volunteer regiment. The guns were detached under Lieutenant Richardson, assisted by Oapt. B. F. Eshleman, of the Fourth Company, who had been with us during the morning. We were now joined by Lieut. J. J. Garnett with a section which was attached to General Longstreet’s brigade.
Hearing firing, and supposing it to be our rifled cannon under Lieutenant Richardson, I left the five pieces under command of Lieutenant Garnett, and rode in that direction to see if my battery of five pieces in the rear could be used, and get orders to bring them on the field. I found the guns in battery firing through a thick piece of woods, and appeared to have done good execution, as the enemy were now driven back and nothing could be seen of them. Lieutenant Garnett in the mean time received orders to join us, which he did. The guns were ordered to form in battery on the left, which order was promptly obeyed. Orders came to cease firing, as the enemy had retreated. We rested about fifteen minutes, when a courier came, stating that the enemy had rallied and the infantry were marching in column of companies to attack our battery on the right flank. We then received orders to find out their position and commence firing, which order was obeyed.
We at first directed our fire against the infantry, whose bayonets we could see over the tree tops, but had not fired five rounds before the enemy brought a battery in position on a high hill directly in front of us and opened their fire. I immediately gave orders to the gunners to fire a little below the point from whence the smoke of the enemy’s guns came. The firing now became general on both sides, the enemy firing at first over our heads, but gradually getting our range. We returned their fire, and were informed by General Longstreet that we were doing great execution. The enemy’s guns ceased firing for a few minutes, and it appeared that something had happened. Our battery in the mean time kept up rapid firing. The enemy soon opened again, their shells bursting in the very midst of our battery, wounding Capt. Eshleman, Privates H. L. Zebel, J. A. Tarleton, and G. W. Muse, of First Company, and Privates H. Tully and A. Baker, of Third Company; also Lieutenant Richardson’s horse, the lieutenant himself barely escaping with his life. G. W. Muse died of his wound during the night.
At this point Lieutenant Garnett brought orders from the general commanding to advance by hand to the front, which was no sooner executed than a shower of shell, spherical case, and round shot flew over our heads. One of our guns was disabled, the vent having been enlarged, which rendered it useless. Seeing that our men could not stand the work much longer I sent Lieutenant Garnett to General Longstreet, commanding, to state our condition. He brought an order to withdraw piece by piece from the left, leaving one piece to return the fire of the enemy, gun for gun. It was evident that the enemy was retiring, as his shots were few and long intervals between each discharge. At this juncture we were ordered to fire the last gun at the retreating foe.

at that point then consisted of nine regiments and two battalions of infantry, four companies of artillery, with sixteen pieces without caissons, harness, or horses, and about three hundred cavalry. They were, of course, undisciplined, several regiments without accouterments, and with an entirely inadequate supply of ammunition.
I lost no time in making a complete reconnaissance of the place and its environs, in which the chief engineer, Major (now Brigadier-General) Whiting, ably assisted. The result confirmed my preconceived ideas. The position is untenable by any force not strong enough to take the field against an invading army and to hold both sides of the Potomac. It is a triangle, two sides being formed by the Potomac and the Shenandoah, and the third by Furnace Eidge. The plateau thus inclosed, and the end of Furnace Eidge itself, the only defensible position, which, however, required for its adequate occupation double our numbers, was exposed to enfilade and reverse fires of artillery from heights on the Maryland side of the river. Within that line the ground was more favorable to an attacking than to a defending force. The Potomac can be easily crossed at many points above and below, so that it is easily turned. It is twenty miles from the great route into the valley of Virginia from Pennsylvania and Maryland, by which General Patterson’s approach was expected. Its garrison was thus out of position to defend that valley or to prevent General McClellan’s junction with General Patterson. These were the obvious and important objects to be kept in view. Besides being in position for them, it was necessary to be able on emergency to join General Beauregard.
The occupation of Harper’s Ferry by our Army perfectly suited the enemy’s views. We wrere bound to a fixed point; his movements were unrestricted. These views were submitted to the military authorities. The continued occupation of the place was, however, deemed by them indispensable. I determined to hold it until the great objects of the Government required its abandonment. The practicable roads from the West and Northwest, as well as from Manassas, meet the route from Pennsylvania and Maryland at Winchester. That point was, therefore, in my opinion, our best position. The distinguished commander of the Army of the Potomac was convinced, like myself, of our dependence upon each other, and promised to co-operate with me in case of need. To guard against surprise and to impose upon the enemy, Major Whiting was directed to mount a few heavy guns upon Furnace Eidge and otherwise strengthen the position.
I was employed until the 13th of June in continuing what had been begun by my predecessor, Colonel (now Major-General) Jackson—the organization, instruction, and equipment of the troops, and providing means of transportation and artillery horses. The river was observed from the Point of Eocks to the western part of the county of Berkeley, the most distant portions by the indefatigable Stuart with his cavalry. General Patterson’s troops were within a few hours of Williamsport, and General McClellan’s in Western Virginia were supposed to be approaching to effect a junction with Patterson, whose force was reported by well-informed persons to be eighteen thousand men.
On the morning of the 13th of June information was received from Winchester that Eomney was occupied by two thousand Federal troops, supposed to be the vanguard of McClellan’s army. Col. A. P. Hill, with his own (Thirteenth) and Colonel Gibbons’ (Tenth) Virginia Eegiments, was dispatched by railway to Winchester. He was directed to move thence towards Eomney, to take the best position and best measures to check the advance of the enemy. He was to add to his command

the Third Tennessee Regiment, which had just arrived at Winchester. During that day and the next the heavy baggage and remaining public property were sent to Winchester by the railway, and the bridges on the Potomac destroyed.
On the morning of the 15th the Army left Harper’s Ferry for Winchester—the force had been increased by three regiments since the 1st of June—and bivouacked four miles beyond Charlestown.
On the morning of the 16th intelligence was received that General Patterson’s army had crossed the Potomac at Williamsport ; also, that the United States force at Romney had fallen back. A courier from Richmond brought a dispatch authorizing me to evacuate Harper’s Ferry at my discretion. The Army was ordered to gain the Martinsburg turnpike by a flank movement to Bunker Hill, in order to place itself bet ween Winchester and the expected advance of Patterson. On hearing of this, the enemy recrossed the river i>recipitately.
Resuming my first direction and plan, I proceeded to Winchester. There the Army was in position to oppose either McClellan from the west or Patterson from the northeast, and to form a junction with General Beauregard when necessary. Lieut. Col. George H. Steuart, with his Maryland battalion, was sent to Harper’s Ferry to bring off some public property said to have been left. As McClellan was moving southwest-ward from Grafton Colonel Hill’s command was withdrawn from Romney. The defense of that region of country was intrusted to Colonel McDonald’s regiment of cavalry.
Intelligence from Maryland indicating another movement by Patterson, Colonel Jackson, with his brigade, wras sent to the neighborhood of Martinsburg to support Colonel Stuart. The latter officer had been placed in observation on the line of the Potomac with his cavalry, his increasing vigilance and activity relied on to repress small incursions of the enemy, to give intelligence of invasion by them, and to wmtch, harass, and circumscribe their every movement. Colonel Jackson was instructed to destroy such of the rolling stock of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as could not be brought off, and to have so much of it as could be made available to our service brought to Winchester.
Major Whiting was ordered to plan defensive works, and to have some heavy guns and navy carriages mounted. About twenty-five hundred militia, under Brigadier-General Carson, were called out from Frederick and the neighboring counties to man them.
On the 2d of July General Patterson again crossed the Potomac. Colonel Jackson, pursuant to instructions, fell back before him. In retiring he gave him a severe lesson in the affair at Falling Waters. With a battalion of the Fifth Virginia Regiment (Harper’s) and Pendleton’s battery of field artillery lie engaged the enemy’s advance. Skillfully taking a position where the smallness of his force was concealed, he engaged them for a considerable time, inflicted a heavy loss, and retired when about to be outflanked, scarcely losing a man, but bringing off forty-five prisoners.
Upon this intelligence the Army, strengthened by the arrival of General Bee and Colonel Elzey and the Ninth Georgia Regiment, wras ordered forwmrd to the sux>port of Jackson. It met him at Darkesville, six miles from Martinsburg, where it took up a position for action, as General Patterson, it was supposed, was closely following Colonel Jackson. We waited for him in this position lour days, hoping to be attacked by an adversary at least double our numbers, but unwilling to attack him in a town so defensible as Martinsburg, with its solid buildings and inclosures of masonry. Convinced at length that he w ould not approach

us I returned to Winchester, much to the disappointment of our troops, who were eager for battle with the invaders. Colonel Stuart, with liis cavalry, as usual, remained near the enemy.
Before the 15th of July the enemy’s force, according to the best intelligence to be obtained, amounted to about thirty-two thousand. Ours had been increased by eight Southern regiments. On the 15th of July Colonel Stuart reported the advance of General Patterson from Martins-burg. He halted, however, at Bunker Hill, nine miles from Winchester, where he remained on the 16th. On the 17th he moved to his left to Smithfield. This created the impression that he intended to attack us on the south, or was merely holding us in check while General Beauregard should be attacked at Manassas by General Scott. About 1 o’clock on the morning of July 18 I received from the Government a telegraphic dispatch informing me that the Northern Army was advancing upon Manassas, then held by General Beauregard, and directing me, if practicable, to go to that officer’s assistance, after* sending my sick to Culpeper Court-House. In the exercise of the discretion conferred by the terms of the order, I at once determined to march to join General Beauregard. The best service which the Army of the Shenandoah could render was to prevent the defeat of that of the Potomac. To be able to do this it was necessary, in the first instance, to defeat General Patterson or to elude him. The latter course was the most speedy and certain, and was therefore adopted. Our sick, Pearly seventeen hundred in number, were provided for in Winchester. For the defense of that place the militia of Generals Carson and Meem seemed ample, for I thought it certain that General Patterson would follow my movement as soon as he discovered it. Evading him by the dispositions made of the advance-guard, under Colonel Stuart, the Army moved through Ashby’s Gap to Piedmont, a station of the Manassas Gap Bailroad. Hence the infantry were to be transported by the railway, while the cavalry and artillery were ordered to continue their march.
I reached Manassas about noon on the 20th, preceded by the Seventh and Eighth Georgia Regiments and by Jackson’s brigade, consisting of the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Twenty-seventh, and Thirty-third Virginia Regiments. I was accompanied by General Bee, with the Fourth Alabama, the Second, and two companies of the Eleventh Mississippi. The president of the railroad company had assured me that the remaining troops should arrive during the day. I found General Beauregard’s position too extensive, and the ground too densely wooded and intricate, to be learned in the brief time at my disposal, and therefore determined to rely upon his knowledge of it and of the enemy’s positions. This I did readily from full confidence in his capacity.
His troops were divided into eight brigades, occupying the defensive line of Bull Run. Brigadier-General Ewell’s was posted at the Union Mills Ford; Brig. Gen. D. R. Jones’ at McLean’s Ford; Brigadier-General Longstreet’s at Blackburn’s Ford; Brigadier-General Bonham’s at Mitchell’s Ford; Colonel Cocke’s at Ball’s Ford, some three miles above; and Colonel Evans, with a regiment and battalion, formed the extreme left at the stone bridge. The brigades of Brigadier-General Holmes and Colonel Early were in reserve in rear of the right. I regarded the arrival of the remainder of the Army of the Shenandoah during the night as certain, and Patterson’s junction with the Grand Army on the 22d as probable.
During the evening it was determined, instead of remaining in the

﻿474	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
defensive positions then occupied, to assume the offensive and attack the enemy before such a junction. General Beauregard proposed a plan of battle, which I approved without hesitation. He drew up the necessary order during the night, which was approved formally by me at 4.30 o’clock on the morning of the 21st. The early movements of the enemy on that morning and the non-arrival of the expected troops prevented its execution. General Beauregard afterwards proposed a modification of the abandoned plan, to attack with our right while the left stood on the defensive. This, too, became impracticable, and a battle ensued different in place and circumstances from any previous plan on our side.
Soon after sunrise on the morning of the 21st a light cannonade was opened upon Colonel Evans’ position. A similar demonstration was made against the center soon after, and strong forces were observed in front of it and of the right. About 8 o’clock General Beauregard and I placed ourselves on a commanding hill in rear of General Bonham’s left. Near 9 o’clock the signal officer, Captain Alexander, reported that a large body of troops was crossing the valley of Bull Run some two miles above the bridge. General Bee, who had been placed near Colonel Cocke’s position, Colonel Hampton, with his Legion, and Colonel Jackson, from a point near General Bonham’s left, were ordered to hasten to the left flank. The signal officer soon called our attention to a heavy cloud of dust to the northwest and about ten miles off*, such as the march of an army would raise. This excited apprehensions of General Patterson’s approach.
The enemy, under cover of a strong demonstration on our right, made a long detour through the woods on his right, crossed Bull Run two miles above our left, and threw himself upon the flank and rear of our position. This movement was fortunately discovered by us in time to check its progress, and ultimately to form a new line of battle nearly at right angles with the defensive line of Bull Run.
On discovering that the enemy had crossed the stream above him, Colonel Evans moved to his left with eleven companies and two field-pieces to oppose his advance, and disposed his little force under cover of the wood near the intersection of the Warren ton turnpike and the Sudley road. Here he was attacked by the enemy in immensely superior numbers, against which he maintained himself with skill and unshrinking courage. General Bee moving towards the enemy, guided by the firing, had with a soldier’s eye selected the position near the Henry house, and formed his troops upon it. They were the Seventh and Eighth Georgia, Fourth Alabama, Second Mississippi, and two companies of the Eleventh Mississippi, with Imboden’s battery. Being compelled, however, to sustain Colonel Evans, he crossed the valley and formed on the right and somewhat in advance of his position. Here the joint force, little exceeding five regiments, with six field pieces, held the ground against about fifteen thousand United States troops for an hour, until, finding themselves outflanked by the continually arriving troops of the enemy, they fell back to General Bee’s first positiofl, upon the line of which Jackson, just arriving, formed his brigade and Stanard’s battery. Colonel Hampton, who had by this time advanced with his Legion as far as the turnpike, rendered efficient service in maintaining the orderly character of the retreat from that point; and here fell the gallant Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, his second in command.
In the mean time I waited with General Beauregard near the center the full development of the enemy’s designs. About 11 o’clock the violence of the firing on the left indicated a battle, and the march of a large

475
body of troops from the enemy’s center towards tbe conflict was shown by clouds of dust. I was thus convinced that his great effort was to be made with his right. I stated that conviction to General Beauregard, and the absolute necessity of immediately strengthening our left as much as possible. Orders were accordingly at once sent to General Holmes and Colonel Early to move with all speed to the sound of the firing, and to General Bonham to send up two of his regiments and a battery. General Beauregard and I then hurried at a rapid gallop to the scene of action, about four miles off. On the way I directed my chief of artillery, Colonel Pendleton, to follow with his own and Alburtis’ batteries.
We came not a moment too soon. The long contest against fivefold odds and heavy losses, especially of field officers, had greatly discouraged the troops of General Bee and Colonel Evans. Our presence with them under fire and some example had the happiest effect on the spirit of the troops. Order was soon restored and the battle re-established, to which the firmness of Jackson’s brigade greatly contributed. Then, in a brief and rapid conference, General Beauregard was assigned to the command of the left, which, as the younger officer, he claimed, while I returned to that of the whole field. The aspect of affairs was critical, but I had full confidence in the skill and indomitable courage of General Beauregard, the high soldierly qualities of Generals Bee and Jackson and Coionel Evans, and the devoted patriotism of their troops.
Orders were first dispatched to hasten the march of General Holmes’, Colonel Early’s, and General Bonham’s regiments. General Ewell was also directed to follow with all speed. Many of the broken troops, fragments of companies, and individual stragglers were reformed and brought into action with the aid of my staff and a portion of General Beauregard’s. Colonel (late Governor) Smith with his battalion and Colonel Hunjbon with his regiment were ordered up to re-enforce the right. I have since learned that General Beauregard had previously ordered them into the battle. They belonged to his corps. Colonel Smith’s cheerful courage had a fine influence, not only upon the spirit of his own men, but upon the stragglers of the troops engaged. The largest body of these, equal to about four companies, having no competent field officer, I placed under the command of one of my staff, Col. E. J. Thomas, who fell while gallantly leading it against the enemy. These re-enforcements w^ere all sent to the right to re-establish more perfectly that part of our line. Having attended to these pressing duties at the immediate scene of conflict, my eye was next directed to Colonel Cocke’s brigade, the nearest at hand. Hastening to his position, I desired him to lead his troops into action. He informed me, however, that a large body of the enemy’s troops beyond the stream and below the bridge threatened us from that quarter. He was therefore left in his position.
My headquarters were now established near the Lewis house. From this commanding elevation my view embraced the position of the enemy beyond the stream and the approaches to the stone bridge, a point of especial importance. I could also see the advances of our troops far down the valley in the direction of Manassas, and observe the progress of the action and the maneuvers of the enemy.
We had now sixteen gun sand twro hundred and sixty cavalry and a little above nine regiments of the Army of the Shenandoah and six guns, and less than the strength of three regiments of that of the Potomac, engaged writh about thirty-five thousand United States troops, among whom were full three thousand of the old Regular Army. Yet this admirable artillery and brave infantry and cavalry lost no foot of ground. For nearly three hours they maintained their position, repelling five succes-

﻿476	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
sive assaults by the heavy masses of the enemy, whose numbers enabled him continually to bring up fresh troops as their preceding columns were driven back. Colonel Stuart contributed to one of these repulses by a well-timed and vigorous charge on the enemy’s right flank with two companies of his cavalry.
The efficiency of our infantry and cavalry might have been expected from a patriotic people accustomed like ours to the management of arms and horses, but that of the artillery was little less than wonderful. They were opposed to batteries far superior in the number, range, and equipment of their guns, with educated officers and thoroughly instructed soldiers. We had but one educated artillerist, Colonel Pendleton, that model of a Christian soldier, yet they exhibited as much superiority to the enemy in skill as in courage. Their fire was superior both in rapidity and precision.
About 2 o’clock an officer of General Beauregard’s adjutant-general’s office galloped from Manassas to report to me that a United States army had reached the line of Manassas Gap Bailroad, was marching towards us, and then but three or four miles from our left flank. The expected re-enforcements appeared soon after. Colonel Cocke was then desired to lead his brigade into action to support the right of the troops engaged, which he did with alacrity and effect. Within a half hour the two regiments of General Bonham’s brigade (Cash’s and Kershaw’s) came up, and were directed against the enemy’s right, which he seemed to be strengthening. Fisher’s North Carolina regiment was soon after sent in the same direction. About 3 o’clock, while the enemy seemed to be striving to outflank and drive back our left, and thus separate us from Manassas, General E. K. Smith arrived with three regiments of Elzey’s brigade. He was instructed to attack the right flank of the enemy, now exposed to us. Before the movement was completed he fell, severely wounded. Colonel Elzey, at once taking command, executed it with great promptitude and vigor. General Beauregard rapidly seized the opportunity thus afforded him, and threw forward his whole line. The enemy was driven back from the long-contested hill, and victory was no longer doubtful.
He made yet another attempt to retrieve the day. He again extended his right with a still wider sweep to turn our left. Just as he reformed to renew the battle Colonel Early’s three regiments came upon the field. The enemy’s new formation exposed his right flank more even than the previous one. Colonel Early was therefore ordered to throw himself directly upon it, supported by Colonel Stuart’s Cavalry and Beckham’s battery. He executed this attack bravely and well, while a simultaneous charge was made by General Beauregard in front. The enemy was broken by this combined attack. He lost all the artillery which he had advanced to the scene of the conflict. He had no more fresh troops to rally on, and a general rout ensued.
Instructions were instantly sent to General Bonham to march by the quickest route to the turnpike to intercept the fugitives, and to General Longstreet to follow as closely as possible upon the right. Their progress was checked by the enemy’s reserve and by night, at Centreville. Schenck’s brigade made a slight demonstration towards Lewis’ Ford, which was quickly checked by Holmes’ brigade, which had just arrived from the right. His artillery, under Captain Walker, was used with great skill. Colonel Stuart pressed the pursuit on the enemy’s principal line of retreat, the Sudley road. Four companies of cavalry, under Colonel Badford and Lieutenant-Colonel Munford, which I had held in reserve, were ordered to cross the stream at Ball’s Ford to

reach the turnpike, the line of retreat of the enemy’s left. Our cavalry found the roads encumbered with dead and wounded (many of whom seemed to have been thrown from wagons), arms, accouterments, and clothing.
A report came to me from the right that a strong body of U. S. troops was advancing upon Manassas. General Holmes, who had just reached the field, and General Ewell, on his way to it, were ordered to meet this unexpected attack. They found no foe, however.
Our victory was as complete as one gained by infantry and artillery can be. An adequate force of cavalry would have made it decisive. It is due, under Almighty God, to the skill and resolution of General Beauregard, the admirable conduct of Generals Bee, E. K. Smith, and Jackson, and of Colonels (commanding brigades) Evans, Cocke, Early, and Elzey, and the courage and unyielding firmness of our patriotic volunteers. The admirable character of our troops is incontestably proved by the result of this battle, especially when it is remembered that little more than six thousand men of the Army of the Shenandoah with sixteen guns, and less than two thousand of that of the Potomac with six guns, for full five hours successfully resisted thirty-five thousand U. S. troops with a powerful artillery and a superior force of regular cavalry. Our forces engaged, gradually increasing during the remainder of the contest, amounted to but — men at the close of the battle. The brunt of this hard-fought engagement fell upon the troops who held their ground so long with such heroic resolution. The unfading honor which they won was dearly bought with the blood of many of our best and bravest. Their loss was far heavier in proportion than that of the troops coming later into action.
Every regiment and battery engaged performed its part well. The commanders of brigades have been already mentioned. I refer you to General Beauregard’s report for the names of the officers of the Army of the Potomac who distinguished themselves most. I cannot enumerate all of the Army of the Shenandoah who deserve distinction, and will confine myself to those of high rank : Colonels Bartow and Fisher (killed); Jones (mortally wounded); Harper, J. F. Preston, Cummings, Falkner, Gartrell, and Vaughn; J. E. B. Stuart, of the cavalry, and Pendleton, of the artillery; Lieutenant-Colonels Echols, Lightfoot, Lack-land, G. H. Steuart, and Gardner. The last-named gallant officer was severely wounded.
The loss of the Army of the Potomac was 108 killed, 510 wounded, and 12 missing. That of the Army of the Shenandoah was 270 killed, 979 wounded, and 18 missing. Total killed, 378; wounded, 1,489; missing, 30. That of the enemy could not be ascertained. It must have been four or five thousand.
Twenty-eight pieces of artillery, about five thousand muskets, and nearly five hundred thousand cartridges, a garrison flag, and ten colors w~ere captured on the field or in the pursuit. Besides these wre captured sixty-four artillery horses, with their harness, twenty-six wagons, and much camp equipage, clothing, and other property abandoned in their flight.
The officers of my staff deserve high commendation for their efficient and gallant services during the day and the campaign, and I beg leave to call the attention of the Government to their merits. Maj. W. II. C. Whiting, chief engineer, wTas invaluable to me for his signal ability in his profession and for his indefatigable activity before and in the battle. Major McLean, chief quartermaster, and Major Kearsley, chief commissary, conducted their respective departments with skill and

energy. Major Rhett, assistant adjutant-general, wlio joined me only the day before, was of great service. I left him at Manassas, and to his experience and energy I intrusted the care of ordering my troops to the field of battle as they should arrive, and forwarding ammunition for the artillery during the action. Capts. 0. M. Fauntleroy, 0. S. Navy, T. L. Preston, assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut. J. B. Washington, aide-de-camp, conveyed my orders bravely and well on this their first field, as did several gallant gentlemen who volunteered their services— Colonel Cole, of Florida; Major Deas, of Alabama; Colonel Duncan, of Kentucky. Lieut. Beverly Randolph, C. S. Army, aided Col. F. J. Thomas in the command of the body of troops he led into action and fought with gallantry. With these was my gallant friend Capt. Bar-low Mason, who was mortally wounded. I have already mentioned the brave death of my ordnance officer, Col. F. J. Thomas. I was much indebted also to Cols. J. S. Preston, Manning, Miles, and Chisolm, and Captain Stevens, of the Engineer Corps, members of General Beauregard’s staff, who kindly proffered their services and rendered efficient and valuable aid at different times during the day. Col. G. W. Lay, of General Bonham’s staff, delivered the instructions to the troops sent in pursuit and to intercept the enemy, with much intelligence and courage.
It will be remarked that the three brigadier-generals of the Army of the Shenandoah were all wounded. I have already mentioned the wound of General Smith. General Jackson, though painfully wounded early in the day, commanded his brigade until the close of the action. General Bee, after great exposure at the commencement of the engagement, was mortally wounded just as our re-enforcements were coming up.
The apparent firmness of the U. S. troops at Centreville, who had not been engaged, which checked our pursuit; the strong forces occupying the works near Georgetown, Arlington, and Alexandria; the certainty, too, that General Patterson, if needed, would reach Washington with his army of thirty thousand men sooner than we could, and the condition and inadequate means of the Army in ammunition, provisions, and transportation prevented any serious thoughts of advancing against the capital. It is certain that the fresh troops within the works were in number quite sufficient for their defense. If not, General Patterson’s army would certainly re-enforce them soon enough.
This report will be presented to you by my aide-de-camp, Lieut. J. B. Washington, by whom, and by General Beauregard’s aide, Lieutenant Ferguson, the captured colors are transmitted to the War Department.
Most respectfullv, your obedient servant,

The word “ after” is not found in the dispatch before the words “ sending your sick,” as is stated in the report; so that the argument based on it requires no comment. The order to move “if practicable” had reference to General Johnston’s letters of 12th and 15th July, representing the relative strength and positions of the enemy under Patterson and of his own forces to be such as to urnke it doubtful whether General Johnston had the power to effect the movement.

Sir : My attention has been called to the fact that in the enumeration of the officers who distinguished themselves in the battle of Manassas the name of Col. S. B. Gibbons, commanding the Tenth Virginia Regiment, was omitted. This omission was due to unaccountable carelessness, and is a matter of regret and mortification to me. I beg that it may be corrected in my report on file in your office, and the correction published. Colonel Gibbons and his gallant regiment played an important part at a critical time, and injustice to them, even accidentally, is unpardonable. Colonel Elzey, to whose brigade Colonel Gibbons belongs, made honorable mention of him in his report.

Report of Brig. Gen. T. J. Jackson, C. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, Army of the Shenandoah.
Headquarters First Brigade, Camp near Manassas, Va., JwZy 23, 1861.
Major : I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my brigade on the 21st:
About 4 in the morning I received notice from General Longstreet that he needed a re-enlorcement of two regiments, which were accordingly ordered.
Subsequently I received an order from General Beauregard to move to the support of General Bonham, afterwards to support General Cocke, and finally to take such position as would enable me to re-enforce either, as circumstances might require.
Whilst in the position last indicated I received a request from General Cocke to guard the stone bridge, and immediately moved forward to effect the object in view.
Subsequently ascertaining that General Bee, who was on the left of our line, was hard pressed, 1 marched to his assistance, notifying him at the same time that I was advancing to his support $ but, before arriving within cannon range of the enemy, I met General Bee’s forces falling back. I continued to advance with the understanding that he would form in my rear. His battery, under its dauntless commander, Captain Imboden, reversed and advanced with my brigade.
The first favorable position for meeting the enemy was at the next summit, where, at 11.30 a. m., I posted Captain Imboden’s battery and two pieces of Captain Stanard’s, so as to play upon the advancing foe. The Fourth Begiment, commanded by Col. James F. Preston, and the Twenty-seventh Regiment, commanded by Lieut. Col. John Echols, were posted in rear of the batteries; the Fifth Regiment, commanded by Col. Kenton Harper, was posted on the right of the batteries ; the Second Regiment, commanded by Col. James W. Allen, on the left, and the Thirty-third, commanded by Col. A. 0. Cummings, on his left. I also ordered forward the other two pieces of Captain Stanard’s and all those of Colonel Pendleton’s battery. They, as well as the battery under Lieutenant Pelham, came into action on the same line as the others; and nobly did the artillery maintain its position for hours against the enemy’s advancing thousands. Great praise is due to Colonel Pendleton and the other officers and men.
Apprehensive lest my flanks should be turned, I sent an order to Colonels Stuart and Radford, of the cavalry, to secure them. Colonel Stuart and that x>art of his command with him deserve great praise for the promptness with wrhich they moved to my left and secured the flank by timely charging the enemy and driving him back.
General Bee, with his rallied troops, soon marched to my support; and as re-enforcements continued to arrive General Beauregard posted them so as to strengthen the flanks of my brigade. The enemy not being able to force our lines by a direct fire of artillery, inclined part of his batteries to the right, so as to obtain an oblique fire 5 but in doing so exposed his pieces to a more destructive fire from our artillery, and one of his batteries was thrown so near to Colonel Cummings that it fell into his hands in consequence of his having made a gallant charge on it with his regiment ; but owing to a destructive small-arm fire from the enemy he was forced to abandon it.

[Chap. IX.
At 3.30 p. m. the advance of the enemy having reached a position which called for the use of the bayonet, I gave the command for the charge of the more than brave Fourth and Twenty-seventh, and, under commanders worthy of such regiments, they, in the order in which they were posted, rushed forward obliquely to the left of our batteries, and through the blessing of God, who gave us the victory, pierced the enemy’s center, and by co-operating with the victorious Fifth and other forces soon placed the field essentially in our possession.
About the time that Colonel Preston passed our artillery the heroic Lieutenant-Colonel Lackland, of the Second Eegiment, followed by the highly meritorious right of the Second, took possession of and endeavored to remove from the field the battery which Colonel Cummings had previously been forced to abandon; but after removing one of the pieces some distance was also forced by the enemy’s fire to abandon it.
The brigade, in connection with other troops, took seven field pieces in addition to the battery captured by Colonel Cummings. The enemy, though repulsed in the center, succeeded in turning our flanks. But their batteries having been disabled by our fire, and also abandoned by reason of the infantry charges, the victory was soon completed by the fire of small-arms and occasional shots from a part of our artillery, which I posted on the next crest in rear.
By direction of General Johnston I assumed the command of all the remaining artillery and infantry of the Army near the Lewis house, to act as circumstances might require. Part of this artillery fired on the retreating enemy. The colors of the First Michigan Regiment and an artillery flag were captured—the first by the Twenty-seventh Regiment and the other by the Fourth.
Lieut. Col. F. B. Jones, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieut. T. G. Lee, aide-de-camp, and Lieut. A. S. Pendleton, brigade ordnance officer, and Capt. Thomas Marshall, volunteer aide, rendered valuable service. Cadets J. W. Thompson and N. W. Lee, also volunteer aides, merit special praise. Dr. Hunter H. McGuire has proved himself to be eminently qualified for his position—that of medical director of the brigade. Capt. Thomas L. Preston, though not of my command, rendered valuable service during the action.
It is with pain that I have to report as killed 11 officers, 14 non-commissioned officers, and 86 privates; wounded, 22 officers, 27 non-commissioned officers, and 319 privates; and missing, 1 officer and 4 privates.
I respectfully call attention to the accompanying reports of the commanders of the regiments and battery composing this brigade.*

immediately across tlie run to his left flank, but finding that it would be easier to attain his right flank, I immediately returned and marched rapidly towards the heaviest fire. As I approached the ground General Jackson, whose brigade was then engaged, sent me word to protect his flanks, but particularly his left flank. I divided the regiment, giving Major Swan half (I had but 300 men for duty), and with the remainder hurried up to Jackson’s left, leaving his right to Swan. Entering a skirt of woods, I received intelligence that the enemy was rapidly outflanking us. I hastened forward through several fences just as a regiment dressed in red was running in disorder towards a skirt of woods where the fire had been heaviest. I took them to be ours, and exclaimed with all my might: u Don’t run, boys; we are here.” They paid very little attention to this appeal. When passing in column of twos through a narrow gap to gain the same field and very close to them I saw in their hands the U. S. flag. I ordered the charge, which was handsomely done, stopping their flank movement and checking the advance upon Jackson. I rallied again for another charge, as only a portion of my command was in the first, owing to the difficulty of closing up; but finding the enemy had gained the woods to my right and front, leaving no ground for charging, I retired to the next field to give them another dash if they penetrated beyond the woods, which, however, they did not attempt.
In this encounter the enemy’s line, or rather column, was broken and many killed. Captain Carter’s company, on which the heaviest of the action fell, lost 9 men killed or mortally wounded, and — wounded, and 18 horses killed. Captain Carter’s horse was shot dead as he was gallantly leading his company in to the enemy.
Of the gallantry of those engaged I cannot speak in too high terms.
The regiment charged was the Fire Zouaves, and I am informed by prisoners subsequently taken that their repulse by the cavalry began the panic so fearful afterwards in the enemy’s ranks.
Just after the cavalry charge our re-enforcements arrived upon the field and formed rapidly on right into line. The first was Colonel Falkner’s regiment (Mississippians,) whose gallantry came under my own observation. As these re-enforcements formed I gradually moved off to the left, where I soon found myself joined by a battery, under the direction of Lieutenant Beckham, which my cavalry supported. This battery made great havoc in the enemy’s ranks and finally put them in full retreat. The principal credit here was due to this battery; but having thrown forward vedettes far out on the eminences, the important information I was thus enabled to give the battery as to position and movements must have contributed greatly to its success, and here I may add that this information was also sent back to the infantry, which was still far to our right, notifying what woods could be gained, &c.
The enemy being now in full retreat, I followed with the cavalry as rapidly as possible, but was so much encumbered with prisoners, whom I sent as fast as possible back to the infantry, that my command was soon too much reduced to encounter any odds, but I nevertheless followed our success until I reached a point twelve miles from Manassas, when, by sending back so many detachments with prisoners, I had but a squad left. The rear of the enemy was protected by a squadron of cavalry and some artillery. We cut off a great many squads, many of whom fired upon us as we approached, and the artillery gave us a volley of grape. One man of ours was killed and another wounded at this point. I have no idea how many prisoners were taken.

I encamped that night on Sudley farm, where was a large church, used as a hospital by the enemy, containing about 300 wounded, the majority mortally.
I cannot speak in too high praise of those whom I had the honor to command on the field, but to Mr. L. T. Brian and Mr. P. W. Hairston and J. F. Brown, having no commissions, whose meritorious conduct and worth have been made the subject of previous letters to the general, I was specially indebted for valuable assistance.
Of my regiment the acting chaplain, Bev. Mr. Ball, was conspicuously useful, while my attention was particularly attracted to the adjutant, Lieut. W. W. Blackford; the sergeant-major, Philip H. Powers, and Lieutenant Cummings, whose good conduct on this as on every other occasion deserves high commendation. Lieutenant Beckham deserves high praise for the success of his battery, as he acted as gunner to each piece himself. In the pursuit Lieut. William Taylor alone captured six of the enemy with arms in their hands. A large number of arms, quantities of clothing and hospital stores, and means of transportation were found abandoned on the road.

cidedly superior force, both as to numbers and war equipage, to attack or turn my position in this quarter, was immediately impending, I dispatched on the 13th of July one of my staff, Col. James Chesnut, of South Carolina, to submit for the consideration of the President a plan of operations substantially as follows :
I proposed that General Johnston should unite as soon as possible the bulk of the Army of the Shenandoah with that of the Potomac, then under my command, leaving only sufficient forces to garrison his strong works at Winchester, and to guard the fine defensive passes of the Blue Ridge, and thus hold General Patterson in check. At the same time Brigadier-General Holmes was to march hither with all of his command not essential for the defense of the position of Aquia Creek. These junctions having been effected at Manassas, an immediate impetuous attack of our combined armies upon General McDowell was to follow as soon as he approached my advanced positions at and around Fairfax Court-House, with the inevitable result, as I submitted, of his complete defeat and the destruction or capture of his army. This accomplished, the Army of the Shenandoah, under General Johnston, increased with a part of my forces, and rejoined as he returned Oy the detachments left to hold the mountain passes, was to march back rapidly into the valley, fall upon and crush Patterson with a superior force wheresoever he might be found. This I confidently estimated could be achieved within fifteen days after General Johnston should march from Winchester for Manassas. Meanwhile I was to occupy the enemy’s works on this side of the Potomac, if, as I anticipated, he had been so routed as to enable me to enter them with him 5 or if not, to retire again for a time within the lines of Bull Run with my main force. Patterson having been virtually destroyed, then General Johnston would re-enforce General Garnett sufficiently to make him superior to his opponent, General McClellan, and able to defeat that officer. This done, General Garnett was to form an immediate junction with General Johnston, who was forthwith to cross the Potomac into Maryland with his whole force, arouse the people as he advanced to the recovery of their political rights and the defense of their homes and families from an offensive invader, and then march to the investment of Washington in the rear, whilst I resumed the offensive in front. This plan of operations, you are aware, was not accepted at the time, from considerations which appeared so weighty as to more than counterbalance its proposed advantages.
Informed of these views, and of the decision of the War Department, I then made my preparations for the stoutest practicable defense of the line of Bull Run, the enemy having now developed his purposes by the advance on and occupation of Fairfax Court-House, from which my advanced brigade had been withdrawn.
The War Department having been informed by me by telegraph on the 17th July of the movement of General McDowell, General Johnston was immediately ordered to form a junction of his army corps with mine, should the movement in his judgment be deemed advisable. General Holmes was also directed to push forward with two regiments, a battery, and one company of cavalry.
In view of these propositions, approaching re-enforcements modifying my plan of operations so far as to determine on attacking the enemy at Centreville as soon as I should hear of the near approach of the two reenforcing columns, I sent one of my aides, Colonel Chisolm, of South Carolina, to meet and communicate my plans to General Johnston, and my wish that one portion of his forces should march by the way of Aldie,

fClIAP. IX.
and take the enemy on his right, flank and in reverse at Centreville. Difficulties, however, of an insui>erable character, in connection with means of transportation and the marching condition of his troops, made this impracticable, and it was determined our forces should be united within the lines of Bull Run, and thence advance to the attack of the enemy.
General Johnston arrived here about noon on the 20th July, and being my senior in rank he necessarily assumed command of all the forces of the Confederate States then concentrating at this point. Made acquainted with my plan of operations and dispositions to meet the enemy, he gave them his entire approval, and generously directed their execution under my command.
In consequence of the untoward detention, however, of some five thousand of General Johnston’s army corps, resulting from the inadequate and imperfect means of transportation for so many troops at the disposition of the Manassas Gap Railroad, it became necessary, on the morning of the 21st, before daylight, to modify the plan accepted to suit the contingency of an immediate attack on our lines by the main force of the enemy, then plainly at hand.
The enemy’s forces, reported by their best-informed journals to be fifty-five thousand strong, I had learned from reliable sources on the night of the 20th were being concentrated in and around Centreville and along the Warrenton turnpike road to Bull Run, near which our respective pickets were in immediate proximity. This fact, with the conviction that after his signal discomfiture on the 18th of July before Blackburn’s Ford—the center of my lines—he would not renew the attack in that quarter, induced me at once to look for an attempt on my left flank, resting on the stone bridge, which was but weakly guarded by men, as well as but slightly provided with artificial defensive appliances and artillery.
In view of these palpable military conditions, by 4.30 a. m. on the 21st of July I had prepared and dispatched orders directing the whole of the Confederate forces within the lines of Bull Run, including the brigades and regiments of General Johnston, which had arrived at that time, to be held in readiness to march at a moment’s notice. At that hour the following was the disposition of our forces: Ewell’s brigade, constituted as on the 18th of July, remained in x>osition at Union Mills Ford, its left extending along Bull Run in the direction of McLean’s Ford, and supported by Holmes’ brigade, Second Tennessee and First Arkansas Regiments, a short distance to the rear—that is, at and near Camp Wigfaii. D. R. Jones’ brigade, from Ewell’s left, in front of McLean’s Ford and along the stream to Longstreet’s position. It was unchanged in organization, and was supported by Early’s brigade, also unchanged, placed behind a thicket of young pines a short distance in the rear of McLean’s Ford. Longstreet’s brigade held its former ground at Blackburn’s Ford, from Jones’ left to Bonham’s right, at Mitchell’s Ford, and was supported by Jackson’s brigade, consisting of Cols. James F. Preston’s Fourth, Harper’s Fifth, Allen’s Second, the Twenty-seventh, Lieutenant-Colonel Echols, and the Thirty-third, Cummings’ Virginia Regiments, two thousand six hundred and eleven strong, which were posted behind the skirting of pines to the rear of Blackburn’s and Mitchell’s Fords, and in rear of this support was also Barksdale’s Thirteenth Regiment Mississippi Volunteers, which had lately arrived from Lynchburg. Along the edge of a pine thicket, in rear of and equidistant from McLean’s and Blackburn’s Fords, ready to support either position, I had also placed all of Bee’s and Bartow’s brigades that had arrived,

namely: Two companies of the Eleventh Mississippi, Lieutenant-Colonel Liddell; the Second Mississippi, Colonel Falkner, and Fourth Alabama, with Seventh and Eighth Georgia Regiments, Colonel Gartrell and Lieutenant-Colonel Gardner—in all two thousand seven hundred and thirty-two bayonets. Bonham’s brigade, as before, held Mitchell’s Ford, its right near Longstreet’s left, its left extending in the direction of Cocke’s right. It was organized as at the end of the 18th of July, with Jackson’s brigade, as before said, as a support.
Cocke’s brigade, increased by seven companies of the Eighth, Hun-ton’s, three companies of the Forty-ninth, Smith’s, Virginia Regiments, two companies of cavalry, and a battery, under Rogers, of four 6-pound-ers, occupied the line in front and rear of Bull Run, extending from the direction of Bonham’s left, and guarding Island, Ball’s, and Lewis’ Fords, to the right of Evans’ demi-brigade, near the stone bridge, also under General Cocke’s command. The latter held the stone bridge, and its left covered a farm ford about one mile above the bridge.
Stuart’s Cavalry, some three hundred men of the Army of the Shenandoah, guarded the level ground extending in rear from Bonham’s left to Cocke’s right.
Two companies of Radford’s cavalry were held in reserve a short distance in rear of Mitchell’s Ford, his left extending in the direction of Stuart’s right.
Colonel Pendleton’s reserve battery of eight pieces was temporarily placed in rear of Bonham’s extreme left.
Major Walton’s reserve battery of live guns was in position on McLean’s farm in a piece of woods in rear of Bee’s right.
Hampton’s Legion, of six companies of infantry, GOO strong, having arrived that morning by the cars from Richmond, was subsequently, as soon as it arrived, ordered forward to a position in the immediate vicinity of the Lewis house as a support for any troops engaged in that quarter.
The effective force of all arms of the Army of the Potomac on that eventful morning, including the garrison at Camp Pickens, did not exceed 21,833 and 29 guus. The Army of the Shenandoah, ready for action on the field, may be set at 6,000 men and 20 guns. (That is, when the battle began. Smith’s brigade and Fisher’s North Carolina came up later, and made total of Army of the Shenandoah engaged, of all arms, 8,334. Hill’s Virginia Regiment, 550, also arrived, but was posted as reserve to right flank.) The brigade of General Holmes mustered about 1,265 bayonets, 6 guns, and a company of cavalry about 90 strong.
Informed at 5.30 a. m. by Colonel Evans that the enemy had deployed some twelve hundred men (these were what Colonel Evans saw of General Schenck’s brigade of General Tyler’s division and two other heavy brigades—in all over nine thousand men and thirteen pieces of artillery, Carlisle’s and Ayres’ batteries$ that is, nine hundred men and two 6-pouuders, confronted by nine thousand men and thirteen pieces of artillery, mostly rifled) with several pieces of artillery in his immediate front, I at once ordered him, as also General Cocke, if attacked, to maintain their position to the last extremity.
In my opinion the most effective method of relieving that flank was by a rapid, determined attack with my right wing and center on the enemy’s flank and rear at Centreville, with due precautions against the advance of his reserves from the direction of Washington. By such a movement I confidently expected to achieve a eonqflete victory for my country by 12 m.

[Chap. IX.
These new dispositions were submitted to General Johnston, who fully approved them, and the orders for their immediate execution were at once issued.
Brigadier-General Ewell was directed to begin the'movement, to be followed and supporte l successively by Generals D. R. Jones, Long-street, and Bonham, respectively, supported by their several appointed reserves. The cavalry, under {Stuart and Radford, were to be held in hand, subject to future orders and ready for employment, as might be required bv the exigencies of the battle.
About 8.30 a. m. General Johnston and myself transferred our headquarters to a central position, about half a mile in rear of MitchelFs Ford, whence we might watch the course of events. Previously, as early as 5.30, the Federalists in front of Evans’ position (stone bridge) had opened with a large 30-pounder Parrott rifled gun, and thirty minutes later with a moderate, apparently tentative, fire from a battery of rifled pieces, directed first in front of Evans’, and then in the direction of Cocke’s position, but without dra wing a return fire and discovery of our positions, chiefly because in that quarter we had nothing but eight 6-pounder pieces, which could not reach the distant enemy.
As the Federalists had advanced with an extended line of skirmishers in front of Evans, that officer promptly threw forward the two flank companies of the Fourth South Carolina Regiment and one company of Wheat’s Louisiana Battalion, deployed as skirmishers to cover his small front. An occasional scattering fire resulted, and thus the two armies in that quarter remained for more than an hour, while the main body of the enemy was marching his devious way through the Big Forest to take our forces in flank and rear.
By 8.30 a. m. Colonel Evans, having become satisfied of the counterfeit character of the movement on his front, and persuaded of an attempt to turn his left flank, decided to change his position to meet the enemy, and for this purpose immediately put in motion to his left and rear six companies of Sloan’s Fourth South Carolina Regiment, Wheat’s Louisiana Battalion’s five companies, and two 6-pounders of Latham’s battery, leaving four companies of Sloan’s regiment under cover as the sole immediate defense of the stone bridge, but giving information to General Cocke of his change of position and. the reasons that impelled it.
Following a road leading by the old Pittsylvania (Carter) mansion, Colonel Evans formed in line of battle some four hundred yards in rear, as he advanced, of that house, his guns to the front and in position, properly supported, to its immediate right. Finding, however, that the enemy did not ajjpear on that road, which was a branch of one leading by Sudley Springs Ford to Brentsville and Dumfries, he turned abruptly to the left, and marching across the fields for three-quarters of a mile, about 9.30 a. m. took a position in line of battle, his left, Sloan’s companies, resting on the main Brentsville road in a shallow ravine, the Louisiana Battalion to the right, in advance some two hundred yards, a rectangular copse of wood separating them, one piece of his artillery planted on an eminence some seven hundred yards to the rear of Wheat’s battalion, and the other on a ridge near and in rear of Sloan’s position, commanding a reach of the road just in front of the line of battle. In this order he awaited the coming of the masses of the enemy, now drawing near.
In the mean time, about 7 o’clock a. in., Jackson’s brigade, with Imbo-den’s and five pieces of Walton’s battery, had been sent to take up a position along Bull Run, to guard the interval bet wen Cocke’s right and

Bonham’s left, with orders to support either in case of need, the character and topographical features of the ground having been shown to General Jackson by Oapt. D. B. Harris, of the engineers, of this army corps. So much oi* Bee’s and Bartow’s brigades, now united, as had arrived, some 2,800 muskets, had also been sent forward to the support of the position of the stone bridge.
The enemy, beginning his detour from the turnpike at a point nearly half-way between stone bridge and Oentreville, had pursued a tortuous, narrow trace of a rarely-used road through a dense wood the greater part of his way until near the Sudley road. A division under Colonel Hunter, of the Federal Begular Army, of two strong brigades, was in the advance, followed immediately by another division, under Colonel Heintzelman, of three brigades and seven companies of Begular Cavalry, and twenty-four pieces of artillery, eighteen of which were rifled guns. This column, as it crossed Bull Bun, numbered over sixteen thousand men of all arms by their own accounts.
Burnside’s brigade—which here, as at Fairfax Court-House, led the advance—at about 9.45 a. m. debouched from a wood in sight of Evans’ position, some five hundred yards distant from Wheat’s battalion. He immediately threw forward his skirmishers in force, and they became engaged with Wheat’s command, and the 6-pounder gun under Lieutenant Leftwitch. The Federalists at once advanced—as they report officially—the Second Bhode Island Begiment Volunteers, with its vaunted battery of six 13-pounder rifled guns. Sloan’s companies were then brought into action, having been pushed forward through the woods. The enemy, soon galled and staggered by the fire and pressed by the determined valor with which Wheat handled his battalion until he was desperately wounded, hastened up three other regiments of the brigade and two Dahlgren howitzers, making in all quite three thousand five hundred bayonets and eight pieces of artillery, opposed to less than eight hundred men and two 6-pounder guns. Despite this odds, this intrepid command, of but eleven weak companies, maintained its front to the enemy for quite an hour, and until General Bee came to their aid with his command. The heroic Bee, with a soldier’s eye and recognition of the situation, had previously disposed his command with skill, Imboden’s battery having been admirably placed between the two brigades, under shelter, behind the undulations of a hill about one hundred and fifty yards north of the now famous Henry house, and very near where he subsequently fell mortally wounded, to the great misfortune of his country, but after deeds of deliberate and ever-mem-orable courage. Meanwhile the enemy had pushed forward a battalion of eight companies of regular infantry, and one of their best batteries of six pieces (four rifled), supported by four companies of marines, to increase the desperate odds against which Evans and his men had maintained their stand with an almost matchless tenacity. General Bee, now finding Evans sorely pressed under the crushing weight of the masses of the enemy, at the call of Colonel Evans threw forward his whole force to his aid across a small stream (Young’s Branch and Valley), and engaged the Federalists with impetuosity, Imboden’s battery at the time playing from his well-chosen position with brilliant effect with spherical case, the enemy having first opened on him from a rifle battery (probably Griffin’s) with elongated cylindrical shells, which flew a few feet over the heads of our men and exploded in the crest of the hill immediately in rear.
As Bee advanced under a severe fire he placed the Seventh and Eighth Georgia Begiments under the chivalrous Bartow, at about 11

a. m. in a wood of second-growth pines, to the right and front of and nearly perpendicular to Evans’ line of battle) the Fourth Alabama to the left of them, along a fence, connecting the position of the Georgia regiments with the rectangular copse in which Sloan’s South Carolina companies were engaged, and into which he also threw the Second Mis* sissippi. A fierce and destructive conflict now ensued. The fire was withering on both sides, while the enemy swept our short thin lines with their numerous artillery, which, according to their official reports, at this time consisted of at least ten rifled guns and four howitzers. For an hour did these stout-hearted men of the blended commands of Bee, Evans, and Bartow breast an unintermitting battle-storm, animated surely by something more than the ordinary courage of even the bravest men under fire. It must have been indeed the inspiration of the cause and consciousness of the great stake at issue which thus nerved and animated one and all to stand unawed and unshrinking in such extremity.
Two Federal brigades of Heintzelman’s division were now brought into action, led by Ricketts’ superb light battery of six 10-pounder rifled guns, which, posted on an eminence to the right of the Sudley road, opened fire on Imboden’s battery—about this time increased by two rifled pieces of the Washington Artillery under Lieutenant Richardson, and already the mark of two batteries, which divided their fire with Imboden and two guns under Lieutenants Davidson and Leftwitcli, of Latham’s battery, posted as before mentioned. At this time confronting the enemy we had still but Evans’ eleven companies and two guns, Bee’s and Bartow’s four regiments, the two companies Eleventh Mississippi under Lieutenant-Colonel Liddell, and the six pieces under Imboden and Richardson. The enemy had two divisions of four strong brigades, including seventeen companies of regular infantry, cavalry, and artillery, four companies of marines, and twenty pieces of artillery. (See official reports of Colonels Heintzelman, Porter, &c.) Against this odds, scarcely credible, our advance position was still for a while maintained, and the enemy’s ranks constantly broken and shattered under the scorching fire of our men ; but fresh regiments of the Federalists came upon the field. Sherman’s and Keyes’ brigades of Tyler’s division, as is stated in their reports, numbering over six thousand bayonets, which had found a passage across the run about eight hundred yards above the stone bridge, threatened our right.
Heavy losses had now been sustained on our side both in numbers and in the personal worth of the slain. The Eighth Georgia Regiment had suffered heavily, being exposed, as it took and maintained its position, to a fire from the enemy, already posted within a hundred yards of their front and right, sheltered by fences and other cover. It was at this time that Lieutenant-Colonel Gardner was severely wounded, as also several other valuable officers. The adjutant of the regiment, Lieutenant Branch, was killed, and the horse of the regretted Bartow was shot under him. The Fourth Alabama also suffered severely from the deadly fire of the thousands of muskets which they so dauntlessly confronted under the immediate leadership of Bee himself. Its brave colonel (E. J. Jones) was dangerously wounded, and many gallant officers fell, slain or hors de combat.
Now, however, with the surging mass of over fourteen thousand Federal infantry pressing on their front and under the incessant fire of at least twenty pieces of artillery, with the fresh brigades of Sherman and Keyes approaching, the latter already in musket range, our lines gave back, but under orders from General Bee. The enemy, maintaining their

fire, pressed their swelling masses onward as our shattered battalions retired. The slaughter for the moment was deplorable, and has filled many a Southern home with life-long sorrow. Under this inexorable stress the retreat continued, until arrested by the energy and resolution of General Bee, supported by Bartow and Evans, just in rear of the Bobinson house, and Hampton’s Legion, which had been, already advanced and was in position near it. Imboden’s battery, which had been handled with marked skill, but whose men were almost exhausted, and the two pieces of Walton’s battery, under Lieutenant Bichardson, being threatened by the enemy’s infantry on the left and front, were also obliged to fall back. Imboden, leaving a disabled piece on the ground, retired until he met Jackson’s brigade, while Bichardson joined the main body of his battery near the Lewis house.
As our infantry retired from the extreme front the two 6-pounders of Latham’s battery before mentioned fell back with excellent judgment to suitable positions in the rear, where an etfective fire was maintained upon the still advancing lines of the Federalists with damaging effect until their ammunition was nearly exhausted, when they too were withdrawn in the near presence of the enemy and rejoined their captain.
From the point, previously indicated, where General Johnston and myself had established our headquarters, we heard the continuous roll of musketry and the sustained din of the artillery, which announced the serious outburst of the battle on our left flank, and we anxiously but confidently awaited similar sounds of conflict from our front at Centreville, resulting from the prescribed attack in that quarter by our right wing.
At 10.30 a. m., however, this expectation was dissipated, from Brigadier-General Ewell informing me, to my profound disappointment, that my orders for his advance had miscarried, but that in consequence of a communication from Gen. D. B. Jones he had just thrown his brigade across the stream at Union Mills. But in my judgment it was now too late for the effective execution of the contemplated movement, which must have required quite three hours for the troops to get into position for the attack. Therefore it became immediately necessary to depend on new combinations and other dispositions suited to the now pressing exigency. The movement of the right and center, already begun by Jones and Longstreet, was at once countermanded with the sanction of General Johnston, and we arranged to meet the enemy on the field upon which he had chosen to give us battle.
Under these circumstances our reserves not already in movement were immediately ordered up to support our left flank, namely, Holmes’ two regiments and battery of artillery, under Capt. Lindsey Walker, of six guns, and Early’s brigade. Two regiments from Bonham’s brigade, with Kemper’s four 6-pounders, were also called for, and, with the sanction of General Johnston, Generals Ewell, Jones (D. B.), Long-street, and Bonham were directed to make a demonstration to their several fronts, to retain and engross the enemy’s reserves and any forces on their flank and at and around Centreville. Previously our respective chiefs of staff, Major Bhett and Colonel Jordan, had been left at my headquarters to hasten up and give directions to any troops that might arrive at Manassas.
These orders having been duly dispatched by staff officers, at 11.30 a. m. General Johnston and myself set out for the immediate field of action, which we reached in the rear of the Bobinson and Widow Henry’s houses at about 12 m., and just as the commands of Bee, Bartow, and Evans had taken shelter in a wooded ravine behind the former,

Stoutly held at the time by Hampton with his Legion, which had made a stand there after having previously been as far forward as the turnpike, where Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, an officer of brilliant promise, was killed, and other severe losses were sustained.
Before our arrival upon the scene General Jackson had moved forward with his brigade of five Virginia regiments from his position in reserve, and had judiciously taken post below the brim of the plateau, nearly east of the Henry house, and to the left of the ravine and woods occupied by the mingled remnants of Bee’s, Bartow’s, and Evans’ commands, with Imboden’s battery and two of Stanard’s pieces placed so as to play upon the on-coming enemy, supported in the immediate rear by Col. J. F. Preston’s and Lieutenant-Colonel Echols’ regiments, on the right by Harper’s, and on the left by Allen’s and Cummings’ regiments.
As soon as General Johnston and myself reached the field we were occupied with the reorganization of the heroic troops, whose previous stand, with scarce a parallel, has nothing more valiant in all the pages of history, and whose losses fitly tell why at length their ranks had lost their cohesion.
It was now that General Johnston impressively and gallantly charged to the front, with the colors of the Fourth Alabama Begiment by his side, all the field officers of the regiment having been previously disabled. Shortly afterwards I placed S. B. Gist, adjutant and inspector general of South Carolina, a volunteer aide of General Bee, in command of this regiment, and who led it again to the front as became its previous behavior, and remained with it for the rest of the day.
As soon as we had thus rallied and disposed our forces, I urged General Johnston to leave the immediate conduct of the field to me, while he, repairing to Portici, the Lewis house, should urge re-enforcements forward. At first he was unwilling, but reminded that one of us must do so, and that properly it was his place, he reluctantly, but fortunately, complied; fortunately, because from that position, by his energy and sagacity, his keen perception and anticipation of my needs, he so directed the reserves as to insure the success of the day.
As General Johnston departed for Portici, Colonel Bartow reported to me with the remains of the Seventh Georgia Volunteers, Gartrell’s, which I ordered him to post on the left of Jackson’s line in the edge of the belt of pines bordering the southeastern rim of the plateau, on which the battle was now to rage so long and so fiercely.
Col. William Smith’s battalion of the Forty-ninth Virginia Volunteers, having also come up by my orders, I placed it on the left of Gartrell’s, as my extreme left at the time. Bepairing then to the right, I placed Hampton’s Legion, which had suffered greatly, on that flank somewhat to the rear of Harper’s regiment, and also the seven companies of the Eighth (Hunton’s) Virginia Begiment, which, detached from Cocke’s brigade by my orders and those of General Johnston, had opportunely reached the ground. These, with Harper’s regiment, constituted a reserve to protect our right flank from an advance of the enemy from the quarter of the stone bridge, and served as a support for the line of battle, which was formed on the right by Bee’s and Evans’ commands, in the center by four regiments of Jackson’s brigade, with Imboden’s four 6-pounders, Walton’s five guns (two rifled), two guns (one piece rifled) of Stanard’s, and two 6-pounders of Bogers’ batteries, the latter under Lieutenant Heaton, and on the left by Gartrell’s reduced ranks and Colonel Smith’s battalion, subsequently re-enforced, Falkner’s Second Mississippi Begiment, and by another regiment of the Army of the

Shenandoah, just arrived upon the field—the Sixth (Fisher’s) North Carolina. Confronting the enemy at this time my forces numbered at most not more than sixty-five hundred infantry and artillerists, with but thirteen pieces of artillery and two companies (Carter’s and Hoge’s) of Stuart’s Cavalry.
The enemy’s force now bearing hotly and confidently down on our position, regiment after regiment of the best-equipped men that ever took the field according to their own official history of the day, was formed of Colonels Hunter’s and Heintzelman’s divisions, Colonels Sherman’s and Keyes’ brigades of Tyler’s division, and of the formidable batteries of Ricketts, Griffin, and Arnold (regulars), and Second Khode Island and two Dahlgren howitzers—a force of over twenty thousand infantry, seven companies of regular cavalry, and twenty-four pieces of improved artillery. At the same time perilous heavy reserves of infantry and artillery hung in the distance around the stone bridge, Mitchell’s, Blackburn’s, and Union Mills Fords, visibly ready to fall upon us at any moment, and I was also assured of the existence of other heavy corps at and around Centreville and elsewhere within convenient supporting distances.
Fully conscious of this portentous disparity of force, as I posted the lines for the encounter I sought to infuse into the hearts of my officers and men the confidence and determined spirit of resistance to this wicked invasion of the homes of a free people which I felt. I informed them that re-enforcements would rapidly come to their support, and that we must at all hazards hold our posts until re-enforced. I reminded them that we fought for our homes, our firesides, and for the independence of our country. I urged them to the resolution of victory or death on that field. These sentiments were loudly, eagerly cheered wheresoever proclaimed, and I then felt reassured of the unconquerable spirit of that army, which would enable us to wrench victory from the host then threatening us with destruction.
Oh, my country! I would readily have sacrificed my life and those of all the brave men around me to save your honor and to maintain your independence from the degrading yoke which those ruthless invaders had come to impose and render perpetual, and the day’s issue has assured me that such emotions must also have animated all under my command.
In the mean time the enemy had seized upon the plateau on which Rob-inson’s and the Henry houses are situated—the position first occupied in the morning by General Bee before advancing to the support of Evans. Kicketts’ battery of six rifled guns, the pride of the Federalists, the object of their unstinted expenditure in outfit, and the equally powerful regular light battery of Griffin, were brought forward and placed in immediate action, after having, conjointly with the batteries already mentioned, played from former positions with destructive effect upon our forward battalions.
The topographical features of the plateau, now become the stage of the contending armies, must be described in outline. A glance at the map will show that it is inclosed on three sides by small water-courses, which empty into Bull Run within a few yards of each other a half a mile to the south of the stone bridge. Rising to an elevation of quite one hundred feet above the level of Bull Run at the bridge, it falls off on three sides to the level of the inclosing streams in gentle slopes, but which are furrowed by ravines of irregular direction and length, and studded with clumps and patches of young pines and oaks. The general direction of the crest of the plateau is oblique to the course of Bull

﻿494	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA , AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
Run in that quarter and to tlie Brentsville and turnpike roads, which intersect each other at right angles. Immediately surrounding the two houses before mentioned are small open fields of irregular outline, not exceeding one hundred and fifty acres in extent. The houses, occupied at the time, the one by the Widow Henry and the other by the free negro Robinson, are small wooden buildings, the latter densely embowered in trees and environed by a double row of fences on two sides. Around the eastern and southern brow of the plateau an almost unbroken fringe of second-growth pines gave excellent shelter for our marksmen, who availed themselves of it with the most satisfactory skill. To the west, adjoining the fields, a broad belt of oaks extends directly across the crest on both sides of the Sudley road, in which during the battle regiments of both armies met and contended for the mastery. From the open ground of this plateau the view embraces a wide expanse of woods and gently undulating open country of broad grass and grain fields in all directions, including the scene of Evans’ and Bee’s recent encounter with the enemy, some twelve hundred yards to the northward.
In reply to the play of the enemy’s batteries our own artillery had not been either idle or unskillful. The ground occupied by our guns, on a levrel with that held by the batteries of the enemy, was an open space of limited extent, behind a low undulation just at the eastern verge of the plateau, some five or six hundred yards from the Henry house. Here, as before said, thirteen pieces, mostly G-pounders, were maintained in action; the several batteries of Imboden, Stanard, Pendleton (Rockbridge Artillery), and Alburtis, of the Army of the Shenandoah, and five guns of Walton’s and Heaton’s section of Rogers’ battery of the Army of the Potomac, alternating to some extent with each other, and taking part as needed, all from the outset displaying that marvelous capacity of our people as artillerists which has made them, it would appear, at once the tefror and the admiration of the enemy. As was soon apparent, the Federalists had suffered severely from our artillery and from the fire of our musketry on the right, and especially from the left flank, placed under cover, within whose galling range they had been advanced; and we are told in their official reports how regiment after regiment thrown forward to dislodge us was broken, never to recover its entire organization on that field.
In the mean time, also, two companies of Stuart’s Cavalry (Carter’s and Hoge’s) made a dashing charge down the Brentsville and Sudley road upon the Fire Zouaves, then the enemy’s right on the plateau, which added to their disorder wrought by our musketry on that flank. But still the press of the enemy was heavy in that quarter of the field as fresh troops were thrown forward there to outflank us, and some three guns of a battery in an attempt to obtain a position, apparently to enfilade our batteries, were thrown so close to the Thirty-third Regiment, Jackson’s brigade, that that regiment, springing forward, seized them, but with severe loss, and was subsequently driven back by an overpowering force of Federal musketry.
Now, full 2 o’clock p. m., I gave the order for the right of my line, except my reserves, to advance to recover the plateau. It was done with uncommon resolution and vigor, and at the same time Jackson’s brigade pierced the enemy’s center with the determination of veterans and the spirit of men who fight for a sacred cause, but it suffered seriously. With equal spirit the other parts of the line made |he onset, and the Federal lines were broken and swept back at all points from the open ground of the plateau. Rallying soon, however, as they were strongly

495
re-enforced by fresb regiments, the Federalists returned, and by weight of numbers pressed our lines back, recovered their ground and guns, and renewed the offensive.
By this time, between half past two and 3 o’clock p. m., our re-enforcements pushed forward, and, directed by General Johnston to the required quarter, were at hand just as I had ordered forward to a second effort for the recovery of the disputed plateau the whole line, including my reserve, which at this crisis of the battle I felt called upon to lead in person. This attack was general, and was shared in by every regiment then in the field, including the Sixth (Fisher’s) North Carolina Begi-ment, which had just come up and taken position on the immediate left of the Forty-ninth Virginia Begiment. The whole open ground was again swept clear of the enemy, and the plateau around the Henry and Bobinson houses remained finally in our possession with the greater part of the Bicketts and Griffin batteries, and a flag of the First Michigan Begiment, captured by the Twenty-seventh Virginia Begiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Echols, of Jackson’s brigade.
This part of the day was rich with deeds of individual coolness and dauntless conduct, as well as well-directed embodied resolution and bravery, but fraught with the loss to the service of the country of lives of inestimable preciousness at this juncture. The brave Bee was mortally wounded at the head of the Fourth Alabama and some Mississip-pians. In the open field near the Henry house, and a few yards distant, the promising life of Bartow, while leading the Seventh Georgia Begiment, was quenched in blood. Col. F. J. Thomas, acting chief of ordnance, ot General Johnston’s staff, after gallant conduct and most efficient service, was also slain. Colonel Fisher, Sixth North Carolina, likewise fell, after soldierly behavior at the head of his regiment with ranks greatly thinned.
Withers’ Eighteenth Begiment, of Cocke’s brigade, had come up in time to follow this charge, and, in conjunction with Hampton’s Legion, captured several rifled pieces, which may have fallen previously in possession of some of our troops, but if so, had been recovered by the enemy. These pieces were immediately turned and effectively served on distant masses of the enemy by the hands of some of our officers.
While the enemy had thus been driven back on our right entirely across the turnpike and beyond Young’s Branch on our left, the woods yet swarmed with them when our re-enforcements opportunely arrived in quick succession and took position in that portion of the field. Kershaw’s Second and Cash’s Eighth South Carolina Begiments, which had arrived soon after Withers, were led through the oaks just east of the Sudley-Brentsville road, brushing some of the enemy before them, and taking an advantageous position along and west of that road, opened with much skill and effect on bodies of the enemy that had been rallied under cover of a strong Federal brigade posted on a plateau in the southwest angle formed by intersection of the turnpike with the Sudley-Brentsville road. Among the troops thus engaged were the Federal regular infantry.
At the same time Kemper’s battery, passing northward by the Sudley-Brentsville road, took position on the open space, under orders of Colonel Kershaw, near where an enemy’s battery had been captured, and was opened with effective results upon the Federal right, then the mark also of Kershaw’s and Cash’s regiments. Preston’s Twenty-eighth Begiment, of Cocke’s brigade, had by that time entered the same body of oaks, and encountered some Michigan troops, capturing their brigade commander, Colonel Willcox.

﻿496	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
Another important accession to our forces had also occurred about the same time, 3 o’clock p. m. Brig. Gen. E. K. Smith, with some seventeen hundred infantry, of Elzey’s brigade, of the Army of the Shenandoah, and Beckham’s battery came upon the field from Camp Pickens, Manassas, where they had arrived by railroad at noon. Directed in person by General Johnston to the left, then so much endangered, on reaching a position in rear of the oak woods, south of the Henry house, and immediately east of the Sudley road, General Smith was disabled by a severe wound, and his valuable services were lost at that critical juncture; but the command devolved upon a meritorious officer of experience, Colonel Elzey, who led his infantry at once somewhat farther to the left, in the direction of the Chinn house, across the road, through the oaks skirting the west side of the road, and around which he sent the battery, under Lieutenant Beckham. This officer took up a most favorable position near that house, whence, with a clear view of the Federal right and center, filling the open fields to the west of the Brentsville-Sudley road and gently sloping southward, he opened fire with his battery upon them with deadly and damaging effect.
Colonel Early, who by some mischance did not receive orders until 2 o’clock which had been sent him at noon; came on the ground immediately after Elzey, with Kemper’s Seventh Virginia, Hays’ Seventh Louisiana, and Barksdale’s Thirteenth Mississippi Begiments. This brigade, by the personal direction of General Johnston, was marched by the Holkham house across the fields to the left, entirely around the woods through which Elzey had passed, and under a severe fire, into a position in line of battle near Chinn’s house, outflanking the enemy’s right.
At this time, about, 3.30 p. m., the enemy, driven back on their left and center and brushed from the woods bordering the Sudley road, south and west of the Henry house, had formed a line of battle of truly formidable proportions, of crescent outline, reaching on their left from vicinity of Pittsylvania (the old Carter mansion), by Mathews’ and in rear of Bogan’s, across the turnpike near to Chinn’s house. The woods and fields were filled with their masses of infantry and their carefully-preserved cavalry. It was a truly magnificent, though redoubtable, spectacle as they threw forward in fine style on the broad, gentle slopes of the ridge occupied by their main lines a cloud of skirmishers, preparatory for another attack.
But as Early formed his line, and Beckham’s pieces played upon the right of the enemy, Elzey’s brigade, Gibbons’ Tenth Virginia, Lieutenant-Colonel Steuart’s First Maryland, and Vaughn’s Third Tennessee Begiments, Cash’s Eighth and Kershaw’s Second South Carolina, Withers^ Eighteenth and Preston’s Twenty-eighth Virginia advanced in an irregular line, almost simultaneously, with great spirit from their several positions upon the front and flanks of the enemy in their quarter of the field. At the same time, too, Early resolutely assailed their right flank and rear. Under this combined attack the enemy was soon forced first over the narrow plateau in the southern angle made by the two roads so often mentioned into a patch of woods on its western slope, thence back over Young’s Branch and the turnpike into the fields of the Dogan farm and rearward, in extreme disorder in all available directions towards Bull Bun. The rout had now become general and complete.
About the time that Elzey and Early were entering into action a column of the enemy (Keyes’ brigade, of Tyler’s division) made its wray across the turnpike between Bull Bun and the Bobinson house, under cover of a wood and brow of the ridges, apparently to turn my right, but was

easily repulsed by a few shots from Latham7s battery, now united and placed in position by Oapt. D. B. Harris, of the Virginia engineers, whose services during the day became his character as an able, cool, and skillful officer, and from Alburtis’ battery, opportunely ordered by General Jackson to a position to the right of Latham, on a hill commanding the line of approach of the enemy, and supported by portions of regiments collected together by the staff officers of General Johnston and myself.
Early’s brigade, meanwhile, joined by the Nineteenth Virginia Regi-ment, Lieutenant-Colonel Strange, of Cocke’s brigade, pursued the now panic-stricken fugitive enemy. Stuart, with his cavalry and Beckham had also taken up the pursuit along the road by which the enemy had come upon the field that morning, but soon, cumbered by prisoners who thronged his way, the former was unable to attack the mass of the fast-fleeing, frantic Federalists. Withers’, R. T. Preston’s, Cash’s, and Kershaw’s regiments, Hampton’s Legion, and Kemper’s battery also pursued along the Warren ton road by the stone bridge, the enemy having opportunely opened a way for them through the heavy abatis which my troops had made on the west side of the bridge several days before; but this pursuit was soon recalled in consequence of a false report which unfortunately reached us that the enemy’s reserves, known to be fresh and of considerable strength, were threatening the position of Union Mills Ford.
Colonel Radford, with six companies Virginia Cavalry, was also ordered by General Johnston to cross Bull Run and attack the enemy from the direction of Lewis’ house. Conducted by one of my aides, Colonel Chisolm, by the Lewis Ford to the immediate vicinity of the suspension bridge, he charged a battery with great gallantry, took Colonel Corcoran, of the Sixty-ninth Regiment New York Volunteers, a prisoner, and captured the Federal colors of that regiment, as well as a number of the enemy. He lost, however, a promising officer of his regiment, Capt. Winston Radford.
Lieutenant-Colonel Munford also led some companies of cavalry in hot pursuit, and rendered material service in the capture of prisoners and of cannon, horses, ammunition, &c., abandoned by the enemy in their flight. Captain Lay’s company of the Powhatan Troops and Utterback’s Rangers, Virginia Volunteers, attached to my person, did material service under Captain Lay in rallying troops broken for the time by the onset of the enemy’s masses.
During the period of the momentous events, fraught with the weal of our country, which were passing on the blood-stained plateau along the Sudley and Warrenton roads, other portions of the line of Bull Run had not been void of action of moment and of influence on the general result.
While Colonel Evans and his sturdy band were holding at bay the Federal advance beyond the turnpike the enemy made repeated demonstrations with artillery and infantry upon the line of Cocke’s brigade, with the serious intention of forcing the position, as General Schenck admits in his report. They were driven back with severe loss by Latham’s (a section) and Rogers’ four 6-pounders, and were so impressed with the strength of that line as to be held in check and inactive even after it had been stripped of all its troops but one company of the Nineteenth Virginia Regiment, under Captain Duke, a meritorious officer; and it is worthy of notice that in this encounter of our 6-pounder guns, handled by our volunteer artillerists, they had worsted such a notorious adversary as the Ayres (formerly Sherman’s) battery, which quit the 32 r r—yol ii

contest under the illusion that it had weightier metal than its own to contend with.
The center brigades, Bonham’s and Longstreet’s, of the line of Bull Run, if not closely engaged, were, nevertheless, exposed for much of the day to an annoying, almost incessant fire of artillery of long range; but, by a steady, veteran-like maintenance of their positions, they held virtually paralyzed all day two strong brigades of the enemy with their batteries (four) of rifled guns.
As before said, two regiments of Bonham’s brigade—Second and Eighth South Carolina Yolunteers—and Kemper’s battery took a distinguished part in the battle. The remainder—Third (Williams’), Seventh (Bacon’s) South Carolina Yolunteers, Eleventh (Kirkland’s) North Carolina Regiment, six companies of the Eighth Louisiana Yolunteers, Shields’ battery, and one section of Walton’s battery, under Lieutenant Garnett—whether in holding their post or taking up the pursuit, officers and men discharged their duty with credit and promise.
Longstreet’s brigade, pursuant to orders prescribing his part of the operations of the center and right wing, was thrown across Bull Run early in the morning, and under a severe fire of artillery was skillfully disposed for the assault of the enemy’s batteries in that quarter, but was withdrawn subsequently, in consequence of the change of plan already mentioned and explained. The troops of this brigade were— First (Major Skinner), Eleventh .(Garland’s), Twenty-fourth (Lieutenant-Colonel Hairston), Seventeenth (Corse’s) Yirginia Regiments; Fifth North Carolina (Lieutenant-Colonel Jones), and Whitehead’s company Yirginia Cavalry. Throughout the day these troops evinced the most soldierly spirit.
After the rout, having been ordered by General Johnston in the direction of Centreville in pursuit, these brigades advanced nearly to that place, when, night and darkness intervening, General Bonham thought it proper to direct his own brigade and that of General Long-street back to Bull Run.
General D. R. Jones early in the day crossing Bull Run with his brigade, pursuant to orders indicating his part in the projected attack by our right wing and center on the enemy at Centreville, took up a position on the Union Mills and Centreville road more than a mile in advance of the run. Ordered back, in consequence of the miscarriage of the orders to General Ewell, the retrograde movement was necessarily made under a sharp fire of artillery.
At noon this brigade, in obedience to new instructions, was again thrown across Bull Run to make demonstration. Unsupported by other troops, the advance was gallantly made until within musket range of the enemy’s force—Colonel Davies’ brigade, in position near Rocky Run—and under the concentrated fire of their artillery. In this affair the Fifth, (Jenkins’) South Carolina and Captain Fontaine’s company of the Eighteenth Mississippi Regiment are mentioned by General Jones as having shown conspicuous gallantry, coolness, and discipline under a combined fire of infantry and artillery. Not only did the return fire of the brigade drive to cover the enemy’s infantry, but the movement unquestionably spread through the enemy’s ranks a sense of insecurity and danger from an attack by that route on their rear at Centreville, which served to augment the extraordinary panic which we know disbanded the entire Federal Army for the time. This is evident from the fact that Colonel Davies, the immediate adversary’s commander, in his official report, was induced to magnify one small company of our cavalry which accompanied the brigade into a force of 2,000 men, and Colonel

Miles, the commander of the Federal reserves at Centreville, says the movement caused painful apprehensions for the left flank of their army.
General Ewell, occupying for the time the right of the lines of Bull Bun, at Union Mills Ford, after the miscarriage of my orders for his advance upon Centreville, in the afternoon was ordered by General Johnston to bring up his brigade into battle, then raging on the left flank. Promptly executed as this movement was, the brigade, after a severe march, reached the field too late to share the glories as they had the labors of the day. As the important position at the Union Mills had been left with but a slender guard, General Ewell was at once ordered to retrace his steps and resume his position, to prevent the possibility of its seizure by , any force of the enemy in that quarter. Brigadier General Holmes, left with his brigade as a support to the same position in the original plan of battle, had also been called to the left, whither he marched with the utmost speed, but not in time to join actively in the battle. Walker’s rifled guns of the brigade, however, came up in time to be fired with precision and decided execution at the retreating enemy, and Scott’s cavalry, joining in the pursuit, assisted in the capture of prisoners and war munitions.
This victory, the details of which I have thus sought to chronicle as fully as were fitting an official report, it remains to record was dearly won by the death of many officers and men of inestimable value, belonging to all grades of our society. In the death of General Barnard E. Bee the Confederacy has sustained an irreparable loss, for, with great personal bravery and coolness, he possessed the qualities of an accomplished soldier aud an able, reliable commander. Colonels Bartow and Fisher and Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, of Hampton’s Legion, in the fearless command of their men, gave earnest of great usefulness to the service had they been spared to complete a career so brilliantly begun. Besides the field officers already mentioned as having been wounded while in the gallant discharge of their duties, many others also received severe wounds, after equally honorable and distinguished conduct, whether in leading their men forward or in rallying them when overpowered or temporarily shattered by the largely superior force to which we were generally opposed.
The subordinate grades were likewise abundantly conspicuous for zeal and capacity for the leadership of men in arms. To mention all Avho, fighting well, paid the lavish forfeit of their lives, or at least crippled, mutilated bodies, on the field of Manassas, cannot well be done within the compass of this paper; but a grateful country and mourning friends will not suffer their names and sendees to be forgotten and pass away unhonored.
NTor are those officers and men who were so fortunate as to escape the thick-flying deadly missiles of the enemy less worthy of praise for their endurance, firmness, and valor, than their brothers in arms whose lives were closed or bodies maimed on that memorable day. To mention all who exhibited ability and brilliant courage were impossible in this report; nor do the reports of brigade and other subordinate commanders supply full lists of all actually deserving of distinction. I can only mention those whose conduct came immediately under my notice or the consequence of whose actions happened to be signally important. It is fit that I should in this way commend to notice the dauntless conduct and imperturbable coolness of Colonel Evans, and well indeed was he supported by Colonel Sloan and the officers of the Fourth South Carolina Begiment, as also Major Wheat, than whom no cne displayed more brilliant courage until carried from the field shot through the

lungs, though happily not mortally stricken. But in the desperate, unequal conflict to which these brave gentlemen were for a time necessarily exposed, the behavior of officers and men generally was worthy of the highest admiration, and assuredly hereafter all there present may proudly say, We were of that band who fought the first hour of the battle of Manassas. Equal honors and credit must also be awarded in the pages of history to the gallant officers and men who, under Bee and Bartow, subsequently marching to their side, saved them from destruction, and relieved them from the brunt of the enemy’s attack.
The conduct of General Jackson also requires mention as eminently that of an able, fearless soldier and sagacious commander, one fit to lead his efficient brigade. His prompt, timely arrival before the plateau of the Henry house, and his judicious disposition of his troops, contributed much to the success of the day. Although painfully wounded in the hand, he remained on the field to the end of the battle, rendering invaluable assistance.
Col. William Smith was as efficient as self-possessed and brave. The influence of his example and his words of encouragement were not confined to his immediate command, the good conduct of which is especially noticeable, inasmuch as it had been embodied but a day or two before the battle.
Colonels Harper, Hunton, and Hampton, commanding regiments of the reserve, attracted my notice by their soldierly ability, as with their gallant commands they restored the fortunes of the day at a time when the enemy by a last desperate onset with heavy odds had driven our forces from the fiercely-contested ground around the Henry and Robin-son houses. Veterans could not have behaved better than these ay ell-led regiments.
High praise must also be given to Colonels Cocke, Early, and Elzey, brigade commanders; also to Colonel Kerslia\Y, commanding for the time the Second and Eighth South Carolina Regiments. Under the instructions of General Johnston these officers reached the field at an opportune, critical moment, and disposed, handled, and fought their respecti\e commands with sagacity, decision, and successful results, which haA^e been described in detail.
Col. J. E. B. Stuart likewise deser\res mention for his enterprise and ability as a cavalry commander. Through his judicious reconnaissance of the country on our left flank he acquired information, both of topographical features and the positions of the enemy, of the utmost importance in the subsequent and closing movements of the day on that flank, and his services in the pursuit were highly effective.
Capt. E. P. Alexander, C. S. Engineers, gave me seasonable and material assistance early in the day with his system of signals. Almost the first shot fired by the enemy passed through the tent of his party at the stone bridge, where they subsequently firmly maintained their position in the discharge of their duty—the transmission of messages of the enemy’s movements—for several hours under fire. Later, Captain Alexander acted as my aide-de-camp in the transmission of orders and in observation of the enemy.
I Avas most efficiently served throughout the day by my ATolunteer aides, Colonels Preston, Manning, Chesnut, Miles, Rice, Hayward, and Chisolm, to whom I tender my thanks for their unflagging, intelligent, and fearless discharge of the laborious, responsible duties intrusted to them. To Lieut. S. W. Ferguson, aide-de-camp, and Colonel Hayward, who were habitually at my side from 12 noon until the close of the battle, my special acknowledgments are due. The horse of the former was

killed under him by the same shell that wounded that of the latter. Both were eminently useful to me, and were distinguished for coolness and courage until the enemy gave way and tied in wild disorder in every direction—a scene the President of the Confederacy had the high satisfaction of witnessing, as he arrived upon the field at that exultant moment.
I also received from the time I reached the front such signal service from H. E. Peyton, at the time a private in the Loudoun Cavalry, that I have called him to my personal staff. Similar services were also rendered me repeatedly during the battle by T. J. Randolph, a \olunteer acting aide-de-camp to Colonel Cocke. Capt. Clifton H. Smith, of the general staff, was also present on the field, and rendered efficient service in the transmission of orders.
It must be permitted me here to'record my profound sense of my obligations to General Johnston for his generous permission to carry out my plans with such modifications as circumstances had required. From his services on the field as we entered it together, already mentioned, and his subsequent watchful management of the re-enforcements as they reached the vicinity of the field, our countrymen may draw the most auspicious auguries.
To Col. Thomas Jordan, my efficient and zealous assistant adjutant-general, much credit is due for his able assistance in the organization of the forces under my command and for the intelligence and promptness with which he has discharged all the laborious and important duties of his office.
Valuable assistance was given to me by Major Cabell, chief officer of the quartermaster’s department, in the sphere of his duties—duties environed by far more than the ordinary difficulties and embarrassments attending the operations of a long-organized regular establishment.
Col. R. B. Lee, chief of subsistence department, had but just entered upon his duties, but his experience and long and varied services in his department made him as efficient as possible.
Capt. W. II. Fowle, whom Colonel Lee had relieved, had previously exerted himself to the utmost to carry out orders from these headquarters to render his department equal to the demands of the service. That it was not entirely so it is due to justice to say was certainly not his fault.
Deprived by the sudden severe illness of the medical director, Surg. Thomas H. Williams, his duties were discharged by Surg. R. L. Brodie to my entire satisfaction ; and it is proper to say that the entire medical corps of the Army at present, embracing gentlemen of distinction in the profession, who had quit lucrative private practice, by their services in the field and subsequently did high honor to their profession.
The vital duties of the ordnance department were effectively discharged under the administration of my chief of artillery and ordnance, Col. S. Jones.
At one time, when reports of evil omen and disaster reached Camp Pickens with such circumstantiality as to give reasonable grounds of anxiet}-, its commander, Colonel Terrett, the commander of the intrenched batteries^ Captain S terrett, of the C. S. Navy, and their officers, made the most efficient possible preparations tor the desperate defense of that position in extremity $ and in this connection I regret my inability to mention the names of those patriotic gentlemen of Virginia by the gratuitous labor of whose slaves the intrenched camp at Manassas had been mainly constructed, relieving the troops from that laborious service, and giving opportunity for their military instruction.

[Chap. IX.
Lieut. Col. Thomas H. Williamson, the engineer of these works, assisted by Capt. I). B, Harris, discharged his duties with untiring energy and devotion as well as satisfactory skill.
Capt. W. H. Stevens, engineer C. S. Army, served with the advanced forces at Fairfax Court-House for some time before the battle. He laid out the works there in admirable accordance with the purposes for which they were designed, and yet so as to admit of ultimate extension and adaptation to more serious uses as means and part of a system of real defense when determined upon. He has shown himself to be an officer of energy and ability.
Maj. Thomas G. Rhett, after having discharged for several months the laborious duties of adjutant-general to the commanding officer of Camp Pickens, was detaclied to join the Army of the Shenandoah just on the eve of the advance of the enemy, but volunteering his services, was ordered to assist on the staff of General Bonham, joining that officer at Centreville on the night of the 17th, before the battle of Bull Run, where he rendered valuable services, until the arrival of General Johnston, on the 20th of July, when he was called to the place of chief of staff of that officer. It is also proper to acknowledge the signal services rendered by Cols. B. F. Terry and T. Lubbock, of Texas, who had attached themselves to the staff of General Longstreet. These gentlemen made daring and valuable reconnaissances of the enemy’s positions, assisted by Captains Goree and Chichester; they also carried orders to the field, and on the following day accompanied Captain Whitehead’s troop to take possession of Fairfax Court-House. Colonel Terry, with his unerring rifle, severed the halliard, and thus lowered the Federal flag found still floating from the cupola of the court-house there. He also secured a large Federal garrison flag, designed, it is said, to be unfurled over our intrenchments at Manassas.
In connection with the unfortunate casualty of the day, that is, the miscarriage of the orders sent by courier to Generals Holmes and Ewell to attack the enemy in flank and reverse at Centreville, through which the triumph of our arms was prevented from being still more decisive, I regard it in place to say a divisional organization, with officers in command of divisions, with appropriate rank, as in European services, would greatly reduce the risk of such mishaps, and would advantageously simplify the communications of a general in command of a field with his troops.
While glorious for our people, and of crushing effect upon the morale of our hitherto confident and overweening adversary, as were the events of the battle of Manassas, the field was only won by stout fighting, and, as before reported, with much loss, as is precisely exhibited in the papers herewith, marked F, G, and H,# and being lists of the killed and wounded. The killed outright numbered 369, the wounded 1,483, making an aggregate of 1,852.
The actual loss of the enemy will never be known; it may now only be conjectured. Their abandoned dead, as they were buried by our people where they fell, unfortunately were not enumerated, but many parts of the field were thick with their corpses as but few battle-fields have ever been. The official reports of the enemy are stndjmisly silent on this point, but still afford us data for an approximate estimate. Left almost in the dark in respect to the losses of Hunter’s and Heintzelman’s divisions, first, longest, and most hotly engaged, we are informed that Sherman’s brigade, Tyler’s division, suffered in killed, wounded, and missing 609; that is, about eighteen per cent, of the brigade.

Franklin’s brigade (Gorman’s) lost twenty-one per cent., Griffin’s (battery) loss was thirty per cent., and that of Keyes’ brigade, which was so handled by its commander as to be exposed to only occasional volleys from our troops, was at least ten per cent. To these facts add the repeated references in the reports of the more reticent commanders to the umurderous” fire to which they were habitually exposed, the 66pistol-range” volleys, and galling musketry of which they speak as scourging their ranks, and we are warranted in placing the entire loss of the Federalists at over forty-five hundred in killed, wounded, and prisoners. To this may be legitimately added as a casualty of the battle the thousands of fugitives from the field, who have never rejoined their regiments, and who are as much lost to the enemy’s service as if slain or disabled by wounds. These may not be included under the head of missing, because in every instance of such report we took as many prisoners of those brigades or regiments as are reported missing.
A list appended exhibits some 1,460 of their wounded and others who fell into our hands and were sent to Eichmond.* Some were sent to other points, so that the number of prisoners, including wounded who did not die, may be set down as not less than 1,600. Besides these a considerable number who could not be removed from the field died at several farm-houses and field hospitals within ten days following the battle.
To serve the future historian of this war I will note the fact that among the captured Federalists are officers and men of forty-seven regiments of volunteers, besides from some nine different regiments of regular troops, detachments of which were engaged. From their official reports we learn of a regiment of volunteers engaged, six regiments of Miles’ division, and the five regiments of Bunyon’s brigade, from which we have neither sound nor wounded prisoners. Making all allowances for mistakes, we are warranted in saying that the Federal army consisted of at least fifty-five regiments of volunteers, eight companies of regular infantry, four of marines, nine of regular cavalry, and twelve batteries of forty-nine guns. These regiments at one time, as will appear from a published list appended, marked K, numbered in the aggregate 54,140, and average 964 each. From an order of the enemy’s commander, however, dated July 13, we learn that one hundred men from each regi ment were directed to remain in charge of their respective camps. Some allowance must further be made for the sick and details, which would reduce the average to eight hundred men. Adding the regular cavalry, infantry, and artillery present, an estimate of their force may be made, t
A paper appended, marked L, exhibits in part the ordnance and supplies captured, including some twenty-eight field pieces of the best character of arm, with over one hundred rounds of ammunition for each gun, thirty-seven caissons, six forges, four battery wagons, sixty-four artillery horses completely equipped, 500,000 rounds of small-arms ammunition, 4,500 sets of accouterments, over 500 muskets, some nine regimental and garrison flags, with a large number of pistols, knapsacks, swords, canteens, blankets, a large store of axes and intrenching tools, wagons, ambulances, horses, camp and garrison equipage, hospital stores, and some subsistence.
Added to these results may rightly be noticed here that by this battle an invading army, superbly equipped, within twenty miles of their base of operations, has been converted into one virtually besieged and

exclusively occupied for months in the construction of a stupendous series of fortifications for the protection of its own capital.
I beg to call attention to the reports of the several subordinate commanders for reference to the signal parts played by Individuals of their respective commands. Contradictory statements found in these reports should not excite surprise, when wTe remember how difficult if not impossible it is to reconcile the narrations of bystanders or participants in even the most inconsiderable affair, much less the shifting, thrilling scenes of a battle-field.
Accompanying are maps showing the positions of the armies on the morning of the 21st July and of three several stages of the battlej also of the line of Bull Run north of Blackburn’s Ford. These maps, from actual surveys made by Capt. D. B. Harris, assisted by Mr. John Grant, were drawn by the latter with a rare accuracy worthy of high commendation.*
In conclusion, it is proper and doubtless expected that through this report my countrymen should be made acquainted with some of the sufficient causes that prevented the advance of our forces and prolonged vigorous pursuit of the enemy.to and beyond the Potomac. The War Department has been fully advised long since of all of those causes, some of wffiich only are proper to be here communicated. An army which had fought as ours on that day, against uncommon odds, under a July sun, most of the time without water and without food except a hastily-snatched scanty meal at dawn, was not in condition for the toil of an eager, effective pursuit of an enemy immediately after the battle.
On the following day an unusually heavy and unintermitting fall of rain intervened to obstruct our advance with reasonable prospect of fruitful results. Added to this, the want of a cavalry force of sufficient numbers made an efficient pursuit a military impossibility.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. T. BEAUREGARD,
General, Commanding.
General S. Cooper,

[Indorsement.]
The order issued by the War Department to General Johnston was not, as herein reported, to form a junction, “should the movement in his judgment be deemed advisable.” The following is an accurate copy of the order:
General Beauregard is attacked. To strike the enemy a decisive blow, a junction of all your effective force will be needed. If practicable, make the movement, sending your sick and baggage to Culpeper Court-House, either by railroad or by Warrenton. In all the arrangements exercise your discretion.
The words “if practicable” had reference to letters of General Johnston of 12th and 15th of July, which made it extremely doubtful if he had the power to make the movement, in view of the relative strength and position of Patterson’s forces as compared with his own.
The plan of campaign reported to have been submitted, but not accepted, and to have led to a decision of the War Department, cannot be found among its files, nor any reference to any decision made upon it, and it was not known that the Army had advanced beyond the line of Bull Run, the position previously selected by General Lee, and Avhich was supposed to have continued to be the defensive line occupied by the

main body of our forces. Inquiry has developed the fact that a message to be verbally delivered was sent by Hon. Mr. Ohesnut. If the conjectures recited in the report were entertained, they rested on the accomplishment of one great condition, namely, that a junction of the forces of Generals Johnston and Holmes should be made with the army of General Beauregard, and should gain a victory. The junction was made, the victory was won, but the consequences that were predicted did not result. The reasons why no such consequences could result are given in the closing passages of the reports of both the commanding generals, and the responsibility cannot be transferred to the Government at Richmond, which certainly would have united in any feasible plan to accomplish such desirable results.
If the plan of campaign mentioned in the report had been presented in a written communication, and in sufficient detail to permit proper investigation, it must have been pronounced to be impossible at that time, and its proposal could only have been accounted for by the want of information of the forces and positions of the armies in the field. The facts that rendered it impossible are the following:
1.	It was based, as related from memory by Colonel Ohesnut, on the supposition of drawing a force of about twenty-five thousand men from the command of General Johnston. The letters of General Johnston show his effective force to have been only eleven thousand, with an enemy thirty thousand strong in his front ready to take possession of the valley of Virginia on his withdrawal.
2.	It proposed to continue operations by effecting a junction of a part of the victorious forces with the army of General Garnett in Western Virginia. General Garnett’s forces amounted only to three or four thousand men, then known to be in rapid retreat before vastly superior forces under McClellan, and the news that he was himself killed, and his army scattered, arrived within forty-eight hours of Colonel Ches-nut’s arrival in Richmond.
3.	The plan was based on the improbable and inadmissible supposition that the enemy was to await everywhere, isolated and motionless, until our forces could effect junctions to attack them in detail.
4.	It could not be expected that any success obtainable on the battlefield would enable our forces to carry the fortifications on the Potomac, garrisoned, and within supporting distance of fresh troops; nor after the actual battle and victory did the generals on the field propose an advance on the capital, nor does it appear that they have since believed themselves in a condition to attempt such a movement.
It is proper also to observe that there is no communication on file in the War Department, as recited at the close of the report, showing what were the causes which u prevented the advance of our forces and prolonged vigorous pursuit of the enemy to and beyond the Potomac.”

I am led to infer also that the strategic portion of the report is an obstacle to its publication. Should that be the case, I have to request that it may be separated into two parts, to obviate the difficulty referred to; but I do not wish it understood, however, that I ask the publication of any part of it, leaving that entirely to the judgment of the War Department.

P. S.—What can be the matter with the mails ? My letters are often from five to six days getting here from Eichmond.
Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
July 16, 1861.
Brigadier-General Beauregard,
Commanding Army of the Potomac:
Sir : In obedience to your order, I proceeded on Sunday last, 14th instant, to Eichmond, with the purpose of laying before the President for his consideration your views and plans for the combined operation of the two armies under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston and yourself, respectively. I arrived in Eichmond at 3.30 on the same day I left your quarters, and without delay reported to the President, who, although sick in bed, received me with great kindness and cordiality. After stating to him the object of my visit, he appointed an hour to meet him with General E. E. Lee, and Adjutant and Inspector General Cooper. At the appointed time the President, Generals Lee and Cooper, and Colonel Preston, of your staff, met me in private conference. Being requested by the President to lay before those present the subject-matter with which I was charged, I submitted on your part the following propositions:
That the Confederate armies were in front of the enemy with greatty inferior forces at all points ; that it was desirable by uniting a portion of our forces to outnumber the enemy at some important point; that the point now occupied by you was at present in reference to the armies considered the most important. I stated also that the enemy were at present at or near Falls Church, with eight or ten thousand men, on the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire Eailroad, and also with some portion of his force at Springfield, on the Alexandria and Orange Eailroad, with every indication of a purpose to advance on both lines, and that it was most probable the enemy would threaten our camp at Manassas with about ten thousand men, while the main body, twenty thousand or more, would advance towards Yienna, Frying Pan, and Pleasant Yallev, to Hay Market, on the Manassas Gap Eailroad, with a view to cut off* our communication with General Johnston. To accomplish this, possession would be taken of passes of the Blue Eidge at Manassas, Ashby’s, and Snicker’s Gaps. He would then endeavor to cut off* your communication with Eichmond by the Alexandria and Orange

Railroad, and force you either to fight in open field with greatly inferior numbers or to retire towards Fredericksburg by way of Brentsville, to join forces with General Holmes, or to withdraw from the intrenched camp and retire by the Alexandria and Orange Railroad before the enemy could reach it.
Under these circumstances I stated you would propose, and did propose, that General Johnston should, with the bulk of his forces, say twenty thousand, unite with you, leaving from three to five thousand men to guard the passes of the Blue Ridge and to hold Patterson in check. Then, with the combined forces of General Johnston and yourself, you would move rapidly forward on Fairfax Court-House, establish yourself between the two lines of the enemy, attack them separately with larger masses, and thus exterminate them or drive them into the Potomac. This being done, General Johnston, with ten thousand of your forces in addition to his own, and rallying as he went those left to guard the passes, would return at once with superior numbers, say thirty-five thousand, to attack and destroy Patterson at Winchester or wherever he might be. One week from the time of leaving Winchester would be sufficient to accomplish all this. You would then either occupy the enemy’s works in front of Washington if he should abandon them, or fall back on your present positions, according to circumstances. General Johnston, having disposed of Patterson, would detach a sufficient number from his force to re-enforce Garnett and make him superior to General McClellan. Having defeated McClellan, General Garnett could then unite with Johnston, and the two cross the Potomac at the nearest point for Maryland, and, arousing the people as they proceeded, march to the rear of Washington, while you would attack it in front.
To these propositions respectful and earnest consideration was given by the President and the two generals I have mentioned- The scheme was considered brilliant and comprehensive, but to its adoption at this time two leading objections were urged by the President and by General Lee. One was that General Johnston’s force was not now sufficiently strong to allow of the withdrawal of numbers sufficient to effect your object, and at the same time leave enough to keep Patterson in check and keep him from coming down upon your left. And the other and main objection was that the enemy was as yet too close to their cover to allow the reasonable expectation of the accomplishment of your object; that they would immediately fall back upon their intrench-ments, or, being so close to their large reserves, would be quickly re-enforced in numbers sufficient to regain the superiority of numbers, and thus defeat your purpose; that the combination might be made at a later period, when the objection would be removed by a sufficient increase of your armies and by the lengthening of the enemy’s lines and increase of distance from cover and reserves for quick re-enforcement.
Respectfully submitted.

General G. T. Beauregard :

me that your letter to the Hon. Mr. Miles,* on the wants of your army and the consequences thereof, was read to the Congress, and hence the inquiry instituted. Permit me to request that you will return the telegram to me, which I inclosed to show you the form in which the matter came before me. Some excitement has been created by your letters. The quartermaster and the commissary generals both feel that they have been unjustly arraigned. As for myself, I can only say that I have endeavored to anticipate wants, and any failure which has occurred from imperfect knowledge might have been best avoided by timely requisitions and estimates. I think you are unjust to yourself in putting your failure to pursue the enemy to Washington to the account of short supplies of subsistence and transportation. Under the circumstances of our Army, and in the absence of the knowledge since acquired— if, indeed, the statements be true—it would have been extremely hazardous to have done more than was performed. You will not fail to remember that, so far from knowing that the enemy was routed, a large part of our forces was moved by you in the night of the 21st to repel a supposed attack upon our right, and the next day’s operations did not fully reveal what has since been reported of the enemy’s panic. Enough was done for glory, and the measure of duty was full. Let us rather show the untaught that their desires are unreasonable than, by driveling on possibilities, recently developed, give form and substance to the criticisms, always easy to those who judge after the event.
With sincere esteem, I am your friend,
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
Richmond, Va., October 30, 1801.
General G. T. Beauregard:
Sir : Yesterday my attention was called to various newspaper publications, purporting to have been sent from Manassas, and to be a synopsis of your report of the battle of July 21 last, and in which it is represented that you had been overruled by me in your plan for a battle with the enemy south of the Potomac, for the capture of Baltimore and Washington, and the liberation of Maryland. I inquired for your long-expected report, and it has to-day been submitted to my inspection. It appears, by official indorsement, to have been received by the Adjutant General on October 15, though it is dated August 20, 1861. With much surprise I found that the newspaper statements were sustained by the text of your report. I was surprised, because, if we did differ in opinion as to the measures and purposes of contemplated campaigns, such fact could have no appropriate place in the report of a battle. Further, because it seemed to be an attempt to exalt yourself at my expense, and especially because no such plan as that described was submitted to me. It is true that some time before it was ordered you expressed a desire for the junction of General Johnston’s army with your own. The movement was postponed until the operations of the enemy rendered it necessary, and until it became thereby practicable to make it, with safety, to the valley of Virginia; hence I believe was secured the success by which it was attended. If you have retained a copy of the plan of campaign which, you say, was submitted to me, through Colonel Chesnut, allow me to request that you will furnish me with a duplicate of it.
Very respectfully, yours, &c.,
JEFFERSON DAVIS.

THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.

Bichmond, Va., October 30, 1861. Col. James Chesnut, Camden, 8. C. :
My Dear Sir : I beg that you will as promptly as possible send me a statement of a communication made to me by yourself on or about July 13 last, as aide of General Beauregard, in relation to any proposed plan of battle or campaign. I ask this because I have had'my attention directed to a synopsis in the newspapers of General Beauregard’s report so entirely at variance with the facts as they occurred that I think it well to recur to your recollection of the message brought by you from the general.
I am, very truly, your friend,
JEFFERSON DAYIS.
Camden, S. C., November 2,1861.
To the President :
Dear Sir : I have this morning received your letter of the 15th [30] ultimo,* and, according to your request, reply at once, although you will not get [it] as promptly as I desire, as to-morrow, being Sunday, no mail leaves this place.
You ask me to recur to my recollection and send you a statement of a communication which,, as aide to General Beauregard, I made to you on or about July 13, last, 44 in relation to any proposed plan of battle or campaign.”
On Saturday night or Sunday morning of July 14 last, about midnight, I received a message from General Beauregard, requesting my attendance at his room. I immediately repaired thither, and learned from him that he had formed a plan of campaign which he desired to lay before the President, and requested me to undertake the duty.
About 6 o’clock of the same morning I left headquarters and arrived in Bichmond in the afternoon of the same day, several hours beyond the usual time of arrival. I had two interviews with you that day, one in the afternoon and another in company with other persons during the evening. Bemaining Monday for the completion of my mission, I returned to camp at Manassas on Tuesday following. Immediately after reaching headquarters of General Beauregard I made to him verbally a full report of all things touching the subject-matter with which I had been charged.
On Thursday, July 18 last, while we were preparing for the field, the general in person directed me to make at once a written report of the same matter. This I did, and handed it to the assistant adjutant general, Colonel Jordan, who filed it for information of the general commanding, when I left the camp to join the general on the battle-field. I think the written report bears date of the verbal report, say July 15 last, and I am sure is accurate and full to the points in question, according to the freshness of my recollection at the time. I will ask you, however, to write to General Beauregard requesting a copy of the report, as I myself will do.
In the mean time and now I wall state to you my recollection of the interview and of the contents of the report. I am sure the two will be found identical in substance, however they may vary in phraseology. I stated to General Beauregard that when I arrived in Bichmond I re-

paired immediately to your apartment, where I learned you were ill in bed; but upon being notified of my presence you at once caused me to be invited into your chamber, where I was kindly and cordially received. I informed you of the object of my visit, at which you expressed yourself pleased, and sent messages to Generals Cooper and Lee to meet us that evening at 7 o’clock, with maj)s, in your parlor. I requested you to allow Col. John S. Preston, who was then in Eichmond, to be present at the interview, to which you consented.
At the time and place appointed yourself and Generals Cooper and Lee and Colonel Preston and myself assembled. You stated to the gentlemen present that I had come with a message from General Beauregard, which you then requested me to explain, whereupon I submitted on the part of General Beauregard the following propositions :
That we were standing in front of the enemy with inferior forces at all points; that it was desirable, by uniting a portion of our forces, to outnumber the enemy at some important point; that the most important point was the one at Manassas, and that the indication then was that the enemy would soon advance upon us by the Alexandria and by the Loudoun and Hampshire Eailroad, having then his advanced force,
8.000	or 10,000 strong, at or near Falls Church; that it was probable he would continue the movement towards Vienna, Frying Pan, and Pleasant Valley to Hay Market, on the Manassas Gap Eailroad, with a view to cut oft* General Johnston from us by sending a few thousand men to take possession of the passes in the Blue Eidge, namely, Manassas Gap, Ashby’s Gafj, and Turkersville [Snicker’s] Gap, and then probably attempt to cut off our communication with Eichmond by the Orange and Alexandria Eailroad, and f6rce us to fight him with great odds in an open country, or to retire towards Fredericksburg by way of Brents-ville, to join oar forces with those of General Holmes, or to withdraw from our intrenched camp at Manassas by the Orange [and Alexandria] Eailroad before the enemy could reach it; that the enemy was also advancing part of his force on the Orange and Alexandria Eailroad on our front, with a view probably of covering his movements on our left by threatening our center and right with a force of about 10,000 men.
In view of this condition of things General Beauregard, through me, at that time proposed that General Johnston should at once join him with the larger portion of his force, say 20,000, leaving from 3,000 to
5.000	to occupy and guard the gaps already mentioned and to hold General Patterson in check; then, with the combined forces of Generals Johnston and Beauregard, make a rapid march forward on Fairfax; establish themselves between the two lines of the enemy; attack them separately and successfully, and thus exterminate them. This being done, General Johnston would return and attack Patterson with a force of about 35,000 men, made up of about 10,000 of General Beauregard’s and 20,000 of his own, and gathering up on his return the 5,000 which were left to guard the passes. All this it was thought could be done in one week from the time that General Johnston should leave Winchester. In the mean time General Beauregard, with the 10,000, or about that, left with him, would either hold his position, or occupy the works of the enemy in front of Washington, if abandoned, according to circumstances. After General Johnston should take or defeat Patterson it was proposed that he should send from his command a force sufficient to General Garnett to outnumber and destroy General McClellan, Garnett in the mean time having received orders to fall back in the direction of Johnston’s column. McClellan being disposed of, General Garnett would unite his forces with General Johnston’s, and

both cross the Potomac at the nearest point into Maryland, march on Washington, taking it in the rear, while General Beauregard attacked it in front, General Johnston in the mean time arousing the people of Maryland wherever he passed to the defense of their homes and independence.
After I had laid before you these views, both yourself and General Lee spoke in terms of kindness and compliment to General Beauregard; thought the plan well conceived, and might be brilliant in its results if we should meet with no disaster in the details, and if the time for its execution had arrived. General Lee expressed the opinion, to which you assented, that the time for its execution had not yet arrived. With deference I asked General Lee for the reason upon which the opinion was founded. He proceeded to say the subject had been thought of generally. He thought the enemy was as yet too close to his cover; that if he found us with combined and superior forces before him he would not, or might not, give battle, but retire behind the protection of the guns of his intrenchments, and thus defeat the objects of our combination; that in such an event we would be put to a great disadvantage of achieving nothing and leaving the other points exposed, &c.; that in his opinion it would be better to draw the enemy farther from his intrenchments, and by lengthening to weaken his line, which would give us a better chance of success, &c.
Many other matters were spoken of at that interview as to the war generally, its policy, the character of our forces, &c.; but as they did not pertain to the object of my mission, they were not mentioned in my report nor are repeated here.
I believe I have given you the sum and substance of what occurred at the interview^ referred to in relation to the matter in question, and what is contained in the report which I made in writing to General Beauregard. I do not at this time pretend to verbal accuracy, but feel satisfied of the correctness of the substance of the matter. I had at the time, and I have before me now, a memorandum of the points submitted by me on the part of General Beauregard.
I am sure a full and dispassionate investigation and consideration of this subject will leave little ground for dissatisfaction. The success of our cause depends not merely on the ability and fidelity, but to a great extent also on the harmony and hearty co-operation, of those who are chief and chosen instruments in the direction of our affairs. Any extended distrust in the crisis of our fate will bring dire calamities upon us. We must heed not the unwise babbling of some nor the deliberate malice of many. Yourself and your generals are alike elevated above the reach of unworthy considerations. Firm in the consciousness of right, devoting all your faculties to the triumph of a common and a noble cause, you and they can already afford to live in the clear light of a future judgment.
With great respect, your friend and obedient servant,

vancing upon Washington City. Though such statements may have been made merely for my injury, and in that view might be postponed to a more convenient season, they have acquired importance from the fact that they have served to create distrust, to excite disappointment, and must embarrass the administration in its further efforts to re-enforce the armies of the Potomac, and, generally, to provide for the public defense. For these public considerations I call upon you, as the commanding general, and as a party to all the conferences held by me on July 21 and 22, to say whether I obstructed the pursuit of the enemy after the victory at Manassas, or have ever objected to an advance or other active operations which it was feasible for the Army to undertake.*
Yery respectfully , yours, &c.,
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
Richmond, Va., November 4,1861. Generals Cooper and Lee, G. S. Army:
Gentlemen: The injurious effect produced by statements, widely published, to show that the Army of the Potomac had been needlessly doomed to inactivity by my rejection of plans for vigorous movements against the enemy which were presented to me by General Beauregard, induces me to ask you to state what was the communication made by that officer through the Hon. Mr. Chesnut, on the subject of his position at Manassas in July last, and what were the propositions and requests then conveyed to me. You are invited to refer to the introduction of General Beauregard’s report of the battle of Manassas, that you may see how far the statement made therein agrees with the communication made to me by the Hon. Mr. Chesnut in the .interview at which you were present.
I have requested General Beauregard to furnish me with a duplicate of the plan of battle and campaign, which he says in his report was submitted to me, but have not received an answer.
Yery respectfully, yours, &e.,
JEFFERSON DAYIS.
Richmond, Va., November 9,1861.
To his Excellency Jefferson Dayis,
President of Confederate States:
Sir : In reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I have the honor to state that I was present at an interview in the parlor of the Spottswood Hotel, on the occasion referred to in General Beauregard’s introductory remarks in his report of the battle of Manassas, wherein he states that he dispatched, on July 13, one of his staff, Col. James Chesnut, of South Carolina, to submit to the consideration of the President a plan of operations, &e.
My impression in respect to that interview is that General Beauregard, being fully satisfied that an early attack would be made on his position by the enemy, greatly superior in force, and feeling the necessity for additional aid to enable him to give battle on more equal terms,

bad sent Colonel Chesnut to urge upon the President an increase from General Johnston’s command, then in the valley of the Shenandoah. I am also under the impression that it was represented on the part of General Beauregard that, if compelled to abandon his position by superior numbers, he would retire by Fredericksburg, or in the direction of the Bapxiahannock. Beyond these representations or suggestions I am not sensible that any plan of operations was submitted, whether written or oral; nor can I call to mind that any written communication from General Beauregard was made to the President on the occasion of the interview. In respect to receiving aid from General Johnston, it will be recollected that that officer had in his front a large force of the enemy, at least double his own numbers, and it would have been fatal to our cause in the valley to have sent away at that time any considerable portion of his command for the object contemplated by General Beauregard. Nor was it possible for him to do so, with any reason-ble hope of success, until the tardiness and inactivity of the enemy in his front rendered such movement practicable, when it was finally accomplished under your telegraphic instructions of July 17, which resulted in the success of our arms at the battle of Manassas on the 21st.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
S. COOPER, General, C. S. Army.
Richmond, Va., November 11,1861.
Col. James Chesnut :
My Dear Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge yours of the 2d instant, in reply to my inquiry of the 30th ultimo.* My memory is confirmed as to the fact that you delivered to me orally a message from General Beauregard, but left with me no plan of battle or of campaign; and I regret, as our conversation was to be reported and to be filed with the papers of General Beauregard, that the propositions were not reduced to writing and submitted for a written reply, or at least that I was not permitted to see the report of the interview before it became a public document. I well remember that you came to explain the hazard of General Beauregard’s position, and to ask for re-enforcements, suggesting that General Johnston should make a junction with him; but do not remember that any proposition was made to select Fairfax Court-House as a battle-field, and cannot realize how I should have objected to the choice of that field, as I did not then know how bad a selection it would have been. The rest seems to have been merely hypothetical propositions, and such as would only have impressed themselves on my memory by their errors, both as to numbers of available troops and topography of the country. The general’s report does not give those details, but presents a summary of things which no one desired more than myself, with a conclusion that the plan for their achievement was not accepted, &c. Thus has apparent confirmation been given to the slander that I would not permit the Army to advance to the capture of Washington and the liberation of Maryland, attributing to me political views which I think you must know were not entertained by me. The importance of this is not any effect it may have on me individually, but is the injury inflicted on the public interest by the belief created that

the Army has been doomed to inactivity, to avoid the exasperation of the enemy.
That I have not heeded u the unwise babbling of some nor the deliberate malice of many,77 is to be found in the fact that they were never noticed by me until a respectable foundation appeared for them. My confidence and friendship for General Beauregard have been unmistakably manifested, and none can regret more than myself the error he has committed in bringing extraneous matter into his report of a battle, without any perceivable motive for so doing which is consistent with the good opinion I entertained of him. To a request for a duplicate of the plan of battle and campaign, which he had reported was submitted to me through you, he replies by assuring me that the plan, as stated in his report, is the one you were sent to submit—that he has a written statement of the result of your conference with me, which has been sent to New Orleans, and of which he promises to furnish a copy.
Your letter shows that you bore merely a message from General Beauregard, and his official announcement of a plan of operations submitted but not accepted is poorly sustained by reference to a conversation with me by a third person, even though it was reduced to writing after having been orally communicated to him. When the newspapers published a synopsis of General Beauregard7s report, in which reference is made to the plan said to have been submitted to me by him, I could not believe he was responsible for the statement until I saw his report.
I accept your friendly advice in the spirit which suggests it, and can assure you that our cause is to me so far above any personal considerations, that I can find no difficulty in fully co-operating with any one who can and will promote its success.

General G. T. Beauregard,
Comdg. District of Potomac, Centreville, Va.:
General : 1 have received your letter of the 8th instant,# and in compliance with your request have caused to be affixed to your report of the battle of Manassas the date of your letter of the 14th October, which accompanied it, although this was unnecessary, inasmuch as the letter had already been filed with the report itself.
In respect to the strategic portion of the report as an obstacle to its publication, I would remark that it is a rule of the Department to furnish copies of reports of battles only to Congress, by whose authority alone they are printed. Under this rule they are withheld from publication by the Department in the daily papers. Some few of these reports of battles have found their way into the papers, but the newspapers obtained their copies before the reports reached this office.

you with anything in addition that you might require. I was surprised to learn from Colonel Deas a few days ago that you had never received mv answer.
S. C.
Coosawhatchie, S. C., November 24, 1861. His Excellency The President of the Confederate States :
My absence on an examination of the coast of South Carolina and Georgia has prevented until now my reply to your note of the 4th instant, asking what communication was made by General Beauregard to you through the honorable Mr. Chesnut on the subject of his position at Manassas in July last, and what were the propositions and requests conveyed by him.
1 have not seen the report of General Beauregard of the battle of Manassas, and am unable to refer to his introductory statement to which you call my attention. I cannot, therefore, say how far it agrees with the communication of Mr. Chesnut. I recollect, however, that at the interview at which I was present Mr. Chesnut urged, on the part of General Beauregard, the importance of re-enforcing the Army of the Potomac to enable it to oppose the Federal forces accumulating in its front. As a means of accomplishing this end he suggested that a portion of the Army in the Shenandoah Valley, under General Johnston, be ordered to join it. With the aid thus afforded General Beauregard thought he could successfully resist an attack of the enemy. Should he succeed in repulsing him, he could in turn re-enforce General Johnston. Should General Johnston succeed in driving back General Patterson, then in his front, he could re-enforce the Army in Northwestern Virginia. The advantages of the union of the armies on the Potomac had been more than once the subject of consideration by you, and I do not recollect that at the interview in question they were less apparent. The difficulty of timing the march of the troops so as to benefit one army without jeopardizing the object of the other was therefore mainly considered, and you decided that the movements of the enemy in and about Alexandria were not sufficiently demonstrative to warrant the withdrawing of any of the forces from the Shenandoah Valley. A few days afterwards, however—I think three or four—the reports from General Beauregard showed so clearly the enemy’s purpose, that you ordered General Johnston, with his effective force, to march at once to the support of General Beauregard, and directed General Holmes, with such troops as could be spared from the defense of the approaches to Fredericksburg, to move upon Manassas.
The successful combination of the armies was made, and the glorious victory of July 21 followed.
I have the honor, &c.,

four companies, numbering two hundred and eighty-four officers and men and thirteen guns—six 6-pounders, smooth bore, four 12-pounder howitzers, and three rifled 6-pounders, all bronze—under my command, was assigned to duty as follows :
Four 12-pounder howitzers, under command of Lieut. T. L. Kosser, commanding, Lieut. 0. C. Lewis, Lieut. C. H. Slocomb, and Lieut. H. A. Battles, with General Ewell’s Second Brigade, at Union Mills Ford. Two 6-pounders, smooth bore, under command of Capt. M. B. Miller, Lieut. Joseph Norcom, with General Jones’ Third Brigade, at McLean’s Ford. One rifled 6-pounder and one smooth 6-pounder, under command of Lieut. J. J. Garnett, Lieut. L. A. Adam (reported sick after being engaged in the battle of the 18th instant), with General Longstreet’s Fourth Brigade, at Blackburn’s Ford. Five guns, three smooth 6-pounders, two rifled 6-pounders, under command of Lieut. C. W. Squires, Lieut. J. B. Richardson, and Lieut. J. B. Whittington, with Colonel Early’s Fifth Brigade, then bivouacked near McLean’s farm house.
At about 7 o’clock on the morning of the 21st an order was communicated to me to follow with the battery under Lieutenant Squires the brigade of General Jackson, then on the march towards Stone Bridge. Every preparation having been previously made, the order to mount was immediately given and the battery moved forward, arriving at Lewis’ farm house just in time to receive the first fire from the enemy’s guns, then in position near stone bridge. Here I was ordered to halt and await orders from General Bee.
Shortly after 8.30 o’clock a. m. I detached two rifled guns, under Lieutenant Richardson, and took position about one-half mile to the left of the Lewis farm house, where the enemy was found in large numbers. Fire was at once opened by the section under Lieutenant Richardson, and continued with good effect until his situation became so perilous that he was obliged to withdraw, firing retiring until his guns were out of range, when he limbered up and reported to me. In this engagement one of the enemy’s pieces was dismounted by a shot from the rifled gun directed by First Sergeant Edward Owen, First Company, and other serious work was accomplished.
Isow, under direction of General Cocke, I took position in battery on the hill in front of Lewis’ farm house, my guns directed toward stone bridge, where it was reported the enemy was about to attack. Shortly before TO o’clock orders were communicated to me to advance with my battery to a point, which was indicated, near the position lately occupied by the section under Lieutenant Richardson. Here we at once opened fire, soon obtaining the range with the rifled guns against artillery and the 6-pounders, with round-shot, spherical case, and canister against infantry, scattering by our well-directed fire death, destruction, and confusion in the ranks of both. As the enemy’s artillery would frequently get our range, we advanced by hand to the front until finally the battery was upon the crown of the hill, entirely exposed to the view of their artillery and infantry. At this moment their fire fell like hail around us, the artillery in front of our position evidently suffering greatly from the concentration of fire from my guns and those of the battery on my right, and notwithstanding we were at this time also subjected to a terrific fire of infantry on our left, my guns were as rapidly and beautifully served by the cannoneers, with as much composure and silence as they are when upon the ordinary daily drill.
The batteries of the enemy on our front having become silenced, and the fire of the infantry upon our left increasing, I considered it prudent to remove my battery from the then exposed position, being nearly out

of ammunition (some of the guns having only a few rounds left in the boxes). The order to limber to the rear was consequently given, and my battery, followed by the battery on my right, was removed to its first position upon the elevated ground near Lewis7 farm house.
At about 1 o’clock, as nearly as I can now calculate, Lieutenant Squires was detailed with three 0-pounders, and took position near the road leading to the stone bridge from Lewis’ farm house and directed against the enemy’s artillery, which had now opened fire upon our position from the vicinity of stone bridge. This fire having been silenced by some guns of Colonel Pendleton and the guns of my battery under Lieutenant Squires, we discovered from the position on the hill the enemy in full retreat across the fields in range of my rifled guns. I opened fire upon their retreating columns, which was continued with admirable effect, scattering and causing them to spread over the fields in the greatest confusion, until I was ordered to discontinue by General Jack-son, and save my ammunition for whatever occasion might now arise. Subsequently I was permitted by General Johnston to open fire again, which was now, after having obtained the range, like target practice, so exactly did each shot do its work ; the enemy, by thousands, in the greatest disorder, at a double-quick, received our fire and the fire from the Parrott guns of the battery alongside, dealing terrible destruction at every discharge.
This ended the battle of the 21st, the last gun having been fired from one of the rifles of my battery. The guns of this battery, under command of Captain Miller, with General Jones’ brigade, and Lieutenant Garnett, with General Longstreet7s brigade, were not engaged at their respective points, although under fire a portion of the day. The howitzer battery, under Lieutenant Commanding Eosser, with General Ewell’s brigade, was on the march from 2 o’clock p. m. in the direction of Fairfax Court-House, and, returning by way of Union Mills Ford, arrived with the reserve at my position unfortunately too late to take part in the engagement, notwithstanding the battery was moved at a trot and the canonneers at a double-quick the entire distance from Union Mills Ford.
In this battle my loss has been one killed, Sergeant J. D. Eeynolds, Fourth Company; two wounded slightly, Corporal E. C. Payne, First Company, and Private George L. Crutcher, Fourth Company. There were three horses wounded, two belonging to the battery and one officer’s horse.
I cannot conclude this official report without the expression of my grateful thanks to the officers and men under my command for their gallant behavior during the entire day. They fought like veterans, and no man hesitated in the performance of any duty, or in taking any position to which it was indicated they were required. In a word, I desire to say these men are entirely worthy of the noble State that has sent them forth to battle for the independence of the Confederate States.
To Lieutenant Squires, commanding, I desire especially to direct your attention. A young officer, the second time under fire (having been in the engagement of the 18th), he acted his part in a manner worthy of a true soldier and a brave man. He is an example rarely to be met. Lieutenants Eichardson and Whittington, each with his battery in the engagement of the 18th, were in this battle, and bravely did their duty. Lieut. Will Owen, adjutant, and Lieut. James Hearing, Virginia forces, attached to this battalion, accompanied me. To them I am indebted for valuable services upon the field. Frequently were they ordered to

positions of great danger, and promptly and bravely did they each acquit themselves of any duty they were called upon to perform.
I could mention individual instances of bravery and daring on the part of non-commissioned officers and privates would it not be invidious where all behaved so well.
In conclusion, general, I can only say I am gratified to know we have done our duty as we were pledged to do.
With great respect, I am, general, your obedient servant,

Brigade, First Corps.
Hdqrs. First Brig., First Corps, Army of the Potomac,
Camp Gregg, August 1,1861.
General : I had ordered reports from my officers of the operations of the 21st of July previous to the 1st instant, though I had not until that day received instructions to do so. Between the 18th and 21st of July I placed on my exteme left Kershaw’s regiment with Kemper’s battery, both to give support to the left or center of your whole line, as circumstances might require, and to keep watch on the enemy’s movements, should he attempt to cross any jiart of his force by Cub Bun Ford, between Colonel Cocke’s position at stone bridge and my own at Bull Run. Colonel Kirkland’s regiment was placed in my center, on the ground previously occupied by Colonel Kershaw. The enemy continued up to evening of the 20th to make some display of force in my front, but to what extent it was impossible to ascertain, as his force was under cover of the hills and woods. My command was kept on the alert, and my scouts and pickets kept careful watch on his movements, under the expectation that he was preparing to move directly on my position.
About 2.30 o’clock on the morning of the 21st Colonel Kirkland, field officer of the day for my command, a vigilant officer, came in from visiting his pickets beyond the run and informed me that he had heard the rumbling to my left front of artillery wagons. I directed him to renew his efforts to ascertain its character, and before daylight he confirmed his suspicions that it was the enemy in force, which I communicated to headquarters. I also sent across the run General McGowan, one of my volunteer aides, who brought me the same intelligence. I directed him to report to you in person, and crossing myself (it was now light) to the grove near Butler’s house, directly in my front, I perceived by my field-glass, dimly in the distance, the enemy in large force proceeding along the Warren ton turnpike towards the stone bridge, Colonel Cocke’s position. This fact I immediately communicated to headquarters, and directed my whole command to prepare for action, as I supposed the assault would be made early along our whole line.
Early in the morning the enemy’s fire was opened upon my position from the batteries in my front, throwing shot and shell from rifled cannon, and kept up until the afternoon, with occasional exchanges of small-arms between the advance troops. The distance was such that my own

field pieces could do but little execution, and my fire was reserved for a closer encounter. My men occupied through the day the trenches under this pretty regular fire of shell and shot, exhibiting a coolness and steadiness worthy of veterans.
While standing a little after noon with General Johnston and yourself on Lookout Hill, in rear of my position, watching the progress of the engagement on my left, where the enemy’s chief force seemed to be concentrating, I received an order from yourself in person to detach to the support of our troops engaged on the left, two of my regiments, with one battery. I immediately sent forward Kershaw and Cash with Kemper’s battery.
Between 5 and 6 o’clock in the afternoon I received an order from General Johnston to move forward upon Centreville with most of my command and General Longstreet’s, which order wTas at once obeyed. Before we had reached the position which the enemy had occupied in our front he abandoned his camp, with indications of a precipitate retreat. I continued the pursuit to near Centreville, when the enemy opened with his artillery upon the route of my column as indicated by the dust. Colonel Lay, with a small escort, having gone forward to make a reconnaissance, found his artillery and infantry drawn up on the hills between the run and Centreville, covering the approach to that place. I ordered my own infantry to deploy in the woods to the left of the road and General Longstreet’s to the right, placing a battery of artillery in the road, and the cavalry in the rear, under cover.
By the time the deployment was completed it was dark. After the lapse of a half hour or more I moved the whole command to the run, to refresh themselves preparatory to executing such order as I might receive from you, reporting the fact to yourself at Manassas. During the night the enemy abandoned his position at Centreville. On the following morning I received an order to move forward with two regiments, some artillery and cavalry, to Centreville, where my command, during an incessant fall of rain, took possession of and collected together as far as practicable a large quantity of commissary supplies, tents, wagons, horses, with one piece of artillery, four caissons, and a large quantity of ammunition, and a number of prisoners, sending to Manassas all that could be forwarded that evening. The following day I was ordered to occupy Yienna.
I shall find it difficult to do justice to the fortitude, the patriotism, and the steady courage of the officers and men composing my command, through their hard labors of several weeks in the trenches at Fairfax Court-House $ the falling back from that place to Bull Run, and their occupation of the trenches for four successive days through all changes of weather, much of the time without food, and entirely without covering; their readiness to meet the foe at any odds at Fairfax, and the willingness to encounter him at all times at Bull Run, command my highest admiration. To those gentlemen who belonged to my staff in South Carolina as the major-general of the South Carolina State troops, and who so promptly responded to the first call from the State of Virginia for assistance, at all times cheerfully rendering me every aid in their power in the organization of the troops which have been at different times under my command, coming with me to Manassas at the beginning of military operations in this quarter, and sustaining me under every trial and difficulty, I am much indebted. Col. W. C. Moragn6, Maj. S. W. Kelson, and Maj. B. H. Whitner, of my regular staff, and Maj. E. Spann Hammond, of my volunteer staff, were called home by imperative duties pre vious to these operations. To Lieut. Col. W. D. Simpson, Lieut.

Col. A. P. Aldrich, and Lieut. Col. James M. Lipscomb, of my regular staff, am I greatly indebted for most active and efficient services during the whole time of the operations of my command from the 17th to the 22d of July, inclusive, each executing every order delivered him with the utmost alacrity, and frequently under circumstances of peril. I am also indebted to Maj. Thomas J. Davies, of my regular stall*, and Maj. S. W. Melton, and Alfred Moss (the latter ofVirginia), my volunteer aides, for similar active and efficient services; and to Major Melton I am further indebted for very valuable aid as military secretary. I am also much indebted to my volunteer aides, Majs. S. S. Tompkins, W. P. Butler, and M. B. Lipscomb, for valuable assistance in the performance of various duties connected with my command from the time they joined me at Centreville to the close of the operations. To General S. McGowan, volunteer aide, who also joined me at Centreville, I am under many obligations for his valuable assistance during the operations of my command from the 17th to the 21st, inclusive, under circumstances of peril and exposure.
I desire to mention in most favorable terms the valuable services of Col. George W. Lay, Virginia forces, who acted as my adjutant-general during the above-mentioned operations. To Capt. W. H. Stevens, of the Engineers, C. S. Army, am I greatly indebted for his indefatigable labors in putting Fairfax Court-House in a state of defense, and his constant attention to the execution of all orders extended through him, both in camp and in the field. It is also proper to mention the valuable aid rendered Captain Stevens by General Johnson Hagood, of South Carolina; Professor Venable, of South Carolina College 5 and Mr. Nyllis, of the Eighth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, as volunteer assistant engineer in the construction of the wrorks at Fairfax Court-House. Of Captains Wickham, Ball, Powell, and Payne, and the officers and men of their commands, who have been with me from about the time of my arrival at Manassas early in May, I wish to make my acknowledgments for valuable and efficient services, at all times cheerfully rendered. I desire to make favorable mention also of Colonel Radford and his cavalry, who joined me at a late period, and who have ever promptly executed all my orders. Captain Kemper and the officers and men of his battery are deserving of my highest approbation. They were the first artillery to occupy Artillery Hill at Centreville under my orders. They have been kept steadily in the front, and have shown themselves worthy of the position and the great cause in which they are engaged. The distinguished parts performed by Colonels Kershaw and Cash and Captain Kemper, as also by Colonel Radford’s cavalry and the other troops of cavalry belonging to my command, was somewhat under your own observation on the 21st of July, and to their reports I respectfully refer. Col. J. L. Kemper, of the Seventh Regiment Virginia Volunteers, is entitled to my highest approbation, not only for his generous acceptance of the place of quartermaster with my advanced command, but also on account of his activity and efficiency as a member of my staff in carrying my orders on the 17th, as well as the 18th, at Bull Run. To Colonels Williams, Bacon, Kirkland, and Kelly, and Captain Shields, and the officers and men of their commands, I am also indebted for the promptness, cheerfulness, and energy with which they performed all the duties assigned to them; and I commend the entire command for the spirit and patriotism with which they performed all their duties. To Major Kennedy, commissary of my command, and Lieutenant Washington, assistant quartermaster, C. S. Army, am I also indebted for active and efficient services.

Report of Col. W. W. Kirkland, Eleventh Forth Carolina Infantry.
Hdqrs. Eleventh Reg’t North Carolina Yols.,
MitchelVs Ford, July 23, 1861.
General: I have the honor to report the following facts concerning the operations of the regiment under my command during the actions of the 18th and 21st:
On the 18th I was ordered to take up a position in rear of the howitzer battery to support it. Subsequently I was directed to proceed to the extreme left as its defense. Throwing up a slight breastwork, I directed my men to kneel down and await the approach of the enemy, but as the attack was confined exclusively to the right, we had no opportunity to engage. After the action I was directed to post the regiment in the trenches which formed the center of your brigade, and here remained, perfecting and erecting breastworks, until the morning of Sunday, the 21st, when word was brought that the enemy was advancing against our left in great force, and had drawn up a strong column of about ten thousand, composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with which he menaced our center. You ordered me at this time to proceed to some point near the enemy and report his proceedings as they developed themselves. I took the road leading to Roberts’ house, and from that eminence perceived that a battery of light pieces had been put in position to the left of the road, about opposite the center of our brigade, and farther to the right a heavy piece of ordnance, which I supposed was a 24-pounder, had been arranged in battery. This column must have been the reserve. Soon both light and heavy pieces opened upon our right and center, and, as you are aware, continued a heavy fire for ten hours. Many shot and shell passed over and into the trenches occupied by my regiment, but fortunately no man was touched.
At 3 p. in., by your order, we assisted in the pursuit of the enemy, who was flying before our victorious columns who had so gallantly and so bloodily fought them through ten long hours. I must tell you that the officers and men showed a coolness under fire and an eagerness to advance which was very gratifying. I call your special attention to Maj. J. M. Richardson and Adjutant James A. Walthall, who were unremitting in their efforts to instruct the men in duties of which they had but little knowledge, owing to the recency of our organization.
Regretting, general, that I cannot report that the opportunity offered us to meet the enemy at the point of the bayonet,
1 remain, verv respectfullv, your obedient servant,

Reports of Col. J. B. Kershaw, Second South Carolina Infantry.
Hdqrs. Second Palmetto Beg’t S. C. Yols.,
Vienna, Va.9 July 26, 1861.
General : I have the honor to submit a report of the operations of the troops under my command in the engagement near stone bridge on the 21st instant:
About noon on that day’I received an order to move to Lewis7 house, some three miles distant, to the support of Colonel Jackson’s brigade, then engaged with the enemy, with my own regiment, that of Colonel Cash, and Captain Kemper’s battery. These troops, with the exception of Captain Perryman’s company, of my regiment, were at once put on the march. As we neared the road it was perceived that the passage of troops, indicated to the enemy on the north side of Bull Bun by the clouds of dust, had attracted a dangerous fire of rifled cannon, and I directed the march across the fields. Captain Kemper was directed to precede the column to Lewis’ and await my arrival.
Arrived in the vicinity of Lewis’, a large number of our troops were met returning in a disorganized condition, and giving the most unfavorable accounts of the aspect of affairs on the field. Colonel Miles, of General Beauregard’s staff, met me to hasten our march, and informed me that Hampton’s Legion had just engaged, and that the enemy had acquired a decided advantage.
Soon after orders were received from General Johnston to enter the field on the left of Lewis’. Turning to the left, we passed over a hill through a thicket of woods under a fire of shot and shell from a battery directly in the line of our march, which wounded several, and killed one of our men. Emerging from the wood into an old field, near a ravine, with rising ground in front, I formed line of battle preparatory to entering the field at a point which seemed to indicate the left of the line of fire, which was very heavy in front and constantly increasing, and which I supposed to be directed upon Hampton’s Legion.
Before Colonel Cash had got into position upon my left it was perceived that the firing had passed still farther to our left and covered the whole front of my regiment, rendering it necessary to move the whole command in that direction by a flank. This movement had just been made when the line of fire made a corresponding change, rendering a still further movement necessary to avoid what I supposed to be the line of our troops in front of us. I therefore broke to the right into column, marched to the left, and formed on right into line. When my regiment had formed, the men were made to lie down, to avoid the shower of balls which was passing over us while Colonel Cash was conforming to the movement.
At this moment the head of a regiment marching by a flank passed to the right of my regiment and partly over my right wing, led by an officer who was said to be General Smith. I immediately rode up to the officer, and desired him to form on the left of Colonel Cash. Before he could respond he received a ball in his left breast or shoulder, and his men commenced firing to their front and right into the wood from which the shot came, and formed hurriedly in front of my right wing.
Colonel Cash, having to form in a thick wood, had not yet got into line, when a staff officer gave me the valuable information that a road on my left, leading perpendicularly to the front from my line, would bring me into a flanking position upon the enemy. Desiring to avail

myself of the position, I immediately ordered my regiment to the front in line, obliquing to the left, to avoid the regiment which had formed partly in front of my right, and directed Colonel Cash to follow as soon as possible. The left of my regiment rested on the road to which I have referred. Reaching a fence which skirted the wood in front of us, which I then found to be in full possession of the zouaves of the enemy,
I ordered a charge, which was responded to by a shout from the whole regiment. They swept through the wood, broke and dispersed the zouaves, and opened a deadly fire upon them as they fled across the field, leaving behind them a battery of six steel rifled cannon, which was immediately in front of my right wing in the open ground. The fugitives rallied in a field on our left across the road by which we had directed our march, where a formidable force appeared strongly posted on a commanding eminence. I immediately changed front forward on my left company, occupying the road as my line of battle, which being washed out formed a ravine, giving cover to the men. Captain Rhettfs company, on the left wing, was thrown at an obtuse angle in the skirt of a wood which ran parallel to the line of the enemy. Colonel Cash arriving formed promptly on the left of Captain Rhett, gaining a direct fire from the wood upon the enemy in front, while my regiment had an enfilade fire upon their left flank. In this position a continuous fire was kept up by our whole line until the enemy were driven back and reformed upon the crest of the hill.
Affairs were in this condition when Captain Kemper reported his battery, and was ordered up and directed to take position on the hill by the captured battery, and to fire upon the flank of the enemy over the heads of my regiment in the road. Returning to execute the order he was taken prisoner by some of the fugitive zouaves in our rear and detained some minutes, but released by the timely arrival of some of our troops and his own address. He soon brought up his pieces and placed them in the position indicated, whence he poured a most destructive fire through the ranks of the enemy, who filled up their files with a regularity, steadiness, and precision worthy the ancient fame of the U. S. Regulars, of which it is believed that force was composed. Twice were they broken and twice they reformed, but, again driven from the hill, they fell back out of our fire. Captain Kemper then withdrew his battery to rest his men, having lost one killed, two wounded, and some of his horses.	.
During the heat of the engagement a single company of Marylanders, ^ under Lieutenant Cummings, I am told, reported to me and asked for a position, which I gave them on my left, where they conducted themselves gallantly during the fight. Meantime the enemy occupied in great force an elevated ridge in front and to the right of us, about a half mile distant. Ko troops of ours being visible except the forces immediately under my command, and having received no order since I entered the field, I deemed it prudent to retain my position and rest the command for the present. Within a few minutes, however, I perceived a regiment emerging from the wood on the left of Colonel Cash, and advancing in admirable order up the slope to the hill recently occupied by the forces of the enemy whom we had driven off. I immediately advanced my whole command, moving my regiment by the right flank along the road, Colonel Cash in the field in line. Arriving on the face of the hill towards the enemy, I formed line of battle to the left of the road. Here I found Colonel Withers’ Virginia regiment on the hill to the right of road, to whom I communicated my purpose to form line and advance to the attack, and I asked his co-operation, to which he

﻿524	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
immediately acceded. Witli Colonel Withers’ command I found also the remnant of Hampton’s Legion, under Captain Conner, assisted by Captain Gary. Captain Conner reported to me and was assigned to my left.
As soon as the entire line was displayed evidences of movements became perceptible in the line of the enemy, and in a few moments they were in full retreat by the rear of their left flank. I then proposed to Colonel Withers to proceed towards the stone bridge with a view to cut them off, and forming to the right into column, Colonel Withers being in advance, we marched towards that point.
I detailed some of my men under General Johnson Hagood and Col. Allen J. Green, of South Carolina, who were doing duty in my regiment as volunteer privates, each to take charge of one of the captured guns and turn them on the enemy, while Captain Kemper took charge of two others, and they continued firing until ordered to desist by one of our general officers.
I directed my march along the turnpike to the stone bridge, while Colonel Withers turned to the right and entered the wood. He threw out a skirmishing company, who crossed below the bridge in advance, while my command was marched along the road. Arriving on the north side of Bull Bun, a reserve of the enemy was seen occupying the wood in front with artillery, and I deployed line of battle in the field to the right of the road, Colonel Withers forming line in my rear. Here I sent Adjutant Sill to the rear to report to the first general officer he might meet with that I had occupied that position 5 that the enemy was in front, and that I awaited orders. He delivered his message to Colonel Chesnut, aide to General Beauregard, and returned.
In the mean time Major Hill, C. S. Army, of the staff of General-,
reported to me with a squadron of cavalry, under the command of Maj. John Scott, C. S. Army, and stated that General Beauregard authorized the pursuit of the enemy with a view to cut them off. I immediately formed column for the advance, when Surgeon Stone, IT. S. Army, rode up and asked why I was retreating (mistaking us for friends). He was informed of his mistake, and sent to the rear as a prisoner, first informing me that the enemy were in force in our front. Throwing out the rifles of Captain Hoke (now under the command of Lieutenant Pulliam) and Captain Cuthbert to the right and left of the road, and the cavalry, accompanied by Major Hill, along the road, I moved by column of company along the right of the road towards Centreville. Arrived at the house on the hill which was occupied by the enemy as a hospital, having made many prisoners by the way, we found that a portion of our cavalry (Captains Wickham’s and Radford’s*) had had an engagement there with a battery of the enemy which they had taken, but had retired after being fired on by the heavy reserve corps which intervened between them and my command. This cavalry had come into the road by Lewis’ Ford, below the stone bridge, and neither of us knew of the position of the other until some time after. At this point Captain Radford, Virginia Cavalry, was found mortally wounded.
Here the enemy opened upon us a fire in front, and I again formed line of battle, my regiment and the cavalry on the right of the road in the wood with a field in front, the Hampton Legion as a reserve, and Colonel Cash in column on the left ready to deploy. Here a staff officer rode up and gave me an order from General Beauregard not to engage the enemy until re-enforcements arrived, stating that they were on the

525
way. Soon after Captain Kemper overtook me with his battery, when I formed column with my regiment and the Legion on the right, Colonel Cash on the left, and the battery in the road. At the request of Major Hill he was permitted to go in advance with Captain Cuthbert’s company deployed as skirmishers, and in this order the whole column was moved on to the hill commanding the suspension bridge, where our skirmishers became engaged with the enemy. I directed Captain Kemper to unlimber two of his pieces on the hill and open fire on the enemy, while I deployed my regiment on the right with the Legion and retained Colonel Cash in column on the left. The main body of the enemy were retreating by the Sudley Ford road, which comes into the turnpike at the suspension bridge on the south side of the run. Captain Kemper fired from one gun on the column retreating by the former road and from the other along the turnpike.
The effect of the firing was most disastrous. The reserve which we were pursuing, meeting the main body of the enemy coming by the other road, just at the entrance of the bridge, completely blocked it, and formed a barricade with cannon, caissons, ambulances, wagons, and other vehicles, which were abandoned with horses and harness complete, while the drivers fled. Many of the soldiers threw their arms into the creek, and everything indicated the greatest possible panic. The venerable Edmund Kuffin, who fired the first gun at Fort Sumter, who, as a volunteer in the Palmetto Guard, shared the fatigues and dangers of the retreat from Fairfax Court-House, and gallantly fought through the day at Manassas* fired the first gun at the retreating column of the enemy, which resulted in this extraordinary capture.
At this point I received a peremptory order to return to Bull Bun and take my position at the stone bridge. Here also the skirmishers recaptured General Steuart, of Maryland, who had been for several hours in custody of the enemy. Reluctantly I ordered my command to return, but, directing Colonei Cash to remain, I went with a detachment of twenty volunteers from his regiment to the bridge, where I found Lieutenant-Colonel Munford, with a portion of the Virginia Cavalry, extricating the valuable capture. They had arrived by the Sudley Ford road, having pursued the enemy from the battle-field, and came up to the bridge when Captain Kemper ceased firing. Here I remained until 10 o’clock at night, aiding Colonel Munford, when I returned to camp.
Colonel Cash’s regiment remained in position until 1 o’clock, when the most valuable of the captured articles had been secured and carried to the rear. I am informed that about thirty pieces of cannon were taken at this point. At the time when we were first ordered forward Captain Perryman had been sent with his command on scouting duty across Bull Run, and I dispatched my aide-de-camp, Mr. Edward Wallace, to conduct him to Lewis’. Arrived there, finding the regiment had entered the engagement, he went with Mr. Wallace in search of his comrades, but not being able to obtain any information of our position, he attached himself to Colonel Hays’ Louisiana regiment, and entered the fight in time to participate in the final charge and pursuit of the enemy on the Sudley Ford road. Captain Perryman reports himself as much indebted to Mr. Wallace for his efficient aid in conducting his company through the engagement, and particularly mentions his coolness and gallantry.
One of my personal aides, Mr. W. H. Hardy, was most serviceable during the engagement, gallantly bearing order after order with promptness and intelligence. Having been sent by me to conduct Colonel Preston’s regiment to a position on my left, lie was shot in the breast

at the head of that regiment before he had proceeded sixty yards, and died instantly. A youth of pure and gentle spirit, he evinced on the field the cool, self-possessed heroism of the veteran soldier.
Mr. John A. Myers, private, Captain Casson’s company, mounted Mr. Hardy’s horse, and rendered me most efficient aid during the remainder of the day.
Mr. A. E. Doby, also of my staff, was most active in assisting me on the field, and was most conspicuously exposed. His gallantry and intelligence in conveying my orders deserve particular mention. Riding into a squad of some of the zouaves when sent to Captain Kemper, then in the rear, he preserved his life by promptly repeating a signal which he saw one of them use as he rode up.
Colonel Cash distinguished himself by his courageous bearing and his able and efficient conduct of his regiment during the whole day. He will particularly report the conduct of his command.
Captain Kemper, of the Alexandria Artillery, and all his officers and men, engaged as they were under my own eye, merit the most honorable mention in this report. To the efficiency of this battery I have no doubt we are chiefly indebted for the valuable capture of arms, stores, and munitions of war at the suspension bridge. Without this artillery they could not have been arrested.
It is difficult to discriminate among my own officers and men, since all engaged in the fight with enthusiastic bravery and spirit, and bore themselves with light-hearted and vivacious gallantry to the end.
Captain Hoke, bravely leading his company, which was flanked by the left wing of the zouaves, was severely wounded in the first charge and borne from the field, was taken prisoner by the enemy, but soon rescued. His company was subsequently courageously led by Lieutenant Pulliam.
Captain Richardson was wounded early in the action, gallantly leading his company. Upon being sent to the rear he, too, was captured by the zouaves, but afterwards rescued. The escape of so many of the zouaves to our rear was accomplished by their lying down, feigning to be dead or wounded, when we charged over them, and then treacherously turning upon us. They murdered one of our men in cold blood after he had surrendered, and one attempted to kill another of our number who kindly stopped to give him water, supposing him wounded. The command of Captain Richardson’s company devolved upon Lieutenant Durant, who efficiently conducted it through the day.
Captain McManus was painfully wounded in the arm early in the engagement, but bravely led his company through the day.
Captain Wallace was slightly wounded in the face at the head of his company. Lieutenant Bell wTas also struck. Lieutenant De Pass was most dangerously and severely wounded in the head, in the hottest of the fight, after most gallantly conducting himself in his position with his company. Captain Kennedy was struck, but only bruised, by a ball in the side. Captains Casson, Haile, Cuthbert, and Rhett were uninjured, though bravely conspicuous, as were all the company officers, in rallying and cheering their men in the thickest of the fight.
To Lieutenant-Colonel Jones and Major Goodwyn I am much indebted for their efficient discharge of their important duties. The latter was particularly exposed from time to time, and bore himself with reckless courage. Captain Sill, adjutant, and Sergeant-Major Haile were active and efficient, and did good service in the fight, the former with his pistols and the latter with his musket.
Many individual instances of distinguished gallantry have been

brought to my notice, but where the whole command have conducted themselves with courage, devotion, and spirit it would be unjust to particularize. So, too, incidents illustrating the gallantry and spirit of the whole regiment might be mentioned, but would swell this report to too great a length.
Dr. Salmond, surgeon, and Dr. Kott, his assistant, were on the field, courageously devoting themselves to the wounded, and the chaplain, Bev. E. J. Meynardie, was assiduous in his attention to our unfortunate comrades.
The regimental flag, gallantly borne by Sergeant Garden, was three times struck during the engagement, and one of the color guard was wounded. The flag of the Palmetto Guard, Captain Cuthbert, was struck four times, that of Captain Kennedy once, and Captain Wallace’s once.
Among the trophies taken by my regiment was the flag of the First Begiment, Second Brigade, Fourth Division, of the State of Maine, with its proud motto, “Dirigo,” and a small Federal ensign.
I would particularly mention the gallant conduct of the Bev. T. J. Arthur, whose rifle did good service, and that of Professor Yenable, of South Carolina College, Capt. F. W. McMaster, Gen. Johnson Hagood, Col. Allen J. Green, Maj. J. H. Felder, Mr. Edward Felder, and Mr. Oscar Lieber, citizens of South Carolina, who fought in the ranks of volunteers with distinguished bravery and efficiency.

in rapid succession just in the rear of my lines. After the action of the 18th I had caused strong earthworks to be thrown up and the undergrowth in front to be cut away, which preparations, together with the line natural advantages of the ground I occivpied, made my position formidable to an attack.
Learning that the enemy were deploying in front, I kept my men constantly under arms in the trenches, fully assured that the center would be the point of attack. Heavy artillery soon afterwards heard to my left indicated that another direction had been chosen, but their fire, still kept up at intervals on my lines, encouraged the first supposition. This irregular fire continued throughout the day, each repetition renewing the assurance that an attack would follows But in this we were doomed to suspense. Their fiery missiles wasted their fury in the air above or buried themselves in the forest in front of us, a few of them falling against the embankments.
At 5 o’clock p. m. I was ordered to move forward and attack the enemy in front. The order was promptly obeyed, and my regiment put immediately in motion. I crossed the stream at Mitchell’s Ford and moved up t he ravine to the left of the road. On approaching the woods from which the enemy had been saluting us I deployed Captain Nance’s company as skirmishers, who moved in double-quick in advance of the regiment. I moved my command in quick time up to the enemy’s camp, of which they had taken a hasty leave, and deployed to the left of the road, the skirmishers still covering my front, in discharge of which duty four prisoners were taken; two others were taken by Captain Kennedy, all of whom were sent under guard to Manassas. Early in the night I returned under orders to my position at the run.
On the morning of the 22d I was ordered to proceed in the direction of Centreville, scour the woods, collect abandoned munitions and stores, and send them back to Manassas. A considerable quantity of quartermaster’s and commissary stores were obtained, and one wagon of officers’ private baggage, all of which were sent to headquarters. Late in the evening of the 22d I returned under orders to my original position.
In all the maneuvers of my regiment it affords me pleasure to acknowledge the active co-operation of Lieut. Col. B. B. Foster, Maj. L. M. Baxter, Adjt. W. D. Rutherford, and the officers and men under my command.

THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.
529
About sunrise of the 17th instant the picket of the Seventh Regiment, stationed on the Flint Hill road, three miles above Fairfax Court-House, was fired into by the enemy’s advance guard, and retreated without loss. Immediately as this information was received I ordered the tents struck and the baggage-train loaded. By 9 a. m. the train was ready, and ordered to move to Centreville, thence to their camp half a mile beyond Bull Run Creek, in the direction of Manassas.
At 8.30 a. m. I marched the Seventh Regiment to the trenches, as ordered, and remained there until near noon, when the enemy had approached within cannon range of our embankments, presenting as they approached several lines of battle, fronting from one to three regiments. Before an attack was made the Seventh Regiment was ordered to retreat to Centreville, crossing from the Fairfax to the Braddock road. We reached Centreville at 2 p. m., where we remained as a regiment of vedettes until 1 o’clock a. m. of the 18th, when, marching orders being received, we again retreated quietly and in good order to Bull Run, arriving at the run at 3 a. m. Immediately the Seventh Regiment began intrenching, and in a few hours were securely protected against musketry.
Quite early on the morning of the 18th instant the enemy appeared on the northwest side of the Centreville road, about twelve hundred yards distant. By 9 a. m. they had located their batteries, and forthwith commenced throwing shot and shell against the embankments behind which the Seventh Regiment was located. Random firing was kept up against this and adjacent points during the day, and until the close of the battle fought by General Longstreet’s Brigade on Bull Run, just to the right of the Seventh Regiment. The pieces directed against our embankments seemed to be rifled and 6-pounder cannon, throwing 12-pound conical shell and 6-pound round balls.
During the 19th and 20th instants nothing of material interest occurred, and we continued strengthening our position. In the mean time the enemy were constantly in sight at the point they first appeared. Occasionally the pickets of the Seventh Regiment would approach within firing distance of the enemy’s outposts, and a few of the enemy’s pickets were captured or killed by the pickets of the Seventh Regiment South Carolina Yolunteers.
Throughout Sunday, the 21st instant, batteries, near the same locality they were on the 18th, continued firing at the embankments on Bull Run. The shot and shell were the same as those of the 18th, but thrown with less accuracy. At 5.30 p. m. the Seventh Regiment, with other regiments, were ordered from their intrenchments to charge, if necessary, the batteries on the Centreville road; but before they reached the top of the hill the batteries were withdrawn and the enemy were in full retreat, leaving scattered along the road and in the forest on both sides what appeared to be their entire camp equipage. We pursued but a short distance, being recalled by dusk to our intrenchments on Bull Run.
At 8 a. m. on the 22d instant the Seventh Regiment, with other portions of the First Brigade, were ordered to march on to Centreville. There we remained during the day, assisting in collecting the myriads of articles the enemy had abandoned, with which the earth around Centreville seemed literally covered. Throughout this day the rain fell constantly and often very heavily. From 8 to 11 p. m. of the 22d the soldiers of the Seventh Regiment were arriving, much wearied and fatigued, at their intrenchments on Ball Run, which post they again left on Tuesday, 23d, at 12 m., or shortly thereafter. At 2 p. m. they 31 R R—VOL II

reached Centreville, encamping in the forest immediately southwest of the village. At 8 p. m. they were ordered to move again, and before 9 p. m. were en route for Vienna via Germantown. From Bull Bun to Oentreville is about three and a half miles; from Oentreville to Germantown about six miles, and perhaps a little farther from Germantown to Vienna. The Seventh Regiment reached Vienna about half hour of sunup in the morning of the 24th, where they are now encamped.
During the week, from the 17th instant to the 24th instant inclusive, no accident occurred with the Seventh Regiment, nor were any lives lost, none of its members being missing up to date. Since the 17th instant the ranks of the Seventh Regiment have been considerably reduced by the prevalence of the measles; otherwise the general health of the regiment is good.

Report of Col. F. B. C. Cash, Eighth South Carolina Infantry.
Hdqrs. Eighth Regiment South Carolina Vols.,
Camp Victory, July 31,1861.
In obedience to orders from the general commanding the First Brigade, Army of the Potomac, I beg lea ve to submit the following report of the operations of the Eighth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers during the 21st instant:
Early on Sunday morning, the 21st instant, heavy canonading and rapid discharges of musketry were heard about two miles to my left, and about 11 o’clock a. m. I received orders through Colonel Kershaw to move forward and engage the enemy. As soon as my regiment was put in motion the batteries of the enemy on the opposite side of the run were turned upon us, the balls striking very near my line, but doing no injury. The two regiments, proceeding rapidly to the scene of action, were formed in order of battle some two or three hundred yards from the ground which afterwards proved to be to us the main point of battle. For a detailed account of this movement I ask to refer to the official report of Colonel Kershaw, the senior colonel in command.
My orders were to form on Colonel Kershaw’s left. The greater portion of my regiment being at this time in a dense wood, and not receiving the order immediately, Colonel Kershaw preceded me in the march and arrived a few minutes before upon the field of battle. Here he changed his front, placing his immediate command at right angles to my own. Advancing, I found a considerable force fronting my line and concealed by a rail fence. For a time we supposed them to be our friends. Captain Pawley, of my staff, boldly moved forward with a view to ascertain the real character of those thus concealed. He had advanced some twenty paces when he was fired upon. Escaping uninjured, he immediately returned the fire, killing one of the enemy, as they now proved to be. I at once ordered the firing from my line to commence. After several well-directed volleys had been delivered the

531
enemy (zouaves) were driven back from their position. Falling back in great confusion, they were rallied in a valley some distance in the rear, where the enemy was posted in great numbers. From this point they returned my fire, killing five of my men and wounding several.
Seeing that the enemy were well acquainted with my position, and being unable to return their fire, they using guns of longer range than those in the hands of my men, and it being out of my power to advance without exposing the regiment to a cross-fire from the enemy and Colonel Kershaw’s regiment, I ordered a flank movement to the left, intending to fall upon the enemy’s right. Unfortunately my order was not heard along the whole line, owing to the noise of battle in our front. Order, however, was soon restored, and the regiment advanced, receiving an occasional shot from the enemy, the mass having retired beyond a hill in rear of the position held by them when my flank movement commenced.
After a short delay I was ordered by Colonel Kershaw to follow his command in the direction of the stone bridge. While executing this order I was met by General Beauregard, who ordered me to dislodge a body of the enemy supposed to be in a wood to my left. I at once proceeded to discharge this duty, but found that the orders of the general had been already executed by a body of cavalry. I continued in pursuit of the enemy towards the stone bridge. At this time the remnant of Hampton’s Legion was attached to my regiment, and placed under my command.
After crossing the stone bridge I found Colonel Kershaw’s command drawn up on the right of the road, and was ordered by that officer to take position on the left, Captain Kemper occupying the road. We continued to advance in this order, I deploying as skirmishers to the front Captain Hoole’s company, who drove the enemy before them. Occasionally the artillery of the enemy would fire upon us, but without effect. After continuing the pursuit for some two and a half or three miles we came in full view of the heavy columns of the retreating enemy. The regiments were halted, and Captain Kemper commenced a rapid and well-directed fire upon them, which caused them to abandon their guns, wagons, &c., and completed the defeat. The enemy now fled in the utmost confusion, throwing away everything which at all impeded his flight. Too much j>raise cannot be awarded to Captain Kemper for the manner in which he managed his guns on this occasion. Directing the fire, he displayed all the attributes of a brave, gallant, and accomplished officer. It was during this pursuit that my sergeant-major, W. S. Mullins, took as a prisoner Mr. Ely, a member of Congress from Kew York, who, armed with a revolver, had come upon the field to enjoy the pleasure of witnessing our defeat.
The enemy being hopelessly routed, I was ordered by Colonel Kershaw to send forward a detachment from my regiment to take possession of the cannon deserted by the enemy and bring them within our lines, fearing that these might rally and attempt to retake them. Captain W. H. Evans and fifty men promptly volunteered for this service, and well and faithfully discharged their duty. I remained upon the ground with my command until all the pieces which could be moved were carried to the rear, and at 2.30 o’clock a. m. on Monday returned to the stone bridge, taking position on Colonel Kershaw’s left. Here we remained until ordered to advance to this place.
My officers and men behaved gallantly during this trying ordeal, displaying that heroism and bravery which have ever characterized Southern troops. Where all behaved so well I would do violence to

Report of Col. R. C. W. Radford, Thirtieth Virginia Cavalry.
Headquarters Cavalry,
Camp Vienna, August 1, 1861.
Captain: In accordance with instructions from headquarters First Brigade, Army of the Potomac, I have the honor to report that the cavalry of First Brigade, under my command, was under the fire of the enemy’s heavy guns on the morning of the 21st of July for several hours, and was compelled to change its positions several times to avoid the fire. An order was received from General Beauregard about 11 o’clock a. m. to support the left wing of the Army of the Potomac at the stone bridge, which was the right wing of oar forces, when we were again under heavy fire of the enemy’s guns. In advancing the cavalry was divided as follows: Under my own command I had at first but one squadron, composed of the companies of Captains Radford and Pitzer, the latter in charge of Lieutenant Breckinridge. I was joined by Captains Terry, Alexander, Wickham, and Powell, with their companies, while moving towards stone bridge. The remaining companies were placed under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Munford.
While en route to my position I received an order from the commanding general to support General Jackson’s right, and for several hours succeeding was under heavy fire from the enemy’s cannon, throwing shell and rifled-cannon balls. As soon as it was discovered that the enemy were giving way I received a verbal order through Colonel Lay to charge upon them and cut off their retreat.
It affords me much pleasure at this point to have an opportunity of commending the gallant conduct of the companies under my own command, who charged upon a battery, killing the horses attached to two pieces, taking between sixty and eighty prisoners, and the standard of Colonel Corcoran’s Sixty-ninth Yew York Regiment, and leaving forty-two, dead bodies of the enemy upon the field. I have no hesitation in saying that the charge made by my own command, in connection with that made by the command under Lieutenant-Colonel Munford, composed of Captains Payne, Ball, Langhorne, and Hale, caused the jam at Cub Creek Bridge, which resulted in the capture of fourteen pieces of cannon, their ammunition and wagons, five forges, thirty wagons and ambulances, and some forty or fifty horses. I base this opinion on the fact that we were in advance of all our forces, and by our charge the

enemy were thrown into wild confusion before us, their vehicles of all sorts going off at full speed and in the greatest disorder.
Having dispersed the enemy in our front in the direction of Cub Run Bridge I then charged upon them between Cub Run and Bull Run, but soon came on a column of infantry, about five thousand strong, posted on each side of the road in thick woods, supported by a battery of three pieces, blocking up the road. All three of these pieces immediately opened upon my command, throwing the cavalry into some confusion, and killing Capt. Winston Radford, charging at the head of his company, and by his side Corporal Alexander T. Irvine, of his company, also Sergeant Edward Eountaine and Privates Richard W. Saunders and Philip G. Spindle, of Captain Wickham’s company. Lieut. Boldman H. Bowles, of Captain Wickham’s company, was separated from his company during the charge and was killed, also Private Fuqua, of Captain Terry’s company. Of all the brave and gallant men who fell on the 21st instant fighting for their homes and freedom, none died covered with more glory than the braves who fell in this charge. Peace be with them!
I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of Colonel Chisolm, aide to General Beauregard, who volunteered to guide my command by the nearest route to intercept the retreating enemy. He was among the foremost in making the charge, and distinguished himself by his gallantry, coolness, and bravery. He was of great assistance to me. My adjutant, B. H. Burk, was with me throughout the entire day, and acted with great coolness and bravery, taking Colonel Corcoran, of the Sixty-ninth New York Regiment, with several other prisoners. All the officers of the command distinguished themselves equally. I can make no distinction between them. The following are the names of the officers who were in the charge: Captains Terry, Wickham, Powell, Radford, and Alexander ; Lieutenants Harris, Breckinridge, Johnston, Halsey, Beale, Price, Page, Tardy, Waller, Newton, Watts, Izzard, Kelso, Triplett, Bowles, and Timberlake.
The following men were wounded, viz : Private B. T. Witt, of Captain Winston Radford’s company, and Privates James H. H. Figgat and William T. Marks, of Captain Pitzer’s company; also C. Turpin, of Captain Terry’s company. .
Four horses were killed and two wounded in Captain Radford’s company ; one horse wounded in Captain Powell’s company; one horse killed, one wounded, and one missing in Captain Wickham’s company, and three horses wounded in Captain Terry’s company.
The non-commissioned officers and men of all the companies did their duty in every respect.
Charles, the colored servant of Adjutant Burk, unaided, captured a prisoner armed with gun and pistol, and turned him over to the commanding general of the First Brigade.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Lieut. Col. T. T. Munford, Thirtieth Virginia Cavalry, co/ra-
manding Squadron.
Cavalry Camp, Jwh/ 24, 1861.
General : I have the honor respectfully to report that early on the morning of the 21st Colonel Kadford assigned me a squadron composed of the Black Horse Troop, Captain Payne, and the Chesterfield Troop, Captain Ball. For several hours this command remained under the fire of the enemy’s guns; we were then ordered to follow Colonel Badford’s command to the battle-ground. There I placed my command under cover and was joined by a squadron of our regiment, composed of the Wise Troop, Captain Langhorne, and the Franklin Bangers, Captain Hale. Three other independent companies afterwards joined my command.
About 5 p. m. I received the following order from Col. G. W. Lay, viz:
Colonel Radford has advanced. Munford will follow, and cross the nearest ford and pursue the retreating enemy. Pass the word to Stuart.
I obeyed this order as rapidly as possible, came up with the enemy, who were in wild confusion, charged and captured some twenty prisoners and several horses. As we neared the woods a heavy volley of musketry was opened upon us, disabling four horses and slightly wounding two men. Mistaking Colonel Kershaw’s command and Kemper’s battery, who were in our rear, for the enemy, I withdrew my command and watched their movements until Kemper opened fire upon the enemy. Discovering the mistake, I again ordered up the squadron I had started with and joined Colonel Kershaw. As soon as Kemper’s battery ceased firing I advanced, and found Major Scott, commanding Captain Davis’ company, had jiroceeded to the bridge on Cub Creek. Assuming the command of the cavalry there I ordered them to dismount, and sent Captain Payne to Colonel Kershaw, asking him to assist me. As soon as the cannon on this side of the creek were hitched up and placed in the road, Major Scott, without consulting me, marched off his command, carrying the guns with him. I continued to work with the Black Horse and Chesterfield Troop until five more pieces of cannon were hitched up, including the heavy 32-pounder and all the caissons, forges, &c.
When I had exhausted my command both in numbers and physique, I left the creek and conducted the train to Manassas. I had but one trooper to four horses; all of the others were driving the cannon and wagons. I again joined Major Scott and took charge of the cannon he had carried to Colonel Kershaw’s command, and was compelled to leave fourteen horses and five or six caissons for want of drivers, Major Scott having lost or dismissed his command before I arrived. After being out the whole day of the battle and the entire night I arrived at Manassas, and had the honor of delivering to his excellency the President of the Confederate States ten rifled guns, their caissons, and forty-six horses.
It is proper to say that Captain Evans (infantry), of Colonel Kershaw’s command, who came to my assistance, rendered material aid in getting out the guns. It affords me no little pleasure to have an opportunity to recommend to your especial commendation the corps under my command. In the charge they behaved most gallantly. The position of the Black Horse, being nearest to the firing, gave me an opportunity of seeing them fully tested, and it would be injustice for me to omit mentioning the conduct of Lieutenant Langhorne, of the Wise Troop,

and Private Taliaferro, of the Black Horse. I saw the former charge upon a man who was behind a cedar fence, and in the act of firing his rifle at him, and kill him before he could fire. Taliaferro’s horse was killed under him by one of the enemy, and in falling broke his collarbone 5 but he sprang to his feet, pursued and killed his man with his pistol, both running at speed.
I am not familiar with the roads or the farms, and claim nothing for myself; but I do claim that the men under my command pursued the enemy farther than any other command, and I do believe that when Colonel Radford charged and routed the enemy on my left, and when I met the retreating enemy half a mile lower down, it caused the panic and jam at the bridge which resulted in the capturing of the cannon, &c., and all of the wagons, which I left in charge of Captain Evans.

Report of Capt. Lei. Kemper, Alexandria Light Artillery.
Artillery Quarters Advanced Forces,
First Brigade, First Corps, Army Potomac,
Vienna, July 25, 1861.
General : In compliance with General Orders, jSTo. —, requiring reports from commanders of regiments and detached corps of the operations of their respective commands in the actions of the 18th and 21st instants, I have the honor to submit the following details of the part performed by my battery in the last above-mentioned engagement:
At 7 o’clock precisely on the morning of the 21st the enemy commenced a cannonade from his original position in front of Mitchell’s Ford. My battery was ordered from the lelt of the trenches about 9 a. m., and placed in jiosition in rear of the trenches at Mitchell’s Ford. This position we occupied without a chance to respond to the fire of the enemy, they being clearly beyond our range, until about 1 p. m., when I was ordered to join Colonels Kershaw and Cash, and under the command of Colonel Kershaw to move to the left of our lines near stone bridge.
We arrived near the scene of action about 3 p. m., and immediately taking position in and near the road leading from Sudley Ford to Manassas Junction, and about one-half mile south of the turnpike, we had the honor of receiving and repulsing the last attack made by the enemy. They were found in strong force (of regulars), and required to be repulsed three times before they retired finally, which they began to do about 4.15 p. m. Seeing this general retreat commenced, and my men being very much worn-out, I withdrew my battery a short distance to the rear, and returning with a few of my men, got one of the Parrott rifled guns, previously captured from the enemy, in a position to bear upon their retreating columns, and had the satisfaction of annoying them considerably.
Colonel Kershaw ordered his whole command to pursue them down the turnpike, and especially to endeavor to cut them ofl* where the road from Sudley Church (by which their main body retreated) intersects

the turnpike, about two and a half miles from Centreville. We failed to overtake any enemy in the turnpike until we arrived on the hill about one mile south of Cub Greek Bridge, in time to open (with two of my guns) on the enemy’s column, which was by this time partly in the turnpike. We also threw, with good effect, some spherical case into their baggage train, &c., which had not emerged into tlrn turnpike.
I wish to remark that the first shot fired to rake the road was fired by the venerable Edmund Buffin, and a prisoner subsequently stated that the effect was frightful. This maneuver resulted in the capture of many cannon, caissons, artillery horses, baggage wagons, an immense number of muskets, rifles, and accouterments, and many prisoners. In obedience to orders, Colonel Kershaw’s command returned to stone bridge, where we arrived about 11 p. m., and thus, as far as we were concerned, closed this glorious day.
I desire, general, to call attention to the gallant bearing of Lieutenants Stewart, Bayliss, and Smoot, of my company. Each of them throughout the engagements of Thursday and Sunday performed his whole duty with a degree of coolness and judgment worthy of all praise. The men of my company, with two exceptions, behaved like veterans.
The casualties of my command were: One killed, Private Bichard Owens, killed by a musket bullet, and two wounded slightly; also one horse killed, two wounded, and one lost.
These details are respectfully submitted, general, by your obedient servant,

Union Mills, July 24,1861.
Sir : In conformity with Special Orders, Ko. 145, headquarters Army of the Potomac, I have the honor to report that upon the morning of July 21, 1861, I first received orders to hold myself in readiness to advance at a moment’s notice. I next received a copy of an orddr sent to General Jones and furnished me by him, in which it was stated I had been ordered at once to proceed to his support.
I immediately commenced crossing my brigade over Bull Bun, but whilst so doing received an order to fall back to my former position, which I did, and a short time afterwards received another order, brought by Colonel Terry, aide-de-camp, to cross again, proceed up the run, and attack a battery of the enemy upon its flank and rear, regulating my movements upon the brigades of Generals Jones and Longstreet. I again crossed the stream, and had proceeded about a mile and a half in execution of the order when I was stopped by an order to march at once to stone bridge, following General Holmes’ brigade, which had already been ordered to proceed to that point.
I deem it proper to state that the courier said he had been acconi-

panied by an aide-de-camp, whose horse had given out before reaching me. I countermarched and marched at once to headquarters in the field, remained in reserve at that point until ordered back to Union Mills, which I reached after a long and fatiguing march the same night.
My brigade consisted of Rodes’ Fifth Alabama, Seibels’ Sixth Alabama, Seymour’s Sixth Louisiana, a battery under Captain Rosser, the Washington Artillery, and four companies of cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Jenifer. The infantry would hardly have got back that night, but for the excitement of hearing that the enemy were in possession of the ford. As connected with this, I send a report of a skirmish on the 17th, of Colonel Rodes’ regiment becoming engaged and checking the enemy, owing to the non-reception of the order to fall back on their appearance.*

At 7.10 a. m. the following order was received, viz:

I immediately placed my brigade in readiness to advance, and dispatched a messenger to communicate with General Ewell, whose movement I was to follow. Not receiving a prompt reply, I crossed McLean’s Ford and took position with my artillery in battery on the Union Mills road, near the farm of Mr. E. W. Kincheloe and abreast of Grigsby’s, which the enemy held with a strong force of artillery, infantry, and cavalry. I here awaited the advance of General Ewell for about two hours and a half, at the end of which time I received a somewhat discretionary order, through Captain Ferguson, aide-de-camp, and a few minutes after the following positive order, through Colonel Chisolm, aide-de-camp, to return to my former position, viz:
10.30 A. M.
General Jones :
On account of the difficulties in our front it is thought preferable to countermand the advance of the right wing. Resume your former position.

[Chap. IX.
In tlie execution of these orders the two Mississippi regiments of my brigade, while advancing to recross McLean’s Ford, were exposed to a dangerous and demoralizing fire of rifle shot and shell from the enemy’s batteries, placed at or near Grigsby’s barn. IJpon reaching my intrench-ments General Ewell sent me an order he had received from General Beauregard, upon which was the following indorsement, viz :
Tlie general says this is the only order he has received. It implies he is to receive another. Send this to General Beauregard if you think proper.
FITZ. LEE,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General,
Shortly after this I was requested by General Longstreet to make a demonstration in his favor on my front, followed by an order from General Beauregard, borne by Mr. Terry, 11.30 a. m., to advance upon the enemy up Rocky Run, co-operating with General Ewell on my right and General Longstreet on my left.
I recrossed the ford, my men much fatigued by the morning’s march, many just convalescing from the measels, and retraced my route to the position I had occupied in the morning, and thence endeavored to communicate with General Ewell. Failing in this, I notified General Longstreet that 1 was advancing to the assault, and proceeded westwardly through the woods to the eastern elevation of Rocky Run Yalley. My regiments were flushed forward by a flank movement through a ravine in the northeastern corner of Croson’s field, with instructions to form into line after crossing the hollow in the following order, viz : Colonel Jenkins, Fifth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, on the right, his right wing resting on the woods; Colonel Burt, Eighteenth Regiment Mississippi Volunteers, on the left, and Colonel Featherston, Seventeenth Regiment Mississippi Volunteers, supporting my artillery, protected by a company of infantry and Captain Flood’s small troop of cavalry, to be posted on the brow of a hill well to the left—the only point from which it could be used at all—in order to distract the enemy’s fire from my advancing lines of infantry. This arrangement of my two pieces of artillery, I regret to state, was impracticable, by a vigorous converging fire from the enemy’s rifled guns and an advance of his infantry before my infantry company could be thrown forward to protect the pieces, and I was compelled to withdraw them.
Colonel Jenkins’ regiment advanced through a galling fire and over exceedingly difficult ground across the hollow. The Mississippi regiment followed, but owing to the great difficulties of the ground, which were not apparent in my reconnaissance, and to the murderous shower of the shot, shell, and canister which was poured upon the brigade from a masked battery, as well as from that in front, faltered, and, with the exception of Captain Fontaine’s company, fell back. I rallied them in the woods to the rear at a point to which i had previously withdrawn the artillery and cavalry. While the Eighteenth Mississippi Regiment was endeavoring to form into line its right became lapped behind the left of the Fifth, upon which its fire told with fatal effect. The latter regiment (the Fifth), notwithstanding the heavy fire of the enemy in front and the unfortunate fire of friends in the rear, advanced to the opposite slope, and then formed into line of battle, prepared to make the charge. Being isolated by the falling back of the supporting regiments it maintained its position for nearly three-quarters of an hour, its two right companies in the mean time thrown into the woods with well directed volleys, driving the already retreating foe precipitately from the field. After I had dispatched three separate orders to withdraw, there being

no favoring demonstration from Blackburn’s Ford, it retired well formed and in good order from the field.
Although the main object of our attack—the possession of the battery—was not attained, the effect of our operations, I am glad to believe, was none the less important in working out the grand issues of the day. The enemy left in panic the strong position from which he completely commanded several fords of Bull Bun and the adjacent country for miles around.
My men behaved well in making the advance, considering the great difficulties of the ground and the terrible nature of the fire, as the following statement will show: Fifth Begiment South Carolina Volunteers, 3 killed, 23 wounded; Seventeenth Begiment Mississippi Volunteers, 2 killed, 10 wounded; Eighteenth Begiment Mississippi Volunteers, 9 killed, 29 wounded. Total, 14 killed, 62 wounded.
It affords me much pleasure to express the confidence with which the conduct of Captain Miller and Lieutenant Norcom, of the artillery, and Capt. J. W. Flood, of the cavalry, attached to my command, inspired me. I only regret that the circumstances of my position prevented me from deriving the full benefit of the assistance they were so ready and eager to give. Too much cannot be said in praise of the gallantry displayed by Colonel Jenkins and his regiment of South Carolinians. The daring advance in line, the unwavering determination and coolness with which he held his command in position after it was completely isolated, and the ready tact with which he advanced his right flank and scattered the foe, will challenge comparison, I venture to say, with any of the many exhibitions of gallantry that graced the signal victory of the day. To Captain Fontaine, Company H, Eighteenth Begiment Mississippi Volunteers, much praise is also due for the manner in which he kept his company in hand. Not only did he resist the backward pressure of the other companies of his regiment, but he gallantly maintained his ground in rear of the Fifth Begiment, and with it retired from the field.
For more detailed reports I beg leave to refer you to the accompanying reports of colonels commanding regiments of this brigade.
To the following-named gentlemen: Lieut. F. G. Latham, acting assistant adjutant-general, Capts. A. Coward, J. W. Ford, E. Taylor, J. B. Curell, and Lieut. O. K. McLemore, members of my staff, I am indebted for valuable assistance, and I am under especial obligations to Mr. E. W. Kincheloe, whose services as messenger, scout, and guide were truly valuable to me personally, as well as the cause in which we are engaged, I take pleasure also in acknowledging the valuable assistance of Colonel White and Mr. Davis, both independent volunteers, accompanying the Mississippi Volunteers under my command.

﻿540	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers in the attack made on the enemy’s camp near McLean’s Ford on the evening of the 21st instant:
General Jones’ brigade, composed of the Fifth South Carolina and the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Regiments of Mississippi Volunteers, marched to the field in the order of their position in line. Colonel Jenkins’ regiment, holding the right, was placed in the front; Colonel Burt’s in the center ; and the Seventeenth, holding the left, was in the rear.
On entering the field where the enemy were encamped we found their batteries planted and pointing in the direction of our entrance upon the field. We marched up a ravine some two or three hundred yards until we reached the foot of the first hill occupied by the enemy, where we entered the field. Here we were halted, and the South Carolina regiment formed into line of battle on the right, and the Eighteenth Mississippi immediately on the left of the South Carolina regiment. These regiments were thrown into line near the foot of the hill as perfectly as the ground would permit, where they were somewhat protected against the enemy’s batteries by the hill in front. These regiments covered the whole line of battle, and the Seventeenth Regiment could not be formed in line of battle in rear of the other two, owing to obstacles presented by the ground.
Very soon after we were halted the firing commenced, and the order to charge or advance was given immediately on the right. The two regiments in front marched very promptly and gallantly up the hill, in the direction of the enemy. I immediately ordered the Seventeenth to advance, and standing at the head of the column ascended the hill, directing the right wing to the right and ordered the left to incline to the left, so as to form a line of battle in the rear of the Eighteenth Regiment. This order was promptly obeyed by every company in my command. The Eighteenth Regiment, in our front, advanced until they reached the ravine which separates the two hills occupied by the enemy. Here they were halted by the ravine in front, which at that place could not be crossed without great difficulty, if at all. Standing thus exposed to a heavy fire from the enemy’s artillery and musketry, and being .unable to advance, they fell back. The Seventeenth Regiment advanced to the edge of the ravine, and the right wing was ordered by me to fire after it was unmasked by the Eighteenth. This order was promptly obeyed. The left wing did not fire at all, and was not ordered to do so. Standing thus, unable to advance, and exposed to a heavy fire from the enemy, the Seventeenth fell back with the Eighteenth Regiment. This advance was made by all three of the regiments under a very rapid fire from the enemy’s batteries, as well as from their sharpshooters, and was checked only by the obstacles in their pathway. After falling back beyond the reach of the enemy’s batteries the regiments were reformed and the order given to them to return to their camps.
The orders communicated to me by General Jones before entering upon the field were that my regiment was held rather in reserve, but required to sustain the other two, and I was to exereise my own discretion in doing so. I thought at the time, and still think, that in making the charge the other two regiments required the support of mine, and so ordered it.*
All of which is respectfully submitted.

THE BULL RUN CAMPAIGN.

No. 98.
Beport of Col. E. B. Burt, Eighteenth Mississippi Infantry.
McLean’s Ford, July 22, 1861.
Dear Sir : I have the honor to report that my command, Eighteenth Regiment Mississippi Volunteers, with Colonel Jenkins’ South Carolina regiment, Colonel Featherston’s Seventeenth Regiment Mississippi Volunteers, under command of Brig. Gen. D. R. Jones, proceeded at about 2.30 o’clock on the evening of the 21st to take the battery of the enemy posted near Grigsby’s barn, on the north side of Bull Run.
When within about three hundred yards of the guns of the enemy I endeavored to form my command near the edge of a ravine on the left of the command of Colonel Jenkins. Before, however, the regiment could be formed, which from the nature of the ground was difficult to do, the enemy delivered a murderous fire on it. At this period the command came from the right to charge the enemy. By whom it was given I know not. The charge was made, however, without any knowledge of the ground over which the regiment was to pass, and continued in the face of a terrific fire of canister, shell, and shot from the battery of the enemy and the fire of a portion of my own command through those in advance of them until an impassable ravine was reached (where the line was originally attempted to be formed, but not effected), when the confusion under the galling fire of the enemy’s guns became very great, so much so that to form the line was utterly impracticable, and it was not done until the field of Mrs. Speak’s was reached. The fire of the enemy was returned, and kept up by the regiment for some moments without seeing where the battery of the enemy was placed. The infantry of the enemy fled after the first fire from our arms.
Although but a short time engaged, our loss was severe. Among the killed was Capt. Adam McWillie, of the Camden Rifles, a gallant soldier of the Mexican war, having fought bravely at Monterey and Buena Vista; he was killed by a canister shot while endeavoring to rally his command. First Lieutenant Seary, of Captain Brown’s command, was killed on the field whilst making the charge. Second Lieutenant York, of Captain Wellborn’s command, was badly wounded near the same time. Third Lieutenant McLaurin, of Captain Fontaine’s command, was seriously wounded by the explosion of a shell. Number of killed and wounded, thirty-eight.

When I had thrown my regiment in the position indicated by your orders, and found that the enemy had discovered our approach, I formed

front under the brow of a hill. The enemy opening upon us a heavy fire of grape and shell, I advanced quickly over very difficult ground. While gallantly charging in fine order our friends in the rear poured in upon me heavy fires of musketry, cutting us up sadly. This compelled a halt, which I made upon gaining the brow of the hill upon which the enemy was stationed. Here, under a terrific fire of shell, I reformed and dressed my lines, and reloaded such guns as had been fired. , Expecting the reserve to form to the rear to my support, I made every preparation to renew my charge upon the batteries, when I discovered that I was isolated in the presence of the enemy’s guns, cavalry, and three or four regiments of infantry.
Doubtful whether to advance unsupported against such great odds of position and men, I sent to you three times for orders, and retained my position amid the bursting of shell and threats of attack for thiee-quarters of an hour. Throwing to the front Captain Seabrook’s company as sharpshooters, and finding a large force threatening to charge, I withdrew them and placed Company A (Captain Goss) and Company B (Captain Jackson) in advance, in a skirt of woods upon my right, with orders to open upon the enemy, which was promptly executed and with effect, the artillerists leaving their guns and the troops retiring to the wood immediately in their rear.
Not hearing from the brigade, and the enemy being impregnable to a small body like mine, I decided unwillingly to withdraw, and leaving Companies A and B to prevent a sudden attack, retired in order a short-distance, when I threw into position Company C (Captain Seay) and Company H (Captain Bowen), and called in the two Companies A and B, and, forming column, slowly and in order left the ground.
My observation, limited to a portion of the regiment, at times prevented my noticing all who behaved well. I notice with pleasure, as coming under immediate observation, the coolness and good conduct of Lieut. Col. G. W. H. Legg, in addition to the captains mentioned as performing special orders. I was greatly pleased with the coolness and conduct of others. Captains Giles, Carpenter, and, in fine, all under my observation, obeyed with promptness and kept good order in their ranks. Many lieutenants pleased me by self-possession and coolness, and would no doubt have given signal proof of gallantry and conduct had opportunity offered. My adjutant, Lieut. E. B. Clinton, also greatly pleased me by his conduct. I could notice a general desire to do their duty, and specially marked as encouraging the men were Privates Fernandez and Long, of Captain Glenn’s company. I also hear Private Scaife, of Captain Goss’ company, highly spoken of as aiding his company in its hour of trial.
I can only refer to the providence of a merciful God our success, as the enemy left the field under so small an attacking force ; to His protection, our safety and comparatively small loss under so heavy a fire.
The enemy fired seventy-four shots at us, and my killed amounted only to three and my wounded to twenty-three,.
Most respectfully,
M. JENKINS,
Colonel.

Brigade, First Corps.
Headquarters Fourth Brigade, Jidjy 28, 1861.
In obedience to the generaPs orders of the 20th to assume the offensive, my command was moved across Bull Bun at an early hour on the 21st. I found my troops much exposed to the fire of the enemy’s artillery, my front being particularly exposed to a double cross-fire as well as a direct one. Garland’s regiment, Eleventh Virginia, was placed in position to carry by assault the battery immediately in my front. McRae’s regiment, Fifth North Carolina, under Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, the colonel being sick, was posted in front of the battery on my right, and with same purpose in regard to this battery. Strong bodies of skirmishers were thrown out in front of each column, with orders to lead in the assault, and at the same time to keep up a sharp fire, so as to confuse as much as possible the fire of the enemy, and thereby protect the columns, which were not to fire again before the batteries were ours. The columns were to be supported, the first by the First Virginia Regiment, under Major Skinner, the second by the Seventeenth Virginia Regiment, under Colonel Corse. The Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiment, under Colonel Hairston, was the reserve in column of division in mass, convenient to the support of either column. Arrangements being complete, the troops were ordered to lie down and cover themselves from the artillery fire as much as possible.
About an hour after my position was taken it was discovered by a reconnaissance made by Colonels Terry and Lubbock that the enemy was moving in heavy columns towards our left, the position that the general had always supposed he would take. This information was at once sent to headquarters, and I soon received orders to fall back upon my original position, the right bank of the run. Colonels Terry and Lubbock then volunteered to make a reconnaissance of the position of the enemy’s batteries. They made a very gallant and complete one, and a hasty sketch of his entire left. This information was forwarded to the commanding general, with the suggestion that the batteries be taken.
The general’s orders were promptly issued to that effect, and I again moved across the run, but some of the troops ordered to co-operate failed to get their orders. After awaiting the movement some time, I received a peculiar order to hold my position only. In a few minutes, however, the enemy were reported routed, and 1 was again ordered forward. The troops were again moved across the run and advanced towards Centreville, the Fifth North Carolina Regiment being left to hold the ford. Advancing to the attack of the routed column I had the First, Eleventh, Seventeenth, and Twenty-fourth Virginia Regiments, Garnett’s section of the Washington Artillery, and Whitehead’s troop of cavalry. The artillery and cavalry were at once put ip pursuit, followed as rapidly as possible by the infantry.
General Bonham, who was pursuing on our left, finding it difficult to advance through the fields, &c., moved his command to the road, put

it in advance of mine, and the march towards Ceutreville was continued about a mile farther. Night coming on, the general deemed it advisable to halt. After lying in this position about an hour the general directed that the troops should be marched back to Bull Bun for water.
Early next day I sent Colonel Terry forward, under the protection of Captain Whitehead’s troop, to pick up stragglers, ordnance, ordnance stores, and other property that had been abandoned by the enemy. "I have been too much occupied to get the names or the number of prisoners. As I had no means of taking care of them, I at once sent them to headquarters. Colonel Terry captured the Federal flag said to have been made, in anticipation of victory, to be hoisted over our position at Manassas. He also shot from the cupola of the court-house at Fairfax the Federal flag left there. These were also duly forwarded to the commanding general.
About noon of the 22d Colonel Garland was ordered with his regiment to the late battle-ground to collect and preserve the property, &©., that had been abandoned in that direction. Colonel Garland’s report and inventory of other property and stores brought in to headquarters and listed by Captain Sorrel, of my staff, and the regimental reports of killed and wounded are herewith inclosed.*
My command, although not actively engaged against the enemy, was under the fire of his artillery for nine hours during the day. The officers and men exhibited great coolness and patience during the time.
To our kind and efficient medical officers, Surgeons Cullen, Thornhill, and Lewis, Assistant Surgeons Maury, Chalmers, and Snowden, we owe many thanks. Lieut. F. S. Armistead, acting assistant adjutant-general, and Lieut. P. T. Manning were very active and zealous.
Volunteer Staff.—Colonel Biddick, assistant adjutant-general, North Carolina, was of great assistance in conveying orders, assisting in the distribution of troops, and infusing proper spirit among them. Cols. B. F. Terry and T. Lubbock were very active and energetic. When unoccupied, they repeatedly volunteered their services to make reconnaissances. They were very gallantly seconded by Capts. T. Goree and Chichester, who were also very useful in conveying orders. Capts. T. Walton and C. M. Thompson were very active and prompt in the discharge of their duties. Captain Sorrel joined me as a volunteer aide in the midst of the fight. He came into the battle as gaily as a beau, and seemed to receive orders which threw him into more exposed positions with peculiar delight.

time successfully repelled a body of skirmishers deployed against him. At the several points observed by Captain Herbert there were posted two batteries and a large reserve of infantry to sustain them. During the morning the regiment was ordered to cross the ford, which order was promptly executed by officers and men, and the regiment formed in column at the head of the ravine, on the enemy’s bank, near their batteries. Shot and shell were incessantly poured over their heads, but without any damage, and the regiment under order retired to their original position.

Camp Berkeley, near Ball’s Mill, July 26,1861.
Colonel : On the 18th of July, by orders from headquarters, my command took up its march from Leesburg to join your command, marching eighteen miles that day and ten miles the next, reaching your headquarters about noon.
I was ordered by you to form in line of battle in front of your headquarters, where we remained till the morning of the glorious and ever-memorable 21st. Early that morning my command by your orders was put in motion, and after changing its position several times was ordered behind the woods near to and northwest from your headquarters, to act as a support to other forces more in advance. You directed me to hold this position, and I remained in it for several hours, exposed to the fire of one of the batteries of the enemy, which my men stood with much intrepidity, shot falling sometimes within a few feet of their line and passing over their heads.
Later in the day, about two hours, by order of General Beauregard, I took my command into the conflict and formed in line of battle behind a wood northeast of Mrs. Henry’s house, through which the enemy was said to be advancing in large force. At that moment a portion of our troops were retreating in great confusion, and the general commanding directed me to hold my line firm and assist in rallying the retreating forces behind it. This being done, the Eighth Regiment charged with great spirit through the woods, driving the approaching enemy back in disorder. I was then ordered to the fight around Mrs. Henry’s house, where the Eighth made a most gallant and impetuous charge, routing the enemy, and losing in killed, wounded, and missing thirty-three soldiers. I then drew the men back to a ravine on the east side of the house, to shelter them from random shots, when I was ordered to take a position near our first, to meet what was then supposed to be an advancing column of the enemy, when it was found to be a retreat. I was ordered immediately to Camp Pickens, which was reached at a late hour of the night.
I cannot speak in too high terms of the intrepidity of the men under 35 R R—-VOL II

my command, and where all did so well and acted so gallantly 1 will not and cannot discriminate in favor of any. Two of the companies had only joined the regiment on the day before leaving Leesburg. The whole regiment was very much worn down by their fatiguing march from Leesburg, and suffering from want of food and water on the field. Yet they stood all and bore all with cheerfulness and obeyed every order with alacrity. They had only one meal during the 21st, and but little water.
I was most ably and efficiently supported on the battle-field and during the whole period of our absence from Loudoun by Lieut. Col. C. B. Tebbs and Maj. N. Berkeley, both of whom displayed great gallantry on the field. Acting Adjutant Elzey also rendered me valuable aid, as did my sergeant-major, Fitzhugh Grayson, who has been missing since the fight, and I fear is a prisoner. I feel his loss very sensibly. He was generous and brave, and promised to make a valuable officer.
While mourning over the gallant fellows of the Eighth who fell on that bloody field it is a matter of congratulation and thankfulness to God that so few fell, and that no officer was either killed or wounded.
Below is a list of the killed, wounded, and missing.*

Report of Col. R. E, Withers, Eighteenth Virginia Infantry.
Colonel : I have the honor to transmit a report of the share taken by the Eighteenth Begiment in the battle of the 21st of July.
The position occupied by my command was, as you are aware, on the north side of Bull Bun, at Bari’s Ford, which we were ordered to defend. This position they had occupied for three days, sleeping on their arms, as their position was very much exposed. Colonel Preston’s regiment (Twenty-eighth) was on my right.
Early on the morning of the 21st I heard firing in the direction of my advance picket. Supposing it caused by an advance of the enemy on my position I hastened to the point, and found that the firing was caused by an advance of the enemy along the Warrenton turnpike, driving in the pickets of Major Evans on that road. I could distinctly hear the moving of a very large number of men and many ammunition wagons, indicating that a formidable attack was designed upon our lines. Causing two companies to be deployed as skirmishers on my left and in front I awaited further developments. No attack having been made on us we remained in position until 2 o’clock p. m. At this time, being enabled to see from my position the progress of the fight, and that the extreme left of the position of our army had been turned by the enemy crossing Bull Bun at Sudley’s Mill, some distance above stone bridge, and were outflanking and forcing back by immensely superior numbers our forces on the left and center, I crossed the run and formed my regiment in readiness for immediate action. Soon after Colonel Cocke sent down by one of his aides an order to bring my regiment into action as

speedily as possible. We moved forward in double-quick time, and soon came under fire of the enemy’s battery about Lewis’ bouse. Continuing to advance beyond the bouse, I was ordered by General Beauregard to conduct my regiment obliquely to tbe left and attack tbe center of tbe enemy. On approaching their x>osition I found a pretty strong force posted in a thicket of pines, in some places almost impenetrable. With a cheer we dashed into the thicket and pushed forward, the enemy retiring as we advanced.
They were composed principally of the Fourteenth ]New York Chasseurs, and several of their number were killed and captured by the left wing of my regiment. Emerging from the pines I halted and reformed the regiment, which had been thrown into some disorder whilst advancing through the pines. I now found myself exposed to a hot fire of musketry, and could not clearly distinguish friends from foes. Ordering my men to lie down in a slight depression of the field, so as to protect them as far as possible, I rode to the left of the line, and after some trouble was enabled to discover the U. S. flag with about two regiments on a hill opposite our position and across the Sudley road. A pretty sharp fire at long range was kept up between these troops and my command for some time. Just at this time a number of troops to my right, who had been stationed around an old house (Mrs. Henry’s), fell back in a good deal of confusion, but rallied as soon as they passed my line. One of the captains came up, and, announcing that they constituted a part of the Hampton Legion, and had no field officers left to take charge of them, as their colonel was wounded and lieutenant-colonel killed, desired to know what they should do. I directed them to form on the right of my regiment, which they did with promptness. I was then told that they had been forced back from a battery which they had taken from the enemy, but which they seemed determined to regain, as their skirmishers had advanced very nearly to the guns, supported by a heavy force of infantry. 1 ordered the whole regiment to charge, which they did in beautiful style, driving back the enemy (not only the skirmishers, but the supporting infantry) beyond the hill.
This battery consisted of eight rifled cannon, and I was told constituted a part of the celebrated Sherman battery. They were posted between Mrs. Henry’s house and the Sudley road, in a little triangular plat of grass land. It was immediately proposed to turn their guns on them. I ordered the two rear companies of my command, Company I and Company K, to drag the guns into proper position. They immediately brought up two of the guns and ammunition. Captain Claiborne, of Company B, Adjutant Withers, and Lieutenant Shields, of Company E, assisted by a gallant South Carolina officer, afterwards understood to be Green, and several others, soon loaded one of the pieces, and brought it to bear upon a large number of men who were congregated near a two-story house beyond the turnpike. Just as we were about to fire I discovered among them the Confederate flag, and ordered them not to fire. I know in this I am not mistaken, as it was first recognized by the naked eye, and an examination with a good field-glass confirmed my first opinion. Whilst debating the question amongst ourselves I saw two other bodies of troops passing up the hill towards the house, amongst whom the U. S. flag was clearly visible. They joined the party first seen, and proving thus that they were enemies and had raised our flag with the intention of deceiving us, we no longer hesitated to open fire upon them from their own cannon.
The South Carolinian alluded to above fired the first gun, and a most effective one it seemed to be. A few shots sufficed to drive all the enemy

out of sight. My regiment was then ordered by General Beauregard to push for the turnpike at stone bridge and cut oft*, if possible, the retreating enemy at that point. We reached the run and crossed it just below the cut timber east of the stone bridge, and entered the turnpike road just beyond that point. The enemy, however, had retreated by the Sudley’s Mill and other points above.
Soon after we crossed the run we were joined by two South Carolina regiments, commanded respectively by Colonels Kershaw and Cash, and together we pursued the enemy along the turnpike road in the direction of Centreville, until I was recalled by an order to fall back to stone bridge. Before reaching the point we designed to occupy we were met by another order to march immediately to Manassas Junction, as an attack was apprehended that night. Although it was now after sunset, and my men had had no food all day, when the command to march to Manassas was given they cheerfully took the route to that place. On arriving in the immediate neighborhood of that place I was directed to carry my command to Camp Walker, a mile or two below. This place we reached late at night, and our wearied men threw themselves on the ground and slept till morning. On the 22d we were ordered back to our former position on Bull Run, and the next day to the position we now occupy, Dear suspension bridge, on Cub Bun.
Too much praise cannot be awarded to the Eighteenth Regiment for their conduct during the memorable action of the 21st. Officers and men, with one or two individual exceptions, exhibited the utmost coolness and determined bravery. The last charge made by them was most brilliant and successful, and enabled us to retain possession of their cannon. I believe these pieces had been captured once or twice before during the action, but I claim for the Eighteenth the honor of holding the guns and turning them upon the enemy.
During the action Lieutenant-Colonel Carrington and Major Cabell rendered efficient and valuable service, as did Adjutant Withers and all the staff officers. Indeed, the officers generally displayed so much valor and determination that it would be invidious to draw distinctions. The whole command, indeed, exhibited a steadiness under fire remarkable for raw troops.
Considering the length of time we were under fire our loss was very small. I append the report.*
Captain Matthews, Company H, was among the wounded, but fortunately not very seriously. No other commissioned officer was hurt.
I would respectfully mention the necessity that exists for supplying many of the men with knapsacks, blankets, &c. As they advanced into battle, by my orders they threw away everything except their guns and ammunition, and, having subsequently marched to Camp Walker the same night, they had no opportunity of getting their clothing and blankets again.
I would also request that those of my companies who are now armed with the smooth-bore altered musket may be permitted to exchange them for the more efficient Enfield or minie gun.
With much respect, lam, your most obedient servant,

Report of Col. Robert T. Preston, Twenty-eighth Yirginia Infantry.
Army of the Potomac,
Camp f July, 1861.
Colonel : In obedience to your order of the 23d instant, that u commanders of regiments and of detached troops of all arms serving with the command of Colonel Cocke, on the 21st instant, in the battle of Manassas, will immediately make report to the colonel commanding the Fifth Brigade of the services performed by their respective commands on that glorious day,771 have respectfully to report:
The Twenty-eighth Begiment Yirginia forces, C. S. Army, under my command, was, in obedience to orders, marched from Camp Mason on the 17th instant, and at about 4 p. m. on the same day encamped upon the position assigned it on the right of the road leading from Manassas Junction by Lewis7 Ford of Bull Bun and upon the high ground within about half a mile of Lewis7 Ford, and was also intended to regard and defend the Island Ford of Bull Bun, lying nearly a mile southeast of its position.
During the interval until the 21st the encampment was frequently changed for the purpose stated, and the regiment turned out under arms several times by night and day to repel expected attacks upon the position.
Colonel Withers having some days previously crossed Ball’s Ford and taken position in the woods, I was ordered on the evening of the 19th instant to cross the ford and defend it in conjunction with his command against the attack of the enemy. I occupied the right of the road leading from Ball’s Ford towards Centreville on the night of the 19th, and again on the night of the 20th instant. Both regiments on the nights referred to posted pickets along the Centreville road, and I also posted pickets upon the approaches to the Island Ford. For greater security I ordered Company K, Captain Deyerle, to take position with the advance picket, and make proper resistance before retiring upon my position.
During the early part of the night picket runners informed me that the pickets Of a body of the enemy were posted within half a mile of our advance pickets. They also reported that they could hear a sound as of speeches made in the enemy’s camp, responded to by laughter and cheers. At 2 o’clock on the morning of the 21st pickets reported the noise of large bodies of the enemy and quantities of artillery passing over the turnpike in the direction of the stone bridge. The passing artillery was distinctly audible from my quarters.
At — o’clock a. m. the regiment was turned out under your order, and proceeded to occupy a position to resist the enemy if he should approach along the Centreville road. The two regiments were formed in line of battle, the Twenty-eighth resting on the right side of the road, parallel with and protected by the wood which intervened between their position and open ground. I subsequently caused the fence to be removed farther within the wood, so as to deprive the enemy of a material protection to his advance.
Two days before, in company with Captain Harris, of the Engineers, I made a personal reconnaissance of the Centreville road and approaches to the Island Ford on Bull Bun, he explaining the topography of the grounds around us.
After remaining in this position until — a. m., dispatching couriers

from time to time with information of all occurrences likely to be of interest to yourself, I received orders from brigade headquarters to recross the creek by way of Ball’s Ford or the fish-dam crossing, and take position below Ball’s Ford in the heavy timber on the south side of the ford. This order was executed with rapidity and exactness. The regiment deployed in line, its right resting on the ford. The Eighteenth Regiment crossed the creek by way of the ford, passing along our line, occupied the left, next the hill. The two regiments covered the road from the creek to the hill.
At — p. m. an order was received from you directing the advance of my regiment to the battle-field. The order was obeyed with alacrity. The Twenty-eighth passed in line across the field past the Lewis house (headquarters), through the orchard below the house, across the first ravine, upon the farm road leading from Lewis’ to Mrs. Henry’s house. It there halted, faced to the left, commenced to advance by a narrow lane nearly at right angles to its course up to this point. Its progress was stopped for a few moments by the passage of Latham’s battery, taking position, and afterwards by the Washington Battery coming from the direction of the field of battle. This obstruction removed, the regiment resumed its march. Advancing nearly half a mile, it was fired upon by the enemy, concealed in the woods on the right. By this fire six men of Company B, Captain Wilson, were wounded. This fire was promptly and effectually returned by Company B, Captain Wilson’s company, and several of the enemy killed and wounded.
At this moment a few of the enemy were discovered who had advanced beyond the road, and whose escape was intercepted by the passage of the regiment. Upon presenting a pistol at one of them he cried out that he was 44 an officer and a gentleman,” and yielded himself and companions prisoners. The men wounded and captured proved to be the advance of the First Regiment Michigan Volunteers, of the Federal Army. Among those who surrendered were Col. O. B. Willcox and
Captain-------, the former of whom had been wounded in the arm by
the fire of Company B, Captain Wilson.
My advance continued about half a mile farther through a dense wood, when it entered the road to Sudley’s Mill. There it was stopped by Kemper’s battery, which in passing occupied the road entirely. The regiment was halted for a few moments and the men ordered to lie down from a very heavy fire of the combatants, which passed over them, and which it was not in position to return. By this fire one man of Company C (Captain Bowyer) was wounded.
I was here in some uncertainty in regard to my position. Beyond was a warm conflict between the Second and Eighth Regiments South Carolina Volunteers (Colonels Kershaw and Cash) and the enemy. The woods were very dense. I had never seen the ground before. I was wholly without a guide. I therefore availed myself of the unavoidable delay occasioned by the passage of the battery to procure such information of the relative positions of the combatants as to prevent ourselves from firing into or being fired into by our friends. Riding forward I met with Colonel Kershaw, who, in reply to my request that lie would aid in leading me into position, furnished me a guide in Lieutenant Hardy, who rode forward and rendered important aid in that capacity. The battery having passed, the regiment renewed its march. It had advanced a short distance through a narrow road in the woods when, to my deep regret, Lieutenant Hardy was killed by a fire from the enemy, some of whom, and among them the man who shot Lieutenant Hardy, were immediately fired on and killed by my advanced company (A) Captain Patton

I at once ordered the colors to the front, and emerging upon open ground returned obliquely across a short neck of woods and came in sight of the enemy, who were escaping from the woods in rapid and scattered retreat to their main body upon the turnpike. An effort was made to overtake them, but after pursuing them to the crest of the hill next the turnpike and above the stone house (Matthews7) the regiment was countermarched in a line parallel with the route of the enemy. Advancing upon this route I was directed by General Beauregard in person to cross the turnpike and scour the woods beyond. In performing this service I detached Company A, Captain Patton, with orders to examine the stone house of Matthews, from which a hospital flag was suspended.
In this house were found a large number of the wounded enemy, some dead, and thirty-six men, who surrendered themselves prisoners. Among them were two officers, a surgeon, and assistant surgeon. The latter was liberated on parole, and directed to take charge of and assist the enemy’s wounded. There were also found in the house about one hundred arms. I then passed beyond the stone house through the wood designated by General Beauregard, found several killed and wounded, and sent one of the latter, a Carolinian, to the care of our surgeons. The advance of the regiment stopped at this point, being the same, as I learned subsequently, where a severe conflict had occurred between Major (now Brigadier-General) Evans and the enemy. The regiment was then countermarched over the same ground to the turnpike, and down the same to the stone bridge.
From this point I was ordered by General Beauregard to march in the direction of the White House. This order was under execution when I was directed by order of General Beauregard to take post near Mitchell’s Ford, on Bull Bun. The regiment reached this point at —
o’clock the same night, a distance of about-miles from the field of
battle.
The conduct of the command when called into action or exposed to a fire which they could not return, authorizes me to assure you that it may be relied on for any service which requires courage, energy, and obedience. I shall congratulate myself if it be your opinion that its opportune arrival contributed in any degree to arrest the jirogress of the enemy at a critical point and period of the fight.
I annex a return of the casualties during the fight.

Sir : On the morning of the 21st instant I was posted, by order of Colonel Cocke, on Bull Bun, nearly north from Lewis’ house, to protect a detachment of Rogers’ battery of two guns, under the command of Lieutenant [Heaton]. The enemy made his appearance in the pines some

three or four hundred yards distant, but some three or four well-directed shots induced him to retire.
About 1.30 o’clock p. m. I received your order if not in the presence of an enemy to join you promptly with my command. I did so; two Mississippi companies of Colonel Moore’s regiment having fallen in at my call promptly on my left on the way. On reporting to you I was ordered to fall in on the left of the line then formed and forming, which I promptly proceeded to do, you accompanying us for a quarter of a mile or more.
My battalion, the right under the immediate command of Lieut. Col. Edward Murray, and the left under the similar command of Maj. Caleb Smith, had scarcely taken their position when they found themselves in the presence of two of the enemy’s batteries, which were afterwards gallantly carried. My left had scarcely opened its fire before a heavy column of the enemy advanced from my left on the crest of the ridge or hill on a line parallel with our line of battle, with every jmospect of having my flank turned without difficulty. At this critical moment two regiments came up, posted themselves on my left, protected my flank, and opened upon the enemy at a distance of about eighty yards, with admirable effect. I do not know the names of these regiments nor of their commanding officers, and have to regret it, as it would afford me pleasure to name them on account of the critical and efficient service which they rendered. From some persons acquainted with these regiments I ascertained that one was from Mississippi, and I have an impression that the other was from North Carolina.
I went into action with but three companies of my regiment, forming a battalion consisting of about two hundred and ten men, and regret to inform you that my loss was very severe, being ten killed and thirty wounded. Maj. Caleb Smith and Capt. H. C. Ward fell early in the action ; Major Smith badly wounded, with a leg broken and fractured a little below the hip, and still in a critical condition, and Captain Ward of a wound in the abdomen, from which he died about 12 at night in a state of delirium, cheering on his men to the charge.
I hope 1 may say one word in praise of my men. But three days together—strangers to each other, of course—without that confidence essential to combined effort, and without discipline, and in their first battle, they yet met the crisis in which circumstances placed them with a hardihood and courage which command my admiration.
I have the honor, general, to be, with high consideration, your obedient servant,

tenant-Colonel Munford, of Radford’s regiment, we were ordered to intercept and charge the retreating column of the enemy. This was done with spirit and alacrity by my command, and resulted in the capture of thirty-two prisoners, ten horses, three wagons, one wagon of ammunition, a large and valuable assortment of surgical instruments, thirty-six muskets, a number of pistols, all of which, with the exception of the pistols, one wagon, and two horses have been delivered to the proper authorities at Manassas.
My command lost two horses, and two men wounded from the accidental discharge of their own guns ; also six shot-guns in the charge.
I hope some effort will be made to remount my men and supply those with arms who have lost them through an order given by the commander of the squadron when the charge was made.

Report of Capt. II. G. Latham, commanding section of artillery.
The first section of my battery had been stationed for some days before the 21st on a bluff* bank of Bull Run a short distance, say one hundred yards, on the left of the ford. It was aided by the second section of Rogers’ Loudoun Artillery, under Lieutenant Heaton. The second section of my battery, under Lieutenant Davidson, had been some days before detached and assigned to the command of Major (now Brigadier-General) Evans. About 10 o’clock on the morning of the 21st the enemy’s skirmishers appeared, crossing the open ground in my front. Almost at the same time they brought a single piece of artillery to bear upon my position, and opened fire. I returned the fire from my half battery, and immediately another gun was added to the first and joined in the fire upon me. They fired shot, shell, and grape. After a short time, however, their guns ceased firing, one or more of their pieces having been disabled by our fire, and my half battery remained for some time inactive.
I subsequently moved my half battery to an eminence in the open field about six hundred yards east of the Lewis house, for the purpose of protecting the advance of Colonels Withers’ and Preston’s regiments. Here I was rejoined by the left section of my battery, under command of Lieutenant Davidson. I was ordered by Captain Harris, of the Engineers, to advance; was conducted by him across the field to a position on the ridge about four hundred yards north of the Lewis house, where I remained but a short time, until I was conducted by him across a ravine leading to the mouth of Young’s Branch. I took position upon the ridge next beyond the ravine, being about three-quarters of a mile
southwest of my first position, and about----yards east of the Henry
house. Here I opened fire upon the re-enforcements of the enemy ap-

pearing upon the brow of the hill a little to the right of our front, and distant about seven hundred yards. I continued this fire, and aided in checking the advance of the enemy, who were driven back from this point in disorder. I moved my battery about three hundred yards to the right, and continued to fire upon the retreat until the charge of our cavalry, near the close of the battle, rendered it no longer safe to our troops to do so.
For the action of my second section I must refer to the report of General Evans, to whose command they had been assigned, and with whom they acted during the battle. I feel it a duty to speak in terms of high approval of my command during the engagement. My lieutenant (Foukes) and my gunners (Richardson and Rice) rendered most efficient service. The men served the guns with spirit and skill. We endeavored to do our duty, leaving to others to attribute to us such commendations as we may deserve.
I cannot refrain from expressing my admiration of the skill and coolness with which Captain Harris, of the Engineers, selected and led me into position, and tender him my thanks for the kindness and courtesy with which he introduced me to my first field of actual service.
I annex a report of the casualties of the day:
Casualties.—1 man wounded; 1 horse killed, 3 wounded.

Report of Capt. Arthur L. Rogers, Lmdoun Artillery.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the first section of Loudoun Artillery, under my immediate command, was on the day of the battle of Manassas held in reserve until about 11 o’clock a. m., when by your order I proceeded to the crest of the hill on the west side of Bull Run, commanding stone bridge, from which Latham’s half battery had been withdrawn by Major Evans, to resist the enemy’s attack in front of our forces. Here I posted my section of artillery, and opened a brisk fire upon a column of the enemy’s infantry, supposed to be two regiments, advancing towards me, and supported by his battery of rilled cannon on the hills opposite. These poured into my section a steady fire of shot and shell. After giving them some fifty rounds I succeeded in heading his column, and turned it up Bull Run to a ford about one mile above stone bridge, wThere, with the regiments which followed, they crossed, and proceeded to join the rest of the enemy’s forces in front of the main body of our army. After having exhausted my ammunition I retired, with a section of the Louisiana Washington Artillery posted in my rear, to Lewis’ house, to replenish my limber boxes, having no caisson with my section and being supported by but a small force of infantry. By the time I had procured more ammunition the enemy’s fire ceased upon the right wing of the Army, upon which we were engaged.
The other section of my battery, under command of Lieutenant Heaton, was posted by Captain Harris, of the Engineers, on the west bank of Bull Run, on a bluff, where it assisted in silencing the enemy’s bat-

teries in the pines opposite, and being ordered forward, was conducted by Captain Harris to a position in front of the enemy, upon the eastern verge of the plateau upon which Mrs. Henry’s house is placed, and about six hundred yards distant therefrom, where it was posted, under a heavy fire, supported by Colonel Smith’s battalion of infantry. It kept up an effectual fire upon the enemy until its ammunition was also exhausted, when it retired to Lewis’, for the purpose of replenishing.
My whole battery then being united, we received your order that we should leave it to the rifled cannon to fire at long range, as the enemy were retreating, and that we must cease firing ; after which we were ordered by General Beauregard to Camp Walker, eight miles from the battle field, below Manassas Junction, with General Elzey’s brigade, where we marched that night.

Report of Col. Jubal A. Early, commanding Sixth Brigade, First Corps,
Army of the Potomac.
Hdqrs. Sixth Brig., First Corps, Army Potomac,
August 1, 1861.
Colonel : I submit the following report of the operations of my brigade on the 21st ultimo :
My position on the morning of the 21st was in the pines on the road from Camp Walker to the gate in front of McLean’s farm house, to which place my brigade had been removed on the day before from Blackburn’s Ford, on Bull Bun, where it had been since the action on Thursday, the 18tb. The portion of the brigade with me consisted of Colonel Kemper’s regiment, Seventh Virginia; Col. Harry T. Hays’ regiment, Seventh Louisiana, and six companies of my own regiment, the Twenty-fourth Virginia.
At an early hour in the morning the enemy’s batteries near Blackburn’s Ford opened fire, and I received an order from General Beauregard through one of his aides to move my brigade to the cover of the pines between McLean’s Ford and the road leading to Blackburn’s Ford, so as to be ready to support either General Longstreet or General Jones, as might be necessary. A short time after taking this position I received a request from General Longstreet to send him a regiment, which request I complied with by sending him the six companies of my own regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hairston, and two companies of Colonel Hays’ regiment, under Major Penn. I proceeded also to General Longstreet’s position at Blackburn’s Ford, and after the companies I had sent him were posted as he desired, I returned to the place where the rest of the brigade was, and in a short time received a further request from General Longstreet to furnish him another regiment, which I complied with by carrying him the residue of Hays’ regiment.

Upon arriving at the ford I found the companies I had before sent had crossed over Bull Run and were in position with General Longstreet’s command, awaiting the signal for an assault on the enemy’s batteries, which were constantly firing in every direction. Hays7 companies were drawn up in double column in rear of the ford, where they remained for some time, when I received an order from General Longstreet to march Hays’ regiment back, and with that and Kemper’s cross McLean’s Ford and attack the enemy’s batteries in the rear. Hays’ regiment was immediately marched back to where Kemper’s regiment was, sustaining during its march a fire of the enemy’s batteries, which was directed by the cloud of dust it raised in marching, and a shell exxfioded in the ranks, wounding three or four men.
I proceeded with Hays’ arid Kemper’s regiments to cross at McLean’s Ford for tbe purpose of attacking the batteries in the rear, but before the whole of the regiments had crossed, the general’s aide, Colonel Chisolm, arrived with orders requiring me to resume my position. I then sent Kemper’s regiment back to its place in the pines, and marched Hays’ regiment up the run to Blackburn’s Ford. General Longstreet then directed me to carry the regiment back to where Kemper’s was, and after the men were rested a few minutes they were marched down the run by way of the intrenchments which had been occupied by General Jones’ brigade at McLean’s Ford. Upon arriving there I found General Jones had returned with his brigade to the intrenchments, and I was informed by him that General Beauregard had directed that I should join him (General Beauregard) with my brigade.
I immediately proceeded to comply with this order, and sent to General Longstreet for the six companies of my own regiment, and received a reply stating that I could take in lieu thereof the Thirteenth Mississippi Regiment, under Colonel Barksdale, which had been ordered to report to him, and thus save both regiments from the fire of the enemy’s batteries, which they would have to sustain in marching to and from Blackburn’s Ford.
I accepted this proposition, and immediately put the two regiments of my brigade, with Colonel Barksdale’s Thirteenth Mississippi Regiment, which I found in the pines on the road leading from McLean’s farm house toward Mitchell’s Ford, in motion to comply with General Beauregard’s directions, having previously sent Captain Gardner ahead to ascertain where the general.was. I marched in rear of Mitchell’s Ford in the direction of the ground on which the battle was being fought, near the stone bridge, and after proceeding some distance was met by Captain Gardner, who informed me he had been unable to find the general, but had ascertained that his headquarters were at Lewis’ house, in the direction of the fighting. I continued to advance through the fields as fast as my men could move, guided by the roar of the cannon and the volleys of musketry, until we reached the neighborhood of the battle-ground, when I sent Captain Gardner again ahead to ascertain, if he could, where the general desired me to go, my brigade being still kept on the march.
Captain Gardner met with Col. John S. Preston, one of the general’s aides, who informed him that the general had gone to the front, and that the order was that all re-enforcements should go to the front. The captain soon returned with this information, and I still continued to advance until I was met by Colonel Preston, who informed me that General Beauregard had gone to where the fighting was on the right, but that General Johnston was just in front, and his directions were that we should proceed to the left, where there was a heavy fire of musketry.

immediately inclined to the left in a direction pointed out by Colonel Preston, and soon met with General Johnston, who directed me to proceed to the extreme left of our line and attack the enemy on their right flank. This direction I complied with, marching in rear of the woods in which General Elzey’s brigade had just taken position, as I afterward ascertained, until we had cleared entirely the woods and got into some fields on the left of our line, where we found Colonel Stuart', with a body of cavalry and some pieces of artillery, belonging, as I understood, to Captain Beckham’s battery.
Here I turned to the front, and a body of the enemy soon appeared in front of my column on the crest of a hill deployed as skirmishers. Colonel Kemper’s regiment, which was in advance, was formed in the open field in front of the enemy under a heavy shower of minie balls, and advanced towards the enemy. Colonel Barksdale’s and Colonel Hays’ regiments were successively formed towards the left, and’also advanced, thus outflanking the enemy. At the same time that my brigade advanced the pieces of artillery above mentioned and Stuart’s cavalry moved to our left, so as to command a view of a very large portion of the ground occupied by the enemy. With the advance of my brigade and the cavalry and artillery above mentioned the enemy retired rapidly behind the hill, though the advance of my brigade was delayed a short time by information from one of General Elzey’s aides, who had gone to the top of the hill, that the body of men in front of us and who had fired upon my brigade, was the Thirteenth Virginia Regiment. This turned out to be an entire misapprehension; and in the mean time a considerable body of the enemy appeared to the right of my position, on an extension of the same hill, bearing what I felt confident was the Confederate flag. It was soon, however, discovered to be a regiment of the enemy’s forces, and was dispersed by one or two well-directed fires from our artillery on the left.
As soon as the misapprehension in regard to the character of the troops was corrected, my brigade advanced to the top of the hill that had been occupied by the enemy, and we ascertained that they had retired precipitately, and a large body of them was discovered in the fields in the rear of Hogan’s house, and west of the turnpike. Here Colonel Cocke, with one of his regiments, joined us, and our pieces of artillery were advanced, and fired upon the enemy’s column with considerable effect, causing them to disperse, and we soon discovered that they were in full retreat. My brigade and Colonel Cocke’s command were advanced in a direction so as to pass over the ground that had been occupied by the enemy’s main body, crossing a ravine and the turnpike, and passing to the west of Dogan’s house by Matthews’ house and to the west of Carter’s house. My own brigade advanced as far as Bull Run, to the north of Carter’s house, and one mile above stone bridge, where it bivouacked for the night. Colonel Cocke crossed the river at a ford to the left, and I saw no more of him for that night.
We saw the evidences of the fight all along our march, and unmistakable indications of the overwhelming character of the enemy’s defeat, in the shape of abandoned guns and equipments. Et was impossible for me to pursue the enemy farther, as well because I was utterly unacquainted with the crossings of the run and the roads in front, as because most of the men belonging to my brigade had been marching the greater part of the day, and were very much exhausted; but pursuit with infantry would have been unavailing, as the enemy retreated with such rapidity that they could not have been overtaken by any other than mounted troops. On the next day we found a great many articles

that the enemy had abandoned in their flight, showing that no expense or trouble had been spared in equipping their army.
The number of* men composing my brigade as it went into the action was less than fifteen hundred, but I am unable to give exact returns, as we bivouacked eight or ten miles from our baggage, with which were all the rolls and returns, and the brigade has since been separated and reorganized.
Colonel Kemper’s regiment, embracing less than 400 men at the time, lost in killed 9, wounded 38; Colonel Hays’ regiment lost in killed 3, wounded 20; Colonel Barksdale’s regiment lost in wounded 6; making in killed 12, wounded G4; in all, 76.
Without intending to be invidious, I must say that Colonels Kemper and Hays displayed great coolness and gallantry in front of their regiments while they were being formed under a galling fire from the enemy’s sharpshooters, who, from their appearance, I took to be regular troops. My aide and acting assistant adjutant-general, Capt. Fleming Gardner, rendered me very efficient service during the whole day, and a Lieutenant Willis, who volunteered to act as aide, and did so, was also of great service to me. I have not seen him for several days, and did not learn the particular corps to which he belongs, but I believe he belongs to a company of Bappahannock cavalry.
A company from Bappahannock joined Colonel Kemper’s regiment in the early part of the day, and a South Carolina company joined Colonel Hays’ regiment just after it arrived in front of the enemy.
The companies of my own regiment remained all day, until the retreat of the enemy at Blackburn’s Ford, with General Longstreet, under an annoying fire from the enemy’s batteries, but without sustaining any loss, and afterwards joined in the pursuit, under General Longstreet, towards Centreville.

intervals for about an hour. Having my entire force covered by the crest of the hills on the west side of the bridge, I did not return the fire. Observing I he enemy had deployed a considerable force as skirmishers in front of his line, and that they were advancing on my position, I directed the two flank companies of the Fourth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers and one company of Major Wheat’s Special Battalion Louisiana Volunteers to advance as skirmishers, covering my entire .front.
The skirmishers were soon engaged, and kept up a brisk fire for about an hour, when I perceived that it was not the intention of the enemy to attack me in my present position, but had commenced his movement to turn my left flank. I at once decided to quit position and to meet him in his flank movement, leaving the skirmishers of the Fourth Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers, supported by the reserve of two companies, to keep him engaged. I sent word to Col. Philip St. George Cocke that I had abandoned my position at the bridge, and was advancing to attack the enemy at the crossing of the Warrenton turnpike and the Manassas roads.
Observing carefully the movements of the enemy, I was able to form my line of attack directly in his front, covered by a grove of woods, at about 9 o’clock a. m. Placing the Fourth Regiment on the left, supported by one piece of artillery, Major Wheat on the right, supported by a company of cavalry, I directed my command to open fire as soon as the enemy approached within range of muskets. At 9.15 o’clock my command opened a vigorous fire from their position, which caused the enemy to halt in confused order. The fire was warmly kept up until the enemy seemed to fall back. Major Wheat then made a charge with his whole battalion.
At this juncture General Bee arrived with his brigade to my timely assistance, and formed immediately in my rear, and advanced, covering and relieving my command, and was immediately hotly engaged with the enemy. Col. F. S. Bartow, with his regiment (Eighth Georgia), came up soon after to the support of General Bee, but the enemy by this time were in such large force that our position was no longer tenable, and I ordered my command, now greatly scattered, to fall back under cover towards the Lewis house. The commands of General Bee and myself were now completely scattered, when we were timely covered by Hampton’s Legion and other re-enforcements.
For the further services of my command I beg to refer you to the inclosed reports. While my whole command gallantly charged and repulsed the enemy, I would call the attention of the general commanding to the heroic conduct of Maj. Robert Wheat, of the Louisiana Volunteers, who fell, gallantly leading his men in a charge, shot through both lungs. I am also much indebted to him for his great experience and excellent advice. Colonel Sloan was observed by me several times during the day rallying his men and bravely leading them to action.
For acts of particular gallantry I beg again to refer to the reports of the immediate commanders. Lieutenant Davidson, though with one of his pieces crippled, did gallant service during the entire day, and kept up a brisk fire upon the enemy as they advanced to within two hundred yards of his piece. To my personal staff I am greatly indebted for the promptness with which they bore my orders under heavy fire, and to Capts. George McOausland, Alexander Rogers, aides-de-camp, and A. L. Evans, acting assistant adjutant-general, I am particularly indebted for remaining with me under heavy fire during the entire day.
I send herewith a stand of colors taken during the action by Major Wheat’s battalion. I would also call the attention of the commanding

Report of Col. J. B. E. Sloan, Fourth South Carolina Infantry.
Hdqrs. Fourth Begiment South Carolina Vols.,
Stone Bridge, Bull Run, Prince William Co., Va., July 23, 1861.
General : I have the honor to report that about 3 o’clock a. m. Sunday, July 21, the officer of the guard awoke me and stated that my picket towards the stone house reported that he heard commands in the woods beyond, as if sonie one was commanding forces. I ordered him to report the same to you. Towards 4 o’clock I heard the firing of pickets on the opposite side of Bull Run from my camp, and at once ordered the men to be waked up. In a few moments afterwards your orders came, ordering me to get ready and move up on the hill at once. I ordered the men to fall in, and before 5 o’clock formed in line of battle on the left side of the road, covered by an undulation near the bluff of the hill, about six hundred yards distant from stone bridge.
I sent out, as ordered by you, Captain Kilpatrick’s company, Calhoun Mountaineers, to deploy as skirmishers on the left of the bridge, and Captain Anderson’s company, Confederate Guards, to the right of the bridge, both of them sending their advance skirmishers to the bank of Bull Bun. Captain Dean’s company and the Palmetto Riflemen, the latter commanded by Lieutenant Earle, was left at the camp, some three hundred yards distant, as a reserve. The enemy could be seen in the woods opposite. About six o’clock the enemy sent a man out with a flag, which he attempted to plant in the road about two hundred yards from the bridge. Captain Kilpatrick fired at him five or six shots. The man with the color fled precipitately to the woods. The enemy’s battery, which was planted on the left side of the road in the edge of the woods, then commenced firing at intervals in different directions, as if to make us show our position, which was still concealed from them. Sometimes they would burst a shell about the bridge; again, fire a ball from a rifled cannon just over us. I could also hear firing of cannon below. Up to 8.20 they had fired six times towards us.
About 8.30 o’clock you ordered me to get ready and move up on the ridge, leaving the reserve and the companies sent out as skirmishers. After advancing one-fourth mile I formed in line of battle on the left of Major Wheat’s battalion, he having already formed on the right of the field. Your cannon formed in our front. I had not occupied this position but a few moments when, by your orders, I moved a little to the front and about three-fourths of a mile to the left, and formed in line of battle in a ravine, my left resting on the pike road leading from stone bridge by Sudley’s Mill, and about two hundred yards in advance of

the stone house, and sent out Captain Hawthorn’s company as skirmishers in the woods, resting on our right.
Major Wheat’s battalion, which had been left with the cannon, advanced in front of the woods and was fired into by my skirmishers, which was returned by Major Wheat’s. My skirmishers sustained no loss, but wounded two of Major Wheat’s men. My skirmishers then returned, both Major Wheat and Captain Hawthorn having discovered the mistake. Major Wheat at once opened fire on the enemy and kept it up vigorously for about five rounds. I sent Captain Hawthorn to assist him as soon as he returned. I ordered the cannon to open on the enemy, who had commenced filing out in large force to our left. I then ordered the battalion to open fire by company, and then moved up to the left and advanced through the woods to the field in front. Major Wheat having rallied part of his forces, and formed on my left, at that time General Bee came up on my right and advanced part of his force on my right and commenced a vigorous fire. At the same time I sent forward part of Captain Hollingsworth’s company as skirmishers. I had the fence pulled down to charge to the front when the skirmishers and General Bee’s forces advanced to the right. Major Wheat at the same time advancing on the left, the enemy’s battery and musketry opened on us in large force, which was returned, principally directed about the center of the regiment. The regiment retired to the rear of the woods. Captain Shanklin rallied his company around the colors until the entire force had left the ground. I discovered the enemy attempting to flank us in large force, to which I called the attention of General Bee, who, seeing the force, said that we had better retreat and form on the opposite side of the hill, after which re-enforcements came up and the engagement became general.
Lieutenant Earle, commanding Company B (Palmetto Riflemen), and Captain Dean’s company (C), both reserves, occupied the position first held by the regiment (on the left of the road near the bridge) until after the battery retired, when they also retreated toward Lewis’ house and were then formed into a battalion, with portions of Captain Shanklin’s company, under Lieutenant Cherry, and Captain Long’s company and
the New Orleans Zouaves, Captain-------, and some Alabamians, under
Major Whitner and Colonel Thomas, of Maryland, and by them led to the field of battle on our extreme left. They charged a battery of the enemy, and, after a severe conflict, repulsed him. Sergeant Maxwell planted the colors of the Fourth Regiment South Carolina Volunteers on the cannon of the enemy and maintained his position until after his comrades had been repulsed by a superior force, who had deceived our men and prevented their firing upon them by using our colors and sign of recognition. During this contest Major Whitner had his horse shot under him while endeavoring to rally the men led to the charge. Captain Kilpatrick held the position on the left of the bridge until the enemy advanced in large force to the left and near the bridge, when he left and attached his company to Colonel Hampton’s Legion. Captain Anderson remained on the right side of the bridge till near 1 o’clock, when lie retreated toward Lewis’ house and then formed on some forces said to be under command of Ex-Governor Smith, and advanced with them into the field, engaged the enemy’s battery, when the forces under command of Colonel Thomas and Major Whitner came up, when he united with them in a charge on the battery which is above mentioned, in which our colors were planted on the cannon, but afterwards repulsed. I rallied the other remnants of companies on Captain Kilpatrick’s company on the right of Hampton’s Legion and led them up to three differ-36 R r—VOL II

ent advances. Afterward the men under my command worked the battery under the direction of Captain Ferguson, aide to General Beauregard, who made several telling fires on the enemy, assisted by Lieutenant Sloan, commanding fragments of companies.
Captain Kilpatrick behaved most gallantly, and was shot through the sword hand while bravely cheering his men onward. His first lieutenant, Horton, was shot in the head in a charge. Lieutenant Hunt, of Company H, deserves particular credit for his bravery in reorganizing the company. Sergeants Hawthorne and Fuller both acted their part well; the former was exceeded in gallant daring by no one. Captain Anderson sustained his character as an officer. Many of the officers and soldiers behaved well, among whom were Captain Hollingsworth, Corporal Williams, Privates Ferguson, Smith, and Wilkinson, of Company I. The Palmetto Biflemen were very efficient and behaved well. Lieutenant-Colonel Mattison was active in my assistance during the day in encouraging the men to do their duty. Captain Pool and his second and third lieutenants w^ere all seriously, if not mortally, wounded.

Report of Capt. W. R. Terry, commanding troop of cavalry.
July 23,1861.
I have the honor to report the movements of the cavalry company under my command in the engagement of the 21st, as follows:
Early in the morning, soon after the firing of cannon was heard beyond the stone bridge on the turnpike in the direction of Centreville, I drew up the company near Bull Bun below the bridge, and posted skirmishers, according to orders received from you. We had not remained in that position long before I received orders from you to bring up my company to the point where the action had commenced, (woods beyond stone house). I then posted them near the skirt of woods behind which the firing was going on. Soon afterwards, according to orders, we took position on the hill-side to protect a piece of artillery, and remained until it fired thirty rounds, and we received orders to retire. Afterwards during the day we protected artillery at two other points on the field. Falling in with Colonel Badford’s Bangers late# in the day, when the order was given to charge the enemy, I proceeded with them, and took part in the general pursuit. The men under my command killed several of the enemy in the charge, captured about eighty prisoners and seven horses, and took two stand of colors, one regimental. Among the prisoners taken were Colonel Corcoran, of Xew York; Lieutenant Gordon, of Colonel Keyes’ staff; a captain and a lieutenant belonging to a Michigan company.
We had the good fortune to come out of the engagement with only one killed and one slightly wounded.

Report of Capt. George 8. Davidson, commanding section of artillery.
Headquarters General X. G. Evans’ Command,
Stone Bridge, July 23, 1861.
General : The second section of Latham’s battery, under my command, was on the morning of the 21st stationed on the hill commanding the stone bridge over Bull Run and its approaches. It was on the south side of the turnpike, and about six hundred yards west of the bridge.. About 6 o’clock a. m. the enemy appeared on the high ground east of the bridge, nearly opposite my position. They opened fire from a single piece of rifled cannon, which was stationed on high ground north of the turnpike, not less than three-quarters of a mile east of my position. The fire from this piece and others near the same position was kept up at intervals until near 9 o’clock a. m.
About this time it was known that the enemy was forming in force upon your left flank. I was ordered to join Major Wheat’s command, which lay nearly a mile northwest of my first position. I passed by Yan Pelt’s house, and went on to the Carter house, about one hundred yards northeast of which I xilaced my section in battery. Finding that the^ enemy, still encroaching upon our flank, had changed his position, I was ordered by yourself to return to the turnpike, which I followed to a high point about fifteen hundred yards west of the stone bridge. I placed my pieces in battery on open ground within two hundred yards north of the turnpike. From this position you ordered my second piece, under Lieut. Clark Leftwich, to advance along the turnpike and up the Sudley road. He accordingly took position about one hundred yards east of the Sudley road, bearing nearly five hundred yards north from the stone house of Matthews.
From this position Lieutenant Leftwich opened upon the enemy, advancing along the Sudley road, about one thousand yards distant. He inflicted considerable injury upon them, and maintained his position until our infantry had retired. He then retired to a hill south of the turnpike, and about one thousand yards distant from and west of Robinson’s house. Here he remained, firing upon the enemy until he had expended all ammunition from his limber chest. The horses of the caisson having run off, Lieutenant Leftwich came to ask me for ammunition, which I being unable to furnish him, he proceeded to the Lewis house, where he rejoined and reported to Captain Latham.
Lieutenant Leftwich had not fired more than six or eight times from his first position on the Sudley road when the enemy advanced toward our right (as our regiment then fronted), and came within range of my gun. I immediately opened fire upon him, which I kept up until I found the enemy advancing along the Sudley road toward my position. I then moved my gun into the turnpike immediately at the mouth of the lane leading to Robinson’s house, and fired upon the enemy with canister, and with good effect, until he had come up within one hundred and fifty yards of my gun. Having expended my ammunition, I reported my command to Captain Latham, then posted on Lewis’ farm, about four hundred yards east of the house.
I cannot close my report without testifying to the courage and coolness of my gunners, Charles Perry and James B. Lee. The men also served at the guns in a manner highly honorable to them. I had one man wounded by a shell, but met with no other casualties, except that I broke a caisson pole and a gun-carriage axle while obeying your

Report of Capt. John D. Alexander, commanding Campbell Rangers.
Camp near Stone Bridge, July, 1861.
Sir : In obedience to your orders, on the morning of the 21st instant I reported with my company of cavalry to Major Wheat, who had been thrown forward with his battalion, and occupied a position upon our extreme left in the immediate vicinity of the enemy. By command of Major Wheat, I forthwith proceeded with my whole company to the front for the purpose of reconnoitering, and advanced in close proximity to the enemy’s lines. Having ascertained as precisely as possible his progress and position, I returned and reported the same to Major Wheat. I then by his direction took position a short distance in rear of his left wing, and held my command in reserve, ready to take advantage of any confusion in the enemy’s ranks or to perform any service that might be required. This post I occupied until Major Wheat’s command, with the Fourth South Carolina Regiment, under Colonel Sloan, having gallantly maintained the action for a considerable time, was forced at length to retire before the overwhelming numbers of the enemy and tremendous fire of his batteries. I fell back slowly and without the slightest confusion before the advancing line of the enemy, halting at short intervals and every available point, and holding my company ready for instant service. In this manner I retired, along with Captain Terry’s company, until we fell in with Colonel Radford’s command near Lewis’ house. Major Wheat having fallen from a severe wound received by him early in the action, I joined Colonel Radford’s battalion of cavalry and remained with him the rest of the day.
After the enemy was repulsed and forced back upon our left we received orders with Colonel Radford’s battalion to make a circuit of several miles to our right for the purpose of charging and intercepting the enemy on the turnpike in the direction of Centreville upon their retreat. This order was received by our men with enthusiasm, they having remained the whole day patiently under the enemy’s fire. We came out into the turnpike near the White House, about two miles from the stone bridge. Near this house, and about three hundred yards in rear of the point where we came into the turnpike, the enemy had planted a battery so as to command the road, and in the woods adjacent to the road on either side of the battery they were posted in considerable force. On the opposite side of the road the enemy was retreating rapidly and in great numbers. A portion of the battalion, and among them my company, charged up the turnpike towards the battery, when a tremendous fire was opened upon us from the battery, and also from the whole force stationed in its vicinity. By this fire I lost several horses, but no men. This was the last stand made by the enemy. After they were broken here the rout became general and irresistible. Some of my men joined in the pursuit and became somewhat scattered, but were all collected that night and reported to you the next morning at these headquarters.
I should perhaps mention in appropriate terms the conduct of the

officers and men under my command. From the commencement of the action in the morning until late in the evening they were under the enemy’s fire and within point-blank range of their batteries, and at times almost enveloped in their musketry. They remained firm and unshaken, exhibiting an anxiety only to meet the enemy, and awaiting patiently an opportunity to strike an effective blow. I am gratified to inform you that my officers and men all escaped without personal injury. I received a slight wound in my leg, which did not disable me, and in the charge upon the enemy in the evening at the turnpike, which I have mentioned, Lieutenant Page’s horse was shot, and fell dead while in his proper place at the head of the company. During the day we lost four other horses either killed or permanently disabled. I commend the conduct of all my officers and men to your favorable consideration. It gives me pleasure to inform you that my company is now ready to take the field again and to perform effective service.

Brigade.
Headquarters Brooke’s Station, July 26,1861.
General : On Wednesday, the 18th of July, I received orders from the headquarters of the Army to hold my brigade in readiness to support your army if called on by you. I proceeded with two regiments (the Second Tennessee and First Arkansas Volunteers) and Walker’s battery that afternoon towards Manassas, and on my arrival at Camp Chopawamsic sent an officer to communicate with you. Soon after the officer left I received your telegram to Lieutenant-Colonel Green urging me forward. The march was resumed, and I encamped near Brents-ville.
On reporting to you in person on Friday morning I was ordered to Camp Wigfall as a support to Ewell’s brigade, charged with the defense of Union Mills and its neighborhood. My brigade rested on Saturday.
About 9 o’clock on Sunday, the 21st, I received a copy of your note to General Ewell, directing him to hold himself in readiness to take the offensive at a moment’s notice, to be supported by my brigade. This order caused me to move nearer to Ewell’s position, where, after waiting about two hours, another order was received through Ewell to resume our former places. Up to this time the firing was comparatively slow. About 12 o’clock m., or a few minutes sooner, the firing on our left became very heavy. About 2 o’clock p. m. I received a copy of a note from you to General Jones, dated at a point one mile south of Union Mills, directing me, among other movements, to repair to you.
I immediately marched in the direction of the firing, and on my arrival at Camp Walker received the first order directed to myself. This was a verbal one, requiring me to hasten forward as soon as possible. The march from thence to Lewis’ house was made in good time. The brigade was halted there by order of General Johnston, and did not participate in the fight, as the enemy commenced to retreat within a few,moments after my arrival. I ordered Walker’s rifled guns to fire at the retreating enemy, and Scott’s cavalry to join in the pursuit. The fire of the former was exceedingly accurate, and did much execution, and

Report of Col. Wade Hampton, commanding Hampton Legion.
Headquarters Hampton Legion,
Camp Johnson, Broad Run, July 29, 1861.
General : I have the honor to report that with six hundred infantry of my command I reached Manassas on the morning of the 21st, after thirty hours’ detention on the cars from Richmond. In obedience to orders to take position in the direction of stone bridge, ready to support any of the troops engaged in that quarter, I advanced with six infantry companies to Lewis7 house, the headquarters of General Cocke. On my way to this point a scout informed me that the enemy in great force had turned our left flank and were rapidly advancing. I immediately turned to my left at a right angle to the course I had been pursuing, and guided by the sound of a heavy fire which had just opened, marched towards their advancing lines.
Finding one of our batteries engaging the enemy, I took position to support it and remained for some time near it, but seeing that the enemy were closing in on my right flank, I moved forward to a farm house belonging to a free negro named Robinson, and took possession of the ground immediately around it. After being exposed to a heavy fire from Ricketts’ battery and musketry, I formed my men on the turnpike road leading to stone bridge in front of the farm-yard. A large body of the enemy, who were in advance of the main column, and who were within two hundred yards of the turnpike, opened fire on me as the line was formed. Under this fire Lieut. Col. B. J. Johnson fell, and in his fall the service sustained a great loss, while the Legion has met with an irreparable misfortune. He fell as, with the utmost coolness and gallantry, he was placing our men in position. In his death Carolina is called to mourn over one of her most devoted sons. As soon as my men came into position they returned the fire of the enemy and drove them back with loss into the woods on the top of the hill in front of us.
Their right wing then opened upon us, but after a brisk exchange of fire they retreated and planted a battery in the position they had just left. After this had played upon us for some time a strong force was thrown out, apparently with the view of charging upon us, but a single volley dispersed them in great confusion. They then formed beyond the crest of the hill and moved down to the turnpike on my left flank out of the range of my rifles. As soon as they reached the road they planted a battery in it, enfilading my position. As I was entirely exposed, I made my men fall back and form over the brow of the hill, where they were protected from the fire of the guns but not from that of the rifles. Here we were attacked by a column which came from the direction of the headquarters of General Evans, almost on our right, and we were nearly

surrounded, the enemy being on three sides of us, and Generals Bee and Evans having both advised me to fall back, I gave orders to this effect, having held this position unsupported for at least two hours in the face of the enemy, greatly superior in numbers and well provided with artillery.
A short time before we retired, General Evans and Bartow, with the remnants of their commands, came upon the ground, joined with us in our fire on the enemy, and fell back with us. My men retired in good order to the hill just in our rear, bearing off our wounded, and formed near a battery (Imboden’s and Walton’s), which was just then put in position. Here, after indicating the place you wished me to occupy, you directed me to remain until you sent for me. The order to charge soon came from you, and we advanced to the Spring Hill farm house, (Mrs. Henry’s) under a heavy fire of cannon and musketry. In the face of this my men advanced as rapidly as their worn-out condition would allow, and after delivering a well-directed fire, I ordered them to charge upon the battery under the hill.
In leading this charge I received a wound which, though slight, deprived me of the honor of participating in the capture of the guns which had done us so much injury during the day. After being wounded I gave command of the Legion to Capt. James Conner, the senior officer present. He formed the Legion on the right of the regiment of Colonel Withers (Eighteenth Yirginia), advanced directly upon the battery, passing by the right of the farm house down upon the two guns, which were taken. Captain Ricketts, who had command of this battery, was here wounded and taken prisoner. The enemy being driven back at all points, began to retreat before the forces which were rapidly brought up, and in the pursuit which followed the Legion joined, advancing two miles beyond the stone bridge.
The death of Colonel Johnson in the early part of the day having deprived me of the only field officer who was on the ground, I was greatly embarrassed in extending the necessary orders, and but for the constant and efficient assistance given to me by my staff officers in the extension of these orders, my position would have been rendered as critical as it was embarrassing.
The unflinching courage of the brave men who sustained their exposed and isolated position under the trying circumstances of that eventful day inspires in me a pride which it is due to them I should express in the most emphatic terms, under the terrible uncertainty of the first half hour as to the positions of both friend and foe. Compelled irequently during the day from the same cause to receive an increasing fire from different quarters while they withheld their own, the self-devotion of these faithful soldiers was only equaled by the gallantry of the officers whom they so trustingly obeyed. To the officers and men who followed and upheld our flag steadfastly during the bloody fight which resulted so gloriously to our army I beg to express my warmest thanks. Their conduct has my unqualified approbation, and I trust it has met the approval of their general commanding.
I regret to report a loss of fifteen killed upon the battle-field, four since dead, one hundred wounded, and two missing.
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WADE HAMPTON,
Colonel, Commanding Legion.
Brigadier-General Beauregard,
Commanding Army of the Potomac.

One 30-pounder Parrott gun, with 300 rounds of ammunition; 9 10-pounder Parrott guns, with 100 rounds of ammunition each; 3 6-pounder brass guns, with 100 rounds of ammunition each; 312-pounder brass howitzers, with 100 rounds of ammunition each; 2 12-pounder boat howitzers, with 100 rounds of ammunition each; 9 James rifled, with 100 rounds of ammunition each, field pieces; 37 caissons; 6 traveling forges ; 4 battery wagons, splendidly equipped; 64 artillery horses, with harness; 500,000 rounds small-arm ammunition; 4,500 sets of accouterments, cartridge boxes, &c. ; 4,000 muskets.
No accurate return of drums, swords, pistols, knapsacks, canteens, bridles, &c., can be obtained. One 6-pounder gun and one 12-pounder howitzer were found spiked, but they were easily withdrawn. One of the enemy’s caissons exploded in the field in addition to those captured.
Hospital equipments turned in up to August 16, 1861: 5 medicine chests, partially filled; 6 cases surgical instruments; two sets of panniers, 7 ambulances.
Returns of litters, instruments, supplies, &c., are all very incomplete, so much having been appropriated by surgeons of regiments, &e., besides the loss from plundering by privates and citizens.
Quartermaster’s stores turned in up to August 16, 1861: 870 axes, spades, and intrenching tools; 2 sets carpenters’ and blacksmiths’ tools; 12 sets harness; 23 extra traces for artillery; 7 platform and other scales; 1,650 camp cooking utensils; 2,700 camp mess utensils; 302 pairs pantaloons, drawers, and socks; 700 blankets; 22 tents and flies; 21 wagons, 33 horses, 25 trunks and carpet-bags; 1 coil of rope.
Incomplete returns of many miscellaneous articles, such as bed-ticks, buckets, coffee-mills, halters, picket-pins, saddles and bridles, ten barrels commissary stores, and a few handcuffs left from a large lot captured, but carried off by individuals as trophies.
Abstract of prisoners and wounded of enemy sent to Richmond and the hospitals at other places since July 21, 1861: Prisoners not wounded sent to Richmond, 871; prisoners wounded sent to hospitals, 550. Total, 1,421.
These prisoners represent themselves as belonging to 47 different volunteer regiments, 9 regiments of Regular Army, and the Marine Corps. Besides these regiments, in the reports and orders of the enemy are mentioned by name one regiment of volunteers and companies from two regiments of regulars in Hunter’s division, six volunteer regiments in Miles’ division, and Runyon’s entire division of at least five regiments from New Jersey, from which we have neither prisoners nor wounded, giving as his entire force fifty-nine volunteer regiments and detached companies and battalions from marines and eleven regular regiments. From the most reliable data his volunteer regiments averaged 900 men each, making in all 63,000 men.

No. 123.
Report of Capt. John F. Lay, commanding Squadron of Cavalry, of operations July 18 and 21.
Camp Pickens, Va., August 15,1861.
Colonel : I am ordered to make a report of the operations of my command upon July 18 and 21 upon the field. I have omitted to do so hitherto simply from the fact that 1 did not know it was expected of me.
Acting immediately under the orders of the general commanding, on the morning of the 18th, with my command—consisting of my own company (the Powhatan Troop) and the Little Fork Bangers, commanded by Capt. K. E. Utterback—I acted as an escort to the general commanding to the field, and took position some 400 yards west of McLaws’ house, and there remained until some hour or two after the firing commenced, during which time I had to change my position, then directly in range of the long Parrott gun, the shell of which were falling about us and in full view, I thought, of the enemy’s position. When the firing at Mitchell’s Ford commenced I moved by order with the general to a position near that ford, and during the day acted immediately under his orders, transmitting orders to the various commands.
By order I dispatched Captain Utterback with his company to report to General Longstreet, to aid in the pursuit when the enemy were retiring, which order was promptly obeyed, but not fully carried out, as immediately afterwards the order for the pursuit was countermanded.
That night I returned with the general to camp, and during the intervening days was actively occupied in the transmission of orders to various points, among others dispatching three couriers under a forced and rapid ride to Piedmont at night to communicate with General Johnston’s command. In this ride a very valuable horse was seriously injured.
On the morning of the 21st I early received orders, and marched as an escort to the general commanding with the same command as before to a position upon the road near to Mitchell’s Ford. From this position I was ordered to fall back, owing to a fire from the same long-range gun, attracted, doubtless, by the dust from the cavalry and wagons upon the road. From this point I dispatched various orders to commanders at different points, and then with my command moved with the general to a position near Lewis’ house, when it was ascertained the enemy were making their flank movement in that direction, when I was stopped by order of the general, through his aides, and remained in position during the day, furnishing, under orders, couriers to different commands, guides into position for batteries and regiments, and mounting aides and other officers when ordered to do so.
During the morning, the cavalry being ordered to fall back from this position, in the absence of any immediate commander I reported to Colonel Munford, in command of the cavalry forces near me, and acted under his orders until I could dispatch a messenger to receive orders from the general or one of his aides. By order of Colonel Munford, Captain Payne, of the Black Horse [Cavalry]; Ball, of the Chesterfield Troop, and myself, selected a position for the cavalry, and there remained in formation ready for instant movement, when I received orders to resume my former position under the hill southwest of Lewis? house. From this position I sent off couriers as desired. By request of an aide I sent my surgeon with two men and a horse to aid in the recovery of the body of General Bartow. In this effort they were unable to succeed, owing to a heavy advancing fire, this aide properly

refusing to permit them to go in. Here I lost a horse, but have since recovered him, slightly wounded in the foot. Here, by order of General Johnston, I was successfully engaged for two hours in rallying stragglers from infantry commands and sending them to him, who reformed them under the hill below Lewis’ house.
When the order for the pursuit was given I was in advance of the main body of the cavalry, and started off with Colonel Chesnut, with orders, however, to report to General Beauregard. Before reaching the Warren ton turnpike, below Fairfax House, not finding the general, and learning that he was on [the] other side of the run road, I asked permission to go on, which was granted by Colonel Chesnut, he stating his purpose to accompany me. We were starting upon the main road to Centreville, when a messenger from the adjutant-general ordered me to the left, to disperse a body then apparently forming, but which proved to be of our own men. From this point I advanced beyond the ford at Sudley, taking and paroling prisoners and aiding Colonel Jordan in caring for the wounded at or near that point, and with him returned to camp with men and horses much wearied and exhausted.
I lost no men from my command. One horse, while his rider, acting as guide to a battery, was taking down a fence, was struck by a shell and instantly killed. Two others, while on active courier duty, died from heat and exhaustion; others are permanently injured, I fear.
In conclusion, my officers and men were cool and composed, ready promptly to obey all orders; most of them under fire repeatedly during the day; some of them constantly with the general in his exposure, and with his aide, Colonel Chisolm. I had no opportunity other than to discharge those duties assigned me, which I hope were as efficient as they were cheerfully rendered.
Respectfully,
JOHN F. LAY,
Captain, Commanding Squadron of Cavalry.

Report of Capt. Edgar Whitehead, Radford1 s Rangers, of pursuit July 22.
Centreville, July 28,1861.
Sir : On the morning of the 22d instant I was ordered by General Longstreet to accompany Colonel Terry, of Texas, and pursue the enemy, and find out their exact position. On reaching Centreville we found the main body had fled, and we pursued the stragglers, taking twenty-five or thirty prisoners on the route to Fairfax Court-House, where Colonel Terry shot down the United States flag and placed the stars and bars on the top of the court-house. The large flag sent back by him was intended, we learned, to be put up at Manassas. Another was taken from the courthouse, and the third one, to which you probably refer, was taken from some soldier by Private R. L. Davies, of my company, who had it in a haversack—no doubt to be raised on the first captured battery taken. It had no staff, but was carried carefully wrapped in the haversack.
Yery respectfully,
EDGAR WHITEHEAD, Captain Company E, Radford1 s Rangers. Col. Thomas Jordan, Assistant Adjutant-General, Manassas.
For particulars in regard to horses, wagons, guns, and ready-made clothing, see Colonel Terry’s note to General Longstreet.*

Congratulatory proclamation of Generals Johnston and Beauregard.
Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
Manassas, Pa., July 25, 1SG1.
Soldiers of the Confederate States:
One week ago a countless host of men, organized into an army, with all the appointments which modern art and practical skill could devise, invaded the soil of Virginia. Their people sounded their approach with triumphant displays of anticipated victory. Their generals came in almost royal state 5 their great ministers, senators, and women came to witness the immolation of our army and the subjugation of our people, and to celebrate the result with wild revelry.
It is with the profoundest emotions of gratitude to an overruling God, whose hand is manifest in protecting our homes and our liberties, that we, your generals commanding, are enabled, in the name of our whole country, to thank you for that patriotic courage, that heroic gallantry, that devoted daring, exhibited by you in the actions of the 18th and 21st, by which the hosts of the enemy were scattered and a signal and glorious victory obtained.
The two affairs of the 18th and 21st were but the sustained and continued effort of your patriotism against the constantly-recurring columns of an enemy fully treble your numbers, and their efforts were crowned on the evening of the 21st with a victory so complete, that the invaders are driven disgracefully from the field and made to fly in disorderly rout back to their intrenchments, a distance of over thirty miles.
They left upon the field nearly every piece of their artillery, a large portion of their arms, equipments, baggage, stores, &c., and almost every one of their wounded and dead, amounting, together with the prisoners, to many thousands. And thus the Northern hosts were driven from Virginia.
Soldiers, we congratulate you on an event which insures the liberty of our country. We congratulate every man of you whose glorious privilege it was to participate in this triumph of courage and truth—to fight in the battle of Manassas. You have created an epoch in the history of liberty, and unborn nations will call you blessed. Continue this noble devotion, looking always to the protection of a just God, and before the time grows much older we will be hailed as the deliverers of a nation of ten millions of people.
Comrades, our brothers who have fallen have earned undying renown upon earth, and their blood, shed in our holy cause, is a precious and acceptable sacrifice to the Father of Truth and of Eight. Their graves are beside the tomb of Washington 5 their spirits have joined with his in eternal communion. We will hold fast to the soil in which the dust of Washington is thus mingled with the dust of our brothers. We will transmit this land free to our children, or we will fall into the fresh graves of our brothers in arms. We drop one tear on their laurels and move forward to avenge them.
Soldiers, we congratulate you on a glorious, triumphant, and complete victory, and we thank you for doing your whole duty in the service of your country.

Report of Col. Robert Johnston, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters of Cavalry,
Cocldetown, Fa., July 19, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that a volunteer scout, consisting of Private W. Causey, Old Dominion Dragoons; Colonel Sandidge and son, and Mr. Ferrett, of Louisiana, attached to the Charles City Cavalry, returned to my camp this morning, bringing in as prisoners Capt. E. W. Jenkins and Lieut. R. M. Shurtleff, both of the Naval Brigade.
They met near the New Market Bridge a party of six, supposed to have been annoying our pickets; killed one, who the prisoners state was Major Rawlings; wounded the two brought in, and put the rest to flight. Upon the person of one was found, upon examination, a lot of ammunition, identified as the property of a member of my command. They were met by the surgeon of this post and every attention given. The captain is very seriously wounded, the lieutenant only slightly, and will be sent to you to-morrow. Two guns taken from them are in my possession.

Report of Col. Robert Johnston, 0. 8. Army.
Headquarters of Cavalry,
Cocldetown j Fa., July 20,1861.
Major : I regret to have to report the loss of the horses of the picket on the Back River road last evening just before the time for the picket to fall back to the position assigned it for the night. No blame is to be attached to the private in charge or to any person connected with it. This picket has orders to dismount, and, leaving their horses, to take a position in advance of them during the day. The position occupied by them can be approached to within a short distance through the woods between the Back River and the Sawyer Swamp road. It was in this way that the horses were taken. A large party of the enemy came through the woods from a point on Sawyer Swamp road to within a short distance of where the picket was stationed, and then approached the horses by file from the rear under cover of a ditch brush fence and got over the fence just where the horses were. Fortunately they were seen by our picket as they cleared the fence, who were thus enabled to make their escape by the river side. Had they attempted to escape on the other side in the direction of the woods they would have been taken, as the enemy seemed to have expected their escape on that side and searched for them there. *
The enemy were in force, probably 300 strong, and came out to avenge the death of Captain Jenkins, who they supposed had been killed yesterday. They visited Dr. Semple’s farm, but committed no depredations,

and have returned. I have felt constrained to draw the picket back to near Dr. Semple’s, whence an occasional vedette will move down the road. The enemy is well provided with guides, and can learn the road as well as we can. If this picket were cut off an infantry force could cross the Bethel Creek on the mill-dam below the bridge, and come direct to my camp through the woods without being discovered. I sent out two small parties last night, Captain Curtis with thirty infantry to near Lee’s store, and a detachment of thirty dragoons to light campfires in the woods at Bethel and to lie in ambush below on the Sawyer Swamp road. As soon as I can I should like to confer with the general in relation to my command.

Report of Col. Robert Johnston, C. 8. Army.
Headquabtebs Fobces fbom Cockletown,
Half-Way House, Va., July 25,1861.
Majob : I have the honor to report that I returned to this point yesterday, after occupying Bethel for a few hours, the Messex picket having reported that the enemy had landed in force from nine barges in their vicinity. These barges were towed by two armed steam-tugs under way at this point. I was informed that a detachment of the enemy’s forces were occupying a position almost two miles from their boats. Judging them to be in large force, and thinking that perhaps the movement might be a combined one with a party from Newport News or Hampton, I established my headquarters at this point and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Camming to join me here, and detached Lieutenant-Colonel Hood, with two guns, a squadron of cavalry, and Colonel Bight-or’s battalion, and five companies of Colonel Cumming’s regiment, under Captain Hardee, to look out [for] this party.
Colonel Hood returned this morning. He found that the enemy had burnt a number of vessels and towed out others, one known to be the property of Mr. Booker, which was loaded with Mr. Booker’s effects and was to have dropped down the river last night. The enemy left before dark, and had succeeded in getting out of the river, except one steam-tug, which got aground before dusk and was detained until the high tide, but got out before he could fire on it.
I strengthened my picket at Messex Point and established one near New Market Bridge. This picket was not permitted to take its position. It was driven beyond its horses by a strong picket of the enemy, but returned at 12 o’clock and brought off its horses, which had not been discovered by the enemy.
Owing to the fatigue my soldiers had undergone and the difficulties occasioned by the quartermaster’s and commissary departments, I have remained in camp here during the day with my infantry and artillery, the cavalry being at Bartlett’s to obtain forage. I expect to occupy Bethel, where I shall endeavor to secure the negroes in the lower part of the peninsula and to carry out your instructions in relation to this

Sir : The President is informed that threats are made, and measures taken, by unlawful combinations of misguided citizens of Maryland to prevent by force the transit of United States troops across Maryland, on their way, pursuant to orders, to the defense of this capital. The information is from such sources and in such shape that the President thinks it his duty to make it known to you, so that all loyal and patriotic citizens of your State may be warned in time, and that you may be prepared to take immediate and effective measures against it.
Such an attempt could have only the most deplorable consequences; and it would be as agreeable to the President as it would be to yourself that it should be prevented or overcome by the loyal authorities and citizens of Maryland, rather than averted by any other means.

The Military Department of Washington is extended so as to include, in addition to the District of Columbia and Maryland, the States of Delaware and Pennsylvania, and will be commanded by Major-General Patterson, belonging to the volunteers of the latter State.
The major-general will, as fast as they are mustered into service, post the volunteers of Pennsylvania all along the road from Wilmington, Del., to Washington City, in sufficient numbers and in such proximity as may give a reasonable protection to the lines of parallel wires, to the road, its rails, bridges, cars, and stations.

Have you received General Orders, No. 3, sent by telegraph this afternoon? Major Porter, A. A.

Answer by telegraph.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Philadelphia, April 19,1861. Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, Commanding U. S. Army:
My Dear General: I have orders to march and am intensely anxious to be with and support you, but a very large proportion of my men are without muskets, all are without ammunition, service clothing, greatcoats, blankets, knapsacks, haversacks, canteens, &c., and it is impossible to get them except from the Frankford and Gray’s Ferry Arsenals, where there is abundance of everything. Mr. Dayton, of New Jersey, has telegraphed General Cameron to supply these things. I implore you to go to the Secretary and have an order sent for a full supply. If you cannot get for ten thousand, get for five thousand men. It seems very strange that the people of the South seize the Government property to carry on rebellion, and the men of the North cannot get it to defend the flag of the Union. The law of necessity overrides all laws; we must have arms, ammunition, clothing, and equipments. The State authorities say that if the Government requires it, the State will pay for the clothing at cost price, and the stock can be replenished. Please attend to this at once, and I can have 5,000 men in Washington in five days. General Cadwalader is as decided as I am that our men shall not be made inmates of hospitals for want of comfortable garments, which the Government has at our doors, and which may be taken by others. Say to my good friend the Secretary I entreat him not to hesitate. The moment, the peril of the capital, and the necessities of the case fully justify him in making the order.
Faithfully, yours,

Hon. S. Cameron :
Sir : Since I saw you in Washington last I have been in Baltimore City laboring, in conjunction with the mayor of that city, to preserve peace and order, but I regret to say with little success. IJp to yesterday there appeared promise, but the outbreak came; the turbulent passions of the riotous element prevailed ; fear for safety became reality ; what they had endeavored to conceal, but what was known to us, was no longer concealed, but made manifest; the rebellious element had the control of things. We were arranging and organizing forces to protect the city and preserve order, but want of organization and of arms prevented success. They had arms; they had the principal part of the organized military forces with them, and for us to have made the effort, under the circumstances, would have had the effect to aid the disorderly element. They took possession of the armories, have the arms and ammunition, and I therefore think it prudent to decline (for the present) responding affirmatively to the requisition made by President Lincoln for four regiments of infantry.
With great respect, I am, your obedient servant,

My Dear General: There has been no arrival from the North. Some one or more bridges have been destroyed; where it is not known; telegraph interrupted. Warford has sent by horses along the road to find where the trouble is; will send me and General Keim with his staff through by an express train, if locomotives are on the north side of the track.
This road must be under military control at once, and in charge of the Government. So must the road between here and Washington. This is absolutely indispensable. Our rapid communication with the North is otherwise cut off. Troops coming on your road could leave it about three miles from Baltimore, and by a march of five miles reach the Washington road some two and a half miles from the city on the Washington road. This would avoid the city. But the city must be under the Government control. You should not rely upon any sending dispatches. Trusty agents should keep you informed, and carry your directions. Depend upon it, a vigorous and efficient plan of action must be decided on and carried out, or we will have to give up the capital.
The communication with the South is perfect both by railroad and telegraph, and we must have the same, or we are gone. No arrivals from Philadelphia or New York, and no information. Rumor says the bridge across the Gunpowder is destroyed, and also a bridge some six or eight miles out of the city. The Northern Central should be the base of operations, and the communications by water be kept open. Havre

de Grace, it seems to me, is a point at which our Pennsylvania troops might concentrate with advantage, as from there they could reach here by water or Annapolis by rail. We could keep the railroad open easy from the east bank of the Susquehanna.
Let there be prompt action. Let the Government as soon as possible take possession of the railroad necessary to keep open communication with Washington. Take, if necessary, tow steamers here for transporting troops by water. A few thousand men with artillery on the high grounds about this city would secure it to us.

To the Officer [in command]:
War Department, April 21,1861.
The President, with a desire to gratify the mayor of Baltimore, who fears that bloodshed would unnecessarily result from the passage through that city of the troops from Pennsylvania at this moment on the way, directs that they shall return to York, in Pennsylvania. This order refers to the troops now said to be at Cockeysville, Md., en route for this city. It will be obeyed by the officer in command, who will take care to leave force sufficient along the road to keep it safe from depredation of every kind and within his entire control.
SIMON CAMEKON,

Orders:]	Headquarters of the army,
Washington, April 21, 1861.
It is understood that a body of volunteers approaching this city has reached Cockeysville or other points within seventeen or twenty miles by rail of Baltimore.
The obstructions in the railroad within Baltimore and its neighborhood, and still more the unhappy excitement temporarily existing in that city, have induced the President to direct that those volunteers return to Harrisburg, and take the route via Philadelphia and Wilmington to Perryville, on the Susquehanna: thence to embark in steamers for Annapolis, or to proceed down the Delaware and through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in sufficient tugs or other crafts to Annapolis, as Major-General Patterson may direct.
Major Belger, assistant quartermaster, will convey this written order to the commanders of the volunteers in question, and, if necessary, accompany them to Philadelphia and beyond, in order to facilitate the movement. He will also leave directions at Harrisburg to prevent other volunteers from approaching Washington through Baltimore until further orders.

Maj. Gen. B. Patterson:
Sir : The direct communication by rail and telegraph between us is interrupted by many breaks between the Susquehanna and the Belay House, this side of Baltimore. Bor the present Northern re-enforcements can only reach us by, 1st, the ocean and the Potomac; 2d, by the Susquehanna steamboats and Annapolis $ and 3d, by Harrisburg, York, and a point on that railroad nearest to the Belay House, some six miles to be marched over.
Please give your attention to the road up to the Susquehanna, and station a strong force at a point for the protection of transport steamers, if any besides the Maryland, and the embarkations. It was reported yesterday that this steamer had taken on board at that point two regiments of volunteers—the Seventh, of New York, and another, of Massachusetts—and I immediately dispatched a quartermaster to receive and assist them in reaching Washington. We have not heard of their arrival at Annapolis. But the route via Harrisburg is to us, perhaps, still more important.
Major Porter, assistant adjutant-general, was sent several days ago to Governor Curtin to muster in volunteers, and to string them along the railroad in Maryland, leading from Harrisburg toward Baltimore. Please give your attention in part to this line of communication. Communicate frequently the arrival and departure of troops, numbers, and the routes. Employ express when necessary.
I do not know that we can hire a steamer at Baltimore for Annapolis in addition to the Maryland, and perhaps a war steamer may be necessary to escort transports from the Susquehanna to Annapolis.

regiment at Annapolis and the others at the junction; to hold both positions, guard the road, and report to Lieutenant-General Scott for instructions.
I venture respectfully to suggest, for the consideration of the General-in-Chief, that inasmuch as the force at my disposal is entirely inadequate to open the way and guard the railroad from Gunpowder to Baltimore— and as I learn that all the regiments from the North and East are going by sea from Eastern ports I can hope for no substantial re-enforcements from that quarter—it will be best to adopt as our line of communication the Baltimore Bailroadfrom here to Havre de Grace, the new boat of the rail company, with propellers and Government steamers, well armed, to serve as escorts from here to Annapolis. The road from Annapolis to Washington can be protected without great difficulty, as there are no bridges, and a few small war steamers can keep the Susquehanna and Chesapeake clear, and, if need be, aid Fort McHenry and threaten Baltimore, also blockade it 5 the road from here to Havre de Grace occupied and protected; a battery erected or war vessel (steamer, if it can 1ie spared) to command the Susquehanna and cover Cecil and Havre de Grace. All available steam vessels and other craft to be concentrated at Cecil or Perryville, the railroad terminus at the Susquehanna.
The garrison at Fort McHenry should prevent any steamboat, steam vessel, or any other craft hostile (or that the commander has reason to suppose hostile), from leaving Baltimore.
The Government forthwith to take possession of the railway line from Washington to Annapolis.
When we have sufficient troops and provisions, they shall be concentrated at Washington by means of the Annapolis route. The Government can take possession of the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad and the railway lines from Baltimore to Harrisburg, and thereby secure a safe and speedy means of‘communicating with Washington.
These suggestions are with diffidence submitted to the better judgment of the General-in-Chief, who will at once see whether they are judicious or otherwise.
I have also to suggest that in my opinion it is expedient to declare or put the entire line, and ten, twenty, or thirty miles on each side, or the entire department under my command, under martial law; and if the General concurs, I ask his approval, or rather that he will give the order.

Washington, April 22,1861. Major General Patterson, Commanding, &c.:
Sir: Your letter to the Adjutant-General of yesterday, brought by Mr. Hill, came to me this night.
In my letter to you yesterday I intended that the railroad via Harrisburg and York towards Baltimore was more important, perhaps, for re-enforcing Washington than that from Philadelphia to Perryville, &c. That supposition was founded on the Secretary’s belief that the distance from a certain point on the Harrisburg Eailroad to the Kelay House, eight miles this side of Baltimore, was but some seven miles by a good wagon road, whereas there is no good common road between the two railroads of less than thirty miles. This fact renders the railroad from Harrisburg to Baltimore of no value to us here without a force of, perhaps, ten thousand men to hold Baltimore—to protect the rails and bridges near it. This shall be done as soon as we shall have a surplus force over and above what is necessary for the security of Washington. With this information the line for troops coming from the North to this place via Perry-ville, thence by steamboats to Annapolis, and wagon roads, seems greatly preferable} but, besides the want of railroad transportation this side of Annapolis, we have no war steamer, and may not have one in ten days to convoy the transports from Perryville to Annapolis. The embarkations at Perryville you may be able to protect by a strong guard at that place.
The Massachusetts and Yew York volunteers which arrived at Annapolis yesterday debarked, it is believed, to-day, and have commenced their march upon this place. Up to this moment we do not know that the march has commenced. The difficulty is probably the want of cars or common wagons, leaving perhaps a guard of some three companies at the Naval School, Annapolis. The route for Northern troops coming here from Gettysburg by common roads to Frederick, Md., may be worth attention. Besides the troops supposed to have landed at Annapolis, we greatly need ten or twelve additional regiments for this place, now partially besieged, threatened, and in danger of being attacked on all sides in a day or two or three.
With the greatest respect, yours, truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—Camp equipage is much wanted here, the preparation of which is pushed at Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. The same remark is applicable to accouterments.
The public buildings here have already as many troops as they can receive.

As soon as practicable I will send an Engineer officer to make defensive arrangements at these two places.

I have received some copies of an informal correspondence between the mayor of Baltimore and the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and a copy of a note from your excellency, inclosing the same to Captain Blake, commandant of the Naval School.
These purport to show that instructions have been issued by the War Department as to the disposition of the U. S. militia, differing from what I had supposed to be my duty. If these instructions have been in fact issued, it would give me great pleasure to obey them. Have I your excellency’s permission, in consideration of these exigencies of the case, to land my men, to supply their wants, and to relieve them from the extreme and unhealthy confinement of a transport vessel not fitted to receive them ? To convince your excellency of the good faith towards the authorities of the State of Maryland with which I am acting—and I am armed only against the disturbers of her peace and of the United States—I inclose a copy of an order issued to my command before I had the honor of receiving the copy of your communication through Captain Blake.
I trust your excellency will appreciate the necessities of my position, and give me an immediate reply, which I await with anxiety.
I would do myself the honor to have a personal interview with your excellency if you so desire.

Special Brigade ) Headquarters Second Division Order, No. 37. f Massachusetts Volunteer Militia,
On board steamer Maryland, off Annapolis, April 22,1861. Colonel Munroe is charged with the execution of the following order: At 5 o’clock a. m. the troops will be paraded by company and be drilled in the manual of arms, especially in loading at will, firing by file, and in the use of the bayonet, and these specialties will be observed in all subsequent drills in the manual ; such drill to continue until 7 o’clock, when all the arms will be stacked upon the upper deck, great care being taken to instruct the men as to the mode of stacking their arms, so that a firm stack, not easily overturned, shall be made. Being obliged to drill at times with the weapons loaded, great damage may be done by the overturning of the stack and the discharge of the piece. This is important. Indeed, an accident has already occurred in the regiment from this cause, and although slight in its consequence, yet it warns us to increased diligence in this regard.
The purpose which could only be hinted at in the orders of yesterday has been accomplished. The frigate Constitution has lain for a long time at this port substantially at the mercy of the armed mob which sometimes paralyzes the otherwise loyal State of Maryland. Deeds of daring, successful contests, and glorious victories had rendered “Old Ironsides” so conspicuous in the naval history of the country that she was fitly chosen as the school-ship in which to train the future officers of the Navy to like heroic acts. It was given to Massachusetts and Essex County first to man her; it was reserved for Massachusetts to have the honor to retain her for the service of the Union and the laws.
This is a sufficient triumph of right and a sufficient triumph for us. By this the blood of our friends shed by the Baltimore mob is in so far avenged. The Eighth Regiment may hereafter cheer lustily on all proper occasions, but never without orders. The old Constitution, by their efforts, aided untiringly by the'U. S. officers having her in charge, is now safely upossessed, occupied, and enjoyed” by the Government of the United States, and is safe from all her foes.
We have been joined by the Seventh Regiment of New York, and together we propose peaceably, quickly, and civilly, unless opposed by some mob or other disorderly persons, to march to Washington, in obedience to the requisition of the President of the United States. If opposed, we shall march steadily forward.
My next order I hardly know how to express. I cannot assume that any of the citizen soldiery of Massachusetts or New York could under any circumstances whatever commit any outrages upon private property in a loyal and friendly State. But fearing that some improper person may have by stealth introduced himself among us, I deem it proper to state that any unauthorized interference with private property will be

most signally punished, and full reparation therefor made to the injured party to the full extent of my power and ability. In so doing, I but carry out the orders of the War Department. I should have so done without those orders.
Colonel Munroe will cause these orders to be read at the head of each company before we march.
Colonel Lefferts’ command not having been originally included in this order, he will be furnished with a copy for his instruction.

To Brig. Gen. B. F. Butler :
Sir : I am in receipt of your two * communications of this date, informing me of your intention to land the men under your command at Annapolis, for the purpose of marching thence to the city of Washington. I content myself with protesting against this movement, which, in view of the excited condition of the people of this State, I cannot but consider an unwise step on the part of the Government. But I most earnestly urge upon you that there shall be no halt made by the troops in this city.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
THOS. H. HICKS.

Hon. Gideon Welles,
Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. (7.:
Dear Sir : Please inform the War Department that I sent a detachment from my command, with two pieces of artillery, to take possession of Fort Carroll last evening. They were sent by the U. S. surveying schooner Howell Cobb, which happened to be lying at the dock of this post. I also wrote by her to the commissary of subsistence in New York to send me three months7 additional supplies.
I send this under cover to Mr. Ruger, as I am afraid to communicate this intelligence through the regular channel, on account of the sudden and unaccountable change of sentiment in the city of Baltimore.
The Department has been informed of the resources of this place, and must act on what they already know of my condition.
Very respectfully and truly, yours,
JNO. C. ROBINSON, Captain, Fifth Infantry, Commanding.

other States there en route to this city. If cars can be obtained from the Baltimore and Washington Railroad, yon will obtain as many as practicable for the transportation of those troops hither in one or more trips. Consult the naval commander at Annapolis whether he deems a detachment of troops necessary to defend the Naval School, the fort, and any U. S. vessels which may be there. You will next see the commanders of the regiments of volunteers, and request that one, or both of them together, leave the number of companies that may be needed by Commodore Blake for those defensive purposes. On the arrival of a sufficient naval force at Annapolis for its defense, any detachment left behind will be ordered to join its regiment or regiments. You will remain with the volunteers as long as you can be useful, hiring wagons, &c.
I write by command of Lieutenant-General Scott.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—As it is feared that Baltimore cars cannot be obtained to go to Annapolis for the troops, the cars belonging to the Annapolis road may, in many trips, be able to bring the troops to the junction house, and thence probably the Baltimore cars may bring the troops to Washington. Or in the worst case that may be apprehended, the necessity of marching the whole distance from Annapolis to Washington, you will hire wagons, and make all purchases necessary to their wants.
Take care to admonish the troops to be prepared, in landing, to repel force by force, as in war.

Captain Blake and the governor both say that the occupancy of any position at Annapolis by volunteers will be prejudicial instead of beneficial.
Adjutant-General’s Office,
Washington, D. (7., April 23,1861. Commanding Officer, Carlisle Barracics, Pa. :
Sir: The Secretary of War directs that you at once order to this city and put en route the four companies of the Second Cavalry now at Carlisle Barracks. You will see that the companies are mounted and filled to the maximum standard, and fully armed and equipped for service. They will march from Carlisle to Gettysburg, and thence to this city, by the best route, avoiding as far as practicable the large towns, such as Frederick City. If possible, send not less than two officers with each company, Lieutenant (now Captain) Roger Jones being one of the officers so sent. You are directed to make all needful arrangements to render this movement prompt and successful.

To his Excellency Thos. H. Hicks,
Governor of the State of Maryland :
I did myself the honor, in my communication of yesterday, wherein I asked permission to land the portion of the militia of the United States under my command, to state that they were armed only against the disturbers of the peace of the State of Maryland and of the United States.
I have understood, within the last hour, that some apprehensions vrere entertained of an insurrection of the negro population of this neighborhood. I am anxious to convince all classes of persons that the forces under my command are not here in any way to interfere with, or countenance any interference with, the laws of the State. I am therefore ready to co-operate with your excellency in suppressing, most promptly and effectively, any insurrection against the laws of Maryland.
I beg, therefore, that you announce publicly that any portion of the forces under my command is at your excellency’s disposal to act immediately for the preservation and quietness of the peace of this community.
And I have the honor to be, your excellency’s obedient servant,

To his Excellency Thos. H. Hicks,
Governor of Maryland:
You are credibly informed that I have taken possession of the Annapolis and Elk Bidge Bailroad. It might have escaped your notice, but at the official meeting between your excellency and the mayor of Annapolis and the authorities of the Government and myself it was expressly stated as the reason why I should not land that my troops could not pass the railroad because the company had taken up the rails, and they were private property. It is difficult to see how it could be that if my troops could not pass over the railroad one way, the members of the legislature could pass the other way. I have taken possession for the purpose of preventing the carrying out of the threats of the mob, as officially represented to me by the master of transportation of this city, “ that if my troops passed over the railroad the railroad should be destroyed.”
If the government of the State had taken possession of the railroad in any emergency, I should have long waited before I entered upon it.

I thank you most sincerely for the tender of your men, but I had, before the receipt of your letter, directed the sheriff of the county to act in the matter, and am confident that the citizens of the county are fully able to suppress any insurrection of our slave population.

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 21st instant,* and to thank you for the suggestions, which have had my most cordial consideration. I adhere, however, to the opinion, heretofore expressed to the General-in-Chief, as to the line which could be most readily kept open with our present force, and hope that the Government has seized the railway between Annapolis and Washington, with its rolling-stock.
I trust that there are small war steamers in the Chesapeake in sufficient numbers to protect our transports and capture or destroy all armed vessels of the insurgents. Information has reached me from a source which, though not entirely reliable, entitles it to consideration, that they have a steam-tug in the Chesapeake, armed with a single rifled cannon, for the purpose of sinking our transports. She should be overhauled if possible, and no vessel should be permitted to enter or leave the harbor of Baltimore while the people of that city continue to defy the authority of the General Government.
I have furnished four hundred muskets to the mayor of Wilmington, eighty of which have been used to arm Du Pont’s workmen, embodied for the defense of the mills, and the residue appropriated to the organized volunteers of the city, whose loyalty is vouched for by the mayor.

Captain Bussell, of the steamer Louisiana, carried fifteen barrels of gunpowder, stolen from the powder-magazine at Norfolk, to General Steuart, Baltimore. Powder seized by police for the use of the mob. The Louisiana returned within an hour with cannon for the use of the rebels at Norfolk.
The Georgianna, Captain Smith, is carrying contraband articles for the use of the rebels. William Selden (James Biver boat) is employed in same way.
Capt. Arthur Sinclair, late of the Navy, has a steamboat called Beany,% armed with a 6-pounder rifled cannon, cruising off Cape Henry, to sink transports. Steam-tug Star cruising in the bay plundering. Pour rifled cannon (6-pounders) in the possession of the secessionists at Norfolk.
Captain Baker, owner of the Star and Beany, lives in Norfolk, and should be captured.
Lieutenants Pegram and Page, late of the U. S. Navy, are connected with the secession movement.
Norfolk could be held by fifteen hundred men if the railroad bridges are destroyed.
Philadelphia, April 23,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General, Washington:
Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of the General-in-Chief, dated 21st instant, per special messenger, W. J. Palmer. All my efforts have been directed to open the line to Washington by rail from here to the Susquehanna Biver, thence by Annapolis, and from there by rail, believing this to be the only line which could be maintained with the force at my disposal. I hope that more than one war steamer has been put on the water part of the route to protect the transports and sink or capture armed vessels of the enemy.
Two regiments will be embarked immediately for Annapolis, but they are deficient in equipments and their ammunition is unsuitable, cartridges not fitting the muskets in many cases. Great efforts have been made to supply this deficiency, and I hope that it will soon cease to exist.
I have reliable information that 8,000 men are now on their way from New York to Annapolis. Major Sherman arrived last night with his battery, and has been directed to take post for the present at Elkton, Md., supported by 100 infantry. I have no other battery on this side of the river, where one is much needed.
The medical officers appointed to the volunteer regiments are, so far as I am aware, good selections, but, of necessity, without experience in the field, except in rare instances.
It is of great importance that the medical staff should be promptly organized under the direction of an experienced surgeon. I have therefore earnestly to request the General-in-Chief to assign an Army surgeon to my command for service as medical director.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
B. PATTEESON,

Philadelphia, April 23,1861. General Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir : The suspension of intercourse between this place and Washington has caused an intense feeling here in relation to the safety of the capital, and there is great eagerness to rush to its assistance. This anxiety, however, has not been participated in by the military authorities, and as yet there have been but few troops passed through to Havre de Grace. The people of Philadelphia exhibit some mortification that the Bostonians should have got nearly a week ahead of their troops, notwithstanding their greater distance from the scene of action.
After our communication with Washington was cut off via Baltimore in consequence of Mr. Garrett changing his plan of conveying troops through that city from a steam ferry-boat between Canton and Locust Point to the railroad through the streets, I immediately arranged transportation between Havre de Grace and Annapolis for five regiments jper day. It seems, however, that the remaining New England and New York troops have for some reason taken the ocean route, and but few Pennsylvania troops are prepared to move. If the route from Annapolis to Washington City is open, we have transportation facilities now on the Chesapeake equal to the movement of fifteen thousand troops per day to your city, together with any amount of provisions, &c., for their support.
{Sherman’s battery arrived here last night, and could have been in Annapolis to-day. It is understood, however, that it will not leave until to-morrow morning, and then stop at Elkton. We infer from this that you must feel entirely safe at Annapolis and at Washington. Mr. Palmer informs me that you have not taken military possession of the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company and the Annapolis Road. If you have no superintendent fit to control such an enterprise, I would mention Joseph D. Potts, now in Baltimore, at the Northern Central Railroad Office, and T. H. Duprey, here. Colonel Small smuggled himself off without arms against my earnest protest and refusal to send him without them. He, however, got his force back without much damage to it.	1
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. EDGAR THOMSON.
Philadelphia, April 23,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir : Since I wrote my last of this date I have been informed that the Baltimoreans and Marylanders have destroyed the whole of the bridges on the Northern Central. This seems to have been a mere spite action, and must convince the Government that those loyal to the Government in Maryland are in a vast minority. As soon as the capital is safe from attack, it seems to me that the Government should at once turn on Baltimore and place it under martial law, and require that it should pay all damages to the railroads it has destroyed, and to their business.
There seems to be very little vigor in the organizing and dispatching of troops from this place. Who is to blame time must show. There is evidently a great deal of red tape to retard matters. Sherman’s battery, which could as well have been in Annapolis to-day, is still here. I hope you will give them a stirring up. I have provided ample means

of transit for everything that could be offered. The War Department should at once destroy, if it has not already done so, the bridges on the main stem of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad as high up as Harper’s Berry.
There is now a large field for vigorous operations in the vicinity of Washington, without troubling Charleston until frost. Maryland should feel the power of the General Government in a manner that will hereafter keep her quiet, if it does not make her loyal.
After the excitement in Baltimore on Friday last, I saw at once that the only inland route to Washington was via Annapolis or some point below that place as near to Washington, and did not hesitate to make every preparation to send all the Pennsylvania troops and those from the East over it. The movement down the Northern Central, it seemed to me, could not be more easily effected than through Baltimore, via Havre de Grace. To complete the route, military possession of the Annapolis road should be taken at once. There must be ample force at Annapolis by this time for this object, supported by a respectable artillery force.
If you are in want of railway men to control the road, or locomotives or cars to work it, they can immediately be sent down from here, with competent and loyal engine men. We are in for a fight now, and what we do should be done so as to make an impression over the whole country, striking terror into the malcontents.
Yours, truly,
J. EDGAE THOMSON,
President Pennsylvania Central Bailroad.

Dear General : I have only a moment to say the troops have not got round from Annapolis. Butler says he will be here to-day. The New York Seventh decline coming on some punctilio, as I am informed.
There must be no delay in sending the Philadelphia troops by that route, so as to command the road at once. Those coming from the West should, in my opinion, be concentrated on the Northern Central Railroad near Baltimore, so as to force our way through the city if they continue to harass our troops coming round it. The fine counties of York, Lancaster, &c., will furnish supplies, and the march across to the waters of the Potomac is good. These are at present only suggestions, but I beg for them your examination and reflection.

Dear Sir : Mr. Thomson, Mr. Sanford, and myself organized a plan to supply Washington with troops and provisions, &c., by way of Annapolis. A part of this plan was for Fort McHenry to allow no hostile force to leave Baltimore to seize transports. This we have not effected, of course, as we had no means to do it. We want command of the railroad from Washington to Annapolis and of the telegraph. This, of course, the Government must effect. The rest we can do, and are doing as rapidly as we can. We have assumed great responsibility, both pecuniarily and otherwise, but no good man ought in these times to shrink from any amount of responsibility within his reach. It is a question between government or anarchy, and who can hesitate ?

Sir : If this letter should find you not too far this side of Annapolis, I will ask you to consider yourself, for a time, as the commander of that city and retain a competent force to hold it. Next, I wish you to select a regiment (the one of your brigade or any other), and string it at convenient distances all along the railroad, by the junction and towards this city, as far as its numbers may suffice, to protect the road, its rails, bridges, and cars, so as to keep the communication open for troops and travelers between Annapolis and Washington by rail. *
The principal points in the road to be occupied are: the junction, Beltsville, the bridges, cross-roads, and a few of the other stations. Some of the intermediate stations may also require smaller detachments, and every post ought to be instructed to throw out scouts to the right and left frequently during the night and day. If the regiment takes, an the first instance, cooked provisions for a few days, the posts may afterwards be supplied by the trains which will be passing daily. Tents and cooking utensils will, perhaps, be needed at some of the posts or detachments.
Send to this place all the spare troops from Annapolis as fast as you may find means of transportation, and report often.
Very respectfully,

Road wagons cannot be hired or impressed for the transportation of baggage for any part of the route. Instructions have been given for making camp equipage and accouterments as fast as jiossible in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. We are destitute of those supplies here, but have arms.
I wish no troops to be sent hither deficient in essential equipments.
Sherman’s battery, and a company of foot artillery with it, are needed here. If they can be spared from Perryville (and I think they may), send them to me. I wish Maj. W. W. Morris to take command of Fort McHenry. Perhaps he can only reach the fort by water.
Surgeon Tripler, from Newport, Ky., has been ordered to join you.
Assume command of Maj. F. J. Porter, assistant adjutant-general, sent hence to Harrisburg on duty, as you were informed at the time.
Yours, very respectfully,

Philadelphia, April 25,186L Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, United States:
Dear Sir : Matters are progressing here satisfactorily. We have ample provisions to transport ten thousand men daily from here to Annapolis, and I would recommend that no more be sent from New York or the East via the ocean.
Any amount of provisions can be placed in Annapolis at very short notice as soon as you direct that it shall be done. Having taken the responsibility of establishing the route via Annapolis, and placing upon it the necessary transports, I should be glad if you would, to enable me to have all the accounts properly presented in accordance with the customs of your Department, send to my agent, R. F. Loper, esq., a commission to act as United States transport a’gent between Philadelphia and Annapolis, the commission to date from April 18,1861. Captain Loper acted in this capacity during the Mexican war, and understands all the routine that the Government requires in such service.
The Philadelphia regiments have not yet gone forward, but I am glad to say that General Patterson is using his best exertions to have them properly equipped, and will dispatch them as speedily as he can. It seems that we have been wofully deficient in arms and ammunition in this city. I trust the difficulty will be remedied before it is too late for our city troops to assist in the defense of the capital.
Yours, very truly,

It is u left to the commanding general to watch and await their action, which, if it shall he to arm their people against the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt and efficient means to counteract, even if necessary to the bombardment of their cities, and in the extremest necessity suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.77
In the absence of the undersigned, the foregoing instructions are turned over to Brig. Gen. B. F. Butler, of the Massachusetts Volunteers, or other officer commanding at Annapolis, who will carry them out in a right spirit,* that is, with moderation and firmness. In the case of arrested individuals notorious for their hostility to the United States, the prisoners will be safely kept and duly cared for, but not surrendered except on the order of the commander aforesaid.

General Orders, )	Headquarters of the Army,
Vo. I.	f	Washington, April 26, 1861.
I.	From the known assemblage near this city of numerous hostile bodies of troops it is evident that an attack upon it may be expected at any moment. In such an event, to meet and overwhelm the enemy, it is necessary that some plan of harmonious co-operation should be adopted on the part of all the forces, regular and volunteer, present for the defense of the capital—that is, for the defense of the Government, the peaceable inhabitants of the city, their property, the public buildings, and public archives.
II.	At the first moment of an attack every regiment, battalion, squadron, and independent company will promptly assemble at its established rendezvous (in or out of the public buildings), ready for battle, and wait for orders.
III.	The pickets (or advance-guards) will stand fast till driven in by overwhelming force) but it is expected that those stationed to defend bridges—having every advantage of position—will not give way till actually pushed by the bayonet. Such obstinacy on the part of pickets so stationed is absolutely necessary to give time for the troops in the rear to reach their places of rendezvous.
IV.	All advance guards and pickets driven in will fall back slowly and delay the advance of the enemy as much as possible before repairing to their proper rendezvous.
V.	On the happening of an attack the troops lodged in the public buildings and in the navy-yard will remain for their defense, respectively, unless specially ordered elsewhere, with the exceptions that the Seventh New York Begiment and the Massachusetts regiment will march rapidly towards the Presidents square for its defense, and the Bhode Island regiment (in the Department of the Interior) will make a diversion or detachment to assist in the defense of the General Post-Office building, if it be necessary.

at their posts during the time of greatest danger. Since a sufficient force has been each night stationed in the public buildings, it is believed the officers generally hold themselves ready, in case of an alarm, to repair at once to their posts to give such advice and aid as they can. Since the assignment was made other officers have arrived, and some have left the city, wilich should perhaps cause a new arrangement to be made:
The staff of the General-in-Chief, General Totten and Captain Fry, to repair to headquarters on an alarm. Gen. L. Thomas to command in Georgetown. Major McDowell, assisted by Capt. J. Y. Macomb and Lieutenant Woodruff, Topographical Engineers, assigned to Capitol Hill. Captain Meigs is now here, and should be the engineer of the Capitol building. Captain Garesche to repair to the General Post-Office. Capt. W. F. Baynolds, Topographical Engineers, to the Patent Office. Captain Shiras to Corcoran’s building, corner of Fifteenth and F streets, where there are public offices. Colonel Earned to repair to Winder’s building. Major Hunter, paymaster, to the President’s mansion. Colonel Stone to command of Executive square, assisted by Captain Wright, as engineer. Capt. W. It.

their eyes to the existing state of affairs in the country. We have been without any response, except request for small matters of detail, while all my orders and wishes of the last week have been neglected. Until the day before yesterday we had not 2,500 men here under arms. Now we shall have enough in a day or two.
The railway from Annapolis to this place, under the direction of Scott, will be open by Monday for the whole amount of business of which it is capable. We shall want very few more troops by that route, but provisions, clothing, and munitions should be hurried here by it.
I have sent an engineer to reopen the Northern Central, and have ordered an able officer of this Department to take charge of the troops that may assemble at Harrisburg, and bring them in immediate connection with Baltimore, to be concentrated where the city can be reached. We must occupy it without delay. I will never consent, if the whole power of this Department can prevent it, that a rebel force shall prevent the passage of our fellow-citizens from coming here unmolested. The authorities of Baltimore have acted with bad faith, and one of the most painful acts I have witnessed was the order for the return of our troops from Cockeysville; but that is past, and now we will amend the error.
The President has given me full power to open this communication, and I will do it. To-day the President has ordered me to raise twenty-five regiments of regulars, and also ordered the erection of a manufactory for arms at Eock Island, 111. This shows you that there will be no lack of energy here. If the officers now in command will not act with energy, General Scott shall be authorized to find others that will.
SIMON CAMEEON,
Secretary of War.
Headquarters Annapolis, April 27,1861.
[General Scott :]
Sir : I had the honor to receive this morning your letter from headquarters, of April 25, detailing me to the command of this city. I am deeply sensible of the honor conferred, and will endeavor to hold it. I had taken the liberty to make dispositions for that purpose before I had the honor to receive your order. I had caused Professor Lockwood, a very competent person, fully acquainted with the locality, to make a survey of its environs. From that, aided by my own observations, I find a water battery, known as Fort Madison, without casemates, which commands the channel, and prepared to mount twenty-one guns, but none are mounted. Everything is ready for the reception of its armament, being left in that condition by the Engineer Department last season; but this in its turn is entirely commanded by a height, upon which there
is an old redoubt known by the soubriquet of Port Nonsense. This was built during the year 1812, and, so far as I can learn, has never been oc-cupied since. This also commands the town and the Naval Academy, where we have established our depots. An enemy there with a gun or two properly used would render our position entirely untenable. I have therefore detailed one hundred men from Colonel Pinckney’s regiment, the New York Sixth, which was here with a force of only about five hundred, to occupy Fort Nonsense, and also a company of fifty men from the same command to occupy Fort Madison and to keep up the communication between them, the distance being a short half mile.
During the past night, as I am informed by the very accurate report of the major in command, the troops were disturbed by signal-rockets being thrown up along the line of the interior road for some miles. Im-

## p. 605 (#621) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-------UNION.	605
pressed with the importance of the point, I have ordered an increased force from the same regiment, so that the detachment is now two hundred men, and have furnished them with signal-rockets, so that in case of attack we can immediately re-enforce them from the academy. I have directed Lieutenant Luce, acting quartermaster here, to organize a flotilla of boats so that we can send re-enforcements at, once.
We believe that we have entire command of the bay through the means of the iron steamers Maryland, mounting four 32-pounders, commanded by Captain Steadman, and the Philadelphia ice-boat, which had been put in the service of the United States, free of expense, by the city of Philadelphia, commanded by Captain Cliisson [?], of the Navy, which also mounts four guns.
My attention was next drawn to the rear of the town. The conformation of the ground there is peculiar, as will be seen from an examination of the maps. A creek runs up on each side of the point of land on which the town and the academy are situated, too broad and too deep to allow the passage of any considerable force, and in the rear of the town they approach each other within the space of less than two-thirds of a mile. Nearly in the center of this space runs the high road, and a little to the right of that the railway. The land is high, and presents natural means for a defense. I have caused Professor Lockwood to mark out a line of intrenchment there, and unless I am directed to the contrary, I shall proceed to throw up a field work to protect the rear of the town. I have detailed for the permanent occupation of this place the Third Battalion of,Rifles, of Massachusetts, Major Devens, 246 men; the Sixth New York Regiment, Colonel Pinckney, 500 men; the Boston Light Battery, six pieces, Major Cook, 100 men; and I propose to add to them the Thirteenth New York Regiment, Colonel Smith, about 500 men; making in all 1,300 men. I believe that I have thus stated the effective strength, and with this, unless better instructed when my intrenchments are complete, I think I shall be able to hold the city, especially as I shall be aided from time to time by troops arriving and necessarily delaying here. There is a distance of about a mile between the present railway depot and the wharf at the Naval Academy at the deepest water. I have caused Lieutenant Hopkins, assistant professor of engineering, and well experienced in the matter of railroads, to make a survey for a fine of railroad, and find it an easy and practicable route from the depot to the wharf. I have also sent to Philadelphia for rails, cars, and workmen, with which to build the roads between Annapolis and the Junction, and I doubt not, if my acts are approved at headquarters, to be able to make a railroad communication without other carriage between tidewater at Annapolis and the capital within five days.
Acting according to your letters of instruction, I have sent forward the Sixty-ninth Regiment of New York, Colonel Corcoran, with directions to occupy the railroad from a point near the depot in Annapolis to the Junction in the manner following: Three men are stationed together, each picket within sight of the other, and once in about a mile a squad of ten men, according to the nature of the ground and the proximity of bridges, culverts, and other valuable points, on which the pickets may rely. It is believed that this regiment,, being about 1,100 strong, will be able to protect the road and the telegraph lines from further depredations.
In order to the operation of the telegraph, as there is no operator here who can be trusted, I have caused my command to be examined, and I believe I shall be able to find therein a competent operator as soon as the wires are put in order. I have also detailed Lieutenant Billings and a squad of twenty-five men to be stationed at a place called Patapsco

Ford, where I am informed the foes of law and order are making some small head. I believe these dispositions will prevent further annoyance to the railroad, and I have received from Philadelphia a corps of competent track repairers, who are now putting a destroyed bridge in order, so that I trust hereafter our communications will not be obstructed, and the regular trains will pass over the road. Acting under what I believed were the instructions from headquarters, I have pushed forward all the troops possible with more celerity than I otherwise would have dictated to Washington. I expect the arrival to-morrow or during the night of upwards of three thousand New Jersey troops, some two thousand from New York and about a thousand from Pennsylvania. These are all of which I have authentic intelligence. I do myself the honor to inclose herewith a list of the troops which have arrived and departed.
I have received what I believe to be authentic intelligence from the information of Mr. [Purnell], of Baltimore, who had the honor to receive the nomination of postmaster of that city, and who is comptroller of the State of Maryland, and whom I believe to be a loyal and true man. He states, in a personal conversation with me, that he has positive information that scaling ladders are being prepared, and that a force is being organized for the purpose of throwing up batteries on the heights, with the intention of making an assault upon Fort McHenry. This information, if true, as I believe it to be, is important.
The steam gunboat of three guns Monticello has just reported to me, and I shall be able to send up re-enforcements or supplies. A list of the stores on board that vessel I have the honor to inclose.
Unless otherwise directed I shall continue to forward supplies with what celerity I may, and troops more slowly and with more comfort to themselves.
Since I commenced writing this dispatch I have received notice from the roadmaster that the track is in good running order, but we are deficient in engines and cars, which I hope to receive from Philadelphia tomorrow.
I had the honor also to receive the order* as to the course to be pur sued in the case of the secession of Maryland. I will endeavor to carry out the orders with firmness and moderation.
Yery respectfullv, your obedient servant,
B. F. BUTLER.

The next step will be by force to occupy Baltimore and reopen regular communications between Washington and Philadelphia by rail and wires. The plan that has occurred to me is, 1st, to advance a column from this place via the Belay House to the Washington depot 5 2d, another column by the road from York ; 3d, the same from Havre de Grace, if destruction of bridges be not an insuperable obstacle 5 and, 4th, to move the principal force by water from Annapolis, and to make the four attacks simultaneously.
I wish you to consider and methodize the second and third attacks, and give me your views in advance on the whole subject.
Nothing shall prevent the occupation of Baltimore by a competent force but the voluntary reopening of free communications by rail and wires through Baltimore and Maryland before our preparations are ready.

Sir : I was happy to receive Colonel Butler last night, the bearer of your dispatches. The latter I have read with interest and a hearty approval.
I send herewith a copy of my letter of this date to Major-General Patterson. [Following.]
If Fort McHenry be not re-enforced, please send thither by some armed steamer from 250 to 500 men, with subsistence for at least sixty days.
I shall be glad to have your views on my proposed movement upon Baltimore, particularly on the part to be fitted out from Annapolis, and which you will probably be required to command.
Though you command a separate department and Major-General Patterson another, a free correspondence between you may be of mutual advantage.
I am sorry that the fleet of transports and provision ships sent from New York did not ascend the Potomac. Major Sibley, principal of the quartermaster’s department here, wishes some of those vessels with troops and supplies to be sent around to him, and has written accordingly. This river is yet unobstructed by hostile batteries afloat or ashore, and is likely to remain so.
A strong war vessel, to support Fort McHenry in case of an attack, is of great importance. If there be one not essential as a convoy to transports between Annapolis and the Susquehanna, send her to Fort McHenry.
If the cars promised from New York arrive, those you have ordered from Philadelphia may be unnecessary.
Having great confidence in your zeal, intelligence, and discretion, I remain, yours, truly,

water of 3,000 might suffice. But it may be, and many persons think it probable, that Baltimore, before we can get ready, will reopen the communication through that city and beyond each way for troops, army supplies, and travelers voluntarily.
When can we be ready for the movement upon Baltimore on this side? Colonel Mansfield has satisfied me that we want at least 10,000 additional troops here to give security to this capital, and as yet we have less than 10,000, including some very indifferent militia of the District, &c. With that addition we will be able, I think, to make the detachment for Baltimore.
The Secretary of War tells me that he has sent a party, not military, to repair the bridge and relay the Maryland part of the Harrisburg ancl Baltimore Railroad to a point near the city. This 1 am sure cannot be done without the protection of a military force. I wish you to lpok to this.
I am not sure that either you or Brigadier-General Butler has re-enforced Fort McHenry. I suppose 250 or 300 men to be wanted, if it be not already re-enforced. If with you, send Maj. W. W. Morris there to command. I shall ask General Butler to send up the men that may be yet needed.
I desire Major Porter, assistant adjutant-general, to obtain from you or the governor of Pennsylvania the means of breaking two bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, somewhere below Frederick, but pause a few days for further instructions, as we may want to use that road in taking possession of Harper’s Ferry.
We are in great want of camp equipage and accouterments at Annapolis, I believe, and certainly here, and we have occupied all the shelter for troops to be found here. Therefore please send no more troops this way without camp equipage.
The Cabinet have under consideration a plan for volunteers of long period of service. Please, therefore, to withdraw your request addressed to the governor of Pennsylvania to increase his quota of three months’ men.
Tell me what you can do, and when, towards seizing and occupying Baltimore.
The quartermaster in Philadelphia has two hundred wagons, and thinks he can obtain as many more in ten or fifteen days. Four locomotives and ten passenger cars have been ordered from New Nork for service on this side of Annapolis.

I have no control over the road beyond Havre de Grace. The Annapolis road is, I understand, managed by an able and efficient engineer, placed by the honorable Secretary of War.

Not having received any positive instructions through the brigade orders of General Butler, when leaving Annapolis, I beg leave to report to headquarters:
I have performed the required duty so far, and am now in complete possession of the entire line of railroad from the point nearest Annapolis to Paint Branch Bridge, with my headquarters at this point, which I reached last evening at 5.30 o’clock. During my march here I found a small detachment of the Fifth Begiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia at Patuxent Forge, three miles from here, and the officer in command, who announced himself as First Lieut. K. Stark, with twenty-seven rank and file, who said he was ordered to report to me for duty and orders on my arrival. I then commanded him to maintain the position he had, describing the duty as it was detailed to me by General Butler, and told him that when I reached my assigned headquarters I should send out a force to relieve his and take him to this place.
At 10.30 o’clock I took five of my engineer corps and proceeded by a hand car to make a tour of inspection of the road, and to visit the sentinels all along the worst considered portion of the road. On my arrival at the detachment commanded by Lieutenant Dufty, of my command, and consisting of eighteen rank and file, and some distance nearer to headquarters than Lieutenant Stark’s, I was surprised to learn that he had passed that point, stating that his orders were not to remain on guard of the road after night. I inquired the direction he had taken, and had no difficulty in finding the desired information, as he told sev-

eral on the road he was going to rest with his men at a given point. I followed up, and found them at a farmer’s house at least one mile from the railroad, and found them even there without guard or order or any military precaution to prevent surprise and capture.
Under the circumstances I ordered him to proceed to my headquarters, where, on his arrival, I placed him under arrest, and his command to do duty in connection with my own, until I received further orders. I would have ordered them back to their posts and placed them under the command of some of my own officers, but not knowing what might be the probable conduct of the men under such circumstances, I adopted the one which suggested itself to me as the safest; but I must say, from my inspection of them on this morning and the conversation I had with them in relation to the affair, that they are a reliable body of men, and had no participation in the affair, except of obedience to orders of a superior.
I beg leave to transmit a report of the strength of my command as reported to me on board the steamship from New York to Annapolis, and also a report of my strength at this point.* My entire command is in a healthy condition.

Sir : In a telegram from your staff officer, Major Hamilton, it is said that no more troops would be sent from Annapolis to Washington for the present. I have suggested that I wished the regiments sent here should be provided with equipments, particularly with camp equipage— tents, camp-kettles, mess-pans, &c. But we want at least eight additional regiments to give security to the capital, besides a surplus for the expedition against Baltimore. This surplus, with camp equipage, might be halted near the Junction, at the Laurel factory, with a guard at the Junction. There is, however, some hope that that expedition may not be needed to open hence the direct railroad communication, through Baltimore, with the North, as Maryland may do that voluntarily for us.

Col. J. Dimick, U. S. A.,
Headquarters, April 30,1861.
Commanding Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort, Va.:
Colonel : Your letter of the 28th instant* was received this morning, and Colonel Keyes7 notes of the 22d# are also before the General, who directs me to give you a statement of the measures known to have been taken to strengthen your command. Ex-Governor Boutwell, of Massachusetts, states that the steamer Cambridge will sail this day from Boston with about 350 volunteers, to complete one of the regiments now at Fort Monroe. The same vessel will take one month7s rations for 4,000 men, and camp equipage for the Massachusetts troops. It is known that you have already a large amount of army subsistence stores now on hand ; the General therefore desires that you continue the charter of the Cambridge, or make a new one, so as to send her here with such of the Massachusetts supplies and camp equipage as are not necessary at Fort Monroe, that the Massachusetts troops here may have the advantage of them.
Your several requisitions have been acted on as soon as received, and the supplies have been ordered, and in some cases increased. Fourteen 10-inch columbiad barbette carriages have been ordered to be sent forthwith from Watertown Arsenal5 and, if possible, twelve 8-inch co lumbiad barbette and twenty-eight 42-pounder barbette carriages will be sent from Washington Arsenal to-day. Captain Dyer reports that he will soon have ready several 8-inch iron gun-carriages, which of course are at your disposal. If powder and cartridges have not already been ordered from New York, they will be furnished as soon as possible. There is no ordnance officer who can be ordered to report to you.
The Secretary of War has been urged to procure from the Navy Department an armed steamer, to insure your supply of water and to guard the approaches from Hampton.
The Quartermaster-General ordered camp equipage, bed-sacks, spades, axes, &c., the 19th April, from Philadelphia.
The Engineer Department ordered from New York, by steamer, the 24th instant, all the supplies required by Colonel De Bussy, with additions, including a large number of sand bags. There should now be three Engineer officers, at Fort Monroe, who can certainly secure the magazine and other works against any such batteries as you apprehend may be erected.
The General-in-Chief directs me to say, in conclusion, that he believes all the supplies you have required are either now at Fort Monroe or will very soon be landed there 5 and he is satisfied that with the force—soon to be increased from Boston—and means at your command, Fort Monroe is by far the most secure post now in possession of the United States against any attack that can possibly be made upon it, independent of the war vessels, the Cumberland and the Niagara, at hand and approaching you.
I am, &c.,
E. D. TOWNSEND, A. A. G.
P. S.—The General says, beg the commander of the naval forces to do his best to prevent the erection of batteries within reach of Fort Monroe.
Respectfully,

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Executive Dep’t, Council Chamber, Boston, April 30, 1861.
Brigadier-General Butler :
General : The propeller Cambridge, Capt. S. H. Matthews, owned and fitted jointly by the State of Massachusetts and the underwriters of Boston, is loading as a transport for the purpose of taking out supplies for the Massachusetts troops (of which a memorandum will be hereto appended), provided at the expense of the State, and intended to be charged to the General Government, which charge will be allowed or not, as the General Government may decide.
You will note that in addition to the ordinary rations we have added a few articles which may be necessary lor the comfort of the troops, for officers’ use, or for hospital purposes. The largest item among these is preserved meats in tin, which ought to be carefully used as a reserve. They will keep for years, are already cooked, and being the most concentrated form of carrying food, may be useful for camp service. I learn this morning that Colonel Jones’ Sixth Massachusetts Kegiment is in great need of these at Washington and the vegetables now put on board. We have added a small quantity of pipes and tobacco. '
The ship will probably have fifty to eighty men to fill up Colonel Packard’s regiment at Fort Monroe, and a small quantity of supplies for our troops there. After landing there she is ordered to proceed to Annapolis, and there land her stores and the company sent to guard them, subject to your orders, and immediately to return here. She can bring any sick or discharged soldiers. Should any change of circumstances arise, Captain Matthews will be directed to use his discretion, and to give weight to any recommendation from you. It is possible that there may be a prospect of opening the Potomac route for transporting stores and troops. Upon hearing from you to that effect at Fort Monroe, Captain Matthews will either await further advice there or land his stores and men there, subject to your orders.
It is desirable to have him back early, as we have more troops getting ready, and wish, if possible, to send them by water. In about five days we shall probably dispatch a small iron propeller, well armed, with further stores, with the contributions that are pouring in for the men dtf* clothing and other things.
The Cambridge has two 8-inch guns forward on main deck and two light guns for her hurricane deck; has a full crew, including thirteen marines, with a good supply of small-arms, and can take care of herself against any pirates on her way back. She will have coal enough on board to get her back here. She ought to reach Fort Monroe some time Friday, if she gets off to-morrow ; the doubt being as to delay in getting her big guns from the navy-yard. She will be considered in the transport service until she reaches Boston on her return.
When sending Colonel Wardrop’s regiment by the propeller Spaulding we put on board an invoice of provisions, estimated sufficient for eight hundred men for thirty days, with orders to use as a reserve. If the United States supply the troops at the fort or your troops with rations, it will only be necessary to have these reserve stores taken care of. They have been carefully bought, and will be worth just about what they cost.
The Cambridge has a quantity of private baggage and contributions for the troops at Fort Monroe, and probably some of your troops, in charge of a special agent. From present appearances there will be much more. It is our present plan to keep two armed propellers (Cambridge, of eight hundred and sixty, and the Pembroke, of two hundred and sixty

[Chap. IX.
tons) running between here and the Chesapeake. It would be great economy if you could get the General Government to form a depot of coal at Fort Monroe for transports to buy there at cost.
Since ordering the above we hear that the Potomac is open and also that our troops at Washington are suffering for certain supplies. In view of the difficulty of getting stores across from Annapolis, we have decided, unless we get other information before she sails, to give the captain sealed orders to go directly up the Potomac after landing at Fort Monroe, with or without convoy of a war ship, unless she gets at Fort Monroe or on the way up other orders from General Scott, whom we inform of her movements.
Should you have reason to suppose that there is very great hazard in going up the Potomac, or have any information bearing on the subject that requires action, please call General Scott’s attention to the subject. You may also be able to send down to Fort Monroe by return transport any important information which would justify Captain Matthews to await at Fort Monroe or at the mouth of the Potomac further orders from General Scott.
Please note that we intend to clear her for Annapolis here, in order to avoid publishing through the telegraph that we are sending Massachusetts troops up the Potomac. The Pembroke, being of iron and more vulnerable than this ship, will be less suitable to go up the Potomac, where she might be exposed to a land battery.
The Cambridge ought to reach Fort Monroe between Friday at sundown and Saturday morning.
Yours, faithfully,
JOHN A. ANDBEW,
Governor.

Major-General Patterson, TT. S. A., Commanding, &c.:
Sir : I am glad to learn that Brigadier-General Butler has re-enforced Fort McHenry, and hope that Maj. W. W. Morris may be soon sent there to command.
We still need eight or nine additional regiments of volunteers to give to this capital a reasonable security against a threatened attack. All the troops which have arrived here have been and are, with the exception of the Seventh New York Begiment, without camp equipage, and several regiments without accouterments.
In those essentials, we are here, and everywhere else, most deficient, although I gave orders to the Quartermaster-General five weeks ago on the subject of camp equipage, and to the Ordnance Department at the same time on the subject of the accouterments, and each order has been often repeated since.

But even witli the same deficiencies, we must have here the additional regiments, some of which, it is supposed, may be spared from those already at Annapolis. To save time in writing, I put this letter (open) under cover to Brigadier-General Butler, to be read and forwarded.
The governor of Maryland writes that it is reported a new regiment from New York, called the Zouaves, threatens to force its way to Washington through Baltimore. This is not fully credited. That operation, if it become necessary, must be duly authorized and methodized in the manner I have heretofore indicated in my letters to you.
With high respect, yours, very respectfully,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Baltimore, May 1,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Yesterday sent our master of transportation to Washington to wait upon Mr. Scott and yourself about arranging for the reopening of business and intercourse between Baltimore and Washington. He conferred fully with Mr. Scott, who advised that he would represent our views and wishes to you, under which Mr. Smith considered it unnecessary to trouble you directly with the subject. We have not as yet received any response. For more than ten years past we have run four regular passenger trains daily each way between Baltimore and Washington, and at least one freight train. We now ask the privilege of running two passenger and mail trains and one freight train each way daily, subject to such supervision as you may deem desirable, and not to interfere with the movements of the Government trains. The interests and convenience of numerous parties in Washington and Baltimore, and we hope of the Government, can be greatly served if you can gratify these requests.
J. W. GARRETT,
'	President.
Philadelphia, Pa., May 1,1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the Army, Washington City:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from the General-in-Chief of two communications, dated April 28 and 29, relating to moving troops upon Baltimore via York and Havre de Grace.
Anticipating the wishes of the General-in-Chief, I have, since the withdrawal by the President of troops placed at Cockeysville, given attention to the demonstrations designed, and have posted unequipped regiments in camps of instruction at points from which they can be easily withdrawn and distributed on these lines of communication, viz: At York, 6 regiments; Chambersburg, 2 ; Lancaster, 6; Harrisburg, number unknown, but probably 65 and in this vicinity, 6.
The impoverished condition of the quartermaster’s department here in regard to tents, canteens, and other camp and garrison equipage and the depleted arsenals, will prevent the execution at an early day of any plan of operations. The troops are not fully armed, and are very incompletely equipped, having but few cartridge-boxes, no canteens, tents, or cooking utensils. Articles ordered for troops in advance will exhaust the supply for the next three days. I have directed these commands to be drilled and made efficient, and by the time they are equipped I hope

[Chap. IX.
to be able to move on Baltimore with an effective force of six thousand men via York and six thousand via Havre de Grace, and have sufficient to guard the road as they advance.
To effect this I request my requisitions may be filled as rapidly as forwarded, or the depot quartermaster here and the arsenal at Frank-ford be directed to fill them direct from me. 1 will keep you informed of my progress and my probable advance in time for concerted action. I shall lose no time, but for success take care not to be too fast.
I have authority to draw good volunteers from this State, but I desire, if regular artillery companies are en route to Washington City, to obtain one to serve as artillery with the column from York.
The railroad companies here, and also via York to Baltimore, are now ready to repair their roads, but the troops cannot advance. As soon as the men are equipped they will be thrown to the front, and in a few days the lines will be in working order. Col. Andrew Porter has gone to York to hasten the organization of that column.
Major Porter, governed by the prospect of being able to use for our purposes the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Road, deferred arranging for their destruction, and sent parties to examine the bridges and a portion of the road. He is informed that the large bridges are each guarded by about two hundred men, and so carefully that they cannot be injured. The road, however, will, under his plans, be rendered impassable for our opponents as soon as desired, and he will act when convinced that the present hopes of submission in Maryland prove delusive.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Philadelphia, May 1,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron,
Secretary of War, Washington :
Dear Sir : You will have learned from others that General Patterson forbids the sale of passenger tickets by the military line. I have given Mr. Scott some reasons why I think he cannot work this line successfully for a passenger route. Mr. Felton tells me that he thinks he could now repair his road from Havre de Grace to Baltimore in four or five days if you would protect it as the work progresses. As this work has to be done, would it not be well to have it done at once ? General Patterson, T learn, thinks it would require one thousand men to protect it. In a few days I think a much less number would answer. He has the men, but needs arms and ammunition.
Looking at the large fleet of steamers at Annapolis and Havre de Grace, with the confusion at the former place, I believe it would save the Government a large—a very large—amount to transport directly by rail from here to Washington. I presume there would now be no difficulty with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. Mr. Scott could soon ascertain this. By the time the road is repaired I think there will be no difficulty about going through Baltimore, but if there is to be, I know of no reason why that question cannot be settled as well now as at any time—perhaps the sooner the better, and before an opposition can be organized or aid obtained elsewhere. Just now the North seems to be spoiling fora fight with Baltimore, and if there is to be one, I repeat the sooner it comes off the better, in my judgment. If you concur in

these views, instructions given to General Patterson to protect the road will set Mr. Felton at work with great energy. Would it not be well for me to secure all the powder Du Pont has for sale if to be had at fair prices ?

JOHN. TUCKER.

J. W. Garrett, Baltimore, Md.:
In reply to your dispatch of yesterday I beg leave to say that this Department will consent to your proposal whenever the railroad lines running into Baltimore from the North and East are placed in such a condition as to admit free and uninterrupted travel over them, and when the U. S. Government can be assured that satisfactory arrangements have been made to enable it to transport through Baltimore, unmolested and without interruption, such troops, arms, ammunition, supplies, &c., as it may deem necessary or desire.
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
Fort McHenry, Md., May 2, 1861.
Col. L. Thomas,
Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that I have made an examination of the means of defense of this post to-day, and that. I consider them inadequate to a successful defense against a night attack or escalade. The top of the scarp wall is within easy reach of ladders of not more than ordinary length. There are no ditches or other obstacles to prevent the march of a hostile force up to the walls of the fort. There are not carriages enough to mount all the guns. There is not one round of grape, and only a few rounds of canister, at the post. More than half the command is composed of recruits who have not been drilled sufficiently to be relied upon in a night attack. I therefore respectfully request that at least two companies of regular soldiers (artillery) may be sent as early as practicable to re-enforce my command ; and I urgently request that a supply of ammunition may be furnished as soon as possible.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. W. MORRIS,
Major, Fourth Artillery, Commanding Post.
Washington, May 3,1861.
John Tucker:
Dear Sir: Your favor of May 1 from Philadelphia is received. General Patterson has been directed to remove military restrictions from the movements of passengers, and to give prompt facilities at Perry-ville and Annapolis for their transfer. Messrs. Felton and Scott now have on the line the steamers Ariel and Warner, both of which are comfortable, quick vessels. In my judgment the sooner the line via Annapolis is perfected the better, it will have a good effect in bringing our Maryland friends to terms.

[Chap. IX.
The administration cannot afford to temporize with Baltimore. They (the people of Baltimore and Maryland at large) mast agree to restore the property they have destroyed, and make reparation for damages, before we can open communication by their city. They must also agree that the Federal Government shall have the absolute right to move troops through their city, or quarter them in it or any part of the State of Maryland. Northern sentiment on this question is overwhelming and just in every respeet. In a very few days Baltimore will be at work reconstructing the works destroyed by authority under color of mob violence. In the mean time see Felton, perfect the line via Annapolis, which will be useful in the future, even after route through Baltimore is opened. The large fleet of vessels should be dispensed with as rapidly as our wants for transportation will admit.
The transshipping arrangements at both points should be well looked after, and be in charge of men that are practical and accustomed to the business. Give your attention to everything in regard to vessels. See General Patterson in regard to powder. It should be purchased.
Yours, respectfully,
SIMON CAMERON,

Headquarters, May 3,1861. Lieutenant-Colonel Scott, Aide-de-Camp:
Colonel : The General desires that the headquarters and five companies of the Third Infantry, now at Fort Hamilton, be sent to this city, as soon as they are equipped, by the route through Baltimore. They are to be filled up with recruits, and to bring their camp equipage with them 5 their arms, and the usual number of rounds of ammunition to be in serviceable order. The authorities of Baltimore, having proclaimed that the transit shall be open for troops to this place, have requested that the first body that comes through shall be headed by regulars. Please inform Major-General Patterson beforehand at Philadelphia when they will arrive there, and he will be instructed by the General in relation to forwarding them. The General wishes their movement to be hastened.

Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, Commanding the U. S. Army;
Sir : Agreeably to the deliberations of last evening I now submit to you the following on the defenses of this city:
1st. On the side of the navy-yard and bounded by the Anacostia Biver, I have simply to say that with ample troops in the city at command there can be no difficulty in crowning the heights on the opposite shore, and affording a complete defense from an enemy approaching from that quarter to attack the city or the navy-yard.
2d. That part of the city between the Anacostia River and the Potomac can readily be fortified at any time by a system of redoubts encircling the city. This is always in our power.
3d. We now come to the city and Georgetown and arsenal, exposed

to the Virginia shore. Here I must remark that the President’s House and Department buildings in its vicinity are but two and a half miles across the river from Arlington high ground, where a battery of bombs and heavy guns, if established, could destroy the city with comparatively a small force after destroying the bridges. The Capitol is only three and a half miles from the same height at Arlington, and at the Aqueduct the summits of the heights on the opposite shore are not over one mile from Georgetown.
With this view of the condition of our position, it is clear to my mind that the city is liable to be bombarded at the will of an enemy, unless we occupy the ground which he certainly would occupy if he had any such intention. I therefore recommend that the heights above mentioned be seized and secured by at least two strong redoubts, one commanding the Long Bridge and the other the Aqueduct, and that a body of men be there encamped to sustain the redoubts and give battle to the enemy if necessary. I have engineers maturing plans and recon-noitering further. It is quite probable that our troops assembled at Arlington would create much excitement in Virginia, yet, at the same time, if the enemy were to occupy the ground there a greater excitement would take place on our side, and it might be necessary to fight a battle to disadvantage.
I know not exactly how many troops we have at command. I presume the enemy might bring 10,000 troops into the field in a short time ou such an occasion. I would not urge any premature movement in this quarter, yet one taken too late might cause much bloodshed.
All which is respectfully submitted.
JOS. K. F. MANSFIELD,
Colonel, Commanding Department.
P. S.—I should have said in the body of this report that I have been in consultation with my chief engineer, Major Barnard, in all these views, and his services have been and are very valuable to me.

Grace or Elkton, with Sherman’s battery of horse artillery, as you may direct.
My wish is that these regulars shall head any movement that may be made, by land or water, from your side upon Baltimore.
The temper of Maryland, which a few days ago seemed to have undergone a very favorable change, is now believed to have suffered a relapse, that makes the movement of the six regular companies alone, by the old mail road from the Susquehanna to Baltimore, as was at first intended, hazardous, if not entirely unsafe, without a large addition of volunteers.
You will therefore hold the battalion of regulars, with the necessary addition of volunteers, ready for the combined movement from the other points (heretofore indicated), which I shall order in a few days upon Baltimore, if the route through the city be not sooner voluntarily opened.
On your/part, I give you the choice to move by land or water; in the latter case, letting Brigadier General Butler, who has his water craft ready, know the day on which your commander will be ready to meet and consult him in Patapsco Bay.
You will also let Lieutenant Colonel Porter, on the York road, know the probable time your commander may be expected to approach the eastern side of the city, leaving the western for General Butler’s approach. Let Brigadier-General Butler and Lieutenant Colonel Porter, as well as myself, know the morning you may appoint for the movement from your side.
I have just ordered Brigadier-General Butler to occupy and support a strong post at the Relay House, on the Patapsco, beginning with a regiment of volunteers. That regiment shall be instructed to take a part in the combined movement.
Exact time must be observed on all sides, to be regulated by prompt intercommunications.
Send the New Jersey regiments here, and we shall want for the capital seven more.
With high respect, yours, truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—Again, another change of temper on the part of Maryland in favor of the Union and a corresponding one in these instructions.
A member of the Cabinet, present at the interview of commissioners (sent by the legislature at Frederick) with the President this morning, reports that the commissioners declare Maryland ready to return to her duty towards the Union; consequently, I ask you to add Pratt’s company, from Mackinac, to the six other companies of regulars, mentioned above, and hold them ready to move through Baltimore on the shortest notice.

I designed to have this matter examined into and the arms inspected by Captain Neill, but his own constant occupation and his now necessary absence have prevented. I now respectfully forward this, to add to my reasons given to-day and previously against moving this force till better equipped for the field. If empowered to draw arms, &c., from the arsenal no moment shall be lost.

Hon. John Sherman has been made acquainted with the wants and the feeling of a portion of the command, and I desire he may have a patient hearing.

Dear Sir : An examination of the muskets furnished to my command by gunsmiths and machinists has demonstrated that a great proportion of them are defective and wholly unfit for use. In tapping the nipples in they have not been inserted straight, and the iron forced around them split. They will not bear a pressure of air, which escapes around the nipple. Numbers of the locks are insecurely fastened, and many of the barrels have flaws and holes in them one-sixteenth of an inch deep. They are also filled in around the nipple with some soft metal. The number thus defective and useless are two hundred and forty-six. The balance are reported to be only in tolerable condition, and if taken apart and critically examined would no doubt be found to be unsafe and useless.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt this day, from the General-in-Chief, of his communication of the 4th instant, relating to the advance on Baltimore. My communication of yesterday, by Major Belger, and of the 3d instant, by mail,* will show that no portion of this command is in a proper condition to take the field. Unless there is greater activity in the Quartermaster’s and Ordnance Departments, I fear it can be moved only by consigning the cartridges to the pockets of the men and without cooking utensils. I cannot, at present, designate a day when the command can probably move, but I will inform you in time to prevent delaying the other columns.
I am informed that the portion of the Second Cavalry, which was to have marched ere this, under Major Thomas, is not to be put in motion till the other four companies are equipped and mounted. If such be the case, I request permission to use such portion as may be prepared to advance with the column from York.
I understand that the Northern Central Bailroad have repaired a large portion of the road without interruption. It may be the design of the people of Maryland to offer no resistance in future, but, if peaceable, the command at Yorkshould not advance till better provided. I deeply regret the troops cannot advance as early as the General-in-Chief would desire and the interests of the country appear to demand.

Dear Sir: I deem it important that our railway from Washington to the Eelay House (within nine miles of Baltimore) should be well guarded by the military department.
The Annapolis Branch is now protected. Colonel Scott, in charge of the railway and telegraph departments, recommends that a regiment (if possible to spare it) be stationed along the line as a permanent guard, say one company each four miles, with tents and equipments complete. This would require eight companies, the two remaining companies to encamp at or near Bladensburg, which it is believed is not a loyal district. With our railway and telegraph protected, we could move this regiment for you at any time on short notice to Annapolis, Eelay House, or Washington.
Our telegraph has been destroyed twice since yesterday morning. We much fear that evil-disposed persons may interfere with tracks and cause serious accidents and delay in many of our movements.
Eespectfully, yours,
SIMON CAMEEON,
Secretary of War.
Department of Annapolis, May 6,1861. Lieutenant-General Scott :
General : In obedience to your command, I have occupied the station at the Eelay House, nine miles from Baltimore, with the Eighth New York Eegiment. I have learned however that a force of two regiments of dragoons had been raised and were in force at Ellicott’s Mills, some eight miles from this point, and I therefore ordered up Major Cook’s light battery, Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, which was with me at Annapolis; and as I was moving Colonel Jones’ Sixth Eegiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia from the capital, I ordered them also here, so that I am here in considerable force, to wit:
Colonel Lyons, Eighth Regiment................................ 1,000 men.
Colonel Jones, Sixth Regiment................................. 600 u
Major Cook.................................................... 100 u
Total......................................................... 1,700 “

[Chap. IX.
I have placed two howitzers to command the viaduct, also a sufficient guard to prevent its destruction, and have occupied the station house at the railroad Relay Station.
An officer has been detailed to examine the trains and stop all armed men, arms, and munitions of war. Before, however, we established a full surveillance of the trains, a squad of some ten or twelve men from Baltimore passed up the road to join the traitors at Harper’s Ferry. These men, before I had heard of it, had put the freight train of this morning under contribution, and passed some eight miles along the road plundering the country people. All such irregularities hereafter will be promptly suppressed.
A matter of some doubt has arisen in this connection. A burden train passed up toward Harper’s Ferry, laden with wheat, whisky (a great quantity of it), spades, picks, and shovels) all these were marked for Virginia. In the doubt, the officer in charge allowed the train to pass until further orders. What shall be done with such freight ?
I learn that I am in the immediate neighborhood of the residence of Major-General Carroll, a gentleman who is most bitter in his hostility to the Government, who ordered out the troops under his command to oppose the passage of the U. S. troops across Baltimore. Two companies of cavalry alone responded to the call from this vicinity. They were commanded by Capt. William H. Horsey and Capt. George R. Gaither, both violent rebels, who have more than once put themselves in a hostile attitude to the U. S. Government. They have conducted themselves with great violence, and in fact are now in arms against the Union, although nominally holding commissions from the governor of Maryland. Can anything be done with them ? Might they not be arrested and at least restrained until we are certain what will be the disposition of Maryland But this is a matter for your better judgment.
I find the people here exceedingly friendly, and I have no doubt that with my present force I could march through Baltimore. I am the more convinced of this, because I learn that for several days many of the armed secessionists have left for Harper’s Ferry or have gone forth plundering the country.
I trust my acts may meet your approbation, whatever you may think of my suggestions.
Most truly, your obedient servant,

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen.) Rdqrs. of the Army\ Washington City:
Colonel: I received last evening a telegram from the honorable Secretary of War, directing me to send immediately to Washington, via York, six regiments of volunteers, but at so late an hour I could acknowledge its receipt only by a postscript to a letter then about to be dispatched to you. I, however, ordered the six best regiments in the department to be prepared for immediate call.
I have now to present, through the General-in-Chief, for the consideration of the honorable Secretary of War, a renewal of my reasons why these regiments should not be passed, without urgent necessity, through the city of Baltimore. I premise my reasons by the statement

## p. 625 (#641) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.]
CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-----UNION.	625
that no delay will result from awaiting a reply to the communication of yesterday, borne by Capt. T. H. Neill, Fifth Infantry. I have been given to understand that it is desirable regular troops should precede the volunteers through Baltimore. If so, the five companies of the Third Infantry should be here. This will not be before to-morrow, night.
Only three of the sixteen regiments (there are more, but mot reported) in this department are supplied with cooking utensils, and only one with tents, and almost all of them rely from necessity upon rations supplied to them cooked at their present location. If withdrawn from those camps without further preparation, they will be thrown for a time upon a community where such resources cannot be relied upon, and the public interests perhaps suffer in many ways.
The troops have but very little ammunition; some of them none; some of the cartridges do not fit their arms, and no boxes are on hand to secure them against wear and weather. Much ammunition has already been destroyed. To supply the troops in advance supplies here have been nearly exhausted.
The bridges on the Northern Central Railroad will all be repaired and protected at the time the combined movement can be made, and all the forces be before Baltimore at the same time.
I have arranged to gather transportation at Perryville on Wednesday. I design that night or Thursday morning to throw ample force into Havre de Grace (which I occupy to-morrow) to be at once thrown forward to Bush River, leaving companies to secure the road. To Bush River and the Gunpowder boats bearing companies will be sent to hold and secure the bridges over those streams, and to Canton, in the vicinity of Baltimore, will be sent vessels to land Sherman’s battery, the five companies of the Third Infantry, and two regiments of volunteers from this city. These regiments will send back on the road to Havre de Grace companies to protect it.
I have given the commanding officer at York his instructions, and a telegram will put him in motion. General Butler will also be notified of my intended movements. The command hence to Baltimore will be under Brevet Major-General Cadwalader ; that from York under Major-General Keirn, having the aid of Lieutenant-Colonel Porter. The movement shall be made without waiting for any more cooking utensils and ammunition than can be procured by Wednesday from such resources as are at hand. The ordnance depot having been closed to me, and the clothing bureau having but a scant supply, and no requisition from Washington (except that one regiment had been ordered to be supplied from Frankford) having been acted upon, I must rely upon what can be procured in open market.
I judge from the telegrams of the Secretary of War that he is desirous to have opened these routes through Baltimore, and, presuming he must be aware of the unprepared condition of the troops in this department, I shall, although advising against it, make this movement, unless instructed by the General-in-Chief to delay, relying upon the Quartermaster’s and Ordnance Departments to supply deficiencies as soon as practicable.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON,
Major- General, Commanding.
P. S.—Since writing the above I have been notified that the clothing bureau will provide the necessary cooking utensils and canteens.

Maj. F. J. Porter,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., IIdqrs. DepH of Pennsylvania ;
Major : I bare to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters of yesterday’s date,* received at a late hour last niglit, in one of which I am informed that the Commanding General directs you (me) to hold your (my) command in readiness to move at an early call from him.
It becomes my duty again to call your attention to the fact that three of the regiments of this division are not only without clothing, but also without arms or cartridge-boxes, camp equipage or cooking utensils of any description, and that there has not been a single cartridge-box issued to any one of the eight regiments of this division. Moreover, I yesterday made a more particular report that the muskets issued some days ago to the other regiments of the division are entirely unfit for service. Most of the springs of the locks are broken, and those that are not will not explode a cap. Some of the barrels are not in a condition to resist a discharge, and the alterations of some of them are so imperfect as to render them dangerous to those who use them, and it is the opinion of a gunsmith employed in one of the regiments, to endeavor to put them in order at their own expense, that a discharge of them would do more harm to those who attempted to fire them than they could do to an enemy in their front.
Under these circumstances, I protest against these men being sent into service with such arms and without the means of protecting their ammunition from the weather. My great reliance upon these men is their confidence in each other. Place them in front of an enemy without arms or ammunition upon which they can depend, and that confidence is gone. I would consider the responsibility which would rest upon me a heavy one wrere I not urgently to call the attention of the Government to this fact. The character of this city, of the State, and of the country, to say nothing of the officers and men connected with the command, requires me officially, as I now do, to place this statement upon record, and to ask for a board of survey to examine and report upon the condition of these arms.
In my former communication I omitted to state that some of the plugs in the vents were easily driven out, and holes in the sides of the nipples had been filled with putty. Many of the threads of the screws were imperfect, and many of the locks are so wood-bound that it is with difficulty they can be cocked.
I sent to you in my report, on the 4th instant, letters reporting these defects from the commanding officers of three regiments of this division —Colonel Patterson, Colonel Lewis, and Colonel Lyle—and I now inclose reports from Colonel Dare and from Colonel Gray upon the same subject. I repeat, that to send these regiments into service with such arms would be to discourage the command, and to give them a want of confidence in their superiors and in their Government.
I am, major, very respectfully, yours,
GEO. CADWALADEE,
Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

The mayor and police of Baltimore will co-operate to prevent any disturbance. A transport is ordered from Annapolis to unite with the steamer in bringing troops.

Colonel : Since my letter (No. 2) of yesterday all hope has vanished of moving at an early day the Pennsylvania contingent in this vicinity. (See inclosures.) I did rely upon the Ohio volunteers to execute the movement upon Baltimore, but there is no force to sustain them, and their condition is no better than that of the Pennsylvania troops. I have suspended the order for transportation, and will renew it only when an efficient force can be raised to sustain the Third Infantry and battery. Third Infantry not yet heard from or of.

P. S.—The horses purchased for the wagon train here are ordered to Washington, and further purchases suspended by order from Washington.
[Inclosures.]
Major : I have said what I could to deter the movement of this force. I now say wThat I cannot officially, that General Cadwalader says if this force is moved without being better equipped the officers will resign. The guns are horrible, *and if a collision should arise the responsibility is fearful. The officers will not take it. I beg and implore that the order to advance on Baltimore will be suspended till General Patterson says move. We must be trusted and relied upon, and God knows neither of us will delay or hesitate to do what is right. The move towards Baltimore should not be made now; but if it be found that it can be done, at however much risk, it will be made.
Yours, truly,
E. J. PORTER.
Philadelphia—10 p. m.
Since the packages w^ere closed to you I have telegraphed for two* Ohio regiments to come here, and shall send them with the force to move on Baltimore. I called them in the hope of striking and stirring up Pennsylvania pride. They (the Ohioans), under McCook, will go forward at all risks. When I wrote the letter of General Patterson to-day I was not aware of any hesitating disposition on the part of any one. I then spoke for him of the impropriety of moving unorganized troops. I forced the plan, and am resolved to carry it out if it be possible, and if General Cadwalader won’t go, will try to push the affair through with those who are not so squirmish. It is true the arms are in a lamentable condition, and I fear to-day’s rain will ruin the ammunition and drive out more patriotism.
If you will authorize General Patterson to exercise his discretion about moving the Pennsylvania troops, 1 think I can push the matter through anyhow. At all events, unless you get notice by to morrow night’s train from here that the movement should not take place, you may consider it going on, and that the command will be before Baltimore on Thursday afternoon. The great uncertainty attending these movements must not discourage you and the General. Volunteers have elements of great inconsistency "to work upon, and I can say I never

[Secretary of War:]
Sir: I have given orders to detain all provisions and munitions of war that are attempted to be passed westward. I have given special directions for careful examinations of the express companies, to prevent them from carrying caps, of which the rebels are in great need. I have not as yet examined passengers’ baggage, although large quantities of caps might be easily forwarded under such designation. 1 await your directions upon this subject.
At first I was inclined to permit, and did permit, provisions to pass into Western Virginia, but I am not convinced of the good faith of those consignments, and I have, therefore, ordered all provisions to be stopped, revising my original order. I have permitted groceries (proper) to be forwarded, sucli as coffee, sugar, spices, fruits, &c. Since I have ;given the order, I have had a very full conversation with the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Mr. Garrett, who expressed doubts as to the policy we are pursuing. He avers that we are receiving much larger supplies of provisions from the West than we can by any possibility cut off, and that Governor Dennison, of Ohio, is most anxious to reopen communications through for the purpose of sending forward live-stock ; that no portion of the trains has been stopped at Harper’s Ferry, and that there may be hereafter no retaliation, and that it becomes important that the miners of Cumberland and Western Virginia should receive supplies from Baltimore, from whence he avers that they receive the most of their cured provisions. Although they have not stopped provisions on the trains at Harper’s Ferry, they have stopped live stock and the sheep, about which I wrote in my former dispatch, had gone from our reach before I received the orders from the Department. At present I am returning these provisions and stores to the consignees at Baltimore, although they would be of great use to the troops at Washington. Sending them back will save complications, but will probably result in their being sent forward by a more circuitous route.
Companies of volunteer troops are passing within about six miles of me daily. I have been in doubt whether or not to stop them. The principal question being, not of our ability so to do, but what we should do with them after we have detained them. I await instructions upon this point also.
Being in doubt as to which office I should apply for instructions, I have forwarded this in duplicate to the Commanding General and to the W ar Department.
I have been called upon by an association of butchers and provision dealers from Baltimore, who desire that an order shall be transmitted from the Commanding General allowing certain cattle, now stopped at Bellaire, to be transported, via Harrisburg, to Baltimore. I see no ob-

’ BENJ. F. BUTLEB, Brigadier- General, Commanding„
Grafton, Va., Ray 8,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington :
Dear Sir : You will see by Governor Letcher's late proclamation that Grafton is made a point for the concentration of the State volunteers. This has been arranged by the secession leaders in order to intimidate us, as this is one of the strongest Union towns in this section of the State. There is no avowed secessionist in our town, and our people are* very indignant at the proclamation of the governor, and are rapidly preparing to resist the entrance of troops unloyal to the Star-Spangled Banner into our town. I saw Mr. Carlile on Monday evening, and he informed me that there would be five thousand stand of arms at or opposite Wheeling in a few days, but unless some arrangement can be made with the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company, it will be very inconvenient for us to get them from there, a distance of one hundred miles. Can anything be done for us ? We are now enrolling men and drilling every day, collecting such arms as may be had, and manufacturing cartridges, &c., and preparing for a fight if Governor Letcher’s troops attempt to occupy our town.
Mr. Carlile opposes our being mustered into the United States service for home protection, but I cannot see why, and I do decidedly favor that plan, and can make a good company here for that purpose if thought advisable.
The Union men of Northwestern Virginia are becoming more firm every day. They want to see secession put down and the leaders hung, and I think, with a very little help and a good marshal, we are now about ready to take those among us. As an evidence of this, Judge Camden, who has been appointed to the Montgomery Congress, is not allowed to speak in his own town—Clarksburg, Harrison County—and in Morgantown, at a general muster on last Saturday, the regiment drove the colonel and brigadier-general (secessionists) from the field.

Sir : Tlie letter of General Cadwalader, dated May 1, with inelosurer on the subject of defective arms and deficient equipments, has been referred to the Colonel of Ordnance. Premising that circumstances entirely beyond the control of the existing government conspired to produce the unfortunate state of affairs represented, I will now communicate to you the remarks of the present Chief of the Ordnance Bureau, for the purpose of showing that it was beyond his power to avoid the. inconvenience referred to by General Cadwalader.
Ordnance Office, May 8, 1831.
Tlie arms within referred to were issued in compliance with an order of 19th April,, 1861, to the commanding officer of Frankford Arsenal by telegraph, per the Ordnance Office, to issue to General Patterson 5,000 smooth-bore muskets. The number of these arms at the arsenal was just 5,000, and no more or no other arms could possibly be issued. When, as in this case, and probably in many others, under the present excitement and pressure, the very best is done that the utmost industry and energy of officers can accomplish with the available means of the Government, such charges as the within are cruel and unjust. This department, and every officer in it, is just as anxious to supply the best arms to all the troops as they are to get them, but it is simply impossible to do so now.

I am under tlie impression that it will be found that the muskets issued to Colonel Morehead’s regiment are better than the others. Those of Colonel Lewis’ and Colonel Gray’s command are, I think, defective, I would respectfully suggest that other arms should be issued forthwith to the two companies of Colonel Gray’s regiment, under orders for Forts Mifflin and Delaware. Knapsacks and cartridge-boxes are very much wanted.
I have to report that there seems to be no prospect of obtaining clothing for the three regiments which have last been mustered into the service, commanded by Colonel Ballier, Colonel Gray, and Colonel Owen, unless it can be procured from the United States and charged to the State of Pennsylvania. No arms have been issued to the regiments of Colonel Ballier and Colonel Owen. It appears that the regiments here are now entirely neglected by the State authorities, wdio are sending everything to the regiments in the interior. This could readily be corrected by public opinion if it was generally known, but it is inexpedient to have such information communicated to our enemies.

also of infantry, you would be able, by causing mounted patrols say of ten men each, passing from Millersville to Annapolis and from Millers-viile to Annapolis Junction, to secure tire police of the road, especially as it has to be passed over by working parties after each heavy train to repair breaks, ccc.—be enabled to concentrate at such points as you may deem expedient, say either the Junction or Annapolis, the small detachments of the Fifth New York, now strung along the road; by which means the discipline of the troops may be improved and the opportunities for irregularities lessened. These are only suggestions. General Scott does not desire horses to be purchased for this service, but if not already at Annapolis, horses may be expected to arrive from day to day, or the men attached to battery of Sixth and Eighth New York might be detailed for this service. The Chief of the QuartermasteFs Department sees no objection for this use of the number of horses specified from those of his department should they be on hand or arrive. The details of this arrangement, if it meet'with your approval, are left entirely to your discretion. This is a letter of suggestions, not orders, so far as relates to this matter.

SCHUYLEB HAMILTON, Lieutenant-Colonel and Military /Secretary.
Belay House, May 11, 1861.
The Secretary of War:
From the dispatch I received from Captain Hamilton I fear that in the haste to inform you of the capture of the steam gun I may have laid myself open to the censure of having claimed more credit than belonged, therefore beg leave to briefly state the facts, viz:
Yesterday I received information of the gun having left Baltimore. I immediately informed Colonel Lyons, who was left in command of the brigade by General Butler, of the rumor. He deemed it unreliable, and not worthy of notice. I did not have full confidence in the report, but still thought it of sufficient importance to be looked after. It was filially decided to send one company from Colonel Lyons7 regiment, one from my command, and two pieces from the light artillery. 1 arranged tor a train (by seizure), and had embarked the light artillery with their horses and the company from my command, and started the train. When the company from Colonel Lyons appeared I stopped the train, and they went aboard. B. B. Hare, esq., a gentleman connected with General Butler’s, staff, volunteered and went forward on horseback, and overtook the gun, which was in the charge of two men, and captured it alone, and with the assistance of the neighbors held it until the arrival of the train. It has been brought into camp, and I shall set some machinist at work to-day to get some knowledge of it.
Your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, I). C.:
Sir: I forward for the information of the General-in-Chief, on a department return, a detailed statement of the regiments blustered into the service of the United States, which are or have been in the department, and the present condition of the equipments.* Eight regiments in excess in the Pennsylvania quota arises from troops having been mustered in at this place by authority and no attention taken of them at Harrisburg. 1 have urged and pressed the equipping of these regiments. The commander of Frankford Arsenal reports he cannot till, before the 2oth instant the orders now in his possession for twelve regiments, three of which are at Chambersburg and three at York. Ho requisition for ordnance equipments for General Hegley’s command has-been received, and Lieutenant Treadwell, the ordnance officer at the arsenal, is, by orders from Washington, providing only for twelve thousand four hundred men, the Pennsylvania quota. I am aware that Maryland has been invaded from Virginia at Harper’s Ferry, but in the present condition of my command am powerless.
I make the above statement that the General-in-Chief may not rely at present upon these regiments in his plan of attack upon Harper’s. Ferry. By Wednesday of the coming week one regiment at York and two in this city will be provided with accouterments. I request to be informed if troops from York are to march through or around Baltimore, and whether the regiments on that line are to be pushed to Washington. The railroad hence to Baltimore will be opened in a few days. I desire also to be informed if there is any objection to using; this route through Baltimore.
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hon. Simon Cameron, Washington :
Dear Sir: I called to-day on Mr. Thomson, as requested, but did not see him, as he is at home sick.
I have discharged a large number of firopellers, and will continue to rapidly reduce the number employed. I shall not, however, impair the efficiency of the route via Perryville and Annapolis until I receive further instructions. But as the route is now open between Philadelphia and Washington via Baltimore, and also between Harrisburg and Washington by the way of the Northern Central, I think the number of steamers plying between Perryville and Annapolis may be still further reduced, say to three or four, unless you wish to continue to make this line the chief route, about which I shall be glad to have your instructions.
I saw Mr. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, on Friday last. I am perfectly satisfied that he will now voluntarily and cheerfully make the road from Baltimore to Washington entirely subservient to the purposes of the Government. He thinks, and Mr. Felton concurs in the opinion, that the troops, &c., can pass through

Baltimore without any danger of an attack. This is the quickest route, of course. I think that both of these companies will reduce their regular charges thirty-three and a third per cent, for all Government purposes. I hope that the Camden and Amboy Company will consent to a similar reduction. If so, I am now inclined to think that this route will be the cheapest, and it will certainly be the most simple way of transacting the business.
I am acquiring information about iron propellers suitable for gunboats, about which I will report to-morrow or next day. Anything of the kind that is required can be built as quickly as it can be procured from England.
Knowing the value of your time, I shall make my communications as brief as possible.

Sir : A few minutes since I received a telegram from the commander at York stating General Butler, on Federal Hill, Baltimore, had sent a special messenger for re-enforcements. At the same time came another from Col. Andrew Porter stating the Northern Central Railroad was insecure and should be guarded by at least two regiments.
Lest the re-enforcements should be checked by an injury to the road I immediately, as I telegraphed you, changed the route of the command to leave to-day to the direct one, and have arranged for General Cad-walader to land at Locust Point to-morrow morning at daybreak.
General Keiin has been directed to secure to day the Northern Central Road, after which other troops, as they are prepared, will be pushed over the route. Two regiments will leave here on Thursday.

Philadelphia, Pa., May 14, 1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,

Sir: This instant (4.30 p. m.) 1 received your telegram of this date stating the General-in-Chief knows no cause for sending as I did troops to Fort McHenry, &c. Explanation, additional to that of this morning (copy herewith), is now respectfully presented.
In the absence of more direct information, the call of General Butler direct upon Major-General Keim, at York, appeared so urgent that I should have been derelict in duty if I had failed to respond in the most effective manner, i. eby sending direct from here, thus re-enforcing the troops on Federal Hill eight hours earlier than by Harrisburg. On Lieutenant-Colonel Porter’s telegram, then just received, that the road was insecure and should be guarded by two regiments before other troops were sent over it, I ordered from York troops (for the first time telegraphed as equipped) to seize and secure the road for future use. Only one regiment was available. I feared if the road was passed over by a portion of the command (insufficient to re-enforce and to guard) it might be rendered impracticable before the passage of troops from here. It is too late to turn General Cadwalader’s command from the direct route.
Your telegram apprises me for the first time that Baltimore is embraced within the limits of General Butler’s department. I was making preparations to advance and take up, temporarily, my headquarters in that city.

WINFIELD SCOTT.
Washington, May 15, 1861. John Tucker, General Agent of Transportation:
Sir: Your communication of the 13th is received, and its recommendations generally approved.
The importance of keeping the line of transportation open via Perry-ville and Annapolis, in case of emergency, is fully recognized and admitted by the Department. At the same time, it is thought best to recommend that the number of propellers on that route be reduced to the lowest number warranted by the circumstances. It is not probable that the route will be employed for transportation of Government stores at present. In view of this you are directed to employ the Central Bail-road of New Jersey and the Camden and Amboy routes in forwarding stores, munitions, &c., to this point and intermediate points from New York. The capacity of those routes will doubtless prove equal to the ordinary demands, should the route via Baltimore remain unobstructed. The work will also be accomplished with greater dispatch, as well as with a great reduction of expense to the Government, as you suggest.
Thanking you for the promptness and conciseness of your report, very trulv vours,
SIMON CAMEBON,
Secretary of War.
Washington, May 15, 1861. Brevet Brigadier-General Cadv7Alader:
Sir : This department is much in want of more troops for defensive purposes. After retaining a reasonable force for the occupation of Baltimore (independent of Fort McHenry), the Belay House, the Junction, and Annapolis, as also for holding and protecting the railroads between those points and Bladensburg, you will send the whole surplus within your command to this place. It is supposed that four regiments will amply suffice in the Department of Annapolis for the foregoing objects.
The headquarters of the Department of Annapolis may be, upon notice, changed by the commander from and to the principal points therein, who will report on the sufficiency of the number of troops suggested above.

Commanding Department of Annapolis, Baltimore, Md.:
Sir : I have already, by the direction of the General-in-Chief, addressed to you a letter and a telegram of yesterday’s date, and have received your acknowledgment of the letter. Herewith you will receive a power to arrest persons under certain circumstances, and to hold them prisoners though they should be demanded by writs of habeas corpus.
This is a high and delicate trust, and, as you cannot fail to perceive, to be executed with judgment and discretion. Nevertheless, in times of civil strife, errors, if any, should be on the side of safety to the country. This is the language of the General-in-Chief himself, who desires an early report from you on the subject of the number of troops deemed necessary for your department.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—The Lieutenant-General desires me to add that he has just been instructed by highest authority to cause Mr. Boss Winans, of Baltimore, now a military prisoner at Fort McHenry, to be liberated on condition of his written parole, to this effect: u I solemnly give my parole of honor that I will not openly or covertly commit any act of hostility against the Government of the United States pending existing troubles or hostilities between the said Government and the Southern seceded States, or any one of them.”

Only one letter found.

of this date. In regard to the number of troops deemed necessary for this department, I have already in my letters of this date expressed the difficulty which I experience in forming an opinion from not having had time since my arrival to visit any other of this department, or to converse or receive reports from any officer in command of troops.
In forming any opinion upon this subject I would be guided by a consideration of the question of a probability of an advance of hostile troops, of which probability I have no means of obtaining information. Should no such advance take place, I should suppose one or two regiments here sufficient for present protection, if there should be nothing to develop the hidden and stifled sympathies which certainly exist, and of which I have the candid admission of persons of high standing here, who assume to be in favor of the Government and the Union, but who would immediately take part against it if their fears of the consequences were removed.
On receipt of your letter, which gave me the first official [information] I had that Mr. Boss Winans was a military prisoner at Fort McHenry, I sent an officer to read to him the condition of the written parole, upon acceptance of which I was instructed to liberate him. The result was that Mr. Winans signed the parole and was immediately liberated. I inclose the parole duly signed and witnessed.
I have to report that on leaving Philadelphia three regiments of the First Division of Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanded by Colonels Ballier, Gray, and Owen, mustered into the service of the United States (and not then furnished with clothing and equipments), were directed to remain until properly equipped. The regiments of Colonels Dare and Nagle are fully equipped, and are stationed upon the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Eailroad near to Havre de Grace and Perry ville. They could, if it was desired, be brought forward immediately and replaced by the regiments before mentioned or by two regiments from Ohio that were in camp near Philadelphia when I left there. I think it proper to mention the fact, although having nothing to do with my present command.
The power to arrest persons under certain circumstances, and to hold them prisoners though they should be demanded by writs of habeas corpus, is certainly a high and delicate trust. I will use every effort to execute it, if necessary, with prudence and discretion, and with the best judgment I am capable of giving to the subject. As a matter of caution I would merely state that I did not receive any further power to arrest persons under circumstances than that which is contained in your letter of this date, as your letter seems perhaps to imply that I was to receive a power with instructions to accompany the letter. Awaiting your orders, either by letter or telegraph,
I am, very respectfully, yours,
GEO. CADWALADEE,
Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, May 18,1SG1. Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, TJ. S. Volunteers:
Sir: You will proceed to Fort Monroe and assume the command of that post, when Colonel Dimick will limit his command to the regular troops, composing a part of its garrison, but will, by himself and his officers, give such aid in the instruction of the volunteers as you may direct.

Besides the present garrison of Fort Monroe, consisting of seven com-X>anies of regular artillery, portions of two Massachusetts regiments of volunteers, and a regiment of Vermont volunteers, nine additional regiments of volunteers from New York may soon be expected there. Only a small portion, if any, of these can be conveniently quartered or encamped in the fort, the greater part if not the whole area of which will be necessary for exercise on the ground. The nine additional regiments must therefore be encamped in the best positions outside of and as near the fort as may be. For this purpose it is hoped that a pine forest north of the fort and near the bay may be found to furnish the necessary ground and shade for some three thousand men, though somewhat distant from drinking and cooking water; this, as well as fuel, it may be necessary to bring to the camp on wheels. The Quartermaster’s Department has been instructed to furnish the necessary vehicles, casks, and draught animals.
The war garrison of Fort Monroe against a formidable army provided with an adequate siege-train is about 2,500 men. You will soon have there, inside and out, near three times that number. Assuming 1,500 men as a garrison adequate to resist any probable attack in the next six months for at least many days or weeks, you will consider the remainder of the force under your command disposable for aggressive purposes, and employ it accordingly.
In respect to more distant operations you may expect specific instructions at a later date. In the mean time I will direct your attention to the following objects:
1.	Not to let the enemy erect batteries to annoy Fort Monroe;
2.	To capture any batteries the enemy may have within a half-day’s march of you, or which may be reached by land ;
3.	The same in respect to the enemy’s batteries at or above Craney Island, though requiring water craft; and
4.	To menace and to recapture the navy-yard at Gosport in order to complete its destruction, with its contents, except what it may be practicable to bring away in safety.
It is expected that you put yourself into free communication with the commander of the United States naval forces in Hampton Eoads, and invite his cordial co operation with you in all operations in whole or in part by water, and no doubt he will have received corresponding instructions from the Navy Department.
Boldness in execution is nearly always necessary, but in planning and fitting out expeditions or detachments great circumspection is a virtue. In important cases, where time clearly permits, be sure to submit your plans and ask instructions from higher authority. Communicate with me often and fully on all matters important to the service.
I remain, with great respect, yours,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Baltimore, May 18,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have just received an order from General Scott transferring the command of the Department of Annapolis to General Cadwalader and ordering me to Fort Monroe. What does this mean ? Is it a censure upon my action? Is it because I have caused Winans to be arrested ? Is it because of my proving successful in bringing Baltimore to subjection and quiet ?

Cadwalader may release Winans—probably will. You must guard against that.
If my services are no longer desired by the Department, I am quite content to be relieved altogether, but I will not be disgracejd. In all I have done I have acted solely according to what I believed to be the wishes of the President, General Scott, and yourself.
I am not disposed to be troublesome to you, but I wish this matter might be laid before the President. To be relieved of a command of a department and sent to command a fort, without a word of comment, is something unusual at least, and I am so poor a soldier as not to understand it otherwise than in the light of a reproof.
At least, I desire a personal interview with you and with the President before 1 accept further service. This will be handed you by my friend and aide-de-camp, R. S. Fay, jr., who knows its contents, and is able to represent me fully to you.

Major : I have the honor to report that last evening signal rockets were reported in direction of Aberdeen. I immediately proceeded to Havre de Grace (Lieutenant-Colonel Birney being absent), and finding they were not according to code agreed upon, considered no re-enforce-ment necessary. I proceeded to Aberdeen to ascertain why the rockets had been fired, and at that post they were reported as having been seen in direction of Perrymansville. Taking a guard to that point, I found all quiet.
Information having been given in relation to Capt. Benedict H. Kean, in command of Spesutia Rangers, William B. Michael, and Thomas Wilson, Captain Hoffman, of Company E, First Regiment P. C. G., arrested them ; the first as in command of forces hostile to the United States, and the two latter-named gentlemen as being engaged in destruction of bridges. The arrests were made quietly, and every consideration shown to the gentlemen detained. They were taken to Perry ville and lodged at my quarters.
From representations made by Captain Kean and by other parties, the Spesutia Rangers have not been engaged or intending to engage against the Government. His action in opposing the destruction of the bridges, as represented by credible parties, induced his release on parole of honor to appear if wanted. The others I believe to have been engaged in destruction of bridges, and that the evidence will be ample to sustain the fact. I am now detaining them until I receive instructions from headquarters.

I have had such constant claims upon my time here in seizing arms and ammunition, and in arranging the details with the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company of the understanding in regard to goods passing over their railroad, that I have not been able to accomplish more than to keep up the necessary correspondence with the officers commanding posts, and to give the necessary attention to the troops here preparatory to a visit to the different posts of the department, with a view to possess myself of its affairs, and to communicate such suggestions as may occur to me as proper in regard to the withdrawal of small outposts near Annapolis.

The magazine at Fort McHenry is full, and I do not like to move it until it is decided where it is to go. I should like to have instructions upon this subject. There is a magazine belonging to the city in the northern part of the town where it could be stored, but it would require a strong guard, as it is so far from the other positions occupied by the troops.

United States, and also requires of you the exercise of sound judgment, that while securing the interests of the United States and the safety of your command, you do not unnecessarily trench upon the right of citizens.
The safety of the Northern Central Railroad is intrusted to you, but that is not all; you are to see to the quietude of the country adjacent your stations, and if at any time you know of armed bodies of men outside of Baltimore collected with hostile intent, and the force be not too strong to overcome and overawe with that at your disposal, you will arrest them, by surprise, if possible, and hold them subject to future orders. Men not known to be friendly, drilling at night, or secretly, must be looked upon with suspicion of hostile intent and treated accordingly ; and also wagons with supplies of large amount leaving Baltimore at night, munitions, arms, &c., not designed for the United States, should be seized and held till properly accounted for.
Over the road to Frederick a surveillance must be exercised, and so soon as there is ample force at your disposal it should be stationed on that road within your reach.
The city of Baltimore is within the command of Bvt. Major-General George Cadwalader, and you must be careful to avoid interfering with his prerogatives; but if through force of circumstances you should be forced suddenly to act within his limits, you will report your act to him and the reason therefor. Where time will permit, you will report irregularities to General Cadwalader for his action.
In addition to the above the commanding general desires me to say he wishes to hear from you from time to time, as occasion may offer, in relation to the feeling of the people in your vicinity; the discipline of your command, and other matters you deem of interest and importance. The fact that everything is quiet is of importance to report.
You are also desired to maintain strict discipline, and to drill continuously; also to instruct your sentinels to permit no gatherings around them; to walk their post; talk to no one unnecessarily, and to be vigilant at all times. Tents for your regiment will soon be sent to you. In the mean time you will protect them from the weather by hiring such proper houses as may be in the immediate vicinity of the road.

A. A. <?., Headquarters of the Army, Washington City:
Sir: In compliance with verbal intimation from the General-in-Chief I present for his information in tabular form the locations of the regiments nowin this department; the condition of their equipment, accouterments, clothing, &c., and the probable time they can be put in motion, fully equipped. The probable time is based on the accompanying statement from the commander of Frankford Arsenal, to which I respectfully refer. I also call attention to the offer herewith of the quartermaster-general of this State.* With his aid six regiments can be thrown into the field as rapidly as the accouterments can be distributed, say Monday. Without his assistance (accepted by telegraph through me) the term of service of some of the regiments will expire before they are equipped, or they will be provided at so distant a day that new shoes and other clothing will have to be issued, unless accouterments are provided outside of this department. Colonel Hale offers some four thousand sets. I am anxious to forward the views of the General-in-Chief and to execute his designs, and will be much gratified to have the means of putting in the field regiments well drilled and desirous of seeing service. If desirable, they can be sent forward without accouterments,
Not found.

but without them the men lack confidence in each other and inflict severe injuries.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. PATTERSON,

P. S.—If Colonel Hale’s offer be accepted I shall at once equip the Twelfth and Thirteenth Regiments, at York; Eighth and Tenth, at Chambersburg; Fourteenth and Fifteenth, at Lancaster; and Twentieth and Twenty-first, at Philadelphia, from those accouterments, to be supplied the first of next week by Lieutenant Treadwell.
[Inclosures.]
Pennsylvania Volunteers.—One regiment at Woodberry, Md., complete, except tents; two regiments at York, all ready for service; three regiments at York, tents by 27th, no accouterments; three regiments at Chambersburg, tents by 27th, accouterments by 30th; * three regiments at Philadelphia, no accouterments, rest ready by 25th; two regiments at Lancaster, no accouterments, rest ready by 25th; two regiments at West Chester, no accouterments, rest ready by 25th, except clothing, very deficient; one regiment at Havre de Grace and one at Elkton and Perry ville, all ready for service by replacing them at their posts by Delaware Volunteers; one company cavalry at Philadelphia, provided with nothing.
Delaware Volunteers.—One regiment at Wilmington, deficient in clothing; two companies only with accouterments, in other respects ready.
Note.—May 23, General Patterson ordered two regiments, marked* above, to camp of instruction at Suffolk Park; the regiments at Havre de Grace and Perryville to go into camp at those places.

Sir : In answer to your letter of to-day I have the honor to state, for the information of the general commanding, that only two thousand two hundred and ninety-nine sets of round-ball accouterments are to be received from the Philadelphia manufacturers. I will be able to equip the Seventh Regiment, at Chambersburg, to-morrow, and the Eighth and Tenth Regiments probably early next week.
As I have no further orders for accouterments to give out, my further supply will be derived from Newark, from a contract recently made to deliver twenty thousand sets at this arsenal, dated May 15, at the rate of eight hundred or more sets per week, the first delivery to be made in ten days from date of contract. I will also receive from the Philadelphia makers eight thousand five hundred sets of elongated-ball accouterments, and will be able to equip regiments requiring these at the rate of about three thousand sets per week. I have communicated with the Newark contractor for twenty thousand, requiring him to deliver first five thousand sets of round-ball accouterments, and requesting him to send here as soon as possible any of this or any other kind he may have ready. Three thousand sets of round ball accouterments, ordered to Washington Arsenal, have delayed the supplying of the Pennsylvania

Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott :
I have the honor to report my arrival at this post Wednesday morning at 8 o’clock. I found that no troops had arrived except some recruits for the Third and Fourth Massachusetts Regiments of three-months’ men and two detached companies of three-years’ men which have been temporarily annexed to those regiments. This morning the Second New York Volunteers have reported themselves in good condition, numbering 782 men. These I have encamped on the farm of Mr. Segar, which is at the end of Mill Creek Bridge toward Hampton, and have also ordered into camp in connection with them the First Vermont Regiment (militia), Colonel Phelps. The force at this post may be stated thus: Colonel Dimick, commanding U. S. Regulars, 415 men; Third Regiment Massachusetts Militia and one company three-years’ men, 727 men) Fourth Massachusetts Militia and one company three-years’ men, 783 men5 First Vermont Militia, 779 men,* Second New York Volunteers, three years, 782 men. As there is very little sickness, the effective force will be probably 3,375 men. Of these, the New York and Vermont regiments only are furnished with camp equipage.

Upon my arrival I put myself in communication with Colonel De Eussy, of the Engineers, and consulted him upon two subjects :
First, as to the supply of water. I found that on that day the Minnesota was supplying herself from a well or spring on land of Mr. Clark, near the end of Mill Creek Bridge, about a mile from the fort, and that after pumping 800 gallons the well was exhausted, but. refilled itself during the night, and from personal examinations of its surroundings I think it may be trusted to supply 700 to 1,000 gallons daily with a little enlargement of the reservoir. The water is of the best quality, and as it is immediately under the guns of the heaviest battery of the fort on the land side, I have thought it proper, with the advice of Colonel De Eussy, of the Engineer Corps, to direct that a pipe be put in to bring it into the fort along the bridge and causeway, first having a cistern excavated at the fountain which will contain the whole supply of the spring. I have also advised with Colonel De Eussy of the propriety of finishing the artesian well which had been begun here, and he is now in communication with a contractor for that purpose. There is an appropriation, as I understand, of $14,000 made by Congress for that purpose.
On Thursday I directed Colonel Phelps, of the Vermont regiment, to make a reconnaissance in force in Hampton and its neighborhood within two miles of the fort, in order to examine its capabilities for encamping the troops about to arrive, and at the same time I made personal examination of the ground, Colonel De Eussy being of opinion that the wood suggested by the Lieutenant-General might be a little unhealthy, and I was further determined upon encamping in this direction by considerations of probable advances in this direction, to which I will take leave to call your attention soon. The rebels upon our approach attempted to burn the bridge over Hampton Creek, but the fire was promptly extinguished by the Vermonters, assisted by the citizens. Colonel Phelps passed into the village of Hampton, and found only a few citizens, who professed to be watching their negroes, in which occupation I have not as yet disturbed them. I therefore encamped Colonel Phelps’ Vermont regiment and Colonel Carr’s New York regiment on the point of land just above the spring, about half way between Fort Monroe and Hampton.
Saturday, May 25.—I had written thus far when I was called away to meet Major Cary, of the active Virginia volunteers, upon questions which have arisen of very considerable importance both in a military and political aspect, and which I beg leave to submit herewith.
On Thursday night, three negroes, field hands, belonging to Col. Charles Mallory, now in command of the secession forces in this district, delivered themselves up to my picket guard, and, as I learned from the report of the officer of the guard in the morning, had been detained by him. I immediately gave personal attention to the matter, and found satisfactory evidence that these men were about to be taken to Carolina for the purpose of aiding the secession forces there; that two of them left wives and children (one a free woman) here: that the other had left his master from fear that he would be called upon to take part in the rebel armies. Satisfied of these facts from cautious examination of each of the negroes apart from the others, I determined for the present, and until better advised, as these men were very serviceable, and I had great need of labor in my quartermaster’s department, to avail myself of their services, and that I would send a receipt to Colonel Mallory that I had so taken them, as I would for any other property of a private citizen which the exigencies of the service seemed

﻿650	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
to require to be taken by me, and especially property that was designed, adapted, and about to be used against the United States.
As this is but an individual instance in a course of policy which may be required to be pursued with regard to this species of property, I have detailed to the Lieutenant-General this case, and ask his direction. I am credibly informed that the negroes in this neighborhood are now being employed in the erection of batteries and other works by the rebels, which it would be nearly or quite impossible to construct without their labor. Shall they be allowed the use of this property against the United States, and we not be allowed its use in aid of the United States ?
Major Cary, upon my interview with him, which took place between this fort and Hampton, desired information upon several questions: First. Whether I would permit the removal through the blockade of the families of all persons who desired to pass southward or northward. In reply to this, I informed him that I could not permit such removal, for the reasons, first, that presence of the families of belligerents in a country was always the best hostage for the good behavior of the citizens; and, secondly, that one object of our blockade being to prevent the passage of supplies of provisions into Virginia so long as she remained in a hostile attitude, the reduction of the number of consumers would in so far tend to neutralize that effect.
He also desired to know if the transit of persons and families northward from Virginia would be permitted. I answered him that with the exception of an interruption at Baltimore there was no interruption of the travel of peaceable persons north of the Potomac, and that all the internal lines of travel through Virginia were at present in the hands of his friends, and that it depended upon them whether that line of travel was interrupted, and that the authorities at Washington could better judge of this question than myself, as necessary travel could go by way of Washington; that the passage through our blockading squadron would require an amount of labor and surveillance to prevent abuse which I did not conceive I ought to be called upon to perform.
Major Cary demanded to know with regard to the negroes what course I intended to pursue. I answered him substantially as I have written above, when he desired to know if I did not feel myself bound by my constitutional obligations to deliver up fugitives under the fugitive-slave act. To this I replied that the fugitive-slave act did not affect a foreign country, which Virginia claimed to be, and that she must reckon it one of the infelicities of her position that in so far at least she was taken at her word; that in Maryland, a loyal State, fugitives from service had been returned, and that even now, although so much pressed by my necessities for the use of these men of Colonel Mallory’s, yet if their master would come to the fort and take the oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the United States I would deliver the men up to him and endeavor to hire their services of him if he desired to part with them. To this Major Cary responded that Colonel Mallory was absent.
This morning the steamer Alabama arrived, having on board Colonel Duryea’s regiment of New York, 850 strong, fully equipped. I have caused them to be landed and encamped with the First Vermont. The steamer Pembroke, from Massachusetts, has arrived, having two unattached companies—one of rifles and the other of infantry, 101 men each, and without equipage—so that now the actual number of men ready for service may be set down at 4,400, but not very efficient, some being quite new recruits and others not fully equipped, two regiments being wholly without tents.

The rebels have built a very strong battery on Sewell’s Point, at the entrance of Elizabeth River, about four miles from this post, and about two and one-half miles from the Ripraps, or Fort Calhoun, and supported in the rear, at the distance of about a mile across Tanner’s Creek, by the rebel forces gathered about there, amounting, as nearly as I can ascertain, to some 3,000 or 4,000 men, it being understood from the attack of the Monticello on Sunday last that I intended to menace Norfolk in that direction. Of course I had not at my disposal any force sufficient to make such an attack and carry this battery with any hope • of holding possession of it should it be taken. I had determined, however, upon consultation with Commodore Stringham, to engage the battery with the naval force, and to endeavor, under the cover of their fire, to land and at least destroy the guns and works, and such plan was arranged for this morning $ but yesterday Commodore Stringham received orders from the Navy Department to sail at once for Charleston, so that our expedition was disorganized. As we had no sufficient force to make such an attack—in the absence of the flag-ship Minnesota and her guns at long range—as would give the movement that assurance of success which I understand you desire should seem to attend our operations, it has been abandoned. I have, however, directed Colonel De Russy to prepare to put some guns of long range upon the Ripraps, so as to prevent any further approach towards us from Sewell’s Point or Willoughby’s Spit.
In this connection I beg leave to suggest to the Lieutenant-General the necessity in coast operations for say fifty surf-boats, of such construction as he caused to be prepared for the landing at Vera Cruz, the adaptation and efficiency of which have passed into history. May I respectfully request and urge that such a flotilla be furnished for coast operations.
I have learned that the enemy are about to fortify a point at Newport News, about eleven miles from this place, at the mouth of the James River, and on the northerly side of it. They have already a battery at Pig Point, on the southerly and opposite side of the river, which commands the Nansemond River. I think it of the last importance that we should occupy Newport News, and I am now organizing an expedition consisting of two regiments for that purpose, unless I find unexpected obstacles. I purpose this afternoon, in the steamer Yankee, to make a personal reconnaissance of that point, and at once to occupy the same with that amount of force, intending to intrench there for the purpose of being in possession and command of the entrance to the James River myself, and from that position, by the aid of the naval force, to be in condition to threaten Craney Island and the approaches of Norfolk, and also to hold one of the approaches to Richmond. By a march of nine miles, at farthest, I can support the post at Newport News; by the sea, in two hours, I can afford it relief. There is water enough to permit the approach of the largest sized vessels—indeed the Lieutenant-General will recollect that Newport News Point was once counted upon as a naval depot instead of Norfolk.
Trusting that these dispositions and movements will meet the approval of the Lieutenant-General, and begging pardon for the detailed length of this dispatch, I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel : I arrived here too late in the afternoon of the 27th to assume on that day formally, in orders, the command of the department, but I reported to Major-General Sandford at this place, and received from him such information as to the state of affairs as he was able then to give me. I encamped the night of the 27th with the New Jersey brigade, and early on the morning of the 28th went to Alexandria, and was occupied from 5 a. m. till 9 o’clock at night in examining the position occupied by the troops and looking into the condition of the men.
Defensive works under construction.—The works at Alexandria had not been commenced nor even laid out as late as 10 o’clock a. m. yesterday, nor had the plans been definitely determined upon. A want of tools in the first place, and in the second place of means of transportation for the men from the wharf in Alexandria to the hill to be fortified, and changes made necessary by a better knowledge of the ground, were the principal causes given for the delay. Both the Michigan regiment and the New York Zouaves were bivouacked and encamped on the site, leaving but a few men in town. I trust, therefore, that the Navy Department may be requested to [retain] the Pawnee at her present station. The works at the bridge-head of the Long Bridge were progressing finely, and the report to me was that the men were working diligently. The main work covering the Aqueduct and ferry opposite Georgetown was in a fair state. The Sixty-ninth New York is the only regiment at work on it, and they seemed to me to be working admirably.
Subsistence and means of transportation.—Subsistence is furnished to the troops away from the vicinity of Alexandria by returns on the main depot in Washington. This, and the utter absence of any wagons on

this side, the want of means of communication on the part of some of the regiments, and the inexperience of most of the commanders, have caused the supplies to be irregularly and insufficiently furnished. One regiment has hired on its own account, out of private means, some wagons to procure its supplies. Forage has also been wanting. A depot is to be established at Alexandria, which will afford supplies to the troops in that vicinity. The depot in Washington might answer for all the others, provided the regiments be furnished with wagons to go for them. I suppose the Quartermasters Department in Washington has not at this time enough wagons to supply the force here with its allowance for its baggage merely, which would require about 200.
For the purpose of giving greater efficiency and a better administration of affairs, I have organized the troops not now brigaded into three brigades, and placed them under the colonels ordered to report to me in their letters of appointment. If a portion of the allowance of wagons for the regimental baggage were sent on and placed under the control of the brigade commanders, I think a better state of affairs will be gained at the least cost. With a view to movements in that direction, I have directed Colonel Stone to ascertain and report the amount of rolling stock on the Alexandria and Manassas Gap Railroad, and the amount of material required to place the road in working order.
I beg to request that some of the recent graduates heretofore assigned to the duty of instructing the volunteer regiments may be sent here for the same purpose and other duty. The only assistant quartermaster in the department is at Alexandria, to be in charge of the Quartermaster’s and Commissary Departments. I have to request that another officer of that department, furnished with funds, be sent for duty at headquarters. The troops are occupying houses in some cases, and fields, and cutting wood for fuel. Shall not rent and compensation be paid ? If so, funds are needed for that purpose, as well as the hiring of means of transportation where the same has not been furnished.

•	Cincinnati, June 1, 1861.
Lieut Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel: I had intimated in preceding dispatches an intention of moving on the valley of the Great Kanawha, and had in fact matured my plans for carrying that intention into effect in such a manner as to render all resistance hopeless, with the design of effecting the occupation, as I did that of the Grafton line, without firing a shot.
My view of our course m Kentucky and Western Virginia is that we should not cross the frontier without being fully assured that our assistance is demanded by the Union men, and that our movements should be in such force as to preclude the probability of resistance.
I had a long interview this morning with Judge L. Kuffner and Col. B. F. Smith, both of the Kanawha Valley. They came accredited by Hon. V. B. Horton, of Pomeroy, and other reliable men, and are represented as expressing the sentiment of the Union men of that region. My conference with them was full and frank. I told them that I did not believe it to be the will of the General Government to force assistance on the Union men where there was good ground to believe that they were able and willing to take care of themselves; that should I learn that any force from Eastern Virginia had entered their valley I could promptly drive them out; that they might count upon our aid whenever demanded, and that it is necessary for them to make up their minds to take a decided stand.
They stated that the Union feeling (shown to be decidedly preponderant by the late elections) is rapidly increasing; assert their ability to keep the secessionists under; say that they will not allow themselves to be forced into the Southern Confederacy, and deprecate sending any troops there at present. I have therefore thought it prudent to submit the matter to General Scott, the more especially as I think no ill effects can follow from some delay, for I have information which satisfies me that there are no Eastern Virginians nor Confederate troops in that region, and that they cannot move them there at present. These Kanawha gentlemen approve of the Grafton movement, and I have determined, until I receive further instructions from the General, to modify my original plan so as to accomplish the same result in a manner that will not be obnoxious.
Learning that the rebels who abandoned Grafton were this morning at Philippi I have ordered an advance on that point in two columns from Grafton and Clarksburg, with instructions to drive them beyond Beverly, and hold the latter place. I propose also gradually to advance on Elizabeth and Weston, in order to encourage the Union sentiment and to induce the Kanawha people to take a more decided course. I think they are not yet fully up to the mark, and need careful nursing. By driving the rebels beyond Beverly I think we shall free almost the whole of Western Virginia from their influence.
I have already informed you that I have placed the operations in Western Virginia under Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris, of the Indiana volunteers, a graduate of West Point, and a cool, deliberate man.
I would be glad to have some cavalry at my disposal as soon as possible. There are two companies organizing in Indiana, as many in this State, and some in Illinois, under the State laws. I presume they will be received into the regiment to be raised in this department. We should have at least a couple of companies in Western Virginia. I am watching Beauregard’s movements closely, and am glad that he is to be my antagonist.

It would be well if efficient general officers could be promptly assigned to the troops of this department, as well as a greater number of adjutants general, quartermasters, and commissaries. The absence of all military information in this region is very lamentable. It is a very rare thing to find any one who knows even the elements of squad drill.

Sir : I have the honor to state, for the information of the General-in-Chief, in reply to his telegram of this date, calling for a report of my intended operations, that, though looking to Cumberland, my plans have been mainly directed to turning Harper’s Ferry, throwing across the river near Williamsport ample force (with support following and threatening Shepherdstown) to push on and occupy Martinsburg, if I do not find the enemy too strong and moving to cut my line of march. His attitude and strength will then determine the course to be pursued, either to move direct upon him through Shepherdstown or to cut off his retreat along the Winchester Bailroad and to harass his rear. I wish to place such a force on the Virginia shore as can hold every inch of ground gained, and, however slowly, to advance securely, after Harper’s Ferry falls, upon Winchester.
The effective force now in Chambersburg is five companies of cavalry 42 R R—VOL II

A regiment at New Castle and one at Baltimore will soon follow. The troops in New York Harbor are ordered on.
I shall to morrow evening be in Chambersburg, and shall lose no time to complete arrangements and send forward the command, as indicated in my letter to Major-General Keim, a copy of which is inclosed. All the troops are anxious to be on the move and to see their foe—a desire which shall soon be gratified. 1 will inform you when I shall move in time to permit the General-in-Chief to make the demonstration indicated.
I am much gratified to know the General-in-Chief will provide some artillery.

General : The commanding general instructs me to give you in his name the following information and directions:
A movement, as soon as the force is prepared, will be made to Hagerstown, for the purpose of establishing beyond an encampment as the base of future operations. You are relied upon to organize and hold ready for instant movement those regiments which are prepared to move and face an enemy, and now gathering at Chambersburg, in the following manner:
1.	A column of cavalry and three regiments of well-drilled infantry,, to march from Chambersburg to Hagerstown. This column to be under the command of Col. George H. Thomas, Second Cavalry, TJ. S. Army.
2.	A second column, to be commanded by Brigadier-General Williams, to follow next day on foot, or by rail, if circumstances demand.
3.	A third brigade, to go by rail, and to land in Hagerstown just after arrival of Colonel Thomas’ brigade. If the second brigade goes by rail, the third, wholly or in part, will be pushed to Hagerstown as rapidly as transportation will permit.
4.	A fourth brigade, composed of the other regiments, will be pushed by regiment to Hagerstown as soon as prepared and transportation (rail) can be procured.
Colonel Thomas, with his cavalry from Carlisle, will arrive at Chambersburg on Friday. Direct the regimental commanders to report at once.
Wagon transportation is being prepared at Harrisburg and will be pushed to Chambersburg, and the train organized by A. R. Eddy, assistant quartermaster. Captain Eddy will have charge of the quartermaster’s department at Chambersburg, and transfer the depot to Hagerstown as the forces are located.
Capt. B. Du Barry, Subsistence Department, at Harrisburg, will provide for your present depot, and you are desired to see that each regiment has when it moves at least three days’ provisions.

The commanding general wishes you to require commanders to keep their officers and men in camp and out of the towns, and always ready to turn out.
The commanding general, with his staff, will join you in a few days, till which no movement to the front will be made unless circumstances should imperatively demand, which you will telegraph. He hopes on his arrival to find, through your energy and judgment, aided by the active efforts of every officer of your command, the different commands organized and prepared to move at a moment’s notice on arrival of accouterments, and, if necessary, before their arrival.
Capt. John Xewton, Engineers, will soon join you. He goes with special instructions relating to reconnoitering the ground in advance of Hagerstown. He and Captain Eddy have the confidence of the commanding general, and on this account are sent to you.

Colonel : I have the honor to report my arrival at this place. Pre vious to leaving Philadelphia, I arranged for the satisfactory working of the staff departments there and on this line, and in passing Harrisburg removed many inconveniences under which we have labored for the transportation of troops and supplies. Though this road is of very limited capacity, I expect to execute my designs as herein expressed. I am forced to adopt this mode of putting the column in motion, as not more than six regiments of infantry per day can be transported over the railroad. Wagons will be arriving and no inconvenience will be experienced, as regiments will be receiving accouterments while the troops are advancing to Hagerstown.
My impressions as to the point of attack indicated in my plan of operations have been confirmed by Captain Newton, who has been industriously engaged gathering information, and I shall arrange to advance on Thursday morning. I request to be informed by telegraph if the General-in-Chief has no objection.
Unless something should change my present design, I will direct Colonel Thomas to pass through Hagerstown early on Saturday morning, and advance the whole or part, as circumstances indicate best, of his command to Williamsport, seize the ford, and throw pickets beyond.
As he passes through Hagerstown a company of cavalry will be detached from his advance guard to the road leading through Boonsborough to Harper’s Ferry. The brigade under General Williams (three regiments) will be directed to follow Colonel Thomas, and will be close upon him. Other regiments will be thrown forward as rapidly as the capacity of the road will permit (six or seven per day, probably), and sent on the roads towards Boonsborough and Williamsport—the former to guard against forays from Harper’s Ferry, the latter to sustain the main column. Some of these regiments will reach Hagerstown as soon as Colonel Thomas. Of course I rely upon artillery arriving in time to permit the column to continue on towards Martinsburg.

On Monday morning I hope to have about fourteen regiments in and in advance of Hagerstown. I asked this morning by telegraph for the Second Infantry, which newspaper report placed at Pittsburgh. My design was to unite it to a brigade of volunteers, to command of which Colonel Miles would be assigned, thus having two brigades under experienced officers of the Regular Army. The information I have received leads me to believe a desperate resistance will be offered at Harper’s Perry.

[Ool. Townsend:]
Colonel : The last paragraph in the general’s letter [next preceding] refers to this, that at night the sound of the hammer is heard breaking stone on the Maryland Heights, the ax felling trees. Evidently a blockhouse is going up. No one can get near enough to see, and no one is permitted to come here all the way from there. Their informers only go part way. No guns have been placed on this side, unless they are light field pieces, and taken up in wagons. The Virginia side of the Shenandoah is armed, and the guns are iron and long—probably 32 or 24 pounders. Squadrons of cavalry roam the Virginia shore, oppressing people and pressing them into service. Our volunteers are as green as green can be. Marching is their forte, if they have a drum or a band. They cannot form a square yet of those I have seen, yet they think themselves perfect. As the General has just said he would send one or two batteries here, the general will do nothing about getting the field artillery from Harrisburg, though ammunition will be called here, which will be available for the two field batteries if they come. If they do not come, we can get those guns and plant them. We are working like bees.

You are not the aggressors. A turbulent faction, misled by ambitious rulers in a time of profound peace and national prosperity, have occupied your forts and turned the guns against you; have seized your arsenals and armories, and appropriated to themselves Government supplies; have arrested and held prisoners your companions marching to their homes under State pledge of security; have captured vessels and provisions voluntarily assured by State legislation from molestation, and now seek to perpetuate a reign of terror over loyal citizens.
They have invaded a loyal State and1 intrenched themselves within its boundaries in defiance of its constituted authorities.
You are going on American soil, to sustain the civil power, to relieve the oppressed, and to retake that which is unlawfully held.
You must bear in mind you are going for the good of the whole country, and that while it is your duty to punish sedition, you must protect the loyal, and, should occasion offer, at once suppress servile insurrection.

and drill is mucli improved. I have had great pain in being obliged to issue the accompanying general order. The volunteer troops seem to have adopted the theory that all property of the inhabitants was subject to plunder. I have taken the most energetic measures to correct this idea and prevent plundering. There are some few flagrant instances which can admit neither of palliation nor justification.. I have proposed to deal with these by court-martial, which I have ordered in session to morrow. As the outrages to be investigated are very grave, and as the punishment ought to be, and may be, very severe, I will take leave, unless otherwise instructed, to report the proceedings to yourself before any severe punishment is inflicted.
I have had no new accession of troops since my last report, save that a body of men known as the Naval Brigade, amounting to eight hundred and eighty, were reported here as ready to enlist in the service of the United States; but, under the instructions of the War Department, I have not received them into the service, and have sent so many of them home by the steamer in which they were brought as did not voluntarily engage to labor in the engineer, ordnance, and quartermaster’s departments about the fortress. These men ha ve very much embarrassed me. While I impute no fault, save that perhaps of want of discretion {which I easily pardon), to their colonel, Washington A. Bartlett, esq., I have been exceedingly annoyed with this whole subject; but I hope it is now finally adjusted.
I have here altogether about six thousand effective men, and no more. I am as yet without transportation trains or surf-boats, which I must have in order to make a movement, the project of which I will submit to yourself in my next dispatch. I am preparing myself, however, to be able to land, by causing one regiment at least to be drilled in embarking in and landing from boats. I have also sent up to the mouth of the Susquehanna to charter or purchase ten of a kind of fishing boats, which, I am informed by a gentleman connected with the squadron will be the best possible, except regularly-constructed surf-boats, for the purpose of landing troops. I hope to receive them within the next three days.
I have the honor to report the camp at Newport News and the battery there, to command the mouth of the James Biver, in a state of defense and forwardness, which I think will enable us to hold it against any force which may be brought against it.
We have made an armed reconnaissance some nine miles towards Yorktown, and find no armed men in that direction nearer than the Half-Way House, some twelve miles hence, and that but a picket guard of the enemy, who is in considerable force at Yorktown.
May I most respectfully ask if there is any reason known to the Lieutenant-General why the troops that were expected, and which I understood were promised to arrive here, have not been forwarded ?
I beg leave further to call the attention of the Lieutenant-General to the fact that from some oversight, probably in the Adjutant-General’s Office, the orders creating the Department of Virginia, North and South Carolina, which I understood were issued when I was in Washington, have not been published; at least I have not seen them. May I ask the attention of Lieutenant-General Scott to this omission, which might prove embarrassing?
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

The general in command lias heard with pain that there are instances of despoliation of private property by some perspns who have smuggled themselves among the soldiers of his command. This must not and shall not be. The rights of private property and of peaceable citizens must be respected. When the exigencies of the service require that private property be taken for public use, it must be done by proper officers, giving suitable vouchers therefor. It is made the special duty of every officer in command of any post, or of any troops on detached service or in camp, to cause all offenders in the matter of this order to be sent to headquarters for punishment, and such measure of justice will be meted out to them as is due to thieves and plunderers. If any corps shall conceal or aid in receiving plundered property or plunderers, such corps will be dealt with in its organization in such a manner as to check such practices.
This order will be promulgated by being three times read with distinctness to each battalion at evening parade.
Any citizen, at peace with the United States, despoiled in his person or property by any of the troops of this department, will confer a favor by forthwith reporting the outrage to the nearest officer.

Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. G.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report as follows, in compliance with your telegram of the 3d instant requiring me to submit u an estimate of the number and composition of a column to be pushed towards Manassas Junction, and perhaps the gap, say in four or five days, to favor Patterson’s attack on Harper’s Ferry.”
In view of the number of the enemy supposed to be at Manassas Junction, at Centreville, Fairfax Station, Fairfax Court-House, and other places this side of Manassas, and of that at places beyond Manassas, but within a few hours of it by rail, and of the possibility of troops coming from the valley through the gap, I think the actual entire force at the head of the column should, for the purpose of carrying the position at Manassas and of occupying both the road to Culpeper and the one to the gap, be as much as 12,000 infantry, two batteries of regular artillery, and from six to eight companies of cavalry, with an available reserve ready to move forward from Alexandria by rail of 5,000 infantry and one heavy field battery, rifled if possible; these numbers to be increased or diminished as events may indicate. I propose that this force, composed mostly of new troops, shall be organized into field brigades, under active and experienced colonels of the Army, whilst their regiments are being recruited, aided by a few regular officers. This is made the more necessary from the fact that the presence on this side of some corps indifferently commanded has led to numerous acts of petty depredations, pillage, &c., which have exasperated the inhabitants and chilled the hopes of the Union men. and show that these regiments should

all of them he restrained as well as led; and where, as is the case with many, they are not so by their officers, they must have some one immediately over them who can and will. I do not propose to have a supply train of wagons for the main body, but to use the railroad, which makes it necessary that every bridge or other important point be guarded, and have either a block-house or field-work. This will require several Engineer officers, and a full supply of intrenching tools, axes, &c.
I have now, perhaps, done all that the General-in-Chief desires of me, but I will take the liberty of adding a few remarks, if not even some suggestions. As soon as we commence to move they will do the same, and as their communications with their position at Harper’s Ferry, which they evidently cherish, will be threatened, they will do as they did when we first came over—hurry forward from all the stations at the South—and the question arises as to the best point or line it is advisable to hold, even for defensive purposes. This, it seems to me, is the line of the Eappahannock, which, if occupied in force, will effectually free all Northeastern Virginia, without coming in contact with the inhabitants, and also free the Potomac. It will be necessary to hold the Aquia Creek Eailroad, which, if done in large numbers, would make a powerful diversion in General Butler’s favor. It is true the foregoing is not directly in answer to the question of the General-in-Chief, but I think it flows from it. In relation to the number of troops to be used, I have only to say—what, perhaps, is evident enough, however—that in proportion to the numbers used will be the lives saved 5 and as we have such numbers pressing to be allowed to serve, might it not be well to overwhelm and conquer as much by the show of force as by the use of it?
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, colonel, your most obedient servant,

Orders have been given to purchase horses and collect the guns, equipments, &c., as soon as possible, at Carlisle. It will require some days, but the General considers this addition to your force indispensable. If two Ohio regiments come to you, retain them.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
Sir : I have the honor to report the arrival of Colonel Townsend with the Third New York Regiment of Volunteers, 800 strong, so that now the aggregate effective force under my command, including the regulars, may be set down at 6,750 men. As yet, however, we have not a single piece of artillery for the field. I received some artillery harness, however, and will ask leave to enlist from the three-months7 men for three years two companies of artillerists. We have no horses even sufficient for the quartermaster’s service yet. May I have permission to cause to be bought horses for the guns % I have thought that, as the quartermaster’s service is so pressed in New York, if I had authority to order purchases in Boston, which is substantially an untried market, it might be done with advantage and economy to the Government. My military secretary, Major Fay, is now in Boston arranging his private affairs. He is a thorough business man, and would cause an inspection of the animals before delivery.

this report reaches you, and the place is really very strong. A battery of four 8-inch columbiads will command the channel of the James River upon one side, but still leaves open the channel on the Nanse-mond side.
On this side, as you will perceive, is Pig Point, upon which the rebels have erected batteries, which they are striving now to finish, mounting some seven guns of 32-pounders and 42-pounders. If we Were in possession of Pig Point the James and Nansemond would both be under our control, and the services of one blockading vessel might be dispensed with, which are now required to prevent water communication between Richmond and Williamsburg and Norfolk and Suffolk. My proposition is, therefore, to make a combined naval and land attack upon Pig Point, and endeavor to carry the batteries both by turning them and by direct attack from the naval force $ if we succeed, then to intrench ourselves there with what speed we may, and re-establish the battery; but at the same time to push on with the same flotilla of boats with which we land up the Nansemond, which is navigable for boats and I believe light-draught steamers, to Suffolk, a distance of twelve miles. When once there, tlie Commanding GeneraPs familiarity with the country or a glance at the map will show that we are in possession of all the railroad communications between Richmond, Petersburg, and Norfolk, and also of the Great Shore Line, connecting Virginia with North Carolina via Weldon, by which the guns taken at the navy-yard will be sent South whenever the operation in that direction demands.
By going eight and a half miles farther, by Jericho Canal we enter Drummond Lake, a sheet of water some four by six miles. From the lake the feeder of the Dismal Swamp Canal might be cut off, and that means of transport cut off. Once at Suffolk in position, with these lines of communication of the enemy cut off, Norfolk must fall with her own weight. Starvation, to be brought on by simply gathering up the provisions of Princess Anne County, will make her batteries and the theft of the navy-yard guns substantially valueless, and will save many lives to be spent otherwise in their reduction. I am not insensible to the disadvantages and difficulties of this project, which I may have painted with too much couleur de rose. I do not recognize as among the most formidable the reduction of Pig Point Battery—that is, there is plenty of depth of water within point-blank range to float the Cumberland 5 but, the battery once* reduced, there must be a pretty active march on Suffolk to prevent trouble; some fortifications there, which I believe have not yet been undertaken.
If I am right in the importance which I attach to this position, then I must expect all the force of the rebels both from Norfolk and Richmond, brought there by the railroads, to be precipitated upon me, and be prepared to meet it in the open field. Could they do otherwise f Norfolk would be hemmed in. Am I able to withstand such an attack between two forces which may act in conjunction, with the necessary drafts from my force to keep open the line of communication by the Nansemond with Newport News, which would then be the right flank of my base of operations %
All these questions, much more readily and easily comprehended by the General-in-Chief than by myself, with the thousand suggestions that will at once present themselves to his mind, are most respectfully submitted. May I ask for full and explicit instructions upon this matter ? I have adopted the suggestions of the Lieutenant-General upon the subject of arming the flank companies of Colonel Duryea’s com-

He also instructs me to add in his name, as follows: Gather as much reliable information as possible of the disposition of the people of Maryland and Virginia in that vicinity, and extend your inquiries by secret agents south into Virginia and east along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Encourage the Unionists in disaffected regions to band together for self-defense, and to take heart from the support the Government has already given and the protection now given to them.

ond Infantry, will soon be in from Fort Ripley. Am I authorized to take it and others of the regiment passing East1?
I desire in a few days to occupy the roads beyond Hagerstown, and to establish my headquarters in that town, but do not, in face of the order of the General-in-Chief not to make a forward movement, like to advance beyond Greencastle, to which point Colonel Thomas7 brigade moved to-day. I can in a few days hence throw with wagons eight thousand men beyond that point, and by rail at the same time two thousand more.
While the river is high from recent rains, I wish to establish my depots and to intrench my left flank on the Boonsborough road, placing there the force with which I can threaten the Maryland Heights, and, should a favorable occasion offer, storm them. This force will be that which I will not be able to provide with sufficient transportation at present. The approaches to Harper’s Ferry are so well guarded, and the sympathizers with the rebels in the immediate vicinity so numerous, that no spy can approach their works. The little information I can gain assures me that they are fortifying west of Harper’s Ferry as well as at the Maryland Heights, and design on this field to make a desperate struggle for supremacy.
Independent of the regular force with Colonel Thomas, I have now in this vicinity seventeen regiments, all the force which is to join me, except the New York and Ohio regiments, of which I know nothing.

Asst Adjt. Gen., Washington City:
Sir : On the 24th ultimo I was notified by the General-in-Chief to make use of the New Jersey quota on this line. I called upon the governor of that State to ascertain when they would be ready, and was informed that they would, at the request of the Secretary, go to Washington.
Before daybreak this morning a New York regiment passed through Harrisburg, claiming orders of later date than the 4th instant from the General-in-Chief to move to Washington. I have ordered it to return, unless their last order from the General-in-Chief is subsequent to the one to me.
To-day I commenced placing on the road to Hagerstown the brigades as prepared, Colonel Thomas, Second Cavalry, leading off with five companies of horse; a battalion of two companies of the First Artillery; one of Eighth Infantry, and one of volunteers; the Sixth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-third Regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers. He will encamp near Greencastle, and hold himself ready to move at any moment.
To-morrow morning Brigadier-General Williams, commanding the Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and Twentieth Regiments, will encamp near him. If Colonel Miles arrives by the time wagons will be prepared, he will be assigned to the command of a brigade, and placed in close proximity to General Williams. The baggage train comes in slowly, but every one is working hard, intelligently, and cheerfully to be prepared at the earliest moment, and I expect that by the arrival of the Third

He wishes every precaution taken against precipitate action and nursing ill-feeling, both by political discussions and improper conduct of the men. The Army must have no enemies in the rear. On your prudence and judgment he relies to maintain the present status.
Appeals may be made to cross into Virginia to protect Union people under assurance that a small force only is required to present itself for disunion to hide its head and loyal people to flock to your banners. They must not be heeded. If, however, inroads are made into Maryland within your reach, the commanding general desires you to meet the invaders with a force which will ride down all opposition, and in all cases to return to your present camp. When practicable, the surprise of armed parties will be effected. Brigadier-General Williams will be immediately in your rear, and is directed to sustain you in all cases.

must be no reverse. Hence I have given you the best re-enforcements within my reach, and have just ordered Colonel Burnside’s fine Khode Island regiment of infantry, with its battery (about 1,200 strong), to proceed to Carlisle, and there receive your orders. A company of the Fourth Artillery (to receive its horses and battery at Carlisle) with the battalion of the Third Infantry took the same route and with the same instructions yesterday. This battery may not be ready for you in time, though these heavy rains must swell the Potomac and delay your passage some days.
I am organizing, to aid you, a small secondary expedition under Colonel Stone. He will have about 2,500 men, including two troops of cavalry and a section (two pieces) of artillery.
The movements by road and canal will commence the 10th instant, and passing up the country, touching at Bockville, be directed upon the ferry opposite to Leesburg. This may be but a diversion in your favor, but possibly it may be turned into an effective co-operation. Colonel Stone will be instructed to open a communication with you if practicable, and you will make a corresponding effort on your part.
I do not distinctly foresee that we shall be able to make any diversion in your behalf on the other side of the Potomac beyond repairing the lower part of the railroad leading from Alexandria towards the Manassas Gap.
I have said that we must sustain no reverse; but this is not enough, a check or a drawn battle would be a victory to the enemy, filling his heart with joy, his ranks with men, and his magazines with voluntary contributions.
Take your measures, therefore, circumspectly; make a good use of your engineers and other experienced staff officers and generals, and attempt nothing without a clear prospect of success, as you will find the enemy strongly posted and not inferior to you in numbers.
With entire confidence in your valor and judgment, I remain, your brother soldier,

Xow, therefore, I, Thomas H.

Commanding Fort Monroe, Virginia :
Sir : Your letters of the 4th and 6th instant are received.
The General-in-Chief desires me to say in reply, that he highly commends your zeal and activity, which oblige the enemy to strengthen his camp and posts in your vicinity and hold him constantly on the alert. The principal value of your movement upon Suffolk is, that it would be the easiest route to the Gosport navy-yard, and the objects (including many ships of war) which our people on the former occasion left undestroyed. The possession of Norfolk within itself is of no importance whilst we blockade Hampton Roads; but the destruction of the railroads leading from that city, as far as you may find it practicable, would be a valuable coercive measure.
The naval commander should aid you in the collection of boats for joint expeditions, and the Secretary of War has said that he would cause some eighty horses to be bought and shipped to you for a light battery.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General,
Chambersburg, June 10,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear General : I have your note, and thank you for the attention. There is no use in telegraphing General Scott or the Department to stop troops at Harrisburg. Under authority from General Scott I have ordered from New York regiments in succession to proceed from Harrisburg to this place, and in each case the colonels have refused to obey. If the Department will send orders to their camps to come here, they will probably obey; not else.
Remember, I beseech you, that Harper’s Ferry is (as I have said from the first)the place where the first great battle will be fought, and the result will be decisive of the future. The insurgents are strongly intrenched, have an immense number of guns, and will contest every inch of ground. Under these circumstances I earnestly and urgently request that you order the regiments expected in Harrisburg and the three New Jersey regiments to proceed to this place with all dispatch. The commander of the Jersey regiments has served with me, and I can rely on him. The Jersey troops were put under my command by General Scott, but Governor Olden says you have ordered them to go to Washington, not being aware, I suppose, that they had been assigned to me by the General-in-Chief. Pardon me for pressing this subject. The importance of victory at Harper’s Ferry cannot be estimated. I cannot sleep for thinking about it. Remember, my dear general, that my reputation and the reputation of our dear old State is at stake in this issue. I beseech you, therefore, by our ancient friendship, give me the means of success. You have the means; place them at my disposal, and shoot me if I do not use them to advantage.
With great regard, trulv yours,

Lieut. Gen. W. Scott :
Immediately upon receipt of your telegram of the 6th I gave orders to muster in Yirginia troops for defense of the State. Counter order of Secretary of War received yesterday, and at once transmitted to General Morris at Grafton. Just received from him the following telegram:
If we don't muster Virginians into service according to proclamation and arm them, we must quit the territory or prepare to hold it with Federal troops. The strong motive of the move here is gone unless their volunteers are received. Such as volunteer for the service will not enter unconditionally, having not State aid. Small force of rebels can control numbers. Have already mustered some informally. When a regiment is ready it will not do to disband. The effect would be disastrous. It is the cheapest way to defend Western Virginia. It is the only way to unite her citizens. Other methods will fail.
I fully concur with General Morris and the leading men in Yirginia, and think it would be impolitic to make further movements in Western Yirginia at present unless we can follow it up by raising Yirginia troops for their own defense. If decision cannot be reversed, shall troops now mustered in be disbanded ? I beg and trust not.

Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel: I sent by telegraph to-day General Morris’ telegram in relation to troops in Western Virginia. It is long, but of such importance, that I felt it necessary to transmit it as it was. I cannot urge too strongly the importance of this matter, on which hinges, I think, the fate of Western Virginia. I regard the position of Western Virginia as very different from that of Maryland. The anxiety in regard to this condition arises, I think, not from any unwillingness to fight the battles of the Union on any battle-field, but from the natural solicitude of a simple people for their own homes and families. We have it in our power to unite that people firmly to us forever. I hope the opportunity may not be permitted to pass by. I ask the efforts of the Lieutenant-General in my support.
General Morris informs me to-day by telegram that one of his parties has dispersed another small camp at St. George, capturing a lieutenant and two secession flags. If secession flags are not too plenty with you I will forward that taken at Philippi in fair fight.
I have been prevented from a forward movement on Beverly by the want of transportation and cavalry. The first defect is by this time remedied, and I am trying to secure the second by inducing the governor to raise State cavalry. I know the slender force of regulars on hand, and dislike asking for them, but if I could have the six companies of Pirst Cavalry now at Fort Leavenworth, I could make excellent use of them.
I have been obliged to defer the Kanawha movement for a few days. I hope before I am ready to make it to have received authority to muster in Virginia troops for the defense of that valley. I learned to-day, from authority apparently reliable, that two regiments of Tennessee troops had orders to move last night from Camp Cheatham (near Nashville) to Union City, and thence, when re-enforced, to take possession of Island Ho. 1, some six miles south of Cairo. I at once sent to General Buckner a telegram, of which I inclose a copy, also one to Governor Magoffin, and had them repeated to Hon. J. J. Crittenden and Hon. James Guthrie for their information. General Buckner came to see me on Friday last. We sat up all night, talking about matters of common interest. Buckner gave me his word that should any Tennessee troops cross the frontier of Kentucky he would use all the force at his disposal to drive them out, and, failing in that, would call on me for assistance. He went to Tennessee after leaving here to present that view to Governor Harris.
Great trouble is being experienced in reorganizing the regiments at Camp Dennison. It is very necessary that money should be provided at once to pay off the three-months’ men and get them out of the way, say $120,000 at a rough calculation.

Sir : I yesterday notified you of the occupation of Cumberland by the Indiana regiment under Colonel Wallace, and the fact of secession militia being in his vicinity, upon whom he designed to call. I now inclose for the information of the General-in-Chief the satisfactory report of his journey through Yirginia.
I have reason to believe that with few exceptions the people of Maryland are loyal, and wherever a Federal force will appear disloyalty will hide its head and the Government receive powerful auxiliaries. The Unionists now present a bold front and call for aid, which, as I cannot now give and properly sustain, would invite attack and perhaps cause* defeat.
In the counties bordering the Potomac are many Union-loving people,, but the secessionists are so powerful and violent and well armed, that our friends dare not express open sympathy, and are often forced to array themselves against us. For this reason and to sustain the command at Cumberland, which can gradually work its way east, repairing bridges, I would respectfully suggest two regiments at least, if they could be devoted to that purpose, be designated to protect the road in the rear and permit Colonel Wallace to approach. Supplies must also*

On Saturday my depot will be established in Hagerstown, and immediately thereafter my headquarters will be transferred to that place. The want of wagons and the difficulty of procuring teams rapidly enough has trammeled me and does so yet, but on Saturday night I shall have in front of Hagerstown over ten thousand men, strongly posted. With depot there established the different commands will be litted with expedition and pushed towards the river. The Fourth Artillery battery will not receive its horses before Saturday. The heavy battery will arrive in Hagerstown after me. Before being prepared to advance from that point the troops will be well drilled and disciplined. A marked improvement is daily manifested in their military exercises, and the regiments lately arrived are in excellent condition and drill.

At this time I have only to say that your instructions shall be carried out to the best of my ability. It gives me pleasure to add that my command has been most kindly and hospitably received by the citizens of Cumberland, who appear from their demonstrations to be most loyal and Union. I may also say that I reached this point by way of Grafton, and along my route through Virginia was met with a feeling of good-will amounting to enthusiasm. Although my march was considerably in advance of General McClellan’s troops, and through what is called a disaffected region, there was not a single act of hostility to disturb my progress or interrupt communication with General Morris’ command at Grafton.
By every available opportunity I will forward you reports of the positions and strength of my detachments and the condition of my regiment. At this time I have over eight hundred effective men, keen for the contest, uniformed and very perfectly equipped for the field. If there is impropriety in the remark, general, I hope you will excuse it, but I cannot help concluding with an earnest expression of the hope that you will not forget me when you advance upon Harper’s Ferry and Eichmond, if such be your aim. Through special favor of General Scott (God bless him) we are in the East and under your command, probably the only stranger regiment in a division of gallant soldiers. I hail from a State which, since Buena Vista, has been under a cloud of slander. Do not, I beg you, withhold from us the only chance we may ever have to show the people of the East that Indiana has as much courage as loyalty, and can and will fight to the last man to crush out treason and vindicate her lost honor. General, I will go to the duty you have assigned me, confidently relying upon your generosity and judgment.

Paris, Ky., April [June?] 8, 1861. General George B. McClellan :
Dear Sir : It will probably be unnecessary and superfluous, but still I feel impelled to address you this note:
An intelligent friend was with me last evening who had left the State of Mississippi three days before, and traveled through a section of Tennessee and from Nashville to Louisville by the railroad. He informed me that the insurgents claimed to have eight thousand troops at Corinth, in Mississippi, and about twenty thousand along the railroad between Nashville and the Kentucky line and along that line. He understood from an officer high in command in one of their camps that there was a perfect understanding between their leaders and our governor that if Colonel Anderson moved with any troops to Louisville or the authorities of the United States proceeded to take possession of Louisville and of the railroad, or to violate the neutrality of Kentucky as laid down in the governor’s proclamation, the Tennesseeans had his express permission to take possession of the road in Kentucky and also of Louisville, and that they, with the secessionists in that part of Kentucky, would advance upon Louisville with twenty thousand troops.
My informant further said that the same officer had disclosed to him this as the general plan of the campaign by the Confederate leaders in Virginia: Beauregard was to make a movement on Alexandria and a feint attack on Mansfield’s lines, and then fall rapidly back on the interior of Virginia, with a view to draw Mansfield after him in rapid pursuit, and in this way he was to be drawn deeply in the pursuit, when all the Confederate forces that could in the interval be assembled in Virginia and all that could be got together in that State were to move rapidly upon him, intercept his retreat, and capture or annihilate his army. The gentleman told me that the whole Southern people were animated by the most intense hatred against the Northern States and Lincoln’s administration, and felt the greatest confidence that their forces would be victorious wherever they fought on anything like equal terms. He also expressed his own belief that the Southern men had much greater skill in the use of small arms, superiority in horsemanship, and were more alert and spirited than Northern men, and that when they were anything like equal in numbers they would be victorious, especially in the early battles.

I do not believe we can much longer escape trouble in Kentucky. The sympathy for the South and the inclination to secession among our people is much stronger in the southwestern corner of the State than it is in any other part, and as you proceed towards the upper section of the Ohio Kiver and our Virginia line it gradually becomes weaker until it is almost wholly lost. The vote for our delegates to the Border State Convention was not a true test of the strength of parties in our State, though I doubt not that two-thirds of our people are unconditionally for the Union. The timid and quiet are for it, and they shrink from convulsion and civil war, whilst all the bold, the reckless, and the bankrupt are for secession. They think that if they could have a large body of their partisans armed as the Knights of the Golden Cross, the State Guards, &c., they could strike a startling blow, establish extensively over the State a reign of terror, and force Kentucky out as Virginia and Tennessee were taken. Such au attempt would have been much more apt to have succeeded before the distribution of the arms that we obtained through Lieutenant Kelson. Since the Union men got them they have organized companies and have been actively drilling, and they feel much more confidence in their ability to defend themselves and a growing disposition to uphold the Union at all hazards; but all the efforts of our governor and of our inspector-general have been to arm the secessionists and to keep arms from the Union men. The consequence is that the secessionists have the largest number of armed men.
We have placed the 5,000 muskets in the hands of the Union men, of whom about one-lialf would use. them in defense of the Union in their particular localities and the others anywhere in the State. We have something like one hundred companies organized widely over the State who have applied for arms since we distributed our whole stock, and we have not been able to furnish them with a gun. We were promised 5,000 more of muskets and 8,000 Sharp’s and Enfield rifles. It has been unfortunate that they were withheld, for we could by this time have had them all distributed to good men, which would have made the Union strength in the State invincible. There is a great difference between Union men armed and unarmed. We ought to be putting many more guns in the hands of our friends, and particularly in the northern and eastern sections of the State, for there the largest body of its most faithful friends is to be found. About the latter part of this month or first of July the ball will very probably open. You will have to move on Paducah and Columbus, in this State, and Memphis, in Tennessee, and if we now had the arms that were promised us we would have ready three times as large a movable force to aid you as we could now bring in the field. We will find our governor a declared and active rebel, and we would have ample numbers to drive him from the State.

The First Brigade, Colonel Thomas commanding, will march by the Williamsport and Greencastle road, leaving Hagerstown to the left, and establish its camp near Williamsport, but far enough from the river to be free from the enemy’s shot. He will hold Williamsport and protect the ford by artillery.
The Fourth Brigade, Colonel Miles commanding, will follow the First Brigade, and locate its camp temporarily on stream in the rear and on the right of First Brigade.
The Third Brigade, Brigadier-General Williams commanding, will take the Hagerstown turnpike and the direct road to Sharpsburg, and establish its camp near head of stream. This brigade will throw a large picket towards Sharpsburg.
The Second Brigade, Brigadier-General Wynkoop commanding, will proceed by rail to Hagerstown and march on the Frederick turnpike to vicinity of Funkstown.
The Fifth Brigade, Brigadier-General Negley commanding, will move by rail as rapidly as possible, and be established on the Hagerstown and Williamsport turnpike.
The quartermaster will provide wagon transportation in Hagerstown for this and the preceding column.
Each brigade will post its guards and sentinels so as to secure a continuous line from camp to camp, and place its pickets far enough in advance and on the flanks to secure against surprise.
Each brigade will protect the adjoining one, and in case of attack go to its assistance.
The Fifth Brigade will, in addition to being the reserve, provide the guards for the store-houses, hospitals, &c., in the vicinity of Hagerstown.
In selecting camps, the commanding officers will have a regard for defense and drill and healthy locations.
General Gadwalader will see to the location of the camp of each brigade and administration of affairs.
General Keirn will see to the execution of orders in this vicinity, until the departure of his division, when he will join it in front of Hagerstown.
Immediately on arrival of a train in Hagerstown the regiments will be formed and marched through town and be located on its ground in line of battle, its pickets thrown out and guards established.
The men must be kept in camp ready at all times for instant action, and be drilled in the school of the company and regiment.

If he finds means to communicate with you, and it is expedient to effect a junction with you, he has instructions to do so. The General has sent a man (William Johnston) to endeavor to pass through Harper’s Ferry, and then to join you and give you useful information. It is hoped the facilities he seemed to possess will make his mission successful.
I have the honor, &c.,

Sir: On Saturday, the 15th, I propose to throw a strong force in front of Hagerstown, the remainder of the command to follow as speedily as my limited means of transportation will permit. We will then be beyond the telegraph, and have but one mail a day. The railroad company runs two trains a day, and the postmaster informs me that the additional cost of carrying the mail by both trains would not exceed fifty dollars a month. I venture to request that the contractors be directed to forward the mails twice in twenty-four hours to the Army under my command wherever located.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, vour obedient servant,

General: Information has been given the General-in-Chief that Ben. McCulloch has two regiments of sharpshooters coming from Texas, and that he is now on the spot preparing to meet your column, and then to fall back on Harper’s Ferry.
Indications received from this side confirm the impression you seem to have that a desperate stand will be made at Harper’s Ferry by the rebels. The General suggests that sharpshooters be met by sharpshooters.

To the Mayor of the City of Baltimore :
Sir : I have the honor to transmit to you a copy of an order issued to the troops of the United States in this city and the vicinity.
In pursuance of this authority no soldier will be permitted to leave his post or enter the city during this day without positive orders from the general in command, except those who are voters under the constitution and laws of Maryland, and whose rights as voters, as I understand, have been recognized in a communication addressed by you to my predecessor in command of this department.
I earnestly desire to co-operate with you in all measures that may tend to promote the peace of the city. The large police force, wisely controlled, I think, if impartial and vigilant, will have strength to suppress ordinary election tumults and preserve order. If they fail to do this, or if any considerable portion of the people of Baltimore avail themselves of the difficulties of the occasion to organize anarchy and overthrow all forms of government, the responsibility for the results, whatever they are, will fall upon them.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

The general commanding the department directs me to say that you will on no account allow any of the men of your command to be absent from your camp during the day or night of to-morrow. You will hold your command in readiness at a moment’s notice to move under orders during that time, with arms in perfect order, and provided with forty rounds of ammunition to each man. Should you not have the necessary ammunition on hand, you will send your quartermaster to report to me this afternoon for an additional supply.

I will accept the exchange for Private Carter. The two citizens Whiting and Sively were taken with arms in their hands, one of which was discharged from the house of Whiting upon the column of our troops when all resistance was useless and when his attack was simply assassination, and when no offense had been committed against him.
The house from which the shot was fired and a building which formed a part of your outposts are the only conflagrations caused by the troops under my command, and the light of these had ceased hours before your men ventured out from under their earthworks and ditches to do us the courtesy of burying our dead, for which act you have my sincere thanks.
After our troops returned from the field—hours after—a building was burned which furnished our wounded some shelter, and from which we had removed them, but was not burned by our men.
For your kind treatment of any wounded you may have, please to accept my assurances of deep obligations, and with the certainty that at any and every opportunity such courtesy and kindness will be reciprocated.
I am sorry that an officer so distinguished in the service of the United States as yourself could for a moment suppose that the wanton destruction of private property could in any way be authorized or tolerated by the Federal Government and its officers, many of whom are your late associates. Even now, while y our letter is being answered, and this is on its way to you, a most ignominious and severe punishment, in the presence of all the troops near this post, is being inflicted upon men who have enlisted in the service of the United States—not soldiers—for plundering private property, which could not, by the strictest construction, be considered contraband of war or means of feeding or aiding the enemy. That which has been brought within my lines, or in any way has come into the hands of my troops and been discovered, with the strictest examination, has been taken account of, collected together, to be given up to those peaceable citizens who have come forward to make claim for it. A board of survey has been organized and has already reported indemnity for the property of peaceable citizens necessarily destroyed. In order to convince you that no wrong has been done to private property by any one in authority in the service of the United States, I do myself the honor to inclose a copy of general orders from this department,* which will sufficiently explain itself, and the most active measures have been taken to rigidly enforce it, and to punish violation's thereof. That there have been too many sporadic acts of wrong to private property committed by bad men under my command I admit and most sincerely regret, and believe they will in the future be substantially prevented, and I mean they shall be repaired in favor of all loyal citizens, so far as lies in my power.
You have done me the honor to inform me that the vedette Carter is not a prisoner taken in battle. That is quite true. He was asleep on his post, and informs me that his three companions left in such haste that they neglected to wake him up, and, they being mounted and my men on foot, the race was a difficult one. If it is hot the intention of your authorities to treat the citizens of Virginia, taken in actual conflict with the United States, as soldiers, in what light shall they be considered t Please inform me in what light you regard them. If not soldiers, must they not be assassins ?
A sergeant of Captain Davies’ command will be charged to meet your sergeant at 4 o’clock at the village of Hampton, for the purpose of the exchange of Private Carter.

I need not call your attention to the fact that there will be unauthorized acts of violence committed by those who are not sufficiently under the restraint of their commanding officers. My men complain that the ambulance having the wounded was fired into by your cavalry, and I am informed that if you have any prisoners they were taken while engaged in the pious duty to their wounded comrades, and not in battle. It has never occurred to my mind that either firing into the ambulance or capturing persons in charge of the wounded men was an act authorized, recognized, or sanctioned by any gentleman in command of the forces in Virginia. Before this unhappy strife I had not been so accustomed to regard the acts of my late associate citizens of the United States, and I have seen nothing in the course of this contest in the acts of those in authority to lead me to a different conclusion.
I inclose a certificate by Sively and Whiting, which will show you that they, at least, had received no harm from the Federal troops.

Colonel : I have received a letter from Maj. J. G. Barnard, Engineer, making suggestions concerning the defenses thrown up on this side of the Potomac. I have attended to these so far as my resources enabled me. Speaking of the work on Shooter’s Hill, he says:
Having to use heavy guns on sea-coast carriages for this as well as for other works in progress, it will require at least a week, probably more, before such guns can he mounted; hut there will also he eight field-guns (part of them rifled) in the armament. These could be put in position in a couple of days, but they should not be sent to the work until the matter of a guard or garrison is attended to and artillerists provided for them.

Chambersburg, Pa., June 14, 1861.
[Colonel Townsend :]
Dear Colonel: To morrow morning onr force will be in Hagerstown, located as indicated in the accompanying map. Every effort has been made to press forward, and the move to-morrow is a strained one. Every wagon we could get is engaged with the front column, except twelve employed here taking baggage to the trains. We could not hire teams here, and as far as I see here the people are just as willing to be employed by the foe as by us if it would be safe and would pay. Our one-horse railroad does not permit much work. By Sunday night I hope the main work will be over and the force in Hagerstown, and the track open to the trains coming in with supplies.
To-day many reports have come to us to the effect that the enemy is evacuating Harper’s Ferry. Persons sometimes circulate such to induce us to press on to the trap. Our own spies do not confirm them. Though I have been engaged night and day in the office, and have no intelligent assistants in a military point of view or cognizant of the workings of the staff, I have succeeded in inspecting the regiments here, and to so organize the brigades as to make them the most effective. In each are some riflemen, good marksmen, though the regiments are mainly armed with smooth bore muskets. Till I came here I could not get from any one of them the kind of arm in possession, nor the caliber, nor a solitary requisition for anything. I have had to order each individual article generally before I came here, and to push the articles forward. I have had to play ordnance officer, assistant adjutant-general, commander of the forces, inspector, quartermaster—everything. Now all branches have got to working well, except that part of the quartermaster’s department embraced in transportation. A kingdom for a few horses or mules would be my cry if I had a kingdom. I do wish our force to be the first to enter Harper’s Ferry, but rather than make a false step and lose by it or be checked, I shall be content to be last. Our force is an imposing one to all else outside the ring.
The heavy battery will probably be here on Sunday night or in Hagerstown. The Fourth Artillery battery has not yet arrived at Carlisle, though believed to be on the way. Harness not heard from or of. By the time that battery reaches Hagerstown we will be ready. Our force will be advanced immediately, and a position assumed which will permit the camps to be abandoned to a guard and the force move on. We will soon have a telegraph established to Hagerstown this way. The one through Frederick cannot be trusted. We will soon see other work.
Write to Stone to-night, telling him what we will do, and that at the proper time we wish him to move up, according to his judgment and information, either towards Frederick or Leesburg. You think us slow, but if you and the General were here you would think otherwise, and that we have accomplished much. The enemy have cut off all avenues of approach. The deserters give various accounts, and I believe in some cases they have been sent here to deceive. They gained no information.
I send you sketches of Berkeley County. Cannot get one of Jeff erson. The Maryland Heights were re-enforced on Wednesday by about 3,000 men; whether to coerce the Kentuckians or not, can’t say, or to cover a movement in rear. They have tried several times to induce us to cross and get whipped.

Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,

Col. Charles P. Stone,
Commanding, near Leesburg, Va.:
Sir : The commanding general instructs me to inform you that as soon as he can move his force, so as to strike a blow on the enemy’s left, at Harper’s Ferry, and follow it up with success, he will inform you, to obtain your co-operation, if circumstances, in your judgment, will permit. He desires to be informed of your position, and whether you can most advantageously threaten the Maryland or Virginia Heights opposite Harper’s Ferry. He will not necessarily rely upon your cooperation, though glad to receive it. Can you stop supplies passing from Frederick County, Maryland, into Harper’s Ferry ?
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
F. J. PORTER, Assistant Adjutant- General.
Chambersburg, Pa., June 14,1861. Brevet Maj. Gen. George Cadwalader,
Commanding First Division, Greencastle7 Pa,:
General : The commanding general desires me to inform you that in operating against the forces which occupy and surround Harper’s Ferry his design is, in general terms, as follows:	.
First. To threaten an attack of the Maryland Heights.
Second. To turn the enemy by their left, through or near Martins-burg, with a strong column of mixed arms of service (cavalry mainly in reserve for critical moments, either to launch upon the enemy, to sustain our columns, or hasten the movements of a retreating enemy), cut their line of communication, and attack them in position.
Third. To sustain the advance column by a force strong enough to resist an effort to cut off* the advance, maintain the line of communication, and give the necessary aid to sustain the movement.
A reconnaissance of the enemy’s position may cause a change in this plan, but it is not likely to any material degree. The commanding general, therefore, desires you, while he is preparing his forces, to mature your plans for executing so much of the design as will fall to the lot of your division, that of taking the advance and breaking the enemy’s lines. The commanding general has every reason to believe that a determined stand will be made at Harper’s Ferry—a desperate struggle for supremacy; and so momentous are the interests of our country, involved in the undoubted success of our arms, that all plans must be matured with great prudence; the agents selected and so well disciplined as to render victory certain. While in position near Williamsport, the sustaining force being unprepared, the commanding general desires you to avoid bringing on a collision of any extent by entering Virginia, or attempting anything the success of which is doubtful. Many efforts will be made to induce you to cross the river, but heed them not or give them your careful consideration, and, whatever you undertake, move with great caution. When our forces cross the river he does not wish to withdraw, but to be able to sustain them and to advance. This, of course, is not designed to restrict you in regard to parties who may annoy you or be destroying property or the dams or cross the river into Maryland. They must be quickly met by an overpowering force.

F. J. POETEE, Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters Yorktown, Va., June 15,1861. Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler,
Commanding Fort Monroe, Ac.:
Sir : I have just received yours of the 13th instant, with respect to the firing into the ambulance by my cavalry. 1 have simply to say that the statement of your informant is entirely untrue. My cavalry was never ahead of your column, whose retreat was so rapid as to cause many of your wounded to be left on the field, while others were carried off in the rear, instead of in the front of your column, as they ought to have been, and over bridges, which were immediately taken down to prevent pursuit.
You say the citizens, who defended their homes, must either be considered soldiers or assassins. They are neither, but brave men, defending their firesides against piratical invasion, and are entitled to the respect of all good men. Messrs. Whiting and Sively, whose certificate you have obtained while in duress, were captured before Whiting’s house was burned. I stated that they knew the depredations which had been committed on their neighbors. These depredations are acknowledged by you both in your order and in your letter to me. The last paragraph of your order, guaranteeing protection only to citizens at peace with the United States, that is, only to persons who think as you think, destroys whatever merit there may have been in the previous clauses. With respect to the vedette, Private Carter, I desire to inform you that when a picket of four is placed out for twenty-four hours, as in this case, at least one is permitted to sleep. This picket had orders to retreat before a large force of the enemy. Four men against five thousand constituted, however, such great odds, as to have justified the retreat of the picket even without orders. Had Private Carter been awake, perhaps a retreat would not have been necessary.
Eeciprocating the kind expressions contained in your letter, I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain : In reply to your note of this elate, I have, by direction of the commanding general, hastily addressed a letter to General Cadwalader authorizing him to throw a force beyond Williamsport, and to send in advance towards Martinsburg parties to secure against surprise, provided the report you send that Harper's Ferry is vacated be true. He is advised to send you to reconnoiter carefully, and as you know the wishes of the commanding general and the momentous interests at stake, which would suffer even from a check, which would be construed into a victory, to take your advice into consideration and act upon it, knowing, as does the commanding general, that he can rely upon your judgment and prudence not to compromise our present position. You understand the condition of the Army and the impossibility of advancing far with any large portion of our force, and the danger of having a portion cut off. If the enemy has abandoned Harper’s Ferry, the commanding general wishes it occupied as soon as it can be done safely.

General : The commanding general desires you to give Captain Newton the necessary aid to carefully reconnoiter the position of the enemy beyond Williamsport, to ascertain if he is really vacating the borders of the Potomac in your vicinity. If he has vacated, the commanding general wishes you to throw a portion, if not the whole, of your division over the river, and send parts well in advance to secure against surprise, and, if it can safely be done, to annoy their retreat. Captain Newton will advise you of the wishes of the commanding general, and his advice you are desired to take into careful consideration for the purpose of acting upon. If you find the enemy gone, the general wishes General Wynkoop placed as soon as possible near the river, on your line, and General Williams advanced towards Shepherdstown.

abandoned the right bank of the Potomac and cannot injure you in any possible manner, the commanding general desires you to detail towards Cumberland, as assistance, a section of artillery, a squadron of cavalry, and three regiments of infantry, using for the purpose the transportation of other regiments. No risk, however, must be run to endanger your own force, lest you be cut up in detail. The burning of Harper’s Ferry may be a decoy, and hence the general enjoins the utmost caution upon you and Captain Newton and every officer. Just at*this time, when a movement is made, the danger is the greatest. If you can hire a man to go to Cumberland and tell Colonel Wallace what you have decided to do, the general desires it.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Williamsport, Md., June 15, 1861. Maj. F. J. Porter, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Major: I wrote to you, directed to Chambersburg, in reply to your letter as to sending forward assistance to Cumberland. It is impossible for us to send the force you speak of for many reasons, as we are without sufficient transportation, and we shall have to send to-morrow evening or Monday morning to Hagerstown for subsistence. Moreover, in the absence of more reliable information in regard to Harper’s Ferry, and the country between this and Winchester, and hence to Martins-burg, the hazard would be too great, even if we were in condition to move. I have no doubt my letter will reach you at Hagerstown, although it was addressed to Chambersburg, as it was sent to Captain Holabird, at Hagerstown, to be forwarded to you, and he, no doubt, is aware of your intended arrival at Hagerstown, and will retain my little note, or memorandum, to hand to you. My present object is to repeat this, and, further, to add that I have taken measures to be possessed of information of a definite description as to Harper’s Ferry, and as to the neighborhood in our front on the opposite side of the river, including Martins-burg, to be reported to the commanding general to-morrow as early as possible at Hagerstown.
I will be happy to learn the views of the commanding general and to receive his instructions. I have also taken measures to have information from Winchester and from Cumberland as speedily as possible.

The sword bayonet and rifle cartridges is what I want, with a supply of percussion caps. General Morris has acted very strangely towards me. I would fight them in some of the mountain passes on the other side of the river if he had done the fair thing. It is useless to depend for help on him or General McClellan.

Fort McHenry, June 16,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : The election passed without disorder, but the fact is not a just indication of the spirit of the city. Active demonstrations on the part of secessionists can only be suppressed by constant readiness of our forces. We need greatly some assistance here.
1st. Authority to establish a home guard. There are many good Union men here, who are ready to enter the service, and we have arms for them, which have been taken from ill-disposed persons. They can be deposited at the custom-house under guard of our troops, so as to make secure their possession. This will give occupation to the Union men and confidence to the loyal portion of the city. I think it will be prudently and safely managed.
2d. We need a corps of cavalry to suppress the contraband trade on the back roads leading southward. We have not now a mounted orderly by whom to send a message even to the city. Some assistance of this kind is indispensable. The infantry can well command the railways. I have written to Mr. Secretary Chase to loan us the service of a revenue cutter for a brief period, by which we could control this trade upon the river and bay. To cut off the contraband is to deprive Baltimore of the support now given publicly to the secession spirit and strip the rebel army of its most useful supplies. I beg you to think of this subject, and give us prompt aid.
3d. Baltimore would afford most excellent camps of instruction for raw troops. They can be easily and cheaply supported here in healthy and convenient locations, well drilled and disciplined, and their presence would afford support to the Government against the rebel elements in the city. In a short time you could safely withdraw the best troops for service elsewhere, leaving the new levies in possession here.
With respect I submit these considerations to you, and remain your obliged and obedient servant,

Have sent squadron of cavalry, section of artillery, and Rhode Island regiment towards Cumberland to sustain Colonel Wallace, threatened by a large force and demanding aid, and who may be forced to Hancock. Sustain this by another regiment. Wish to retain regulars for the present, if the General in-Chief is not urgent. I write by Colonel Sherman to-night.
R. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Hagerstown, Md., June 16,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the Army ;
Colonel : I have the honor to report, for the information of the General-in-Chief, my arrival last evening in this place.
From time to time I have notified you of the condition of the command to move, and my intention soon to advance to this place with a force which could maintain any position it might take. With our own transportation, aided by every wagon and team which could be hired contiguous to our camps, in Pennsylvania and in this place, I advanced yesterday (the earliest moment) General Cadwalader’s division, and sent the largest portion of General Keim’s by rail. The remainder, with the supplies, are now rapidly coming in. General Cadwalader encamped last evening near Williamsport; to-day, under my instructions, he will cross the river and occupy the bend to Falling Waters, and will be prepared to push on to Martinsburg, to which place he sends an exploring force. He will be sustained by Generals Wynkoop and Negiey, whose brigades are posted for the purpose.
Early yesterday morning I received simultaneously reliable information of the evacuation of Harper’s Ferry, and a threatened attack upon Colonel Wallace at Cumberland, with a call for aid, which General Morris, in rear, had refused. I directed Colonel Wallace to hire transportation, maintain a bold front to the last moment, and, if hard pressed, to move towards Hancock, in which direction horse, foot, and artillery would be sent, with orders to push on to him; or, at his discretion, to fall back upon Bedford, communicating the fact to the column on this side. With the spirit of a true soldier he has prudently determined to stand, and retire contesting the ground, unless he will have to sacrifice his men.
Confident the enemy had retired and was in rapid retreat from Harper’s Ferry, I ordered a force to be detached to Cumberland. Owing, as will be seen by the accompanying letters, to the want of the means of transportation and the fagged condition of the command, the march being long and the day oppressively hot, the command could not be put in motion.
Major Porter late at midnight visited General Cadwalader at Williamsport, and arranged to send to-day a section of artillery, a squadron of cavalry, and the Rhode Island regiment, Colonel Burnside—a gallant soldier and a gallant command—to support the noble Indiana regiment, similarly commanded. The transportation for that command exhausted all available wagons and checked, had I been able and it been prudent, further advance to push on a fleeing enemy. On the approach, suddenly on their rear of this well-organized force, and the steadily advancing column under Colonel Stone, the enemy appear to have hastily decided to evacuate the position they had openly declared should be held at all hazards. They have fled, and in confusion. Their retreat is as

demoralizing as a defeat; and as the leaders will never be caught, more beneficial to our cause. Harper’s Ferry has been retaken without firing a gun. The moral force of a just cause, sustained by a strong and equable Government, has conquered.
I am prevented from advancing rapidly by want of transportation. The interests of the Government are too momentous to risk a defeat or even a check, and hence I send out no inferior force. To-day and to-morrow about nine thousand men cross to Yirginia, there to await transportation, and to be sent forward in detachments well sustained. In the mean time I propose and submit for the consideration of the General-in-Chief—
First. To transfer to Harper’s Ferry my base of operations, depot, headquarters, &c.
Second. To open and maintain free communication east and west along the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad.
Third. To hold at Harper’s Ferry, Martinsburg, Charlestown, &c., a strong force, gradually and securely advancing as they are prepared, portions towards Winchester, Strasburg, &c.
Fourth. To re-enforce Cumberland and move south to Bomney, More-head [Moorefield], &c., and operate with the column in the third proposition towards Woodstock, and cut off communications with the west.
We will thus force the enemy to retire, and recover, without a struggle, a conquered country.
To carry out this plan time is required, and that, with a strong, firm hand, will restore peace and unity to our distracted country.
To effect what I propose requires the co-operation of General McClellan, and the force from him to be under my control at Cumberland, both to secure the road as far as Grafton and to advance to Bomney, &c.
With Harper’s Ferry in possession, Baltimore falls. Maryland will be a quiet spectator, awaiting the result of the campaign, with her interests developing a feeling in favor of a permanent Federal Government.
If this proposition be adopted I shall continue my present operations, which have been directed to this end, and shall, as soon as I am prepared, occupy Harper’s Ferry and Martinsburg; secure the railroad, &c., thence, and canal to Cumberland; use the railroad thence to Harrisburg, as accessory only.
In connection with this I respectfully request (presuming Baltimore to be so far peaceable that the safety of the railroad can be relied upon) permission to take from the Philadelphia and Baltimore Bailroad and the Northern Central road the regiments now guarding them. The latter I should at once transfer to the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad; the former to the line of operations.
If I am permitted to carry out this plan, the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad and the canal will be in operation in a week, and a free line of communication to Saint Louis established.
I shall continue to carry out these views until checked; but if my course be approved, I wish to be informed. I am advancing into another department, but so essential is it, that for the instant I do not consider the sanction of the General-in-Chief requisite.
The telegram of the General-in-Chief recalling regulars is at hand. My reply is the substance of this communication, with the request that the regulars be permitted to remain for the present. Until Harper’s Ferry is occupied and fortified I should fear the return of the rebels. This force is a good one, but the General-in-Chief has, by the regular

General-in-Chief for all the regulars with my column, and the Ehode Island regiment and battery, the force which the commanding general had ordered to you. It was too late to send another regiment, and transportation could not be obtained till some time after your telegram confirmed the suspicion of the ruse attempted. It is evident the design was to draw off force from here which would be most available for relief to the capital, now threatened by all the power of the enemy. Fortunately you did not require it, and it had not gone so far as to be out of reach. It is now on its way to Washington. Cartridges will not be here until to-morrow, nor caps. In the mean time transportation is being gathered, and as soon as practicable a regiment will be sent to you. I wish you to give me by telegram the caliber of your guns, whether .69, .58, or .54-inch.

Major: I have the most extraordinary rumors here within the last half hour. It is said by many persons here, the most reliable apparently that are around us, that General Johnston is this evening with a very large force at Martinsburg. It is said he has 15,000 men, and that he is marching upon this place at this time. Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Lamon, and others assure me the information is reliable. The best troops have left here and I have no artillery to defend the ford. Something must be done at once. It will require all my efforts to collect the remnant of this demoralized command now scattered everywhere. I have no means of accounting for this unexpected movement. I hear nothing of Colonel Wallace, and it seems impossible to obtain any one to cross the river. It appears to me the troops should all return here. This information is confirmed by several parties, and no one is willing to cross the river. I am entirely unable to account for this movement, but there appears to be every reason to think it is true. Unless it is impossible I would advise that all the troops should be returned here and concentrated, or wherever we are to assume our strongest position. Colonel Burnside might be reached and the Wisconsin regiment should be sent for. I have not one moment to lose and have no one to rely upon but myself. I would like to have some officer or two upon whom I can rely. I do not think I can defend this ford without artillery.

From General Cadwalader’s report apprehensions existed of serious attack at Williamsport from force of fifteen thousand men.

His division had not then recrossed the Potomac. The command now are this side; one man shot. Captain Doubleday just arrived with battery and fitting it out. Miles ordered at once to join you.

Hagerstown, Md., June 18,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst Adjt. Gen. U. 8. Army, Washington City:
Colonel : Finding, on my arrival here on the 15th instant, the enemy still in the vicinity of Martinsburg, I directed, in order to be able to carry out the original plan approved by the General-in-Chief, General Cadwalader, strongly supported, to cross the river at Williamsport and establish himself within the bend opposite and intrench himself. This was executed before I received the call for the regular troops with this column. It had, I think, the happy effect of causing the troops threatening Cumberland to retire.
That night, on receipt of the order from the General-in-Chief and direction to u keep within your [my] present limits,’71 ordered the regular troops to be put in motion for Washington, and the volunteers brought back to this side, and in time for all to have returned by daylight. The execution of the order was deferred by the volunteers, and at night the inclosed report (No. 1)# was received from General Cadwalader. Presuming the enemy, who knows all our movements, had taken advantage of the withdrawal of the regulars to attack the remnant of two brigades, I at once turned Colonels Thomas and Miles, then here, to the support of General Cadwalader, and provided ample force to drive back any enemy in this vicinity. As soon as the force was on this side I detached the regular infantry, in compliance with the original order, for Washington. This fact I telegraphed to-day, and asked permission of the General-in-Chief to retain Thomas and Doubleday, the former too fagged to march, except under great necessity. The delay in returning that force to the General-in-Chief was at the time a necessity, and I feel confident he will pardon it.
The telegrams of the General-in-Chief indicate a desire for me not to advance beyond the Potomac. At present I cannot advance with any large force, as my means of transportation are so limited. I should be

forced to halt every two days to send for supplies. To remedy many inconveniences, and to reopen the line of communication, and to protect the channels of trade, I propose what I consider a military necessity— the rebuilding of Harper’s Ferry Bridge, protected by a force from this side, and the reoccupation of Harper’s Ferry. For this purpose, and to fortify the heights in its vicinity, I wish the artillery under Doubleday. I would approach from this side, and would not think of marching on the right bank to Harper’s Ferry, exposed as my line would be for twenty miles to be cut at several points by the enemy 5 if not, to advance upon Winchester from this point or from Harper’s Ferry. I recommend this course if for no other reason than to keep the volunteers employed and out of settlements. From Harper’s Ferry at any time a force can be sent to you and to operate upon Winchester. I will remind the General-in-Chief that with the exception of one regiment (Connecticut) all this force will be entitled to discharge at the expiration of their three months, and I believe all but one regiment (the Wisconsin, an excellent one) will claim it. That force in Harper’s Ferry, open to the rear and fortified towards Winchester, can maintain itself. The railroad and canal will be reopened, and the people on the line encouraged to defend them.
I respectfully present the above to the consideration of the General-in-Chief, submitting to his superior judgment whatever his decision may be.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Hagerstown, Md., June 18,1861.
General Simon Cameron:
Dear Sir : We are all here deeply disappointed. This entire command on Sunday was in admirable condition. It had dragoons, artillery, a good body of volunteer infantry, good spirits, plenty of provisions, and needing nothing but transportation, and this was being rapidly supplied. A large portion of General Cadwalader’s division was across the river at Williamsport, and in two days would have been in a reasonably intrenched camp, occupying a bend on the Virginia side of the river, with a good ford well defended behind. The residue of this corps was within reach, and in a very short time would have occupied Sharpsburg, Maryland Heights, Harper’s Ferry, Martinsburg, and would have been in good condition to strike at Winchester, or, by a temporary bridge at Harper’s Ferry, to have advanced via Frederick or Leesburg to Washington. General Patterson had around him a corps of very superior Regular Army officers, and it was apparent that the proposed work of this corps was advancing with certainty and force. In this condition of affairs comes an order for Burnside’s regiment with all the artillery in this army, leaving General Patterson without a gun. Then comes an order for all the regular troops, leaving us without dragoons or any regular infantry to give confidence to volunteers; and, what is worse than all, the regular officers, including Colonels Thomas and Miles, heads of brigades, and upon whom much reliance was placed, were taken away. This compelled a return to this side of the river and an abandonment of all aggressive plans. We had then a rumor that Johnston was again appearing in great force at Martinsburg. This led to a delay of Miles’ and Thomas’ movements, but as all General Patter-

son’s force is now on this side, able to repel attack, the orders of General Scott will be at once obeyed.
See what a position this will leave these volunteers in! They are now keen for a fight. They must now stand on the defensive. Their time of enlistment will melt away, and they go home having done nothing, and little likely to enlist again. The demoralization of this column, of which so much was expected, will be generally injurious. Pray think whether it is not better either to leave it in strength to carry out the original plan, or to call it to Washington, via Frederick, to join in your general movements.
Eemember, I write to you freely as an outsider, without presuming to criticise plans, and without knowledge of your precise condition. If you are in actual danger in Washington, we ought to be with you to share in it, or have strength to make a diversion in your favor.
Very respectfully, yours,

I had expected you to recall the regulars on the reappearance on the Potomac of Johnston with a formidable body of troops, and to keep the former until the importance of that movement could be ascertained. I await information from you on that point. Keep the siege guns and the Perkins light battery.

Maj. F. J. Porter,
Asst Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. Dept of Pennsylvania:
Major : Seven regiments of my division and the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry remained on the other side of the river all night, notwithstanding my positive orders to withdraw to this side. The only way I can account for this is by the supposition that the order may not have been properly communicated to them by the commanders of brigades. I must inquire into this.
Finding when the troops left here last night for Hagerstown that those expected did not arrive, I used every effort to communicate with their commanding officers without success, I having no mounted men at my disposal. One of those, named Downs, at the suggestion of Ward H. Lamon, U. S. marshal, now with a regiment here, was sent a mile and a half from here on the other side of the river. Expecting from time to time that our troops would come over, and hearing no firing on the other side, as it became late we concluded not to send more troops over, but to remain in a state of readiness to cover their retreat or to defend this position in case of our being attacked. We had a force ready at the ford and a regiment advanced up the river westwardly all night. We intended at daylight to cross the river if occasion should require it. I am happy now to report the safety of our forces on the other side in Virginia, and that we are withdrawing them as speedily as

we can without loss or injury to property. The ford is about four feet deep at present, and there are many large stones or rocks that are in the way and render us liable to accidents in crossing.
I am now endeavoring to reach the truth in relation to whether or not there is really a large force of rebels near to us, as is universally asserted here. I shall make another attempt to bring here George W. Curtis, who is referred to in the note I send. It was stated he saw the force; that he was confident that there could not have been less than 14,000 men, and that General Johnston was with them. How any plans are to be formed without knowing the truth of this report appears to me to be impossible, and it may be intended that he is to be ubiquitous, and that he is at one time to threaten Washington by uniting with the forces there, and at another to appear here or in the West, keeping our forces moving around the outside of a circle, whilst he is moving across the center. It may be that our movement on Sunday to the other side of the river has invited him to take up a position at Martinsburg to follow our rear, his position being stated to be two miles southeast of that place. General Johnston knew, no doubt, the number of our wagons, and that we would not have been prepared to subsist our column without receiving supplies from the rear, which he would have been in a position to cut off.
You will observe from Colonel Wallace’s letter that he thinks the troops went westward after abandoning Harper’s Ferry. He speaks of their attacking General Morris. Our movement over the river may have drawn them back. I send you the order which I sent over the river last night by the man who was shot, and which they did not receive. It was brought back to me this morning. As soon as we can ascertain with certainty the position of Johnston and his troops we will be able to know what to do. Two messengers have just come in, confirming accounts of large forces near Martinsburg and Darkesville. Major Sherman is here. I will write again.

mand of course operates greatly against any regular system of instruction. I, however, endeavor to visit the several stations twice a week, and hope that the benefits of my instruction are not entirely lost. The company guarding the canal is divided into two equal parts, and its future efficiency thereby much disturbed. As I do not see the necessity of keeping it there, I respectfully suggest the propriety of placing it either at headquarters or at Elk ton. I would likewise offer, very respectfully, the same suggestion respecting the occupation of Northeast and Charlestown. The bridges at Northeast and Charlestown are all of stone, and could not be materially injured before word would reach Perryville or Elkton. I would therefore suggest that two companies be kept at Elkton, two at Perryville, and the rest at this place and below—say two at Bush River and two at Gunpowder. This last place seems to me much more exposed than any other, and as demanding greater protection. I await your orders in these respects. I beg leave to add further that I have not felt easy without some means of constant communication with the other shore of the Susquehanna, and that I have accordingly chartered the steamer Fairy for thirty dollars per day, she finding coal.
In conclusion, I beg leave to present to the general, as the wish of the officers and men of this command (myself included), that it should be called into more active service at an early day. I would also say that the officers and men of this command have received at all hands the well-merited encomiums of all here, and at all the stations, for their genial society and good conduct. 1 regard the material favorable for a first-rate regiment.
I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

at Washington as to prevent my being supplied. I also desire to call bis attention to the fact that I have great need of mounted men for outpost service and vedettes. A company or two would be of great service. I have as yet received no horses for my light battery. I have the harness and guns, and could provide the men if I had the horses. I was reduced to the necessity of sending my own saddle-horse to Big Bethel, to endeavor to convey orders nine miles from my camp, that being the only horse not on duty away from the forts which had a saddle, and those horses were my own personal property. If the exigencies of the service will permit, it will be of great advantage that I should receive some aid in this matter.

Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott,
Commander-in-Chief\ U. 8. Army:
Sir : I send you inclosed a memorandum * of information obtained by me from two deserters from Sewell’s Point, who escaped this morning in a boat. They are both Northern men, apparently frank and honest, and they have been sent North by me. They belonged to the Macon (Ga.) Volunteers. The general will see that we have an experimental gun on Fort Calhoun, of 24-pounder bore, carrying a 53-pound elongated shot, of Sawyer’s patent, by which we are enabled to strike the enemy’s battery with a great degree of accuracy. I think Sawyer’s shell is a success, and I have directed at the ordnance workshop two 6-pounder cannon to be rifled and perhaps one 12-pounder for field purposes, and I have also ordered a competent supply of shell for the same. I hope to have these orders filled within a week. It is among the possibilities, and perhaps the probabilities, that a concentration of troops may be made at Yorktown via James River, and an advance movement upon this post ensue. While waiting for the transportation and the further troops that have been promised me, I have turned my attention, with the aid of the Engineer officers who reported to me four days since, to strengthening my positions outside the walls of the fortress. Newport News, perhaps, can hold out with the three thousand men there against the attack of five thousand or six thousand men, but we have not, as yet, any field artillery here. To defend ourselves outside the fort, we have but about three thousand effective men, and some of them not the best troops. May I ask again for Cook’s battery and the Massachusetts troops which were promised me I The enemy are apparently i>Teparing for an advance movement from Yorktown. By the concentration of the Yorktown and Norfolk troops, should they attack, I should be, to say the least, largely outnumbered.
There are plenty of regiments, especially the Second Volunteer Regi-

ment in Massachusetts, and Major Cobb’s light battery, ready, waiting, and anxious to join me here if an order were only given, and there are ample means of transportation for this.
The General-in-Chief is thus possessed substantially with all the information I have, and it is for his better judgment to deal with the exigency. I will do the best my limited knowledge and experience will permit with the material I have. Perhaps the General would advise a joint land and sea attack upon the battery on Sewell’s Point. If there are any such numbers as are claimed at Norfolk, it will be seen that it would be impossible to hold the battery if it were taken.

Of course it is designed that you should absorb the column of Colonel Stone, now covering the fords and ferries on the Potomac below Leesburg; the remainder of your troops (how many?) to be left to cover the detachment on the Maryland Heights.

Dear Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and regret to learn that any embarrassment to the successful movement of the forces under command of Major-General Patterson occurred in consequence of orders issued from here by the General-in-Chief.
It has been my aim and purpose to furnish General Patterson all the force and aid to enable him to accomplish a gloriously successful result, and to that end I ordered as many troops arriving at Harrisburg to follow in his train as I could, until the apparent change of circumstances at Harper’s Ferry and its neighborhood seemed to make it apparent that it was more important to increase our force here than there. It may be true that if the General-in-Chief had been on the spot and understood the condition of things there as they are now stated by you to have existed at the date of the order issued by him for the return of Burnside’s artillery to this place, he would not have issued it. Of that, of course, I cannot undertake to speak, and do not mean even to express an opinion. Certain it is, however, that this Department, and, indeed, the whole administration, has but one safe course before it in this emergency, and that is to be guided by the counsels of the General-

Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the telegram of the# General-in-Chief calling for a plan of operations with a portion of my force to sweep the enemy from Leesburg, &c. Inclosed is a copy of my telegraphic reply. The following is my plan more in detail:
To carry out the views of the General-in-Chief I propose—
First. To occupy the Maryland Heights with a brigade (2,100 men); fortify and arm with Doubleday’s artillery, and provision for twenty days, to secure against investment.
Second. To move all supplies to Frederick, and immediately thereafter abandon this line of operations; threaten with a force to open a route through Harper’s Ferry, this force to be the sustaining one for the command on Maryland Heights.
Third. To send everything else available (horse, foot, and artillery) to cross the Potomac near Point of Bocks, and unite with Colonel Stone at Leesburg. From that point I can operate as circumstances shall demand and your orders require. If no blow is to be struck here, I think this change of position important to keep alive the ardor of our men as well as to force an enemy.
The reasons for this change of depot will be so apparent to the General-in-Chief that I need not refer to them. By the employment of the local transportation of the country I can soon make the necessary changes, and will hasten to carry out your orders.
I have many reports in regard to the movements of the force opposite us in Virginia, and have reason to believe that when the regulars were withdrawn, General Johnston, with thirteen thousand men and twenty-two pieces of artillery, was marching to the attack, and that night posted his force, expecting from us an attack the following morning. I regret we did not meet the enemy, so confident am I that, with this well-appointed force, the result would have been favorable to us, and that this portion of Virginia would now be peaceably occupied.

With an enemy close at hand, a move suddenly, with present amount of transportation, necessitates sending a large mass of stores back to Harrisburg or their abandonment.
Maryland Heights can be secured, and Frederick also, and a strong force of infantry, some cavalry, and artillery sent via Frederick to Leesburg to sweep the enemy from that point to Alexandria. If no blow is to be struck here, and this meets the views of the General-in-Chief, I will at once commence moving, and be in position to act at the earliest practicable moment.

Since I have been in my present position I have used every possible means to connect it with our present line of operations, and also with the probable movements of the enemy, and I am satisfied that to abandon it would be the greatest mistake we could commit, and for the fob lowing reasons:

## p. 714 (#730) ############################################

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA.
[Chap. IX.
1.	It is so situated as to give you the best possible position to observe the enemy and to obtain the very earliest possible information as to any movement he can make towards Washington.
2.	It is the strongest and most defensible military position, except that about Shooter’s Hill, that I have seen between Washington and four miles of Fairfax Court-House, and is so situated that it must be attacked and carried before it would be safe for any enemy to make any forward movement on Ball’s Cross-Roads or Bailey’s Cross-Roads, as a movement on Bailey’s Cross-Roads would expose the enemy to a flank attack from the troops situated at Falls Church and a movement on Ball’s Cross-Roads to a rear attack, and neither of these crossings is more than two and a half miles from Falls Church.
3.	As the enemy’s pickets before our arrival here were in possession of the ground in our front, I am satisfied the moment we leave the position it will be occupied, and, in connection with the possession of Vienna, will give him the possession of a line that it will cost us thousands of men to drive him from it, and we shall have to do it if he is strong enough to sustain an advance.
4.	A retrograde, if followed by the occupation of the Falls Church position, as it will be, will enable the enemy to control the entire valley of the Four Mile Run, from Vienna to within two miles of Roach’s Mills, and if they have twenty thousand men, everything else being equal, fifty thousand men cannot drive them out.
5.	A retrograde movement (I will not consider its effects on the country) will have a most injurious effect on the Union men in this vicinity (and they are in considerable numbers), and thus must necessarily leave with us or be killed.
The above, general, are only some of the reasons that present themselves to my mind in opposition to a retrograde movement, which I think can be prevented and our position here perfectly secured by posting three regiments at Ball’s Cross-Roads and as many at Bailey’s Cross-Roads, which will bring the whole front from Georgetown, Falls Church, and Alexandria within short supporting positions. With a single battery of light artillery and a couple of hundred of cavalry, with two Connecticut and the two Ohio regiments, I can hold our position at Falls Church for two hours against ten thousand men, counting time from the moment our pickets will notify us of the approach of the enemy, and that will give us time to be supported from Ball’s and Bailey’s Cross-Roads and the New Jersey regiments at Roach’s Mills, leaving the troops at Alexandria and those in the vicinity of Arlington, Georgetown, and Washington near enough to sustain us in case we should be overmatched, which I do not think we should be. At all events, we would give time enough for these troops to come to our relief.
Before a retrograde movement is made I would like to canvass this matter with yourself and General Scott. Since I came here my mind has been constantly occupied with the subject of my position here, and I think I understand as well as any engineer officer or officers who may come out here and pass half an hour examining it and then return to Washington with a report. I know that these things must be, but 1 must confess that I felt mortified that two gentlemen of the Engineers should come into my camp under instructions, as I now find, to examine and pass upon the most important military positions in our whole line, which had been selected by me, and not have the courtesy to invite my attendance or call my attention to the fact that they were on any official duty.

At 10 o’clock last night Wallace was safe, and apprehended no immediate danger, though some 3,000 secessionists were said to be about twenty miles west. Anticipating active operations either as directed by the General-in-Chief or forward, 1 yesterday called him to me from a point where he is only a cause of anxiety and doing no good. I have supplied him with ammunition, and there is no force between us.

Camp Sprague, Washington, D. C., June 22, 1861. Lieut. Gen. W. Scott, Headquarters TJ. S. Army:
Sir : I have the honor to report that the regiment under my command, in pursuance to orders from headquarters of the U. S. Army, departed from Washington on Monday, June 10, for the purpose of joining the column of Major-General Patterson, then moving from Chambersburg upon Harper’s Ferry. The battery of artillery attached to the command, with the baggage, preceded the main body of the regiment twelve hours.
Early upon Monday morning we left camp, and, marching to the station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, entered the cars prepared for our transportation, and were carried to Baltimore. The command was composed of 1,128 men and 117 officers, accompanied by a long wagon train. The passage through Baltimore was peacefully made, and, taking the cars of the Northern Central Railroad, the entire regiment reached Chambersburg, Pa., on the morning of Tuesday, June 11, when I immediately reported to Major-General Patterson for duty. Still proceeding by rail, we reached Greencastle at noon, and encamped. The command remained in camp at Greencastle until Saturday morning, when, in conjunction with the First Brigade of Major-General Patterson’s column, under command of Colonel Thomas, the line of march was taken up for Williamsport, Md. That place was reached at noon, and occupied by the force of which this regiment formed a part.
On Sunday a portion of the battery of artillery was ordered across the Potomac to Falling Waters; but, in accordance with orders from Major-General Patterson, it was recalled on Monday, and the regiment, once more complete, commenced its march at an early hour for Frederick City. The route lay through Hagerstown, Boonsborough, and Middletown, and in these places the command was received with enthusiastic demonstrations of favor. The march continued through the entire day and a part of the following night, with an interval of three hours for rest at Boonsborough.
At 12.30 a. m. on Tuesday the regiment bivouacked in the immediate vicinity of Frederick, having accomplished a march of thirty-three miles.

Soon after sunrise the regiment marched into the city, and remained there through the day.
At 7 p. m. we left Frederick by rail and proceeded to Washington, arriving at 6 o’clock on Wednesday morning, June 19. It gives me pleasure to assure the General-in-Chief of the gratification which I feel at the bearing and conduct of the command during this expedition. The fatigues of the way were endured with fortitude, and had any danger threatened I have no doubt that it would have been bravely met. As it is, I cannot avoid the expression of my satisfaction that the object of the expedition in which this regiment participated was attained in safety and without the loss of life. The command is now in an effective condition for the further service of the Government of the United States.

Major-General Banks, Baltimore:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th, and have given it due consideration. The experience of the Department of the operations of home-guard organizations in communities similar to that of Baltimore has been such as to lead to great doubts as to the propriety of them. The subject is, however, under consideration, and shall be fully examined before an adverse determination is arrived at.
In view of the necessity of having cavalry at your command, the forces organized by Colonel Chorman have been accepted with the design of co operating with the Maryland regiment, and they will be at once ordered to be mustered into service if ready. Your views in regard to making Baltimore the place for the instruction of our new levies impress me favorably.

Your note is received. The General-in-Chief directs as follows: It is his intention that the Third Connecticut Regiment and the Second New York, Colonel Tompkins, shall be sent to you this evening. It will not be convenient to send them by steamer, and he directs that the trains, which will be thirty wagons to each, shall leave their camp ground precisely at six o’clock. These trains will carry their knapsacks also. Please to designate where they shall cross the river, and have two guides to each regiment, one for the train and one for the column, to conduct them to their respective encampments. They can be over the river before 8 o’clock p. m.

Hagerstown, Md., June 23,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen. U. 8. Army, Washington City:
Colonel : Up to the present instant I have received from Capt. J. Newton, Engineer Corps, only a report of a part of his reconnaissance of the Maryland Heights and the ground adjacent, made in compliance with the injunctions of the General-in-Chief. I hasten to give the result thus far, expecting to-morrow evening to present the whole.
Captain Newton approached the heights from this side, ascending over rough and steep roads difficult for artillery. The summit he found capable of defense of ample character by about five hundred men. The main difficulty to be overcome is the supply of water; the springs, which a week since afforded an ample supply, have become dry. He found no water within half a mile of the position selected on the heights for an intrenched camp. In Pleasant Valley, on the east, near the base of the mountain, springs are reported to abound; their character will be ascertained to-morrow. Water would have to be hauled from this valley, and he reports the ascent very difficult. In this valley I propose to place the force sustaining that on the heights. The whole command, if the location prove favorable, need not exceed two thousand five hundred men. That force would render the position safe; anything less would invite attack.
The following is what I have to report in relation to the enemy: Deserters from their ranks, some one or more of whom come in daily, all agree in saying the whole of the force originally at Harper’s Ferry (said to have been 25,000 men) is still between Williamsport and Winchester, about 8,000 coming this way on Friday at Martinsburg. The remainder are distributed in a semicircle, and on the route to Winchester, within four hours’ march of the advance. The advance is approaching Falling Waters under the command of General Jackson, who now commands the whole. The force under Jackson controls the people of Berkeley County, whom I believe are sorely oppressed and would welcome our approach. That force has become some little encouraged from our not advancing, and may soon annoy us. If so, I shall not avoid the contest they may invite—indeed, if it meet the approval of the General-in-Chief, I would march my whole force, as soon as the battery receives harness, upon the enemy, and drive him step by step to Winchester. I believe this force can in ten days rid the adjoining portion of Virginia of its oppressors. I may be forced to this course. My fear is that I may interfere with the general plan of the General-in-Chief and drive the enemy to the aid of the main body. They would, however, go as fugitives, to aid in its demoralization. My means of transportation are coming in rapidly.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hdqrs. Department Northeastern Virginia,
Arlington, June 24, 1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters Army :
Colonel : I have the honor to submit the following, in answer to your letter of June 21, in reference to a column to cb-operate from this position with a movement to be made with a portion of Major-General Patterson’s command u to sweep the enemy from Leesburg towards Alexandria.” For a better understanding of what follows, I have the honor to transmit a map, which I have had prepared, showing the position of our troops and of that of the enemy in front of it. There is at Manassas Junction and the places in its front or immediate vicinity a force of from 23,000 to 25,000 infantry and about 2,000 cavalry and a supply of well-provided artillery. The advanced position of this force is at Centreville, Germantown, Fairfax Court-House, and Fairfax Station, the numbers and proportion at each varying from time to time. How much of a force is beyond Manassas Gap, in the valley, and could be brought within the operations here contemplated, I have no means of judging. There is nothing to hinder their coming, and unless they are kept engaged by our troops around Harper’s Ferry, re-enforcements, in case of serious operations from that section would have to be guarded against,, as would also those from places to the south of Manassas, on the line of the railroad to Eichmond or Lynchburg, which would be pressed forward whenever it should become known we were moving upon them or they upon us in any force.
I have not learned that the troops in our front are fully provided with transportation, though I am satisfied they are not so deficient*as we have supposed, and not as much so as we are at this time ourselves, for the Quartermaster-General, after supplying yesterday transportation for two regiments to move each about six miles, had but three horses left.
We have in this department, good, bad, and indifferent, twenty regiments of infantry, giving an aggregate of less than 14,000; four companies of cavalry, giving about 250; one battery of regular artillery of six rifled guns; one battery of volunteer artillery, smooth-bores—an excellent company, but not accustomed to their guns, and hardly fit for service in the field. There are three companies of regular artillery, but they are in the earthworks, and not available for field service. The General-in-Chief was pleased to say he wished I would fight this project of a combined movement to sweep away the enemy from Leesburg towards Alexandria with him step by step. I take advantage of this permission, if, indeed, I do not obey a command, to say that it seems to me the distance between General Patterson’s force and this one is so great, and the line of march each has to take is such (a flank exposed), that, in my view, the force to move from each position should be constituted without reference to material support from the other. I am thought by those for whose judgment I have great respect, and who have been on the ground, to hazard something in having my advanced position so near Falls Church, when it is thrown forward from the right of the line, Fort Corcoran, and there are means of re-enforcing it promptly by the Georgetown turnpike and the railroad to Alexandria.
What would be our position if a movement is made to the right, at this the right bank of the Potomac, towards Leesburg f In the first place, as we are for any such purpose without means of wagon transportation, we should be obliged to repair and use the railroad; but whether this was done or not, we should march with the left flank of

CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—UNION.
the column exposed to attack from their advanced positions, and on getting as far to the right as Vienna, have our line exposed to interruption, for Vienna is nearer to the enemy than it is to Falls Church or the camps on the Georgetown road.
To go farther to the right could not safely be done, even by a force superior to that the enemy can bring against us. I thinkfa glance at the map will show this. Any reverse happening to this raw force, pushed farther along, with the enemy on the flank and rear and an impassable river on the right, would be fatal. I do not think, therefore, it safe to risk anything from this position in the direction of Leesburg farther than Vienna, seven miles by the Leesburg turnpike from Falls Church, and even to go there the force should be large. Vienna could be supplied or re-enforced—
1st. By the Leesburg road from Falls Church.
2d. By the railroad from Alexandria.
3d. By the dirt road from BalPs Cross-Boads.
The first two are liable to interruption unless strongly guarded, and the third is an indifferent road and a long one. The force, then, to go as far as Vienna should be large enough to hold the position for several hours, and should be well supplied with artillery and cavalry and strengthened by such defenses as could be readily thrown up. Vienna being held in force, and offensively, would cover the country from the Difficult Creek well towards Goose Creek from any force of the enemy operating from Manassas Junction or its dependencies, and I have never heard of there being over 500 men, mostly local troops, at Leesburg. As it would be constantly liable to be attacked by all the available force of the enemy and is only a few hours7 march from him, it would be necessary to have strong reserves ready at either Falls Church or the camp of the Ohio brigade.
The force sufficient to hold Vienna cannot well be stated, because of the changes which are taking place in front of us. I do not think it prudent to go there with less than 8,000 infantry, a battery of field regular rifled artillery, with some guns in position, and six companies of cavalry, and the line from Fort Corcoran to General Tyler to be held as strong as at present, and a reserve on that line of 3,000 men $ some of the force to be organized into small field brigades, as heretofore proposed, under regular colonels.

OPERATIONS IN ME)., PA., VA., AND W. VA.
[Chap. IX.
We cannot count on keeping secret our intention to overthrow this force. Even if the many parties intrusted with the knowledge of the plan should not disclose or discover it, the necessary preliminary measures for such an expedition would betray it; and they are alive and well informed as to every movement, however slight, we make. They have, moreover, been expecting us to attack their position, and have been preparing for it. When it becomes known positively we are about to march, and they learn in what strength, they will be obliged to call in their disposable forces from all quarters, for they will not be able, if closely pressed, to get away by railroad before we can reach them. If General J. E. Johnston’s force is kept engaged by Major-General Patterson, and Major-General Butler occupies the force now in his vicinity, I think they will not be able to bring up more than ten thousand men. So we must calculate on having to do with about thirty-five thousand men.
The objective point in our plan is the Manassas Junction. This is covered by the enemy’s troops stationed at Centreville, Germantown, Fairfax Court-House, Fairfax Station, a place between Fairfax Station and Sangster’s, and on the Occoquan. The position at Manassas may be reached by four routes : First, by the Leesburg stone road, Georgetown turnpike, and Loudoun and Hampshire Bailroad, via Falls Church and Vienna; second, by way of the Little Biver turnpike and Fairfax Court-House; third, by way of the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad; fourth, by way of the road south of the Orange and Alexandria road.
There is a fifth approach, from Dumfries or Evansport, by way of Brentsville, a march of about twenty-two miles, but the starting point is too far from the main direct approach to admit of its being used in the first instance without a superabundance of force. The country lying between the two armies is mostly thickly wooded, and the roads leading across it, except the turnpikes and railroads, are narrow, and in places sunken by the wear of travel and wash of rains. This makes it necessary to have the fewest possible number of carriages of any kind, and our forces, therefore, though the distance is short, will have to move over several lines of approach in order to get forward in time a sufficient body to operate with success. The Loudoun and Hampshire road is in working order as far as within five miles of Vienna, and no doubt could soon be repaired to that place. The Orange and Alexandria road, which I propose to look to as the main channel of supply, is now in working order some seven miles out of Alexandria, and from Manassas Junction to within fifteen miles of Alexandria. In the intermediate space the road has been destroyed as effectively as possible, and a long deep cut filled in wTith trees and earth. Nevertheless, all these obstacles can soon be removed with plenty of force and an adequate supply of proper materials.
Leaving small garrisons in the defensive works, I propose to move against Manassas with a force of thirty thousand of all arms, organized into three columns, with a reserve of ten thousand. One column to move from Falls Church or Vienna (preferably the latter), to go between Fairfax Court-House and Centreville, and, in connection with another column moving by the Little Biver turnpike, cut off or drive in (the former, if possible) the enemy’s advanced posts. The third column to move by the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad, and leaving as large a force as may be necessary to aid in rebuilding it, to push on with the remainder to join the first and second columns.
The enemy is said to have batteries in position at several places in his front, and defensive works on Bull Bun and Manassas Junction. I

do not propose that these batteries be attacked, for I think they may all be turned. Bull Bun, I am told, is fordable at almost any place. After uniting the columns this side of it, I propose to attack the main position by turning it, if possible, so as to cut off communications by rail with the South, or threaten to do so sufficiently to force the enemy to leave his intrenchments to guard them; if necessary, and I find it can be done with safety, to move a force as far as Bristoe, to destroy the bridge at that place.
I cannot learn that the enemy has any magazines at the Junction, and I am under the impression he receives his supplies, except fresh beef, from the south by the railroad. I am told that on most of the approaches abatis have been made and other preparations to obstruct the advance of our troops, and, as the roads are mostly through woods, and are narrow, it will be necessary the Army should go, in the first place, as free from baggage as x>ossible—no tents; provisions only in the haversack ; the only wagons being those necessary for carrying axes, spades, and picks, and ammunition for the infantry, and ambulances for the sick and wounded. A subsistence train should be ready in Alexandria to go by the Little Biver turnpike in case the Orange and Alexandria road cannot be repaired, and another should be ready at Vienna, under the guard to be left there, for the use of the column moving from that point, in case it should fail to reach in time the Orange and Alexandria road or the Little Biver turnpike, or the latter should not in time be cleared of the enemy.
Believing the chances are greatly in fa vor of the enemy’s accepting battle between this and the Junction, and that the consequences of that battle will be of the greatest importance to the country, as establishing the prestige in this contest on the one side or the other—the more so as the two sections will be fairly represented by regiments from almost every State—I think it of great consequence that, as for the most part our regiments are exceedingly raw and the best of them, with few exceptions, not over steady in line, they be organized into as many small fixed brigades as the number of regular colonels will admit, these colonels commanding brigades to be assisted by as many regular officers as can be collected for the purpose, so that the men may have as fair a chance as the nature of things and the comparative inexperience of most will allow.
If the three companies of artillery in this department are furnished with batteries, we shall have with the three regular and three volunteer batteries here and in Washington a sufficiency of artillery; though, if the nature of the country did not make it embarrassing, I would, on account of the confidence it gives new troops, have still more. Fortunately, the country is so wooded that, our deficiency in cavalry will be the less felt. We shall need all we have for the ordinary work of escorts, advance pickets, &c. I think every arrangement should be made, that when the columns take up their line of march no step be taken in retreat, but that they should press forward to the ultimate point steadily and determinedly. If they are well led I think they will do so, and with every chance of success.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Headquarters of Army:
Statement of Mr. J-----u, a man on whom I rely:
Arrived at Fairfax Court-House Thursday, 20th instant; found there Prince William company and the Bappahannock—about sixty-five in each company. Friday morning these companies went to Fairfax Station, leaving nobody in the town. Friday night the South Carolina regiments began to come, and Saturday night it was said there were three regiments at the Court-House and another coming; saw the three himself—amounting to about 3,000 men. Started for the Junction about 8.30; went by Germantown and Centreville. At Germantown saw Gregg’s South Carolina regiment—about 1,000. The road between Fairfax and Centreville much obstructed about one mile before you get to the Bald Hill, where there are five cannon planted.
At Centreville, Bonham, of South Carolina, was in command. He had other troops besides his own regiment and the artillery. At Bull Bun there was an entrenchment on the right bank—four guns. Two regiments of South Carolinians stationed there; they had been there but a short time. Bull Bun Crossing is five miles from Centreville and two from Manassas Junction. Arrived at Manassas Junction at 10 o’clock a. m.; saw General Beauregard; staid until 3 p. m.; returned the s^me way he went. On reaching Bull Bull, found the South Carolina regiments had struck their tents, had their wagons packed, and were moving in the direction of Centreville and Fairfax Court-House, taking their four cannon with them, occupying the road for about two miles. Had a difficulty in passing the column. The colonel asked if he had a pass; showed him one from General Beauregard; was then allowed to pass. He was cautioned by the colonel not to speak of movements of troops even to their own men. These regiments did not come to the Court-House. At Centreville things were not as they were when he went through first. At Germantown found Gregg’s regiment had broken up it's camp and moved to the Court-House, and was encamped near the Little Biver turnpike, about one-quarter mile from the Court-House. Learned that Gregg’s place at Germantown had been supplied by another regiment or regiments, and supposes it may have been by those he passed at Bull Bun and those which were on the march to the front.
At Fairfax Station there were about 800 men—Virginians. The South Carolina regiments were all (except one—Spratt’s) about 1,000 men each. Forty of Gregg’s regiment had the measles. The two regiments on the march from Bull Bun had about fifty wagons for their baggage and supplies, old road and farmers’ wagons, five to six horses each. Wagons well crammed up to the bows. The South Carolina regiments were the best armed and equipped and in high spirits, u freezing for a fight,” being much elated by the Vienna affair. Negroes with them as servants. Cavalry, estimated, all told, 1,500; 500 Louisianians and 1,000 Virginians; mounted so-so as to Virginians; those from Louisiana good. Virginia cavalry armed irregularly with double-barreled shot-guns, pistols, fowling-pieces, some carbines, and sabers. Horse furniture indifferent, made up of odds and ends. Louisiana cavalry better in all respects—men, horses, arms, and equipments. The total at the Junction and the places this side he estimated at 20,000, all told.

Saw five guns harnessed at Court-House. Saw five guns at Centreville. Saw four guns at Bull Bun.

Sir : In reply to your application of the 21st instant for the aid ot the Federal Government to repel from Virginia the lawless invaders now perpetrating every species of outrage upon persons and property throughout a large.portion of the State, the President directs me to say that a large additional force will soon be sent to your relief. The full extent of the conspiracy against popular rights which has culminated in the atrocities to which you refer was not known when its first outbreak took place at Charleston. It now appears that it was matured for many years by secret organizations throughout the country, especially in the slave States. By this means, when the President called upon Virginia in April for its quota of troops, then deemed necessary to put it down in the States in which it had shown itself in arms, the call was responded to by an order from the chief confederate in Virginia to his armed followers to seize the navy-yard at Gosport, and the authorities of the State, who had till then shown repugnance to the plot, found themselves stripped of all actual power, and afterwards were manifestly permitted to retain the empty forms of office only because they consented to use them at the bidding of the invaders.
The President, however, never supposed that a brave and free people, though surprised and unarmed, could long be subjugated by a class of political adventurers always adverse to them, and the fact that they have already rallied, reorganized their government, and checked the march of these invaders demonstrates how justly he appreciated them.

Two worthy Quakers, named William Bobinson and James D. Graham, have, it seems, been threatened with violence for no other cause than this.

Governor : As in the course of the military operations of the command now in this department this force may be withdrawn from this vicinity and that of Frederick and Cumberland, leaving the frontier of Pennsylvania unprotected, I consider it my duty to notify you, that you may take such steps as may appear to you proper to be prepared to defend your State from encroachment should the offensive be assumed by the insurgents. As you now have a considerable force of reserve troops, which at any moment the General Government might wish to use for common defense, I trust you will pardon me for suggesting that they be posted at points on the frontier of Pennsylvania which to my mind are the most exposed, and from which at any moment, if the Government desired their services, they could be pushed as Federal troops into this State, or sent by rail to other threatened parts of our country. The places of importance in a military point of view are Bedford, Cham-bersburg, Hanover or Gettysburg, and York. State troops at these points would sustain IT. S. forces in Maryland, and check, in case of their being withdrawn, encroachments from Virginia. York has the additional advantage of supporting Hanover, and of being on an easy line of communication with Washington. At all of them a Federal officer, authorized by the Government, can speedily turn the State into Federal troops, and throw them where they may be required.

As the enemy on breaking up at Harper’s Ferry did not abandon that district of country, but still continues in force between Winchester and the Potomac, observing that river from Harper’s Ferry to Williamsport, I deem it best that you should with your column remain in his front, and if, as is supposed, with superior or equal numbers, that you should cross the river and offer him battle; but if the enemy should retire upon his resources at Winchester it is not enjoined that you should pursue him to that distance from your base of operations without a well-grounded confidence in your continued superiority.
A secondary object to which your attention is invited is a combined operation upon Leesburg between a portion of your troops and the column of Colonel Stone, at and (possibly) above the Point of Rocks, in order to occupy and to hold that village, the center of a wealthy district, abounding in friends of the Union. As I write I learn from Colonel Stone that the enemy has just re-enforced Leesburg up to about 1,600 men, and may increase that number. Inquire.

I wrote by mail in substance. Remain in front of the enemy while he continues in force between Winchester and the Potomac. If you are in superior or equal force, you may cross and offer him battle. If the enemy should retire upon his resources at Winchester, it is not enjoined that you should pursue him to that distance from your base of operations without a w^ell-grounded confidence in your continued superiority. Your attention is invited to a secondary object—a combined operation on Leesburg between a portion of your troops and the column of Colonel Stone, at and probably above Point of Rocks, to hold that village.

Maj. Gen. George Cadwalader,
Commanding, Williamsport, Md.:
General : The commanding-general desires information of the location of the enemy on the opposite side of the river. To aid in obtaining it he sends Captain Simpson to you, and for the same purpose authorizes you to retain Captain Newton. This information is to determine the importance of crossing the river and offering battle or the possibility of cutting off any considerable body of their army. He purposes, with a part or all of his available force, to cross the river east of Falling Waters and to rout such portions of the enemy as may be near the point of crossing; to attack the force stationed near the junction of the Shep-herdstown road with that from Williamsport to Martin sburg; to turn upon the enemy stationed on the Neck, and recross at the ford near Williamsport. Though wishing specially the character and number of the, fords east of Williamsport, the same information of those west is important, in order to make a diversion, and perhaps his main attack on that side.
Lest a reconnaissance should draw the enemy in force from Bunker Hill in time to strengthen the body between this and Martinsburg, the general desires the information obtained as secretly as possible, employing spies to go into Virginia and testing the fords at night, by intelligent persons, swimming, &c. He designs to cross with a force which will render success certain. Other information may be obtained in seeking for that desired, which may tend to change this plan or to mature it, and therefore the general desires the officers not to confine themselves to this. As soon as possible, after sufficient information is obtained, the general wishes Captains Newton and Simpson to report to him. He only awaits the arrival of harness for Perkins7 battery and this information to act.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
F. J. POETEB, Assistant Adjutant-General.

From information received to-day, I renew request that two Pennsylvania State regiments, now near Cumberland, be directed on Cumberland and Piedmont. If possible, some guns and cavalry.

Colonel : I have just received the inclosed letter from General Neg-ley, saying that he is informed the enemy are preparing to cross the river at Harper’s Ferry. I have no reason for doubting the fact, other than I think their main force is near Bunker Hill, say 7,000 or 8,000 men, and the remainder, with perhaps the greater part of the artillery and cavalry, south of Falling Waters, say perhaps 5,000 men. The artillery, said to be seventeen 6-pounders, are rifled brass pieces, as is said by an intelligent deserter here and confirmed by one other source. I have written to General Negley to say I will support him at once on hearing that the enemy have actually crossed the river.

The enemy being superior in number, 15,000, with twenty-two guns, and having just assumed a threatening attitude and location, I would not be warranted under the orders of the General-in-Chief in crossing the river with my single battery, raw and immovable for want of harness. Send me the Ehode Island regiment and battery, or one or more batteries in condition for service, and I will cross on their arrival. If you will send regulars it will add to the obligation. Unless the force in front is dispersed or driven back, I cannot well carry out the judicious suggestionof moving on Leesburg.

General Jackson, and a reserve of 5,500 men under General Johnston near Bunker Hill. He also reports twenty to twenty-four guns and a large cavalry force with General Jackson, and thinks that General Neg-ley, whose brigade is on my left, near Sharpsburg, will be attacked—the river being fordable at almost every point. To meet this force of 15,000 men, with twenty-two guns, and nearly 1,000 cavalry, I have about 10,000 volunteer infantry, and 650 cavalry and artillery, the latter being nearly all recruits. The horses are untrained and we are still without harness for the battery.
I have repeatedly asked tor batteries, and ought to have one for each brigade, but have none. The only one fit for service sent me was the Bhode Island Battery, and that the General-in-Chief was compelled, by the necessities of his own position, to take from me when most wanted, and within a week after it joined me. I have neither cavalry nor artillery sufficient to defend the fords of the river between Harper’s Ferry and Hancock, but I would much rather attack than defend, and would have far more confidence in the result. While I will not on my own responsibility attack, without artillery, a superior force, I will do so cheerfully and promptly if the General-in-Chief will give me an explicit order to that effect.
To insure success, I respectfully, but earnestly, request that the troops taken from me when Washington was menaced be sent to me with all speed, with a number of field guns equal to those of the insurgents. I will then be enabled to choose my point of attack, offer battle to the enemy, and, I trust, drive them before me, clearing the valley in front, and taking such position as the General-in-Chief may indicate.
I respectfully suggest that Colonel Stone’s column be sent me, with other re-enforcements, and venture to add that the sooner I am reenforced with reliable troops and abundant field artillery the better. I am making arrangements for crossing the river, and will do so without waiting for orders or re-enforcements, if I find that the strength of the enemy has been overrated.
I beg to, remind the General-in-Chief that the period of service of nearly all the troops here will expire within a month, and that if we do not meet the enemy with them, we will be in no condition to do so for three months to come. The new regiments will not be fit for service before September, if then, and meanwhile this whole frontier will be exposed.
I have got my command into as good condition as I could expect in so short a time. Officers and men are anxious to be led against the insurgents, and if the General-in-Chief will give me a regiment of regulars and an adequate force of field artillery I will cross the river and attack the enemy, unless their forces are ascertained to be more than two to one.
I beg you to assure the General-in-Chief of my sincere desire to sustain him faithfully, and to promote, by all the resources at my command, the success of his general plan of operations.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

merits called for by bis excellency tbe President of tbe United States from tbe State of Virginia are now in tbe field under tbe direction of Major-General McClellan.
Tbe first regiment was of tbe three months’ volunteers. They have received guns, &c., but no tents. I think if they now bad tents, tbe most if not all of that regiment would enlist for three years.
The second regiment for three years is full, but they are without arms and equipments. A large number of this regiment are from the mountain region of Western Virginia. It is important to have them in the field as soon as possible, on account of their knowledge of the country. Permit me to urge the importance of sending arms, tents, and equipments immediately for this regiment. I would also observe that the First Regiment has yet no knapsacks.
1 have also two companies of cavalry, of one hundred men each, ready to muster into the service. They are much needed. They are also gathered from the mountain region 5 well acquainted with the country. You will please send arms for them. They are all marksmen, and have been accustomed to the use of the rifle.
It gives me great pleasure to assure you that our Union men are entering into the spirit of the work with great energy; and when they learn that our government is recognized at Washington, it will strengthen Union men and stop cavilers. Our people will give the United States all the aid they can spare from defending their families and property from their secession neighbors, many of whom have imbibed the spirit of their leaders.
I am in receipt of information from every part of Western Virginia, from the most intelligent and influential citizens, of their high approval of the action [of] our Convention and of their determination to sustain it.

Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott,
Commander-in- Chief Army of the United States:
Sir : I have the honor to call your attention to the present condition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway. By a written communication received to-night from the roadmaster, I am informed that parties of the enemy have recently examined the trestles, bridges, &c., with a view to further destruction. My informant asserts that he is threatened, if the slightest attempt is made to repair the trestles, greater injuries to the road will follow. The company, however, is prepared to reconstruct the road on our promise to protect it. The injured road being beyond the limits of this department, I can only say that 1 regard the reconstruction of it necessary to our operations here. There is a strong Union feeling along the route, especially in Hampshire and Morgan Counties, which only awaits protection to practically develop itself, companies in that vicinity being x>repared to muster into service. Under these circumstances, by ordering down the Pennsylvania troops, the war frontier would be moved towards the South, and our left flank be so protected that we could continue our operations of advance with greater alacrity, more expeditiously, extending them to the Kanawha.

The necessity of the continual detachment of bodies of troops to watch the enemy on the left being obviated, we could throw a greater force on the more prominent points of attack. The opening of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, the protection of a Union sentiment wherever manifested, and the importance of guarding the base of our operations alike point to the apparent necessity of the measure indicated, which, I trust, will appear a sufficient excuse for presenting it to your attention.

Hagerstown, Md., June 29,1861. Col. E. I). Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen.j Washington City:
Colonel : I inclose, for the information of the General-in-Chief, Captain Newton’s report of his examination of the Maryland Heights. The report is not as full as I desired it to be, due to its being rapidly made, in consequence of having to send him off suddenly. From conversation with him and information I gain from residents, I am convinced the occupation of the heights would be attended with great labor, and unless a strong force be placed in Pleasant Valley to keep open comm ideations with water, it cannot be held at this season by any command opposed.
I inclose also a communication from Captain Newton, relating to the reoccupation of these heights. I do not think the information reliable. Considerable force has been seen in the vicinity of Shepherdstown.
I arranged to-day to advance into Virginia on Monday. This is the earliest I can move with artillery, without which I deem it very imprudent to cross the river, with information of a large opposing force close at hand. I expect to drive the enemy from our vicinity, and, should it appear advisable, will push to Winchester. If the enemy have retired (which his demonstrations may have prepared for), you will next hear of my approach to you.

[Inclosnres.]
Hagerstown, Md., June 25,1861. Maj. F. J. Porter, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I have the honor to report the result of my examination of Maryland Heights (Elk Ridge).
I ascended first the western slope by the county road leading to Solomon’s Gap; thence I proceeded on the summit four miles to the southern extremity of the ridge. This road requires extensive repairs for heavy hauling for a distance of about four miles.
The top of the ridge is covered with a small growth of timber and brushwood, and is difficult of penetration. An easy defense could be made by cutting down the timber and brush across the summit for about two hundred yards in width, and forming behind this obstruction a light parapet, having the interior slope stockaded, the stockade to be high enough to protect the heads of the men when standing on the banquette, and to be loop-holed. Other stockaded parapets may be erected whenever a more minute examination may render it necessary and at

those points where the access up the sides of the mountain may be convenient to an enemy. The portion of the heights to be occupied by us should extend about one and three-fourths miles from the southern extremity of the ridge, with the object of protecting our supplies of water from the base of the mountain at the foot of the eastern slope and distant about one and one-quarter miles from the southern extremity of the ridge. Our principal defense should be felling trees, &c., on the sides and slopes of the mountain and on the summit wherever an approach would be practicable. We should also occupy below the base of the slope, where our supplies of water are to be drawn. The mountain affords capabilities for a strong defense, but from the extent of ground to be occupied, the condition of the roads, and the necessity of hauling water and stores up the mountain, much inconvenience may be experienced, and a certain amount of time also will be expended in completing the defenses.
The ascent of the eastern slope is through Solomon’s Gap, by a road larger and steeper than by the corresponding road from the western side, and also by a road constructed by the enemy and leading up from Sandy Hook. The latter road is not too steep, but is very rough, hav-iug large stones live or six feet long in many places directly in the road. The same is true in a measure of all other roads upon the mountain. The rocks are said by those who have made roads on the mountain to be generally detached, and not to form a part of a ledge.
It is impossible to state what amount of force could be detailed from the Army at this period, with the necessity also of watching closely the enemy, to construct the necessary defenses. My estimate is that two thousand men are necessary to occupy the mountain and the eastern slope, and it would require two thousand men to work about ten days in order to put everything in condition to make a vigorous defense.
The extent and rugged nature of the ground examined and the close growth of timber and brush rendered it impossible to take measures, and the distances are accordingly taken from maps, guides, and from personal observation, without the use of instruments.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

My Dear Major: From all the information as yet received the enemy has recrossed the river at Harper’s Ferry on flats and boats and occupied the Maryland Heights with two regiments—said to be the Kentucky and Mississippi—numbering together about two thousand men.
First. The express arrived at General Cadwalader’s at 3 a. m. from this camp. I considered it best at the time for me to come over here, and accordingly here I am.
Second. Is this movement made to mask Johnston’s retreat ?
Third. Is it to secure his flank while he marches against Stone ?
Fourth. Has he been re-enforced, as has been asserted, and is this the first offensive movement on his part? He is likewise said to have a number of rifled cannon, a deserter asserting that the balls are not round, but flat at one end and egg-shaped at the other.

Fifth. His position now threatening all communication with Stone, is it not necessary to effect this junction at all hazards ?
General Cadwalader thinks, and it may be the case, that the present movement is a feint, while the real point of attack is to be our right. Unless he (the enemy) is decidedly superior in force, such an intention would scatter his forces over too long a line. This is per contra to General Cadwalader’s opinion.
If General Negley is to maintain his present position it would be well to send to-day some crow-bars (20), 30 axes, 30 picks, and 40 shovels, consigned to the brigade quartermaster, with directions to him to receipt for them, and to use them for no other purpose except intrenching.

Sir : I have the honor to report that yesterday my scouts captured an enemy’s picket about five miles from Newport News, and from letters found at their quarters it appears that General Magruder left Yorktown on Tuesday last with the intention of attacking the post at Newport News; that he advanced within three miles of the News without baggage, tents, or trains, and stopped overnight on the road near the site of Little Bethel, and in the midst of a drenching rain. He had with him two regiments of Carolina troops, a regiment of Louisiana zouaves, a howitzer battalion from Richmond, and some two hundred or two hundred and fifty horsemen. After advancing so as to be almost within reach of our pickets at Newport News he changed his course up the James River, and was yesterday encamped at Young’s Mills, between eleven and twelve miles from Newport News, near Mulberry Point.
Acting in consultation with my engineers, I have advanced the two

Massachusetts regiments into the town of Hampton, and directed [them] to extend their pickets as far as New Market Bridge, and to hold the road to Newport News, that being at the corner of the road, seven miles from that post, so as to be ready to act in conjunction with my forces there in case of an attack, and also to hold the peninsula of Elizabeth City County, in the neighborhood of Fort Monroe, thus keeping open communication to Newport News both by land and water. I have further to report the arrest of Colonel Allen, of the First New York Volunteers, under the following state of facts:
There was a wheat held of some twenty-five acres belonging to the Twine estate, owned by a widow and some minor heirs, as I am informed. The occupants had received a written safeguard upon taking the oath of allegiance and giving parole not in any way to aid, counsel, or advise the enemies of the United States. Colonel Allen, against express orders, crossed the creek near Hampton by the police guard there stationed. A small detachment of his men proceeded to the ground, arrested the parties for no other offense, as he states, save that they were getting the wheat, and sent them, six in number, to Fort Monroe and to my headquarters (which was also against orders), and ordered the wheat field to be set on fire, which was done, and the crop consumed. Upon report of these facts by General Pierce in the form of charges against Colonel Allen, and upon other charges affecting his personal habits, substantially verified by evidence, I caused him to be arrested and held for trial. I have caused enlisted men to be punished for the destruction of private property, and I believe this act of Colonel Allen was a most unnecessary, not to say wanton, destruction and waste. The place where it happened was wholly within our control, and if there had been any attempt at an improper use being made of the wheat, it might easily have been brought within our camp and served some good purpose at least. I trust that this action will receive the approbation of the General Commanding, because it has become necessary, in order to prevent such destruction and waste of the jiroperty of our enemies even as will disgrace us.
When I last had the pleasure and honor of an interview with the Lieutenant-General Commanding, I was assured that Major Mackall would be detailed as assistant adjutant-general as soon as he returned from the Pacific coast. I am now using the services (and necessarily) without compensation of the adjutant of this post. I pray leave to call the attention of the General to this fact, and to ask that Major Mackall, or some assistant adjutant-general, may be detailed here.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

To General G. B. McClellan, Grafton, Va.:
Sir : Inclosed I send you a slip from the Cincinnati Gazette. I learn there were two men taken—Messrs. Miller and Wagner.
I propose that we occupy Point Pleasant.
There are 3,500 secession troops at Charleston, fifty*two miles from Point Pleasant. Can we not take the regiment from Gallipolis and send him some other forces, and let them intrench themselves at Point Pleasant, if necessary ? I have received intelligence in the last few days that they can raise a regiment in that neighborhood of Virginia troops if they had a rallying point.
I have an offer of a regiment from Pittsburgh to come into the service, unconditionally, for three years. The gentleman offering says he can be ready in a week. We could place that regiment there. Can you not spare Captain Daum, who is here in camp yet, with his artillery, to join that movement ?
I can procure artillery and ammunition at Pittsburgh for Captain Daum, if you need what he has here, if you can do without the company.
My dear sir, I deem it a matter of great importance to commence a movement in that direction, even if we have to encamp them on the Ohio side until we get strong enough to take position on the Virginia.
Yours, in haste,
F. H. PEIBPOINT.
P. S.—My impression is that the object of Wise in his trip towards Parkersburg is to make a dash at the Northwestern Virginia Bailroad and burn up the bridges, by dashing at different points with his cavalry.
I have just learned that there were many of the Union men with their families driven into Ohio from Jackson County—from Bavenswood and that vicinity. It is also stated—for the truth of which I cannot vouch— that a regiment from Ohio passed into Virginia at Point Pleasant.
Yours, &c.,

Colonel Norton, of the First Begiment State troops at Gallipolis, telegraphed the governor to day that on Saturday night a mounted party of fifty men came from Charleston, Va., to Point Pleasant, headed by A. G. Jenkins, and took some of the most prominent Union men there prisoners and marched them off. Colonel Norton started with a hundred men in pursuit, but could not overtake them. He then scoured the country, and took thirty prominent secessionists prisoners, whom he now holds as hostages for the safety of the Union menin hands of the rebels. Norton says there are 3,500 rebels now at Charleston, under command of Hawes.

Col. H. H. Lockwood :
Sir : As a part of the command stationed on the line of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, we deem it but right and proper to make known to you the heroic conduct of the daughter of Mr. Bowman, the keeper of the bridge at this place, on the night of the burning of the bridge by Trimble and his men. From Mr. Smith, the master carpenter of the road, and others who were present on the occasion, we have learned the following particulars:
When the train bearing the bridge-burners had crossed the bridge, and Trimble had drawn his men in line immediately in front of Mr. Bowman’s house, the object of their coming was announced in the hearing of Miss Jane by Trimble himself. She pronounced him a coward, and in a loud voice called upon the men, who had been armed by the road and placed there to protect the bridge, to defend it, and when she saw these men throw away their arms, some of them taking to the woods and others hiding within her father’s house, she called upon them again not to run, but to stand fast and show themselves to be men. At this time, seeing one of the pistols lying upon the floor of the porch, which had been thrown away by one of the bridge-guards, she picked it up and ran with it. Meeting Mr. Smith she gave it to him, saying at the same time, “Use it; if you will not, I will.”
Another evidence of the wonderful courage and presence of mind of Miss Jane was shown in her anxiety for the safety of one of the men employed by her father to assist him in taking care of the bridge. This man was on the draw at the time the firing of the bridge commenced. Miss Jane was the first to think of him, and promptly called upon her father, or some one, to go for him in a boat, saying, “If no one else will go, I will.”
In conclusion, permit us to say that such heroism in a young lady as shown in the conduct of Miss Bowman on this occasion has rarely been met with anywhere, and, in our opinion, should not be suffered to go unrewarded.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
I have the honor to report that the term of enlistment of the Third and Fourth Massachusetts Regiments, three months’ men, expires by limitation to morrow, and I have made arrangements to have them sent to Boston as the place of rendezvous. I had some doubt whether, as they were mustered into the service of the United States at Fort Monroe, that might not be considered their place of rendezvous; but learning from the colonels that they claimed their rendezvous at Boston, and as it would at best make but two or three days’ difference in their term of service, and as there would be saved to the United States a very large amount of traveling fees over and above the cost of transportation, being, as near as I can reckon it, about twenty dollars per man, I have caused transportation and three days’ rations to be furnished them, in order that they may be mustered out of service at Boston.
These two regiments were armed with the improved rifle muskets, while most of my regiments are armed with the issue of 1844, altered to percussion. Believing that these arms were distributed to the States under the act of Congress only to be used in the service of the Union, I have supposed that it was competent, as it was certainly desirable, to have them kept here, and therefore I have directed that all rifled muskets that will pass inspection of the ordnance officer at this post in the hands of the three-months’ men be exchanged for the altered flint-lock muskets of 1844, and I propose to distribute these rifled muskets to the most deserving and best drilled troops. I also propose to have returned to my assistant quartermaster by the three-months’ men such tents and camp equipage as they have received from the United States, and allow them to take back with them such as has been furnished by the State of Massachusetts. I trust these dispositions will meet the approbation of the Commanding General.
It will be observed that by the return home of these men at least a thousand of the most effective of my troops are withdrawn from our forces, and I beg to call your attention to the fact that within fifteen days the First Vermont Regiment, three-months’ men, 750 strong, being one of the best regiments here, will be entitled to a discharge. I would respectfully ask if the exigencies of the service will not permit other regiments, now being raised in Massachusetts or elsewhere, to be ordered here to take the place of those withdrawn by the expiration of enlistment.
I have further the honor to report that in a skirmish between Newport News and Warwick, by a patroling party numbering twenty-five, of Colonel Hawkins’ regiment, under command of Captain Hammell, and a detachment of Louisiana volunteers, numbering one hundred and fifty, under the command of Colonel De Russy, late of the U. S. Army, Colonel De Russy and one other officer of the rank of captain, name unknown, were killed, and seven men wounded. No one was injured upon our side.
I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

The commanding general has experienced much embarrassment during the progress of this campaign from the want of early information regarding the movements of distant detachments within his command.
The success of the operations of the main column are in a great degree intimately connected with and dependent upon the subordinate auxiliary detachments, and unless the commanding general is kept constantly advised of the exact condition of those commands the service must suffer.
In view of this it is directed that all commanders of detachments and posts in Western Virginia make daily reports to these headquarters, showing the true state of their commands, all movements of the enemy, and such other information as it may be important for the commanding general to know.
These daily reports will be forwarded by the most expeditious methods of communication.

In view of the large call of the President for troops, and of the probable demands for operations in my department, I would respectfully urge upon the General-in-Chief the propriety of accepting for three years’ service the Ninth Regiment of Ohio State troops now in this department, instead of forming four regiments from among them, as is now contemplated by existing orders. Much valuable time and a great deal of annoyance and ill-feeling would be saved by this course, by which also I think the mass of the men may be retained for the three-years’ service. I also ask the authority to send recruiting parties to fill these regiments to the maximum standard. I am emboldened to make this request by the necessities of the service. I also ask authority to muster into the three-years’ service Burdsal’s company of Ohio Cavalry, now serving with me under the State organization. An early reply by telegraph is requested.

Your suggestions in respect to Staunton would be admirable, like your other conceptions and acts, with support. McDowell yesterday drove the enemy beyond Fairfax Court-House. He will attack the intrenched camp at the Manassas Junction to-day. Beaten there, the enemy may retreat both upon Richmond and the Shenandoah Yalley, where Patterson is doing nothing. He will lose eighteen regiments by discharges in about a week. I may re-enforce him in that time sufficiently to enable you, with him, to bag Johnston in that valley if the latter has not been permitted to send his principal force to Beauregard. If you come to Staunton, and McDowell’s victory at the Junction be complete, he may, with Patterson, give you a hand about Winchester. I will telegraph you again to-day.

Hardly had we arrived at this place when, to the horror of every right-minded person, several houses were broken open and others were in flames by the act of some of those who, it has been the boast of the loyal, came here to protect the oppressed and free the country from the domination of a hated party.

The services of this regiment have been so important, its good conduct so general, its patience under privations so constant, its state of efficiency so good, that the departure of the regiment at this time can only be considered an important loss to the Army.
Fully recognizing the right of the regiment to its discharge and payment at the time agreed upon when it was mustered into the service, and determined to carry out literally the agreement of the Government in this respect, the general commanding, nevertheless, requests the regiment to continue in service a few days longer, pledginghimself that the postponement of the date of muster out of service shall not exceed two weeks.

General Winfield Scott:
Your telegraph of 8 p. m. received. I am much pained at its contents. My three-months’ men are homesick and discontented with their officers, and determined to return at once. When I suggested the Staunton movement I expected these regiments to unite in it. I should be compelled to fight the enemy now ascertained in force at Monterey, and should reach Staunton without men enough to accomplish much. McDowell’s check would greatly increase my difficulties and render numerous detachments necessary to keep open my communications and protect my flanks. How would it meet your views were I to leave, say, four regiments at Huttonsville and in the strong position of Cheat Mountain, one at Beverly, one at Bulltown, and send two or three and a better general to re-enforce Cox, then move with the rest by railroad to New Creek, on Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, find effect a junction with Pat* terson near Jamesburg, on the road from New Creek to Charlestown % With this force, in addition to such State troops as Pennsylvania can furnish, we should be able either to defeat Johnston or separate him from Beauregard, and, connecting with McDowell, fight them in detail. I shall know early to morrow the exact condition of the three-years’ regiments now in Ohio and Indiana. Depending upon that information, I can join Patterson with probably fifteen thousand men besides such as Pennsylvania can furnish. The time required would be about seven days, perhaps six, from the day on which I receive your orders until the junction with Patterson at Jamesburg. This, though not so brilliant a plan as a movement on Staunton, appears to me the sounder and safer one. Whatever your instructions may be, I will do my best to carry them out. I will suspend all further preparations for my projected movement on Kanawha until I hear from you. Please reply by telegraph at once.

I have been to the encampment of the Twenty-second Pennsylvania, whose term expired yesterday, and the men consent to continue in service a week longer. The Thirteenth New York resolved unanimously this morning to go home to-morrow.

They might be willing to remain if they could be sent to Washington and another regiment substituted for them. They contend that their term of service is ended now.

If they are entered by any unusual number of persons, or if any attempt is made to move the arms in case they are secreted there, as conjectured^ the whole police force, aided by the military, will be called out. In half an hour two regiments can be concentrated at either point.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
Dear Sir : Your orders directing four and one-half regiments to be sent to Washington, via Baltimore, were received at 2 o’clock this morning. Believing that the exigency required promptness, I have sent forward the California regiment, Colonel Baker, and the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Regiments New York Volunteers, making an aggregate force of about four thousand men. These regiments are among the very best I have, and, with the exception of their equipments, will compare favorably with any other volunteers in the service.
The General will'perceive that this reduction of my forces here leaves it impossible to take up or hold any advanced position. Newport News, where I have an intrenched camp, and a very important point in my

judgment, will be in great danger of attack from Yorktown and Warwick, where the Confederates are now concentrating troops across James River from Smithfield to Warwick.
From the very best sources of information I can get there are about eight thousand men at Yorktown, and some ten thousand at Norfolk and vicinity. Might I suggest that we here now are too few for safety, unless under the guns of the fort, and too many for comfort or health even within the fort 1
Would it not be better, if no offensive movement is intended from this quarter, to withdraw three regiments and a light battery, which I have just mounted, leaving about two thousand men for a garrison, which I remember the Commanding General remarked would be a sufficient number 1
I ask direction upon the point whether I shall hold Newport News or withdraw the troops from it. It will be at once occupied by the enemy when we leave it. It will be recollected that the Vermont regiment will be entitled to return home in a week from date. I trust my action will meet the approval of the Commanding General.
I have now no brigadier, and my senior colonels, with the exception of Colonel Phelps, who will be away by limitation of time in a few days, are with the withdrawing regiments.
I have the honor to be, most truly, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLEE, Major-General, Commanding.
Harper’s Ferry.—(Received July 26, 1861.)
Colonel Townsend :
Received dispatch. Twenty thousand men is the least force that can hold this place against a probable attack. There are three points that must be held—Loudoun Heights, Maryland Heights, and the plateau beyond the village of Bolivar that commands the road to Winchester. If the enemy has possession of either one, it will command the town. If attacked with our present force we shall secure the Maryland Heights, which will make the town absolutely untenable by the enemy and cover our line of communication. Orders have been sent to Hagerstown to have the stores ready for removal if attack is threatened in that direction. We are sending as far as convenient the regimental wagons across the ferry for safety. No indications of a movement of the enemy is seen here, but various reports of his intentions.
There is no doubt that the local cavalry scouts are busy in impressing men into service of the rebels, but that is all we know with certainty. The remaining three months’ force is unreliable.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
Sir : I have the honor to report that by adding four steamers of my own to the steamers furnished by the Bay Line I was enabled to get off the forces mentioned in my report of yesterday, with the exception of four hundred men, who go forward in the boat to-night. I have been obliged to abandon the village of Hampton and withdraw the regiments that I have here under the walls of the fort. I beg leave further to report that upon advising with Colonel Phelps I have concluded to hold Newport News until I get instructions from the General Commanding. I have also the honor to ask instructions as to the disposition to be made of some twenty-five prisoners that I have taken—some in conveying intelligence to the enemy; some in supplying them with provisions, and all of whom refuse to take the oath of allegiance, or take it with reservation. I have no power to try them ; it would be dangerous to allow them to escape, and I am guarding and feeding them at Fort Calhoun.
It becomes my duty to report that Colonel Duryea, commanding Fifth New York Begiment, took with him certain negro slaves to Washington. They are reported nine in number. This was done against my express orders, and after a portion of them had been detained by my provost-marshal. This is a question of difficulty with departing regiments, and one upon which I ask instructions. I will forward to Colonel Baker, as senior officer commanding, the official returns as soon as they reach me.
Awaiting instructions, I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

No officer nor soldier, nor person employed in the service of the United States, shall enter the houses or inclosures of inhabitants of Western Virginia without permission from the owners thereof, except in cases of absolute necessity, nor shall they use threats or intimidation to obtain such consent.

Two Pennsylvania regiments and one Indiana arrived, making nine war regiments now here. In view of our reduced force and the probabilities of attack, which, however uncertain, can not be disregarded, I have placed our force chiefly on the Maryland side. We are too weak to defend, yet so strong as to make retreat across the ford impossible if necessary. Commanding officers unanimous in recommending this movement. We occupy the town and the heights commanding it absolutely, and with our increasing forces and the immediate erection of a temporary bridge we shall be ready for any movement you may order.
N. P. BANKS.
Department of the Shenandoah,
HarperJs Ferry, Va., July 29, 1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General, &c.:
Sir: I telegraphed you this morning the position we had taken. Our force was reduced, with the exception of the battery of Major Doubleday, to five or six thousand men. Reports were received constantly of advancing forces of the rebels, and, although proving in the end to be unfounded, we could not disregard them. So strongly did these rumors come to us, that one of the officers on Saturday evening, at 5.30 o’clock, believed that he saw several regiments crossing the Shenandoah above Keys’ Ford. In momentary expectation of attack, with a force wholly incompetent to defend against any considerable number, we were also compelled to recognize the fact that, with our force of six thousand, and the volunteers whose terms were daily expiring, and more than three hundred baggage-wagons, it would be utterly impossible to cross by the ferry without destruction. The ferry was likely to be made impassable by threatened rains. We sent our disposable baggage-wagons across on Saturday. Yesterday we moved the chief part of our troops across, taking a very strong position in Pleasant Valley, a little below Sandy Hook. Our troops still occupy the town, and we planted batteries on the plateau opposite the town, and another on the summit of the Maryland Heights, to which there are good mountain roads. These will make the town of Harper’s Ferry and the Loudoun Heights, on the south of the Shenandoah, absolutely untenable to the enemy, whether in large or small force. We are so placed that we can attack the enemy if he advances, support our batteries if assailed, prevent the occupation of the town by the rebels, and secure against all chances our communication with our lines.

commanding officer agreed in the necessity of this movement. We here have also good opportunity to organize and discipline our forces.
I have thus stated our position fully, that you may be enabled to change it as the public interests may require. With our increasing forces we shall be able to execute any orders that the Commander-in-Ohief may desire at once. I do not apprehend attack immediately, but we are in readiness.
Captain Reynolds, of the Rhode Island Battery, reached us this morning with his men. Captain Tompkins will be at once relieved. We need very much another rifled gun for Major Doubleday’s battery, in return for which we can send, if necessary, one of the 24-pounder guns.
We have no reliable news of the advance of the rebels. There are some five thousand militia at Winchester, with the sick left by Johnston. Indications of movements in the direction of Leesburg seem more important, but yet not decided.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
NATH. P. BANKS, Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, July 29, 1861.
Capt, G. Stoneman:
Sir : In conformity with your request, I transmit an informal statement of the present condition of the artillery south of the Potomac.
Fort Corcoran, above Arlington, with its two redoubts, has an armament of twelve 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, seven 24-pounder barbette guns, two 12-pounder field guns, and two 24-pounder howitzers. About two hundred light artillerists, under Captains Carlisle and Ayres, are at these works; also the German regiment (De Kalb), which has in its ranks many artillerists.
Fort Albany, on the Fairfax road, has eighteen guns, of various caliber (twelve being 24-pounders), Griffin’s and Edwards’ companies light artillery, and a Massachusetts regiment.
Fort Runyon, at the forks of the Alexandria and Fairfax roads (end of Long Bridge), one 30-pounder Parrott rifled gun, eight 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, ten 32-pounders, and four 6-pounder field guns. Garrison—Colonel Rogers’ Twenty-fifth New York: artillery officer in charge—Captain Seymour, Fifth Artillery.
Fort Ellsworth, Alexandria, two 30-pounder and two 10-pounder Parrott rifles, twelve 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, four 24-pounder siege guns, one 24-pounder field howitzer, three 6-pounder guns. Garrison—Captain Arnold’s light company, one hundred and twenty men, and Seventeenth New York, Colonel Lansing.
The supply of ammunition for these forts, although not complete, is sufficient for an emergency, averaging about one hundred rounds per gun, and the amount is being increased as rapidly as possible.
The field batteries are in a very unsatisfactory condition, many of them, but as fast as the materials can be procured they are refitting.
Platt has four light 12-pounders, 107 men, in good condition; Tidball has two 6-pounders, two 12-pounder howitzers, 127 men, in good condition 5 Greene has four Parrott 10-pounders, rifled, 130 men, in good condition ) Carlisle has 100 men, no guns; Arnold has 120 men, no guns; Ayres has two 6-pounders, two 12-pounder howitzers, 120 men $ Ed-

wards has two 10-pounder Parrott guns, 75 men $ Griffin has one 10-pounder, rifled, 120 men.
Platt and Griffin are to have two additional light 12-pounders each. They will soon be ready for issue from the arsenal. There are five 10-pounder rifles now preparing. Three will be given to Griffin and two to Tidball, and others are being prepared for issue. When the guns, howitzers, &c., are received, the batteries will be composed as follows: Platt, six light 12-pounders; Tidball, Greene, and Ayres, four 10-pounder Parrotts and two 12-pounder howitzers each; Carlisle and Edwards, two 20-pounder Parrotts and two 24-pounder howitzers each; Griffin, four 10-pounder Parrotts and two light 12-pounders; Arnold, four 6-pounder guns and two 12-pounder howitzers.
I further propose to equip Captain Bookwood’s company, of Yon Stein wehr’s German regiment, with four 6-pounder guns and two 12-pounder howitzers. Captain Bookwood brought off the Yarian battery from the field—that is, the guns and one caisson—when that battery was abandoned by its company. His company has a number of German artillerists, and he can easily fill up with instructed men from the brigade of German regiments (Blenker’s) to which I propose the battery be attached.
The German regiments contain a number of artillery officers and soldiers. I suggested the propriety of placing, for the present at least, those regiments in the forts, that the guns may be served by drafts from the instructed men. One company, Captain Morozowicz’s, of the De Kalb regiment, is composed almost exclusively of old German artillery soldiers, and should there be a lack of field artillery, could readily be made available.
Respectfully, &c.,
HEKRY J. HUNT, Brevet Major, and Chief of Artillery.

The general commanding the division has, with much regret, observed that large numbers of officers and men stationed in the vicinity of Washington are in the habit of frequenting the streets and hotels of the city.
This practice is eminently prejudicial to good order and military discipline, and must at once be discontinued.
The time and services of all persons connected with this division should be devoted to their appropriate duties with their respective commands. It is therefore directed that hereafter no officer or soldier be allowed to absent himself from his camp and visit Washington, except for the performance of some public duty, or for the transaction of important private business, for which purposes written permits will be given by the commanders of brigades. The permit will state the object of the visit.
Brigade commanders will be held responsible for the strict execution of this order.
Col. Andrew Porter, Sixteenth IT. S. Infantry, is detailed for temporary duty as provost-marshal in Washington, and will be obeyed and respected accordingly.
Colonel Porter will report in person at these headquarters for instructions.

Col. E. D. Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen., Washington, D. C. :
Dear Sir : It becomes necessary, with the increase of our stores at this post and the probabilities of the removal of supplies from Hagerstown, to obtain a secure position for a general depot for the army supplies and for hospital uses. I believe, from careful inquiry and examination, that the city of Frederick offers more advantages than any other point. It is equally central for all points (Baltimore or Harper’s Ferry); is sufficiently removed from the river to be safe from marauding parties, and has the best railroad facilities in every direction. The presence of a regiment there would have a most excellent effect.
At Sandy Hook there are not buildings sufficient, and the strip of land between the heights and river has not capacity, being in part occupied by canal, railroad, and highway, to admit of the erection of proper structures. It is also greatly exposed from the heights on the Virginia side.
At Frederick there are sufficient room, buildings, protection, &c. As it has recently been embraced in the Department of Washington, it becomes necessary that we should obtain consent of the Department for the transfer.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Mr. John T. Sangston, of Caroline County, is desirous that a company of Union men in that county, who have been drilling for several months, should be armed. Governor Hicks thinks it important, and I concur with him. If I had the authority to arm eight or ten companies on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, I believe they could take care of themselves and do much to keep the secessionists in order. I think it proper to add that an active trade with the rebels in Virginia is kept up from Salisbury, the southern terminus of the Delaware Bailroad. As soon as there is a disposable force, it would be well to place a regiment there.
There is a camp of secessionists, variously estimated from one thousand to three thousand men, at Eastville, in Northampton, the lower county on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. This is not in my department, but I would suggest that three or four regiments should be sent there as soon as we can spare them and break up this camp. The exhibition of such a force and the destruction of the secession camp would have a salutary effect throughout the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia.
I have the honor to be, respectfully, yours,

Division Headquarters, jHarper’s Ferry, Va., April 21, 1861. General Wm, H. Richardson, Adjutant-General:
Dear Sir : My present force here is about two thousand. I have endeavored to-day to get up a consolidated report of the strength and condition of my command, but defer it on account of imperfectness in the returns.
I have effected an understanding with the Maryland authorities. They are pledged to report to me any hostile approach through their territory, and consent to the occupancy of the heights commanding my position whenever necessity requires it. I have guarded all the approaches east and west, and established telegraphic communications, to guard against surprise.
The work of forwarding to Winchester uncompleted arms and machinery progresses rapidly. The arrangements for this branch of my duties are so nearly completed, that I hope to give more of my attention to the military command. From necessity I have had to devolve many of the details upon General Carson. I have had to assume heavy responsibilities, and felt some embarrassment in the absence of all written instructions. The troops assembled without ammunition, generally, and, there being little here, I have had to send abroad for it.
Not being informed of the troops ordered into service, I have, so far, received all which were presented. General Meem, of the Seventh Brigade, reports for duty, as he states, upon verbal orders, received through Colonel Crump, from the governor. This presents some difficulty. I see no reason for the employment of three brigadier-generals for such a force ; but, not being informed of the number of troops ordered to this point, I of course recognize him. General Carson’s brigade has reported to-day ,• numbers six hundred and fifty-five. General

Upon the representations of the governor, the council respectfully recommend the issue from the arsenal at Lexington of 5,000 muskets, as a loan, to the Maryland troops.
The council respectfully recommend to the governor to forward the following telegraphic dispatches:

Alexandria, Va., April 22,1861.
Col. R. E. Lee, Richmond Va. ;
We are the bearers of a letter to you from General Steuart, of Maryland, and we regret, on arriving here, to find you absent. The letter referred to we forward to you in a separate inclosure, to the care of the governor of the State of Virginia. We left Baltimore by way of Ellicott’s Mills, the cars having been stopped, on yesterday at 3 p. m., and reached Washington at 2 a. m. The people of Baltimore, and, indeed, the citizens of Maryland generally, are united in one thing at least, viz, that troops volunteering for Federal service against Virginia and other sister Southern States shall not, if they can help it, pass over the soil of Maryland. We have desired to have an interview with the colonel in command at this point, but find him too unwell to be seen. General Steuart will be most anxious to hear from you immediately.
Respectfully,
L. P. BAYNE.
J. J. CHANCELLOR.
P. S.—I am authorized to say to you by Maj. Montgomery D. Corse, commander of the Alexandria battalion, that if you or the governor desire to communicate with General Steuart or the authorities of Maryland, any dispatch directed to them, to his care, at this point, will be forwarded by horse express across the country immediately.
P. S.—All public communication, I understand, has been stopped between Washington and farther north. General Steuart has declared Washington road to be under military rule.

Dear Governor: I have endeavored to keep you advised ot my action here. Two official communications have been made through the adjutant-general and two communications to yourself. So far I have had no written instructions from you. My object has been, not only

to secure all the efficient arms here, and remove the machinery in such a manner as that it may be readily put together again, as well as all the unfinished guns, but to have an inventory made of the public propel, so that the officers charged with the details may be held to proper account. Of course I could do no more than adopt such general directions of military affairs as were important for the security of my position—the details being left to the ranking brigadier-general (Carson). I am now though this terrible pressure, however, in regard to the public property, and intend to assume at once the active military command. I have now about twenty-four hundred men here. Not knowing what troops you ordered, I have received all which offered. The hourly telegraphic dispatches sent in are exciting; but I feel calm, as I have taken adequate measures to guard against surprise. Some here, who do not know, no doubt think I am rather incredulous as regards their information. But trust me; I am well posted, and shall be found ready. The responsibilities assumed by me, under the circumstances in which I was placed, have been heavy; but the exigencies were pressing, and I rest with confidence on the record of my proceedings for full vindication of all my acts. If man could have effected more, then I am willing to be condemned.
From the information I have of the condition of the guns in progress of manufacture, there are components to fit up readily for use from seven to ten thousand stand of arms, exclusive of those rescued uninjured from the flames. I have employed artificers to put these together, and am turning out daily several hundred minnie muskets. You must sustain me. I am wholly unprovided with funds. I can get them from the Winchester banks, if you will give authority. You may judge of the state of things here when I say even Virginia money will procure nothing, but at an enormous discount, in the stores of the place.
With sincere regard, yours,

Fredericksburg, Va*, April 23,1861. His Excellency John Letcher:
I am this moment informed that the enemy has landed from a small steamer at Lee, on the Eappahannock Eiver, fifty miles below us, attacked the inhabitants, and caused general alarm. Can you send us three or four thousand disciplined volunteers at once, two or three batteries of light artillery, with ammunition; also twenty heavy guns, with plenty of ammunition'? Please answer immediately.
DANIEL EUGGLES, Brigadier-General Virginia Volunteers.
Headquarters, Alexandria, Van April 24,1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee :
Sir : Your dispatch of the 23d instant,* by telegraph, has been received. I had fully anticipated all your instructions. I recognized from the moment I took position and command on this line of operations the policy of preserving the anomalous military position now existing, but which may at any moment be overthrown in the present disorganized and feeble military position of our State, and especially on this line of operations. Time, therefore, gained on the one side will enable us to organize and strengthen; but, unless every possible nerve is strengthened on our side, and every moment reckoned as a month, our enemy will press us in this race. Your summons, therefore, from the heart of the State should be “To arms! To arms!*’ from the center to the remotest confines, and, as soon as you can cover from Alexandria to the heart of the State, at Eichmond, immediately extend the whole might of the commonwealth to come up to the aid of the line of operations. I stand here to-day in sight of the enemy’s position, an army now numbering from ten to twelve thousand men, under arms, and rapidly increasing by re-enforcements from the North, while I have today but three hundred men fit for duty; and while I am without any staff organization, cannon, or any ordnance and ammunition, without any officers, engineers, artillery, or ordnance, and without suitable staff’ officers, it will be my part to mask your designs and operations; to act for the present absolutely on the defensive; to watch the enemy; to keep you informed of his movements; to rally to my aid the whole country in the rear; to organize, and await re-enforcements from every possible quarter. Indicate to me, as soon as possible, whatever points shall be decided upon in rear of my position for the rendezvous of any proposed re-enforcement. Your instructions, also, as to the best position of my own headquarters and of my camp of recruits and organization in my rear will be gladly received. I am moving back the flour from Alexandria to the depots on the railroads in the interior. I am also moving back a large amount of railroad iron, which we shall want for batteries. I am cutting off the supplies from Washington, and sending them back to the farms, or returning what may pass through this place.

General P. St. George Cocke:
General : Your dispatch of the 24th is at hand. I rejoice that you so fully recognize the proper policy to be pursued, and initiated it on your arrival at the scene of your operations. Continue it till compelled to change. I am endeavoring to organize the military of the State. Two 8-inch columbiads, with implements and one hundred rounds of ammunition, go to you to-day.
Captain Walker, with four rifled 6-pounders, was dispatched, by the governor, to the Potomac before my entering on duty. Direct him to report to you, and assign him to service where you deem best. Lieutenant Simms, State naval forces, has been ordered to duty on the Potomac, above Aquia Creek. He will be under your orders.
Select points of rendezvous on or near the railroads leading to Alexandria. Leesburg would be a suitable point for forces on that road such points as you think convenient on others. Establish your headquarters as necessary. Establish camps of instruction, and instruct your troops in the use of their different arms; make the necessary arrangements for their support. Ko bacon is to be obtained in Virginia. Consult with merchants in Alexandria as to the feasibility of obtaining bacon from Ohio or Kentucky. If this is not practicable, beef and mutton must be your meat ration. The valley of Virginia will naturally suggest itself to you as the point from which this part of the ration must be obtained.
Let it be known that you intend no attack, but invasion of our soil will be considered an act of war.
Very few officers of experience have as yet reported; as soon as possible some will be sent to you.
In reference to the regiment to be raised by Mr. Funsten, I will state that, in conformity to an ordinance of the convention, volunteers are accepted by companies; when organized into regiments, the field officers are appointed by the governor and council.
It is not now believed that the enemy will attack you; should he do so, however, and you are not able to maintain your position, fall back on your reserves, on the route to Gordonsville.

If bacon cannot be procured, fresh meat must compose that part of your ration.
Two 8-inch howitzers have been sent you to-day 5 also ammunition for the same. I regret I cannot furnish you with carriages for these pieces, but I hope you will be able to have them constructed or made available for your purpose in Fredericksburg.

By your orders I proceeded to Aquia Creek, and examined the place, with the view of fortifying it, for the purposes indicated by your verbal directions of this date, viz: To secure the railroad iron, the timber, two vessels, and a small steamer at that point from the enemy. I was joined in the evening by Lieutenant Lewis, of the Yirginia Kavy, at your request, and we reviewed the ground together. After examining the topography of the ground and the character and position of the channel, we are of the opinion that the best place to put a battery is on the

Split Rock Bluff, as the channel can be commanded from that point by guns of sufficient caliber. A battery on Cream Point would invite attack, and, being separated from the landing by Aquia Creek, would be difficult to hold. We do not think the place worth fortifying, and would respectfully recommend that a small force of ten or twenty men be kept there, to keep off any boats that might attempt to land there, and be employed in loading cars, which should be sent to remove the iron and timber to Fredericksburg at once 5 that the captains of the vessels be allowed to sail with their vessels at their pleasure. While the enemy holds the Potomac the steamer is of no value to us, and we have not the slightest idea that the enemy will make the attempt to possess themselves of it. The men kept there should be required to give information to headquarters of any attempt of the enemy to land there in force, which would be indicated by the number of vessels in the offing, and not allowed to harass the inhabitants by reporting every vessel they see in the river.
Very respectfully submitted by

Their pickets are said to have been down below the Long Bridge last night, and it is said that Alexandria is in imminent peril of being occupied by the U. S. troops.
WM. H. LEE.
April 25.
Dear Steuart : We have later news from Annapolis. Twelve thousand additional troops landed there yesterday. They have possession of the city, and are sending forces on the line of the road. They say they are going to take military possession of our State permanently. Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, is reported in Annapolis, and Sumner is to follow. They are to establish a civil commission, to supersede our State government. The last troops were brought from New York, and the steamers went back for more. A movement will be made on Baltimore from north and south. It is thought Fort McHenry will be assaulted to-day. It is no time for Virginia to stand on etiquette. Let her come and capture Fort Washington. Our legislature meets at Frederick City to-morrow, Annapolis being in the hands of the enemy.

The following dispatches, this moment, by the hands of a courier, who received them in person from Daniel Clarke himself, which Daniel Clarke, I am assured here by reliable persons, is the son-in-law of Ex-Governor Pratt:
Upper Marlborough, Md., April 25, 1861. General Steuart, Commander of the Virginia Forces at Alexandria, Fa.:
Accompanying I send you the latest intelligence, brought by me from Annapolis, which is authentic, reliable, and gathered from the best sources. It is desirable to telegraph the news to the South immediately, and to the Cabinet of the Southern Confederacy. In telegraphing to the Southern Cabinet at Montgomery please send the accompanying dispatch, annexed, to Hon. J. P. Benjamin. I am well.known to him, and the intelligence would be known by him to be authentic, coming from me direct from Governor Pratt, Annapolis.

The dispatches dated Annapolis, April 24th, 6 o’clock, are reliable and authentic, having been brought by me from Governor Pratt.
DANIEL CLARKE.
Annapolis, Md., April 24, 1801—6 x>. m.
The Northern troops have taken forcible possession of the navy-yard and the depot and railroad. This morning two thousand troops left here for Washington, via the railroad. The track, which was torn up, has been relaid by the troops. Twelve thousand more troops have just arrived by steamers and war vessels from New York. A portion of the troops, which have just arrived, are now leaving for Washington. Twenty-five or thirty thousand troops are expected to be sent to Maryland by Monday next. A joint movement of the forces from Annapolis and Pennsylvania is contemplated upon Baltimore, against which city the Northerners swear vengeance. The city is alive and making preparations against the attack. The Northern forces intend to hold Annapolis as a military post, at which to land the troops, ammunition, and provisions for Washington. Governor Hicks, in consequence of the military occupation of Annapolis, has been forced to convene the legislature at Frederick City. It is thought the legislature will pass an ordinance of secession at once. The people are in arms, and determined to unite in the cause of the South. Prompt and immediate action of the Southern forces for the relief of Maryland is absolutely necessary to prevent the military occupation of the State by the Federal forces.

I shall do the same from this point, to cover and protect any working party, under the direction of the engineer, at a certain point on the Potomac. I would be glad to have Lieutenant Lee, of the Engineers, or some other officer of the Engineers, assigned for immediate service, to direct the construction of the works of this enterprise.

Sir : The commanding general desires you to report by letter, without delay, whether, after taking from Harper’s Ferry such machinery as it is necessary for the armory at this city, and which he hopes is now on its way, the condition of the factories at Harper’s Ferry will be such that the arms that are partly finished may be completed and brought into use, and whether, in a military point of view, it could be safely accomplished.

Sir : In reply to your communication of yesterday’s date, I have the honor to report that, in obedience to the orders of the governor, I proceeded to Yorktown on Thursday, the 18th instant, accompanied by two assistants. Before leaving there on Saturday the form and position of a water battery on Gloucester Point was decided upon, that covers all the channel-way with fire, lying within two miles of the point. The battery will mount thirty-one guns, if twenty feet be allowed to each. If eighteen feet be sufficient, the number can be increased to thirty-four. The faces bearing on the channel above and below are arranged for five and nine guns, respectively. Those intermediate (fifteen) are arranged on the arc cf a circle, containing about one hundred and twenty degrees. The lines of fire cross the channel lines so near that this part may be armed with 8-inch howitzers, while for the faces 8-inch columbiads should be provided. The faces of this battery converge towards the high ground northwest of the point. This high ground affords an advantageous site for a large field work for the defense of the position. NTo attempt was made to trace one on the ground. A very good position for a 6-gun battery was selected on the Yorktown side, near to the river bluff. An assistant, J. J. Clarke, who has had no

experience on military works, but with a high reputation as a civil engineer, was left in charge of this work, with instructions to raise a laboring force in Gloucester, if practicable, and to meet me in Bicli-mond on Monday p. m.
About 1 p. in., with one assistant, I embarked on board the steamer for this place, and arrived a very short time before the steamer Pa wnee passed up the river ; reported myself to the commanding general, but received no orders from him until Sunday morning. Since that time I have been fully occupied with the construction of defensive works on this river. The ground in front of the Naval Hospital has been prepared for mounting fourteen guns on two faces, the half of which are now ready for service, with navy furnaces for heating shot. This work was commenced amid the greatest confusion and excitement. Three guns and carriages were hastily removed from the navy-yard to this place, and mounted in the rear of the ground required to be broken for the battery. One hundred and fifty bales of cotton were sent over, to make a temporary cover for the men between the guns, should the Pawnee or Cumberland attempt to return to the yard. No such attempt having been made, the cotton was carefully piled in a way to prevent serious damage, and will now be returned to the public store nearly in the condition it was when received.
As soon as working companies could be organized at this place, which, from the extreme excitement and confusion prevailing, required much time, even after local officers had been assigned to take charge of them and direct the application of labor, I proceeded to Fort Norfolk, where it was deemed expedient to mount as many guns as could be brought to bear on the channel, and also to construct between the wharf and fort covering the channel a water battery of six guns. This has since been reduced to five, in consequence of finding stone under and near the surface of the earth. Bequisitions were made for materials, tools, and ordnance, and officers assigned to superintend the work; but no laboring force was available before Monday morning.
In the evening, after having made requisition for troops, materials, tools, &c., accompanied by one assistant, I left in a small boat for Craney Island. As far as practicable the ground was examined by moonlight. Neither troops nor laborers arrived during the night, but about 8 a. m. Monday morning labor commenced coming in from the plantations, and by 10.30 a. m. about one hundred and twenty laborers, with a suitable number of carts, had been placed on the work, which had been laid out to mount twenty guns, which cover all the channel-way within range from N. 5° W. to E.
A battery, to mount twelve guns, has been laid out on Penner’s Point. The work on this is under the control of officers of the Navy, but requisitions for the laborers and tools have been filled at this office.
SollePs Point has been examined, and lines marked for three batteries, of six guns each. This position is so unfavorable for defense, no works have been commenced there.
April 27.
The works in progress will mount sixty-one guns when completed. Of these, fourteen will be at the Naval Hospital, fifteen at Fort Norfolk, twelve at Penner’s Point, and twenty on Oraney Island. I am unable to state the number ready for service. At the Naval Hospital the officer in charge reports ten ready for action, two 8-inch shell and eight 32-pounders, with furnaces and fuel for heating shot.
From Fort Norfolk the report is not yet in. On Thursday the guns

were on the rampart, and the platform nearly ready to receive them. Penner?s Point work is to be commenced to-day by the Navy Department. Craney Island is ready for the platform and.guns. One lighter,, carrying four 9-inch columbiads, with fifty rounds of ammunition for each, was ordered down yesterday p. m.
Last evening Assistant Engineer Sharp was detailed to make an examination of the approaches to the city and navy-yard, and to prepare a map of the country lying between the Elizabeth River and East Branch, within ten miles of this place. Mr. Conway Howard was detailed to assist him.
I have unofficially learned that a battery of four guns is under construction, by the residents, near Bushy Bluff, which I contemplate visiting in the course of the day. Further examinations will be made this side of Soller’s Point for more favorable ground before commencing works at Soller’s Point.

Alexandria, Va., April 27, 1861. General Lee, Com mander-in- Ch ief:
Having succeeded in accomplishing the objects of taking up my temporary headquarters at this place, I proceed to-morrow morning to Culpeper Court-House, by the 6 o’clock train, which, as at present advised, will be my headquarters for some time to come. Colonel Jones, having arrived, will accompany me to Culpeper Court-House. I have arranged for my communications, through the medium of rail, wire, and courier, to headquarters, and I have, also, through a private chain of couriers (hence through Maryland to Baltimore), connected with General Steuart, in that city. My first volunteer aid, John S. Barbour, jr., remaining here, will receive dispatches at Alexandria.
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE.
Ordnance Department, Richmond, Fa., April 27,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Army and Navy of Virginia:
General : As your attention is so much monopolized by the personal applications of our rather unsystematized citizen soldiers, I prefer to put on paper what I have to say:
1st. Without your positive order I fear there will be a dangerous delay in removing the machinery from Harper’s Ferry. Captain Carter, of this department, sent by me to take charge of and remove this machinery, writes me that it will take probably six weeks to remove it. From the tenor of his letter I conclude that there is a disposition from the surrounding citizens to hold back the removal. Would it not be best for you to instruct General Harper, in command, to push forward this matter ?
2d. As there is not room at the armory to work up and pack away all the ammunition for heavy ordnance, field pieces, and small-arms, I respectfully suggest that the laboratory work upon all ammunition for the heavy pieces for stationary batteries be done elsewhere than at the armory, and under the superintendence of a naval officer. Why not at Norfoik? If not there, I can get a large tobacco factory in this city. It is more than I can attend to, having but one officer in my department, and he away at Harper’s Ferry. In conversing with Captain Minor, of 50 R R—VOL II

the Navy, he entirely approves of this; but your order seems to be required. I can attend to all field artillery and foot troops, but wish the heavy guns and their ammunition to be under the Navy Department.
If it be intended to give me an experienced officer to aid me in the Ordnance Department, please do so, but give him a rank beyond that of captain, as if he is experienced he should rank higher than captain. The call for ammunition has been and is yet great. ? I hope none will be wasted, for we have none to spare. As it now is, General Richardson, adjutant-general, gives the orders for the issues—carefully, I know, but he is importuned excessively. Some assistance, I think, should be given him. Pardon this suggestive communication.
I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,
0. DIMMOCK, Colonel of Ordnance.

€ol. Thomas J. Jackson,
Virginia Volunteers, Commanding Harper’s Ferry, Va.:
Colonel : The major-general commanding instructs me to direct you to cause all the arms from the Harper’s Ferry Arsenal, now in the hands of the militia and citizens serving at that point, to be returned to you, except such as may be in the hands of those who volunteer and shall be mustered into service by you under your instructions of yesterday. As soon as practicable you are instructed to report here the number and condition of the arms so returned.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. S. GARNETT,
Adjutant- General.
Headquarters Potomac Department, Culpeper Court-House, Fa., April 28, 1861—12.30 p. m. General Lee, Commander-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:
Having completed the requisite arrangements at Alexandria, and succeeded in informing myself of the actual state of things at that outpost of my command, in sight of the enemy, I proceeded this morning, by the 7 o’clock train, accompanied by the assistant adjutant-general, my aide, and secretary, towards this place, which I reached at 10 a. m., and where I propose, for some time to come, to establish my headquarters. I left all quiet and composed at Alexandria, where by my presence, during the suddenly augmented flow of Northern vandalism through Annapolis, I was so fortunate as to avert alarm and panic.
Intelligence first reached me, ever finding a solution through my knowledge of and confident faith in the existing status, not immediately, in my opinion, threatened to be overthrown, so long as there is nothing more than a mere persistence in a course on the part of the enemy, long ago initiated, and even now only intensified and strengthened; thus solving, as I did, the thousand sensations, rumors, and accounts that poured in upon me during my whole stay in Alexandria.
I have been enabled to infuse the same confidence into the minds of the leading citizens of the place, to have secured their confidence, and to

have left them for the present tranquil and firm; whilst at the same time I have provided to organize the few troops in that extreme outpost ; to provide for strengthening the same for the present up to about one thousand men; to establishing my communications in every direction, and thence to these headquarters 5 to throw myself in connection with various persons and sources of information at Alexandria 5 to inform myself as correctly as possible as to the number, efficiency, movements, and animus of the enemy, and by every means in my power to urge on such an organization, drilling, and discipline of the troops of that post as would best prepare them for the trying position they occupy.
In coming here, sir, I find myself, as upon my first arrival in Alexandria, “ with naked hands.”
Colonel Jones, fortunately assigned to me as assistant adjutant-general, is the first Army officer to report for duty within my command. He promptly arrived in Alexandria last evening, and is with me here to-day. He will know what to do with his department, but I want an assistant quartermaster-general, a chief of the medical department, an ordnance officer, a chief of military engineering of talent. I had heretofore insinuated a preference in this last connection. I want arms. I am expecting from fifteen hundred to two thousand guns from Harper’s Ferry, when they shall be able to fit them up from the wreck of that place. I want a chief of artillery ; I want powder; two or three batteries of field artillery (6-pounders), with caissons, ammunition, complete for service, &c.
My part now will be to rally the men of the fine country around me, to establish camps of instruction, to wit: Leesburg, Warrenton, headquarters, and at or near Dangerfield, in supporting distance of Alexandria. I want camp equipage for the various encampments above indicated.
In regard to Harper’s Ferry, that most important strategic point on my left, and in connection with which I have not yet been able to place myself in a satisfactory attitude and connection owing to the lack of telegraph communication; of continued rail; for want of full understanding with the chief of command at that position; for want of the requisite and reliable information of all the various circumstances and conditions affecting the present military state of things at that post.
I have, since my arrival here, indicated the plan of sending Assistant Adjutant-General Jones, by rail, to-morrow, to that point, to obtain all such information, and to report to me accurately and fully the present condition of things there with as little delay as possible.

Major : You will muster into the service of the State such volunteer companies as may offer themselves, in compliance with the call of the governor, take command of them, and direct the military operations for the protection of the terminus of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad on the Ohio Biver, and also that of the road. It is desirable that the business operations of the company and peaceful travel shall not be interrupted, but be afforded protection. Maj. F. M. Boykin, jr., has been directed to give protection to the road in the vicinity of Grafton. You will place yourself in communication with him, with the view to cooperate, if necessary.

You will proceed to the valley of the Kanawha, and muster into the service of the State such volunteer companies (not exceeding ten) as may offer their services, in compliance with the call of the governor $ take the command of them, and direct the military operations for the protection of that section of country. Your policy will be strictly defensive, and you will endeavor to give quiet and assurance to the inhabitants. It has been reported that two companies are already found in Kanawha County, Captain Patten’s and Captain Sevann’s, and that there are two in Putnam County, Captain Becket’s and Captain Fife’s. It is supposed that others will offer their services. The number of enlisted men to a company, fixed by the Convention, is eighty-two. You will report the condition of the arms, &c., of each company, and, to enable you to supply deficiencies, five hundred muskets, of the old pattern, will be sent. I regret to state that they are the only kind at present for issue. Four field pieces will also be sent you as soon as possible, for the service of which you are desired to organize a company of artillery. The position of the companies at present is left to your judgment, and you are desired to report what points below Charleston will most effectually accomplish the objects in view.

Richmond, Va., April 29, 1861.
Col. R. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General, Virginia Army, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to report that there are three light artillery batteries now together at the artillery barracks, Baptist Seminary, viz: Randolph’s (of six pieces, called the Howitzer Battery), Cabell’s (four pieces of light artillery), and Latham’s (four pieces of light artillery). Two pieces will be added to Randolph’s battery, he having two hundred and twenty-five drilled men in his company. I propose that these two pieces should be Parrotts rifled cannon, as being more nearly the weight of Randolph’s howitzers, which are of the Dahlgren pattern.
I have to request that the battery of rifled cannon (Parrotts), now in charge of Captain Walker, and some forty men, not mustered into service, and now at Fredericksburg, Va., be ordered to the artillery barracks near this place, and, after turning over their cannon and implements, that Captain Walker’s company (if it can be made up to its proper complement) be received into the artillery service and drilled, so as to be ready for service with any battery that may be prepared for it.
Randolph’s battery, being divided into two batteries, of four pieces each, both under his command, will thus (with the cadet battery) make six batteries, of four pieces each, which should be housed immediately. I have to request, therefore, that three hundred and fifty-six horses be purchased without delay for mounting these companies, and that the Quartermaster-General should be directed to send them out to the artillery barracks (as they may be called for by requisitions of the captains, approved by the proper authorities), and to furnish, also, the necessary halters, riding-saddles and bridles, picket-rope, girths, horse-blankets, horseshoes, and forage; also, that the Ordnance Department be instructed to furnish such batteries of light artillery with their harness and caissons complete, and battery wagons and forges, as may be required from time to time by requisition, and to purchase at once the running-gear of as many wagons as can be conveniently turned into caissons, for the service of such pieces as are or may be mounted.
The following is the estimate of horses for each battery, subject to such modifications as experience may suggest, viz : Randolph’s Dahlgren howitzers, with two rifled guns attached, 84 horses ; Cabell’s light battery, of four pieces, 68 horses; Latham’s light battery, of four pieces, 68 horses) rifled battery, of four pieces, at Fredericksburg, 68 horses; cadet battery, of four guns, at the fair grounds, 68 horses. Total for six batteries, 356 horses.
For the purpose of assisting in drilling these companies, I request

## p. 790 (#806) ############################################

﻿790	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA, VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX,
that ten cadets, of the higher classes, be detached and ordered to report to me for temporary duty. They will be borne on the provision return of one of the companies, and arrangements will be made for messing and quartering them comfortably. I recommend that the cadet battery be turned over to me also, to be prepared for the field and for the purposes of drill. I request, also, that as many artillery officers (late of the U. S. Army) as can be spared be ordered To report to me for duty. At present I have no staff officers of any description.
There are field pieces enough in the State for more than twenty companies, or two regiments. Taking that as a basis, and deducting six batteries (the horses of which have been estimated for above), there will be required for the remaining batteries, if six horses to a piece be used, 952 horses; if four, 616 horses. Should any of the batteries be of 12-pounder guns and 24-pounder howitzers, which I would recommend to a limited extent, then the estimate would be increased proportionately.
There is at the camp of the cadets one rifled gun (Parrott), without carriage. I think it ought to be sent to the artillery barracks. Colonel Gillam offered it to me, and also informed me that Sergeant Rap wt say, an experienced ordnance sergeant, was at my service, and recommended him strongly to me. 1 should like to have him ordered to report to me at once. I am also informed that the cadets have sixty-five artillery sabers, which I desire to get, as one of the companies of artillery has not an arm of any kind with which to arm themselves, even as sentinels.
As the making of harness for artillery seems to be a slow operation, from the scarcity of mechanics, I would respectfully recommend that a pattern of the artillery harness be sent to each of the considerable towns on the lines of the railroads, where they can be manufactured. Some carriages might also be procured with more rapidity in this way, as well as tents, which the artillery companies, that have reported, are in want of.

A PROCLAMATION.
The sovereignty of the Commonwealth of Virginia having been denied, her territorial rights assailed, her soil threatened with invasion by the authorities at Washington, and every artifice employed which could inflame the people of the Northern States and misrepresent our purposes and wishes, it becomes the solemn duty of every citizen of this State to prepare for the impending conflict. These misrepresentations have been carried to such extent that foreigners and naturalized citizens who but a few years ago were denounced by the North and deprived of essential rights have now been induced to enlist into regiments for the purpose of invading this State, which then vindicated those rights and effectually resisted encroachments which threatened their destruction. Against such a policy and against a force which the Government at Washington, relying upon its numerical strength, $ is now rapidly concentrating, it becomes the State of Virginia to prepare proper safeguards. To this end and for these purposes, and with a determination to repel invasion, I, John Letcher, governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, by authority of the Convention, do hereby authorize the commanding general of the military forces of this State to call out and cause to be mustered into the service of Virginia, from time to time, as the public exigencies may require, such additional number of volunteers as he may deem necessary.
To facilitate this call the annexed schedule will indicate the places of rendezvous at which the companies called for will assemble upon receiving orders for service.

Advised unanimously that General Gwynn be instructed to furnish, upon the order of the governor of Missouri, the heavy ordnance called for in his requisition, provided that the order can be filled without detriment to the public service at Norfolk, in all twenty-two pieces, ten 24 and 18-pounder siege guns, four 8-pounder howitzers, six 8 or 10-inch mortars, and two 8-inch columbiads.

Officers will be sent to the respective rendezvous to muster these troops into service and rapidly to organize the whole force.
Therefore, I call upon the brave men within the geographical limits above indicated to respond instantly to this demand upon their patriotism in defense of all that is held sacred and dear to freemen. Men of the Potomac Military Department, to arms! The once peaceful capital of the United States is now the great rallying point of the armed military power of the Korth! The Constitution of your country, the sovereign rights of your State, truth, justice, and liberty, are all ignored and outraged amidst the brutal and frenzied cry of the Korth for force, force!
At this moment hosts of armed men profane by their insolent presence the city, the grave, and the memory of Washington, whilst an unbroken stream of thousands in arms violate the soil of Maryland and murder her citizens in their march to re-enforce and occupy the caintal.
And for what'? The capital has never been threatened; it is not now threatened. It is beyond and outside the limits of the free and sovereign State of Virginia.
The Korth has not openly, and according to the usage of civilized nations, declared war on us. We make no war on them; but should Virginia soil or the grave of Washington be polluted by the tread of a single man in arms from north of the Potomac, it will cause open war. Men of the Potomac border, men of the Potomac Military Department, to arms! Your country calls you to her defense. Already you have in spirit responded. You await but the order to march, to rendezvous, to organize, to defend your State, your liberties, and your homes.
Women of Virginia! Cast from your arms all cowards, and breathe the pure and holy, the high and glowing, inspirations of your nature into the hearts and souls of lover, husband, brother,*father, friend!
Almighty God! Author and Governor of the world; Thou source of all light, life, truth, justice, and power, be Thou our God! Be Thou with us! Then shall we fear not a world against us!

yard, as well as in other parts of my command, there has been, and still [is], the most cordial co-operation in all measures intended for the common defense, not only between Commodore Forrest and myself, but between all the officers of the Army and Navy in this command. As an illustration of this, I may mention that one of the most important posts of my command, viz, Fort Norfolk, is under the command of Oapt. Arthur Sinclair, of the Navy, including all the land forces stationed at that post.
The immediate occasion of the communication of Commodore Forrest, of which I sent you the copy, was the act of Captain Fairfax, ordnance officer, in taking possession without my knowledge of the whole supply of percussion caps within my control, the greater part of which, I understood, he was about to send off to Richmond under an order from Colonel Dimmock, which would have left my whole force inefficient. Besides which, I had not been able, notwithstanding my repeated requests, to get any sufficient information as to the quantity of munitions and stores in the navy-yard, which information was indispensable to the proper discharge of my duties. Under these circumstances I thought it best to send that communication to Commodore Forrest with a view to the prevention of further embarrassments and misunderstandings. I must add that I have not yet been able to get the inventory of the munitions and stores in the navy-yard, nor has the commodore made any reply to that part of the above-mentioned communication. I trust, however, that your communication will remove all doubt upon the point of difference above indicated.
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WALTER GWYNN,
Brigadier-General, Commanding Forces in Norfolk Harbor.
Division Headquarters, Harper's Ferry, Fa., May 6, 1861. General Lee, Commander-in-Chief:
General : I assumed command of this post on Monday last, soon after my arrival here. Since that time I have been busily occupied organizing the command and mustering the troops into service. 1 send herewith a report of the strength for May 4.# To-morrow I will give you a more detailed account of the forces, equipments, &c. All the troops have been mustered into service, except some companies on detached service. I have occupied the Virginia and Maryland Heights, and I am about fortifying the former with block-houses of sufficient strength to resist an attempt to carry them by storm. Whenever the emergency calls lor it, I shall construct similar works on the Maryland Heights. Thus far I have been deterred from doing so by a desire to avoid giving offense to the latter State. If you have an experienced engineer officer, I hope that you will order him here, if you have no duty for him elsewhere. There are four 6-pounder guns here without caissons. I re* spectfully request that you will send the caissons, and also two 6-pounder batteries and two extra 12-pounder howitzers, all fully supplied with ammunition, horses, equipments, and everything necessary for being turned over to companies now waiting for them. Reliable information has been received that the Federal troops are at the Relay House. As

four thousand flints have been found here, I have taken the responsibility of ordering the one thousand flint-lock rifles from the Lexington Arsenal, and also ten barrels of musket and ten barrels of rifle powder, as in my opinion the emergency justified the order. Should the Federal troops advance in this direction, I shall no longer stand on ceremony. In addition to the cavalry stationed at Point of Eocks, I this morning ordered two 6-pounders to the same position. The enemy, from good authority, are about four thousand strong in the neighborhood of Chambersburg. About two-thirds of the machinery from the musket factory has been removed from here. This morning Mr. John Ambler, the quartermaster in Winchester, informed me that the merchants were paying double freights, and were thus securing all the transportation. To prevent the consequent delay of the machinery, I directed him to impress the wagons. He also notified me that the baggage cars from Strasburg were employed in carrying flour from the valley to New York, and that every barrel would be required for our use. To remedy this evil, until the subject could be referred to you, and also to secure the transportation for the machinery, I directed him to impress the cars. About four hundred and eighty Kentucky volunteers are here without arms, and stand greatly in need of them. I directed some old arms to be issued to them, but they refused to receive them. I refer the subject to you, with the hope that something may be done towards arming them. The material is good. My object is to put Harper’s Ferry in the most defensible state possible, and hence feel it my duty to give the best arms to the Virginia troops, as the others may at any time be ordered off. The news from the northwest shows great disaffection, especially in Ohio County.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Col. E. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General Volunteer Forces, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to transmit, for the consideration of the general commanding the forces, the report of Maj. Thomas H. Williamson, chief engineer of the State, respecting the proposed battery at Mathias Point, the substance of which has been already communicated by mail and telegraph. I am making every possible preparation for the prosecution of the work. There is very little probability of executing it without threatened or real molestation, for which, of course, I shall endeavor to be prepared.
I also transmit a report of Major Williamson, made of a reconnaissance directed by me on assuming the command at this station. I regard the Aquia Creek Landing and the preservation of the steamer George Page as of secondary importance, except in the moral influence necessarily involved in the endeavor to protect a point regarded important by a community unused to the chances and vicissitudes of war. It is difficult as a position to defend, being easily turned by the Potomac Creek, and exposed to disaster from an attack in the rear. It has served its purpose of drawing attention from the two important points on the Potomac suj>posed to control its navigation, and which, when occupied, will render a battery at this place of little importance.

Fredericksburg, Ya., May 4,1861.
Sir: In obedience to your verbal orders, I have examined Mathias Point, on the Potomac, and the shores of the Bappahannock to its mouth, with the view of selecting proper points for batteries, to prevent the enemy passing up those rivers, when we think proper to do so. Mathias Point is a bluff headland, twenty feet above the water, and while I was there a war steamer passed the point and showed me the channel. I also made inquiries of persons who were recommended to me by the gentlemen in the neighborhood, and learned from them that the extreme distance from the shore to the farther side of the channel is not over three-quarters of a mile, and that a vessel would be in that range at that distance for one mile. I would recommend at Mathias Point a semicircular sunken battery, on the side next the river, for ten heavy guns, and an intrenchment, with a strong profile and plan, on the land side. Should the enemy attempt to land on the point between Gambo Creek and the Potomac, or go up Machodoc Creek to land, with a view of attacking the fort, a detachment would be required at that point to prevent their landing.
After examining Mathias Point, I proceeded across to the Bappahannock Biver and examined a point called Bristolmine Creek. The bluff in the intersection of this creek with the river is high (sixty-five or seventy-five feet), and commands the river completely, both up and down; and the guns of a battery at this point would cover the ground inland all around. The ridge between Bristolmine and Machodoc Creeks falls suddenly towards the valley of the Mattox Creek, and this sink extends about fifteen miles down the neck between the Potomac and the Bappahannock, and is completely overlooked from the ridge, so that no force could land below and march up the country without being observed from many points on the ridge. There are two roads passing up this ridge; one by Millville, at the head of Bosier’s Creek, and the other at the head of Bristolmine Creek. The intervening ridge is covered with a dense forest, and the roads through it could be easily obstructed, should the enemy attempt (which is not likely) to pass through it. Detachments at Miilville, and at the road at the head of Bristolmine Creek, would be in good positions to watch the country below, and to offer resistance to their march. This line of defense, in conjunction with forts at Mathias Point and the White House, which would prevent the enemy using the Potomac, would protect the railroad communication with Bichmond on the east side, and keep up the line to the South, through the Carolinas, as well as the nature of the ground and the very extensive line will admit, from Jamestown to the White House.
At your request I accompanied Commander Lewis down the Bappahannock Biver to its mouth. The points lowest down the river where batteries would be effective in preventing the passage of vessels are at Lowery’s and Accokeek Points, about seven miles below Tappahannock. The channel does not exceed three-quarters of a mile from these points,

and a small redoubt, with five or six heavy guns on each point, would close the passage to any vessels that are likely to attempt it. Respectfully submitted.

Since writing the above, at the request of Captain Lynch, and by your verbal directions, I have been to Mathias Point, and measured the distances of the opposite shores of the channel from the Point, and find the far side of the channel five thousand eight hundred feet, and the near side two thousand three hundred and thirty feet, which makes the width of the channel three thousand four hundred and seventy feet.
Respectfully submitted.

Lynch.
I am given to understand that the intention of erecting a battery at Mathias Point is not abandoned. Although, after sounding the channel off that point, I expressed, in my report, the opinion that a cross-fire from it upon a steamer, at a distance of a mile and a quarter, for the space of about five minutes, would be a waste of ammunition, yet I am ready to obey any order upon the subject ; and, in pursuance of the intimation I have received, respectfully ask what guns can be furnished for that position % It was originally designed to mount twelve 8-inch guns there and a like number at the White House. To the latter place I gave the preference.

I have just arrived with two hundred and twenty-six men. Two companies yet behind. There are satisfactory reasons for postponing this movement. I have countermanded the order, not being subject to Governor Letcher’s orders, and wait instructions from War Department. Shall I obey Governor Letcher and proceed when my regiment is complete?

Yery respectfully, &c.,
E. E. LEE,
Major- Genera Z, Commanding.
Division Headquarters, Harper’s Ferry, Van May 7,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces :
General: I forward herewith a statement of the strength of my command at this post, of the deficiency of arms, ammunition, and accouterments.*
The deficiencies I respectfully request may be supplied at the earliest practicable period, as I wish to put the post in as defensible a condition as possible. I have finished reconnoitering the Maryland Heights, and have determined to fortify them at once, and hold them, as well as the Virginia Heights and the town, be the cost what it may. For this purpose I would urge the necessity of giving me an ample supply of good arms, and such disciplined troops as you can spare (though it should swell the number here to nine thousand five hundred or ten thousand men). Two pieces of field artillery (12-pounders) should be placed on the Virginia Heights, and a larger number of 6-pounders on the Maryland Heights. Heavier ordnance, in addition to the field pieces referred to in yesterday’s letter, could be advantageously employed in defending the town. The heights west of Bolivar must be strengthened. I would be more than gratified could you spare the time for a short visit here, to give me^the benefit of your wisdom and experience in laying out the different works, especially those on the heights. I am of the opinion that this place should be defended with the spirit which actuated the defenders of Thermopylae, and, if left to myself, such is my determination. The fall of this place would, I fear, result in the loss of the northwestern part of the State, and who can estimate the moral power thus gained to the enemy and lost to ourselves ? The commissary department here is in a suffering condition, and will continue so, unless the estimates are complied with. All the cadets you can spare from Eichmond are needed here.
The enemy are in possession of the Eelay House, and permit no freight cars to come west. Personal baggage is searched. At Grafton the cars have been broken open by the Eepublicans, upon the suspicion that they contained arms. I dispatched a special messenger this evening to Baltimore, for the purpose of having the arms which Virginia furnished Maryland returned to us, and I trust that the scheme will be so carried out as to elude the vigilance of the enemy.
The pressure of office business here is so great as to induce me to retain Maj. T. L. Preston, of the Virginia Military Institute.
Mr. Burkhart, who is in charge of the rifle-factory, reports that he can finish fifteen hundred rifle-muskets in thirty days. I have, in obedience to the orders of Governor Letcher, directed the rifle-factory machinery to be removed immediately after that of the musket factory. My object

is to keep the former factory working as long as practicable without
interfering with its rapid removal.
An unarmed company, in Harrison County, has offered its services, and I design arming it at Grafton. With prudent management I hope to assemble a number of companies at that post from the northwest, and for this purpose I have been corresponding with reliable gentlemen in various parts of that section of the State. Major Boykin was here yesterday on his way to Grafton, where I hope he will not long remain without a command.
I would respectfully recommend that the money for which estimates have been made by the quartermaster and commissary be turned over to them at once, and, if practicable, that it be deposited in a Winchester or Charlestown bank. They have been forced to use their private credit, that of the State being insufficient.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond Va., May 8,1861. George Mason, Esq., Spring Bank, Alexandria, Va. :
Sir : I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 5, respecting the defenseless condition of your neighborhood. General Lee is not insensible to the dangers to which your own and other unguarded neighborhoods in the State are exposed, and no one laments more deeply than he does that the available resources of the State do not enable him to give such efficient protection as he desires to every portion of the Commonwealth. He has instructed the commanding officers that every neighborhood shall be protected, as far as possible, by the troops stationed in it; but the limited resources of the Stjte and her pressing exigencies render it necessary that the people in each locality should take such measures as are in their power to guard against marauding parties and do what they can for their own protection. The formation of home guards, arming and drilling them, and, by concerted signals, to collect the guards of adjacent neighborhoods in time of danger, to resist the sudden attack of small marauding bands of the enemy, are among the means of defense adopted by the inhabitants of the country bordering on Chesapeake Bay and the lower rivers, and are recommended for the consideration and adoption of yourself and your neighbors. He cannot but hope, if war is to be waged against us, that reason and the opinion of mankind will at least induce our enemies to conduct it in accordance with the rules that prevail among civilized nations.

General : I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of communications from Maj. T. H. Williamson, engineer, Virginia Army; Lieut. H. H. Lewis, Virginia Navy, and W. H. Kerr, brigade inspector Virginia volunteers, in relation to fortifying Aquia Creek.* The general commanding desires me to say that the object in view is the defense of the avenues of approach to the terminus of the railway, rather than the protection of the few vessels at Aquia Creek ; that the instructions given by him with reference to this matter were based upon the report of Captain Lynch, Virginia Navy. You will therefore, being on the spot and in possession of the facts requisite to a proper disposition of the works and the troops under your command, exercise your judgment, in connection with that of Captain Lynch, with reference to the defense of the avenue of approach to the terminus of the railroad and the general protection of that country.
The importance of erecting batteries at Mathias Point is apparent; but from the report of Captain Lynch, which represents the necessity of supporting such a movement by a larger force than you had at your disposal, it was considered advisable to employ the guns originally intended for that point in the defense of the approaches to Fredericksburg by rail or river.

Col. R. S. Garnett:
Sir: In accordance with orders received from the general-in-chief, to post at Manassas Junction sufficient force to defend that point against any attack likely to be made against it by troops from Washington, I immediately ordered the Powhatan troop of cavalry to march from this place this morning, to join Capt. J. S. Green’s company, now at Amissville, Rappahannock County, and to proceed together to Manassas Junction, where there are two (raw, undrilled, ununiformed, and armed with the altered musket) Irish companies, lately sent out from Alexandria, and which I had ordered to be held and drilled at Manassas Junction. We will endeavor to use these companies. I have also ordered one section (twTo pieces) of Captain Kemper’s artillery, (the only part of his battery at all available as foot artillery, and that rendered available by doubling upon the two pieces the horses and ammunition he had for the four pieces), which I shall also take along to the same point. The Powhatan troop of cavalry and the section of artillery are absolutely all of the force at all available at this time at this place. I have telegraphed back to Charlottesville for two companies of riflemen to be dispatched to this point, and learn from Lieutenant-Colonel Fry that I will get but one, and that not until this evening.
Looking to Lynchburg, I learn that the armed companies of that place are now in Richmond, under Colonel Garland. If so, I trust, sir, they will be immediately dispatched to the command at Manassas.
We have no ammunition of any kind, except the limited supply sent forward to Alexandria. I shall gather in as fast as possible the armed companies that have not been mustered into the service throughout my department (if any there be besides those referred to), and concentrate them here at Manassas and Alexandria, as occasion may require.
From three to five thousand muskets or rifles should be immediately forwarded to this point for the use of this command 5 thence to be drawn for arming companies, as mustered into service. Some place will be provided as a magazine at this point. The powder, balls, munitions, equipments, and all ammunition whatsoever required for at least five thousand men, should be immediately prepared and forwarded to this place.
The city of Alexandria, situated, as it is, in the re-entering curve of the river opposite to Washington, on the convex side of that curve, is a point difficult to hold, in case the enemy shall have any designs upon it in the present weak condition of our forces. The enemy, by proceeding below, to Fort Washington or Mount Vernon, may turn the position, take it in the rear, and cut off its communication, and so by advancing 52 r r—VOL 11

over the bridges from above the enemy may, by short lines, turn and get in the rear of that place. In order to prevent such a disaster there should be, obviously, outside of and behind Alexandria, a force sufficient to throw out outpost guards, radiating upon the possible lines of advance of the enemy, to protect that place in the rear, and thus to support and cover the little force now held in Alexandria, and prevent its capture or annihilation. With such an arrangement the force in Alexandria could return, without danger of being surprised, and find support in falling back upon the force in its rear. But I have absolutely nothing at present out of which to constitute such a supporting force in rear of Alexandria. As soon as I can collect the means, or you shall send them to me, I shall endeavor to make the best use of them to this end.
Very respectfully, your obedient,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE, Brigadier-General, Commanding Potomac Department.
Headquarters Potomac Department,
Culpeper Court-Souse, May 8, 1861.
Col. E. S. Garnett :
Your order of May 7, this moment received, stating that “The general in command is in want of information from you as to the strength and organization of your command, and begs that you will supply him with it at the earliest possible moment. The return due on the 1st instant by General Orders, Ko. 4, has not been received. The general desires particularly to know with what force you can take the field, provided any movement is made against you from Washington; how it would be composed, officered, and what service could be counted on from it.” I have to say in reply that, coming to this command with “naked hands” and in my plantation dress, arriving in Alexandria on the morning of the 22d of April, I have had everything to do towards organization, with extremely limited means of accomplishing anything. It has been entirely iuqmacticable, in consequence of the want of my proper staff, until very recently, to initiate the means of obtaining the regular, formal, and full company returns and other returns which would show the strength and organization of the weak, unorganized, and widely-scattered force under my command.
The assistant adjutant-general, since his appointment and entrance upon duty, has taken the most active steps to accomplish the objects desired by the commanding general. Those steps will be persevered in. Such partial returns as I have been able to obtain from time to time from captains, both in regard to number of men, arms, and ammunition, and general equipment, have been forwarded to the headquarters at Richmond, and will be found on file there.
The assistant adjutant-general, Jones, has this morning left me, by my order, under the pressing emergency of sending the only experienced officer of the army at my command to march with the Powhatan troop this moment en route for Manassas Junction, to assist in collecting, establishing, and organizing at that point the force that I may be able to command, to carry into effect the order of the general-in-chief, received yesterday, to occupy and hold that point against any probable attack of the enemy. I propose to follow myself to-morrow with such other forces as I can gather, going “by rail” to the same point, and

thus to effect a contemporaneous arrival at Manassas Junction. This necessary absence of the assistant adjutant-general from these headquarters, together with the yet unorganized state of the general staff and the inexperience of many of the captains of many of the companies, will yet cause some delay in making regular army returns.
I beg, however, that the general-in-chief will have collated from my dispatches and reports from the beginning the information therein imparted in this connection, and which may thus furnish him with an approximate estimate and exhibit at least of the available forces heretofore and now at my command.
In order to facilitate the accomplishment of this object, I will here briefly indicate from the best sources I possess the present character and disposition of what available force I have. (See statement inclosed.)

In the absence of Captain Lynch, of the Navy, for whom I have dispatched a messenger, I have directed Captain Thorburn to put the guns in position and make the necessary preparation for service. It is my expection that the battery will be in a measure completed within forty-eight hours. Measures will be taken to give the requisite protection.
I respectfully recommend that a battery of four 32-pounders be established on the Rappahannock River, at Bristol Mines or Tappahannock, with as little delay as is practicable.
I transmit a memorandum of a statement made yesterday by Messrs. John T. Washington and John H. Stuart, of King George County, Virginia. Measures were taken immediately by dispatching mounted men to intercept and recover the slaves supposed to have escaped, but thus far without satisfactory results.
Repeated applications have been made to me from counties bordering on the Rappahannock on both sides, along the Northern Neck, for instructions preliminary to enrollment as volunteers, from the fact, doubtlessly, that they were within my original jurisdiction. I am instructed by General Cocke to embrace my original limits until further orders.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Statement of Mr. John T. Washington, of Hampstead P. 0., King George
County, Virginia.
That he was one of the patrol on last night, 6th instant, starting on duty about 10 p. m., with some six or seven others, and that upon his return home the following morning, about sunrise, he discovered that five of his negro men had packed up tbeir clothing and absconded, and, from some tracks he discovered, thinks they moved in the direction of Fredericksburg.
Upon making inquiries he found that Mr. John Hill Stuart had missed two of his negro men, Dr. A. B. Hooe two of his, Mr. Custis Grymes two of his, Mr. H. M. Tennent two of his, Mr. Quisenberry one of his, Mr. John H. Washington two of his, and Mrs. Virginia Washington two of hers.
The above-named persons were all whom he had an opportunity of hearing from, and as they all had missed some of their negroes, he infers that his neighbors generally have suffered.
Mr. Washington also stated that the patrol visited seven estates upon the night of the 6th instant, and that upon six of the estates they saw but one negro man each and upon the other but two negro men.

Gloucester Point, Va., May 8,1861. Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee, Commander 4n-Chief:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I assumed command at this post at 7 o’clock yesterday evening. I hastened to assume the command from the fact that I learned, on my way from Richmond, that the howitzer battery under Lieutenant Brown, acting under the orders of Captain Whittle, of the Virginia isavy, had resisted the approach of the steamer Yankee and driven her back, after the firing of some ten or twelve rounds on either side. I immediately ordered out the volunteer forces of the county, amounting to some two hundred and fifty men, to re-enforce the battery and prevent a landing of the enemy in boats. These troops had not been mustered into the service of the State, and no force beyond a small guard had been stationed at this place. Major Page, mustering officer, will muster in three companies to day. I have now subsistence for four hundred men for thirty days, and will erect huts for the troops this evening. I have to urge that you will order to this point some effective sea-coast guns, for the small battery of 6-pounder guns now here will prove of small consequence in resisting an attack upon this place by a naval force of much importance.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. B. TALIAFERRO,

I have directed that four 6-pounder guns be forwarded to you as soon as possible, and two 12-pounder howitzers, with a supply of ammunition and equipment for firing, will be sent to you at once. There are no caissons. Horses, wagons, and harness will be procured near you by an agent of the quartermaster’s department, sent for the purpose.
Captain Pendleton’s company of artillery from Lexington will join you as soon as possible, with such field pieces as it has. Flour and provisions for use of the troops must be secured. In other respects it is not designed to embarrass the legitimate commerce of our citizens.

The regiments under Colonels Garland and Preston were designed for Manassas Junction. You are requested to send them there, and as company and field officers are available which might properly be assigned to them, to forward them to the respective regiments. That the troops may be prepared for field service, it is desirable that they be removed from the towns and placed in camp, where their instruction may be uninterrupted and rigid discipline established. Officers and men will sooner become familiar with the necessities of service, and make their preparations accordingly. It is impossible at this time to furnish tents, but unoccupied buildings might possibly be obtained or temporary plank huts established.

roy, of the Xavy, who is ordered to report to you, and I hope will be useful in defending your post.
Your intention to fortify the heights of Maryland may interrupt our friendly arrangements with that State, and we have no right to intrude on her soil, unless, under pressing necessity, for defense. I had hoped that her own citizens would have relieved us of that question, and you must endeavor to give to the course you may find it necessary to pursue the appearance of its being the act of her citizens. At all events, do not move until actually necessary and under stern necessity.
I have directed the companies ordered to rendezvous at Staunton to be sent to you as soon as mustered into the service, and I hope you will receive a large accession of troops under the authority extended to you. Several officers of experience have been sent to you, and I shall endeavor to send some cadets. I know, from the spirit with which you are animated, that you will leave nothing undone to insure the defense of your post and the security of your command. You will not neglect, therefore, the instruction of the troops, who ought to be constantly practicing their military exercises and prepared in every way for hard service. Every rifle that you can finish will be of advantage, but it will be necessary to send off that machinery as soon as the musket factory is removed. I have directed the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments to send funds, if practicable, to the assistant quartermaster and commissary at your post.

I wrote you to-day that two 32-pounders had been ordered to you. I fear you may have been premature in occupying the heights of Maryland with so strong a force near you. The true policy is to act on the defensive, and not invite an attack. If not too late, you might withdraw until the proper time. I have already suggested to you the probability of the use of the canal as a means of carrying ordnance and munitions from Washington to use against you. In that event it would be well to cut the supply dams to prevent its use. Ten cadets have been ordered to report to you, in addition to the ten now there.

Colonel : In forwarding Special Orders, Eo. 39,1 take occasion to say that, while pursuing a strictly defensive policy, it is necessary that you should be vigilant, have your troops at or near points where they may be needed, and urge forward their instruction and preparation with all the means in your power. For this purpose it will be necessary to remove them from the towns, if possible, and establish them in camps, where their constant instruction and discipline can be attended to. They will the sooner become familiar with the necessities of service, and be better prepared for its hardships. It will be impossible to furnish tents at this time, but it is hoped that unoccupied buildings or temporary plank huts might be obtained where needed. At Manassas Junction, where it will be necessary to establish a portion of your command to secure the road to Harper’s Ferry, some preparation of this sort will be needed. Colonel Garland’s and Colonel Preston’s battalions (the first consisting of four and the second of seven companies) have been ordered to that point, to report to you. These battalions will be increased to regiments as companies from their districts arrive, which will be forwarded to you by Colonel Cocke. You will give them the necessary orders and add such re-enforcements as you think proper. The troops near Alexandria will be kept in readiness to move whenever necessary, will afford such protection to the town and neighborhood as their number will permit, and you will endeavor to take measures to allay unnecessary excitement, and not to provoke aggression.

By command of Major-General Lee:
R. S. GARNETT,
Adjutant- General.
Grafton, Va., May 10,1861.
General R. E. Lee :
Sir : Being pressed for time and deeming it necessary to communicate with you at once, I wrote from this point on the 7th instant, giving my views hastily as regards the best policy to be pursued in order to carry out my instructions. I am fully confirmed in the opinions there given, as I have since had an opportunity of posting myself by visiting some of the adjacent counties. The feeling in nearly all of our counties is very bitter, and nothing is left undone by the adherents of the old Union to discourage those who are disposed to enlist in the service of the State. I find that organizations exist in most of the counties pledged to the support of what they term the Union. We have various rumors about forces being sent from Ohio and Pennsylvania for the purpose of holding the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Grafton. I have no doubt from the confidence and bearing of the Union men in and around here that they are expecting aid from some quarter.
While I deem it absolutely necessary for us to hold this point immediately, I think it impracticable to undertake it with the very small force which could be gotten here soon.
I see no other alternative than to send forces from the east for the present. This section is verging on a state of actual rebellion, and many men who are true and loyal to the State are afraid to leave their families among men who recognize as a leader John S. Carlile, who openly proclaims that the laws of the State should not be recognized.

If forces are sent, I think we should have at least one battery. I think five hundred men will bo sufficient to quell any disturbance which inight arise if a smaller force were sent.
As regards the necessity of a force at Parkersburg, I am clearly of opinion that troops should be assembled there immediately. I most respectfully commend to your consideration the name of Judge W. L. Jackson, formerly second auditor and afterwards lieutenant-governor of the State, as a suitable person to appoint to the command at that point. Judge Jackson is a gentleman of very great personal popularity, not only with his own party, but with those who are diametrically opposed to him politically, and I am satisfied could exert more influence towards conciliating than any other gentleman who could be appointed. I consider it unnecessary to say more of the judge, as he is known throughout the State to be devoted to the interest of Virginia, and will stand by her to the last extremity. I have recently had a conversation with him, and he will accept the command if tendered him.

Col. J. B. Magruder :
Sir : Yesterday, about 1 o’clock p. m., an armed steamer approached our battery, coming within the range of two or three miles. We sprang to our guns, and were ready for action as soon as it was manifest that the steamer was coming up the river. We all expected an attack, but she turned and proceeded down the river, and dropped anchor near its mouth. Another ship or steamer was also in the distance. During the night there was a vigilant lookout. This morning four ships or steamers passed beyond the first steamer, proceeding rapidly from north to south. About 8 o’clock this morning the attacking steamer weighed anchor and left the river. You can draw your own conclusions as well as I can of the purpose of the enemy.
I regard this point as next in importance to Fortress Monroe. I hope I may say that I am acquainted at least with the commercial wants of the State. It is, in my opinion, invaluable, both for military defense and the commercial necessities of the State. Let its importance not be underrated. This point properly secured, and no effectual blockade can continue; no ships can pass up York River $ no attack can be made on Richmond, except by long land marches. If you could see the place, you would be satisfied of its great importance. To allow it to be lost would be a fatal error. The force here, consisting entirely of volunteers, are prepared to defend it to the last extremity. They are perfectly aware of the strangeness and peril of their situation, but though u there is plenty of danger, there is no fear.” But if I am correct in regard to the importance of retaining this position, though the necessities of the State would not permit more men to be sent for the support of the few here, yet that force should be promptly sent for the protection of the present and future fortifications here.

Lincoln and Cabinet appear to be, they must see the importance of taking this place. A land attack by a large force would probably do this. We would dispute every inch of ground with them; but however valiant our defense, it would not repay the loss of this place. I believe it can be easily defended from a land attack. Access from our rear is over ground perfectly level, and mostly open. The enemy must march through a space not over a mile or mile and a half wide. Defend this by a rude fort of logs even, and it would greatly contribute to our defense. It will require a much larger force to do this. But the plateau in the rear of this is the most beautiful as well as extensive field for drill I have ever seen. A brigade could well maneuver upon it. Send down, therefore, some of your raw troops of infantry, and let a school of instruction be placed here.
The Federal troops may land below, but they must pass through the level interval or over Sarah’s Creek. They cannot pass Sarah’s Creek without boats, and its defense is very easy. I have not time to say more.
Please submit this to General Lee and the governor and council. Let the public not hear of it till the plan is executed.

You must persevere, however, and call out companies from the well-affected counties, and march them to Grafton, or such other point in that vicinity as you may select. Four hundred rifles and some ammunition have been ordered from Staunton to Major Goff, Virginia Volunteers, at Beverly, Bandolph County, who has been directed to communicate their arrival to Colonel Porterfield, and take his directions as to their disposition. You can by this means arm certain companies and prepare them for service, preparatory to receiving those from Harper’s Ferry. I do not think it prudent to order companies from other parts of the State to Grafton, as it might irritate, instead of conciliating the population of that region. On Colonel Porterfield’s arrival at Grafton communicate this letter to him.

from Keysville, on the Richmond and Danville Road, to Clarksville, on the Roanoke, whereby an additional railroad connection would be had between Richmond and States to the south of Yirginia. As a military road at this time, General Lee thinks it would be both desirable and important to have the road which you propose constructed, as it would afford not only an additional means of communication between Richmond and the South, but, in the event of obstruction on one road, the other might be kept open for travel and transportation. Contingencies might occur to render this a matter of the highest importance, and he would therefore be pleased to see the road made. But while he regards it as desirable, he thinks, from the information he has of the financial condition of the State, it would not be proper just now to divert the money required for the work from other objects.

ments and my own. My general line of operations is very much in the direction of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, while yours would be, in the present attitude of the enemy, through Aquia Creek to Dumfries and Occoquan. Our lines would thus converge upon Alexandria and the enemy’s position bey ond. The line of the Potomac to the mouth of the Aquia, flanking your line, as indicated, as well as mine, at least as far back as this point, it is exceedingly important that we should have strong outposts at Aquia, Dumfries, and Occoquan, at either of which places the enemy could enter and land by boats, and take me in flank and your own position in front. By establishing a strong force at these points indicated, we shall prevent surprise, hold the enemy in check along the Potomac, which flanks this line of operations from here to Alexandria, while we shall, at the same time, hold ourselves in position by a connected chain of posts for reciprocal support and intelligence and for prompt co-operation. In order to effect the objects indicated in general terms above, you will place at Dumfries a detachment, consisting, if practicable, or as soon as it may be practicable, of at least one battalion of infantry (rifles would be best), one section (two guns) of rifled cannon, Walker’s battery, and a troop or two of cavalry, while a similar force should be placed at Occoquan as soon as it may be practicable to do so.
I am well aware of the difficulties you may have in fulfilling literally these commands in this incipient stage of organization of your force. I must, therefore, trust to your discipline to do whatever may be practicable for the present, to be followed up as future circumstances may allow. The troops from Prince William, now at Dumfries and Occoquan, and any other troops that may be there, will remain at those posts, respectively, and be strengthened as circumstances will allow to do so, as above indicated. This post will be promptly put in connection with Occoquan by outposts, pickets, vedettes, and patrols, and it would be exceedingly desirable to establish a similar unbroken chain of communication between Occoquan, Dumfries, Aquia, and Fredericksburg.
Very truly, &e.,

General: The precautions mentioned in your letter of the 6th instant have been under consideration for some time, and some of them have been taken 5 others are progressing as rapidly as the circumstances admit of. Arrangements are complete for a desperate defense at Point of Rocks. I have troops also at Berlin, Shepherdstown, and Martins-burg. Marylanders, with artillery, are opposite Shepherdstown, and have threatened us there to such an extent as to induce the officer stationed there to call on me for artillery; and though I can poorly spare it, yet, under the circumstances, I must comply. Previous to receiving your letter I had authorized the payment of $5 for the best arms, and graded pieces below that. My report for yesterday* will show the strength of the command. I can get enough volunteers from the counties named to swell the force to probably four thousand five hundred; but they are without arms, accouterments, and ammunition. Please send me five thousand good muskets and rifles, with complete equip-

Grafton should be occupied at once. Col. J. M. Bennett will deliver this to you, and give important information respecting the northwest. The quartermaster, Mr. John A. Harman, of this post, should not be removed, if it can possibly,be avoided. Please have him appointed and retained, if practicable. I had difficulty in inducing him to remain; but, if the appointment be sent to him, I think he will continue here.

Upon the occurrence of any emergency, which in his judgment may require it, or upon the order of Major-General Lee, General-in-Chief, Maj. Benjamin S. Ewell, of the active volunteer force, is authorized to call out any portion of the militia of the line or the volunteers of the Sixty-eighth Begiment, James City, for the protection or defense of the county. He will please report to General Lee what number and description of additional arms may be necessary for the purpose.

I.	In conformity with instructions from the headquarters of Virginia forces, volunteer companies of infantry and riflemen will be received into the service of the State for the period of one year from April 25, 1861, from the counties of Richmond, Northumberland, and Lancaster, preparatory to instruction, at or near the court-houses of the respective counties, or such other points as may be designated 5 and also companies of volunteers, organized and armed as above specified, will be received in the counties of Essex and Middlesex for the same period of service, for instruction, in the vicinity of Tappahannock and Urbana. Companies of volunteer artillery and cavalry already organized, armed, and equipped according to law will be reported by their captains in person or by mail directly to these headquarters for special instructions.
II.	The companies of volunteers presenting themselves are expressly enjoined to conform in every essential particular in their organization, armament, and equipment to the requirements stated in the instructions for mustering volunteers into service, from Inspector-General Baldwin, dated April 30, 1861, for which application may be made directly to the inspector-general of the State or to the inspector at these headquarters. As companies are reported organized by their captains at these headquarters, or at such other points as may be designated, an

inspector will be directed at an appointed time to muster them into the service of the State.
III. The policy of the State, as clearly indicated by the proclamation of the governor and the ordinances of the Convention, is to rely mainly on the organized and disciplined volunteer forces, in conjunction with the Provisional Army of Virginia. The readiness with which the people of this department have responded to the call for volunteers induces the hope that, save upon the emergency of actual invasion, the militia will not be called out; but, should that contingency arise before precise instructions are communicated, full reliance will "be placed on the bold hearts and stong arms of a united people to make each house a citadel, and every rock and tree positions of defense, thus efficiently aiding the organized forces, by communicating by telegraph and concentrating by railway at the endangered point in such numbers as to sweep from our borders the insolent invaders. Called to command a border district of Virginia, now threatened with invasion and subjugation by a lawless tyranny, which, over a violated Constitution, would march to conquest and carnage, it is esteemed not less the post of honor than of danger. Brave and loyal men of that district which has given to freedom a Washington, Madison, Monroe, Lee, Mercer, and others, whom, both in camp and council, the world has recognized as among the noblest defenders of constitutional liberty, you are called upon to rally for the defense of your homes and firesides $ your wives and children 5 the ashes of your mighty dead$ the freedom purchased by your fathers7 blood, and the soil and sovereignty of your proud old Commonwealth. Give force and efficiency to your patriotic ardor by the aid of discipline and organization 5 substitute prudence and policy for passion/ and by your devotion to liberty, regulated by law, vindicate before the nations your claim to exercise the inalienable right of self-government.

Headquarters,
Gloucester Point, Van May 11,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
General: I have the honor to report that the condition of the defenses at this place has greatly improved since my last communication. Two heavy 9-inch guns have been placed in position at the water battery at the extremity of the point, and we have the means of preventing a landing from boats, as the work and the shore line are protected by the field guns of Captains Cabell and Brown7s batteries. Two additional 9-inch guns have been sent here this morning, and will be placed in battery with all dispatch.
I have directed the quartermaster to erect huts on the most economical plan, for the accommodation of the troops, which work is making much progress, and I hope to be at least able to protect the whole command from the weather by this evening.
Major Page has mustered into the service two companies of infantry,, numbering one hundred and fifty-eight men, and one of artillery, numbering ninety men, which is the whole force yet mustered from the counties of King and Queen and Gloucester. Believing it necessary to concentrate as many men as possible here, on the evening of the 7th I ordered here a company of cavalry, and have retained them until this time. I have thought it advisable to direct Major Page to muster this

troop into service, as the character of the country to be defended renders it necessary to have the co-operation of a small cavalry force to act as scouts and vedettes, the more particularly to give confidence to the people along the shores and creeks, who are apprehensive of forays. This muster has not yet been completed, and, should you regard this force as unnecessary, they can be discharged frpm service, with but small loss for their support during the limited time they have served.
I would respectfully suggest that a force be stationed at Yorktown and batteries erected there. I understand that Major Ewell is in command of a battalion on that side of the river, and that my command is limited to this. I have not had any official communication with him, and desire to be advised of the fact of the extent of his command. I would suggest that his headquarters be established at Yorktown, so that we could co-operate.
I have, in conclusion, to say that I have not received from the head-quarters of the Army, or any other source, an order or official communication of any kind, with the exception of your letter of the 8th instant, and the order assigning me to duty, which was exhibited to me in Eichmond. I presume the derangement of the mails has been the cause of this, and I ask that copies be forwarded to me, via West Point.

Colonel : Yours of the 9th instant is at hand. Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne has been instructed to call out and muster into service five regiments of infantry or riflemen, and one of cavalry, from the counties for which Lynchburg was appointed the rendezvous by the governors proclamation of the 3d instant. One thousand percussion muskets, with equipments and ammunition, as far as they can be supplied, will be sent to Lynchburg for such companies as may come there unarmed. To the cavalry companies, which may offer themselves unarmed, it is recommended to provide themselves with double-barreled shot guns, buck-shot cartridges, and pistols. The supply of cavalry arms and equipments here is nearly exhausted. It is left with Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne to determine the proportion of companies to be drawn from the different counties of his district. If the cavalry companies cannot get arms, they will have to be mustered in as infantry or riflemen.

pared against any immediate attack, to review your lines of defense, strengthen, improve, and enlarge them, as necessity and opportunity may permit, and apply all your means and use every exertion to the instruction and discipline of your men, and prepare them for hard and active service. With this view, they should be placed at or near the points where their services will be required in case of an attack and be prepared and habituated to the necessities of service. Is the revetment of Fort Norfolk sufficiently protected by earthern-covered ways, and are the parapets of all your redoubts sufficiently thick and high to resist heavy shot and protect the men within ? If not, they had better be strengthened and every measure taken to give confidence and security
to the men.
In the fabrication of musket cartridges at this point we are now obliged to use coarse powder for want of musket powder. As you have a large amount of cartridges on hand, you are desired to send ten barrels of musket powder, as soon as possible, to Colonel Dimmock, at this place. Telegraphed to this effect to-day.

Col. T. J. Jackson,
Commanding, &c., Harper’s Ferry, Va. :
Colonel : I have just received your letter of the 11th instant, by Colonel Bennett. I am concerned at the feeling evinced in Maryland, and fear it may extend to other points, besides opposite Shepherdstown. It will be necessary, in order to allay it, that you confine yourself to a strictly defensive course. I presume the points occupied by you at Point of Bocks, Berlin, and Shepherdstown are on our side. I am glad to hear that volunteers are assembling. Over two thousand arms have already been sent to you, and one thousand more have been ordered this evening. If you only expect to receive sufficient volunteers to swell your force to four thousand five hundred men, I do not see how you can require five thousand arms, as you must now have nearly three thousand armed, besides the three thousand arms, above mentioned, ordered to you. We have no rifles or cavalry equipments. The latter may use double-barreled shot-guns and buck-shot, if no better arms can be procured. I will see to the quartermaster. I fear no field battery can be sent you besides that now preparing. The Fourth Begiment Alabama troops, from Lynchburg, have gone to you, and I have ordered two others from the same point. Ammunition has also been ordered to you. You know our limited resources, and must abstain from all provocation for attack as long as possible.

it refers. Your change of rank has resulted from the action of the Convention. Before the termination of its session an ordinance was passed requiring all appointments in the military service by the governor to be submitted to the Convention for confirmation. The Convention also determined, as I have understood, to reduce the number of the higher grades in the service, which resulted in the renomination by the governor, by and with the advice of the council, of several officers for appointments to grades one degree lower than those to which they had been originally appointed. General Gwynn’s, General Johnston’s, General Buggies’, yours, and others were of this number. Another ordinance of the Convention gave to officers of the Provisional Army rank above those of the volunteer forces of the same grade, and subjected them to duty with the volunteers until required for service with the Provisional Army. Colonel Buggies and Colonel Terrett having been appointed in the Provisional Army, it was incumbent on me to recognize their rank. It therefore became necessary to change your command, which I did with regret. Of the circumstances attending it I supposed you were cognizant, as the action of the Convention, I think, occurred before your last visit to this city.
When Colonel Jackson was sent to Harper’s Perry, it was to muster into service the companies there assembled, with a view of organizing a force as rapidly as possible to hold that point. Hence he was not directed to report in person to you on his route, as that would have occasioned delay, though it was well understood that Harper’s Perry was embraced within your command. At the present time, as well as for the reasons given in Special Orders, NTo. 39, it was deemed advisable to give to the commander at Harper’s Ferry command of that station, without reference to any other question. I hope you will perceive, from the foregoing explanation, which has been necessarily brief, that the change in your command was dictated by necessity and not by choice. In assigning the officers within your former district to their present posts, I was guided entirely by the convenience of the service and a desire to hasten the organization of the troops. It is temporary, and designed to meet the exigencies of the occasion. As to yourself, I desired to have the benefit of your knowledge of the troops and officers called from the extensive country assigned to you, in their organization and equipment, and hoped the service would be as agreeable to you as I believe it will be beneficial to the public. Becognizing as fully as I do your merit, patriotism, and devotion to the State, I do not consider that either rank or position are necessary to bestow upon you honor, but believe that you will confer honor on the position. In the present crisis of affairs, I know that your own feelings, better than any words of mine, will point out the best course for you to pursue to advance the cause in which you are engaged, and to promote the interests of the service, which you have so much at heart, and will leave to the voice of your fellow-citizens to assign to you the position you deserve.

Six hundred rifles, in addition to the four hundred of which you were already notified, have been ordered to be sent from Staunton to the care of Major Goff, Virginia volunteers, at Beverly, which will be subject to Colonel Porterfield’s orders. I regret to hear of the difficulties mentioned in your letter of mustering troops at and in the vicinity of Grafton, but hope that by perseverance you will overcome them. Major Goff has been directed to muster troops in Randolph and "adjacent counties, and it is hoped he will be enabled to obtain a sufficient number for the purposes mentioned in your letter, as it is deemed unadvisable to send troops from the east for the present.

General : Your letter of the 10th, requesting authority to call into service an additional cavalry company, has been received. It was supposed that four mounted companies would be sufficient for the service at Norfolk, as their duty would be mainly vedette. Your water communications and system of signals, it was hoped, would enable you to lighten that service. It is an expensive force, difficult in that region to forage, and should not be increased beyond the actual necessities of the service. Should another company, however, be indispensable, you are authorized to call it out. It may be proper for you to keep in mind that there are no cavalry arms here for issue; so, unless it be already provided with arms, it cannot be equipped.

Culpeper Court-House, Fa., May 14,1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General:
Sir: I report, for the information of the General-in-Chief, that I returned to this place on Sunday morning, the 12th instant, from Manassas Junction, where I had gone to examine "the position and the country around, and to make arrangements for gathering a force there for the defense of the place. My observations of the country were mainly directed towards the Potomac, on the right flank, and I And the head of tide, at Occoquan, approached within eighteen miles of Manassas. Mr. John Grant, my acting engineer and topographical draughtsman^ was sent forward with a guide, to examine the roads towards Occoquan, while I myself rode over the most direct road, to a point where it crosses the Occoquan River, seven or eight miles to the right of Manassas Junction. Mr. Grant subsequently pursued this latter road to the village or landing of Occoquan, the head of tide, and I can report that the country upon these routes, covering the right flank of the position at Manassas Junction, is quite favorable for defensive operations, the same being broken or undulating, covered with dense forests of second-growth pines or of original oak, except here, and small fields or farms, the roads very narrow (mere ditches), and everywhere such as to render artillery and cavalry of our enemy on the march of little use to him, while the cover of forests, hills, and ravines make a fortress for brave men and riflemen in which to carry on the destructive guerrilla warfare upon any marching columns from that side. Nevertheless the proximity of the Potomac River, on that side, from Manassas Junction to Alexandria, will ever require extreme vigilance and precaution to cover the right of that line from flank attack at other points, where the ways may be more open and inviting.
The force that I have been enabled to assemble thus far at Manassas Junction consists of a detachment of artillery, under Capt. D. Kemper, with two 6-pounders,* Capt. W. H. Payne’s company, numbering 76 men; Capt. J. S. Green’s company, numbering 57 men; Captain Hamilton’s company, numbering about 60, and two Irish companies, numbering, respectively, 54 and 58, and Colonel Garland’s force, arrived Sunday, consisting of 490 men. Altogether, about 830 men. Also Captain Marr’s company, 88 Warren ton Riflemen. Total, 918. The Powhatan Troop, under Captain Lay, has been ordered back here, and will arrive to-day.
Should Colonel Terrett make Manassas his headquarters, he will doubtless go on to strengthen it with forces to be gathered within the large and populous district assigned to his immediate command. I have advised Colonel Terrett, through a letter yesterday, addressed to him, not to leave Alexandria himself until he shall be well satisfied that his next in command there will be a man of cool, firm, and otherwise able character, to hold that important outpost so long as it be possible for brave men to hold it.
The General-in-Chief may be assured that I will make all practicable eiforts to bring about the speedy assembling, mustering into service, organizing, drilling, and disciplining of the volunteers on my whole line, and to draw from this source as rapidly as possible, to strengthen the main positions on this line—a line which even now remains almost wholly open to the enemy, should he decide to march with any force upon it. Indeed, it would seem highly expedient, in view of the now openly acknowledged and accepted state of war on the part of the

S. guard, and demanded an explanation of the firing. He stated that it was not from his men. His orders were to stop supplies, suspicious persons, and to act upon the defensive. I then sent a messenger to the mayor of Georgetown, demanding an explanation of him. Received in reply, through superintendent of police, that the corporate authorities would punish

the offenders if found out; that my complaint had been brought before the military commandant, and that all ball-cartridges would be taken from the troops quartered in Georgetown. The mayor offered me an escort and protection if I would visit Georgetown for more explicit explanation, but I considered that received as sufficient.

Colonel : I have the honor to report that in compliance with orders of the 4th instant, which failed to reach me in time for earlier action, I arrived at Grafton at an early hour this morning. The officers directed to report to me are not present $ nor is there any volunteer or other force here. I will at once proceed to ascertain the whereabouts of Major Goff’s command, which I hope to find soon, and will then endeavor to unite with one or more companies, with which I will return and take position in or near this place. On account of the sparseness of the population here, it will be difficult to get the various companies to act in concert.
After my return I would desire as soon as possible to be re-enforced by a detachment of not less than two hundred and fifty men and a few pieces of artillery, if they can be spared from the command at Harper’s Ferry.
The loyal citizens of this section much need and should have all the protection the State can give them.
There is great disaffection in this and the adjoining counties, and opposition to the lawful action of the State authorities is certainly contemplated.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

There are at this place three tenements, owned and inhabited by citizens ; these houses are necessary for the accommodation of the sick and for depots for quartermaster’s and commissary stores. These citizens refuse to leave them or to rent them to the government for any reasonable sum.
I have no hospital yet established, and there is no means of providing other hospital accommodations than those afforded by huts, and it is essential to have a ventilated building for this purpose, and it is important to have control of all the tenements within the limit of our lines. I believe an exorbitant rent would be charged, and perhaps a spirit of resistance to military interference would prevent the possibility of renting at any price.
I ask instructions as to the powers I possess under the law.
An armed vessel of the United States steamed into York River yesterday, and approached within some three miles of our works. She did not, however, venture to approach nearer, but seemed to be engaged in sounding the channel at the mouth of the river. No boats were sent out from her and no attempt made to land troops; other steamers of the enemy have been observed in Mobjack Bay and just without the mouth of York River.
Our water battery is now armed with three 9-inch guns, and the men have been constantly instructed in the working of the guns by Oapt. T. J. Page, of the Navy.
Should the enemy land in force on this side of York River, either on the York or the waters of Severn, it would be necessary to resist them with a much larger force of infantry than that now at this post.
There are but two infantry companies here, and the light batteries are without horses.
For so small a command as there now is here, and I see no probability of its being increased materially for some time, I beg to suggest the necessity of fortifying the land approaches in our rear, and I ask that, should it meet the approbation of the general commanding in chief, a military engineer be ordered here to plan and lay out the works.
I have found it entirely impossible, from the absence of all accommodations for the troops and from the constant detail of almost the entire strength every day for work in landing and placing in position the heavy guns, to effect a proper organization, or to devote much time to drill or instructions.
No blank forms have as yet been received, and I ask that you will forward them. I have no blank requisitions, and suppose it is unnecessary to forward a requisition. I will send receipt if necessary.

Colonel : I have received your letter of the 14th instant, and am gratified at your arrangements for the defense of Manassas Junction, and the favorable account you give of the country towards the Potomac for defensive operations. I hope, by a judicious use of its natural obstacles, that the march of a hostile column will be much embarrassed. I have to request that you will endeavor to fill up Colonel Garland’s and Colonel Preston’s regiments from the companies that will report to you, as desired in my letter of the 10th instant, and as soon as you are able to form other regiments that you will send such re-enforcements to Manassas Junction as in your judgment may be necessary or as may be requested by Colonel Terrett. Please direct the troops you may send to the Junction to report to Colonel Garland, and place them under Colonel Terrett’s orders. I beg leave also to request that you will give to Colonel Terrett the benefit of your information and advice respecting the troops and country in which he is operating. It is desired to strengthen that whole line as rapidly as the organization of troops will admit, to resist any attack from the forces at Washington. Hitherto it was impossible to concentrate an adequate force for the defense of Alexandria, an abortive attempt at which would, in my opinion, have had no other effect than to hazard the destruction of the city. The posts at Norfolk and Harper’s Ferry, which seemed to be first threatened, being in some measure fortified, our resources can now be applied to your line of operations. Should an advance be made on Colonel Terrett, or an intention be manifested to seize the Manassas Junction, you are desired to sustain Colonel Terrett with your whole force. Respectfully, &c.,

It will be necessary for you to give particular attention to the defense of that point, and to organize your force in front of it, to oppose, as far as your means will allow, any advance into the country from Washington.

to resist successfully any attempt to occupy Alexandria, but you may prevent tlie extension of marauders into the country and the advance of troops on the railroad. Should you discover an intention to seize the Manassas Junction, you will notify Colonel Cocke, who will advance to sustain you, and you will, with his and your whole force, oppose it. It will be necessary to watch the approaches on your right from the Potomac, as the distance from Occoquan, which point may be reached in boats, is not more than eighteen or twenty miles from Manassas Junction.

The following order from the governor and council (having been communicated to the commanding general of the Virginia forces, with his excellency’s instructions to carry it into effect) is published for the information and guidance of the Virginia troops, viz:
In Council, May 15, 1861.
In order to secure a full and fair expression from the voters of the State as to the ordinance of secession, the council unanimously advise that polls he opened at the various places of encampment, according to the terms of the seventh section of the schedule accompanying the ordinance of secession, for the purpose of taking upon said ordinance the votes of the qualified voters of the State who are in the military service; said votes to he held over, and, in case the military exigencies of the service of the State on the fourth Thursday in this month (the day appointed in the schedule for taking the vote throughout the State) he such as to make a vote hy the army and navy, or any portion thereof, impracticahle on that day, to he returned to the Convention for its action: Provided, however, That the vote herein recommended shaU not supersede the vote on the fourth Thursday in the month (where it may he practicable to have it taken on that day), the vote herein advised being precautionary. It is further advised that orders he at once issued to the commanding officers at the aforesaid encampments to have the polls opened and the vote taken as soon after the receipt of the order as practicable.
From the minutes:

Secretary of the Council.
All officers commanding troops from the State of Virginia will accordingly take measures, upon the receipt of this order, to take the vote of such troops, in conformity with the terms of the seventh section of the schedule accompanying the ordinance of secession.

Sir : I. In my dispatch, which I had the honor to make on yesterday, I addressed myself to the consideration of the great importance of this my central line of operations through Culpeper, Manassas, Alexandria, &c. I endeavored to impress upon the mind of the General-in-Chief

## p. 847 (#863) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—CONFEDERATE.	847
the exceedingly feeble means of defense as yet gathered upon this line* notwithstanding the exertions that have been and that are being made. I showed how easy it would be to take Alexandria in reverse, thus to paralyze and capture the little force there, to advance upon Manassas, where there are at present scarcely a thousand men, seize the whole section of railroad, and thus be able to pour their masses like an avalanche over this fine region, and by using the Manassas Gap Road to turn the positions of Harper’s Ferry and Winchester, take them in rear, and isolate them effectually. In order to prevent results so disastrous, the General-in-Chief will pardon me if I urge upon his consideration what I conceive to be the great importance of immediately massing troops, first at Manassas and next at Winchester, in support of Harper’s Ferry. If at this moment we had eight or ten thousand well-appointed men of all arms at those points, respectively, they would not be too many to enable us to play an equal game with the enemy, who at this moment doubtless has forty thousand men in and about Washington and from fifteen to twenty thousand at Harrisburg and Carlisle $ all to be concentrated upon Harper’s Ferry or to be precipitated along this line whenever he shall decide to commence invasion. It is obvious, sir, with a strong corps Warmee at Manassas, and at least a division at Winchester, these two bodies being connected by a continuous railway through Manassas Gap, there should be kept all times upon that road ample means of transportation. These two columns—one at Manassas and one at Winchester—could readily co-operate and concentrate upon the one point or the other, either to make head against the enemy’s columns,, advancing down the valley, should he force Harper’s Ferry, or, in case we repulse him at Harper’s Ferry, the Winchester supporting column could throw itself on this side of the mountains, to co-operate with the column at Manassas and all that can come up in the rear of this line, to hurl back the invader, should he attempt to march beyond the Potomac upon Virginia’s soil.
II. I have every reason to believe that the officers recently appointed and assigned to the work of enlisting and mustering into the service volunteers in the geographical bounds of this central line of the Potomac Department, are exerting themselves with great zeal and energy* and that in the course of a few weeks they will raise and send forward a large portion, if not all, of the ten regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery I was authorized to raise within these limits* In the mean time it may be well for the General-in-Chief to consider what other means, more immediately available, he can throw upon this line, to provide against a possible early invasion of our Potomac border* I remain, general, very respectfully, your most obedient,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE,

His Excellency John Letcher, Governor of Virginia:
Dear Sir : By direction of Major-General Lee, I will start to-day the arms, &c., intended for the Northwest, under escort of Capt. F. F. Sterrett’s company of cavalry. I have also, in furtherance of the plan concurred in by Col. F. H. Smith, ordered Capt. Felix H. Hull, who is now here, to proceed at once to Highland and gather two hundred men, including his company, to accompany Captain Sterrett’s command. I have further issued the following orders: to Captain Moorman, of Pendleton, to repair at once to Monterey with two hundred men, if possible, including his company; to Captains Stover and McNeil, of Pocahontas, to repair to Huttonsville, each with one hundred and fifty men, if possible, including his company) they severally to unite their commands with Captain Sterrett’s and proceed to Beverly. I have ordered Colonel Goff, of the last-named place, to collect the volunteer forces of Randolph and such other force of men as he can gather, and I have directed each and all of these officers to bring with them such supply of arms and ammunition as they could without delay procure. I now respectfully invite you to issue at once to Colonel Goff, or such other person as may seem good to you, such orders and directions, with regard to this expedition in aid of the Northwest, as may appear expedient. My aim is that it shall reach its destination (Grafton, if thought proper) at least by the day of election; at this last point it will be in communication by rail with Harper’s Ferry and may from thence be re-enforced or vice versa.
I shall also send with the expedition at least a wagon load of bacon, to avoid a possibility of a want of provisions.
Hoping that my action in this matter may meet with your approval, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

## p. 849 (#865) ############################################

that things appeared to be fast assuming the aspect of good military organization, and officers and men cheerful and buoyant. I spent the evening and night at Colonel Jackson’s headquarters, and even my limited observation there confirmed the general tone of all around him, that all were in good hands under his command. You will doubtless have better sources of information than could be opened to a wayfarer, but the immediate and daily intercourse between Harper’s Ferry and Baltimore, although the pregnant source of countless rumors, yet there are occasional items of intelligence which, when put together, may not be unworthy of consideration; and although you are doubtless kept fully advised by Colonel Jackson, yet I venture to throw in my mite.
The Federal troops being now in full possession of Baltimore, with the railroads leading to it, north and east, from Pennsylvania, and the spirit of resistance in Maryland overpowered, for the time at least, it is considered that the Federal Army will be gradually extended, and in force, westward along the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad. It has been said in the papers, I know not whether on authority, that Governor Letcher has some scruple or doubt about occupying the mountain heights in Maryland opposite to Harper’s Ferry. Of course I did not inquire of Colonel Jackson, nor do I know, what counsels prevail on this point. I learned at the Ferry, in general conversation, that some four or five hundred Virginia troops occupied those heights, and it was said that preparation was making to fortify or intrench them. That whichever power holds those heights commands the town of Harper’s Ferry none can doubt; and there is as little doubt that a small body intrenched and fortified there, well and appropriately armed, could hold it against a far superior force. All this, however, is better known to you than to me. I want to speak only of our right to fortify and hold those heights, whether Maryland protest or no, putting aside the law of necessity and its sanctions. If Maryland were suo jure, and a friendly contiguous power, the occupation of her territory by forces hostile and menacing to Virginia give the clear right in public law to Virginia to occupy her territory too, so far as necessary for self-protection; a right not to be questioned under existing circumstances by Maryland or any other power. But Maryland is not suo jure; she remains one of the United States, a power now foreign to Virginia, and in open and avowed hostility to us. Occupying her territory, therefore, is only occupying territory of the enemy; nor is it invasion in the j)roper sense of that term, because the occupation is defensive and precautionary only, and not for aggression, and will cease as soon as the enemy withdraw from Maryland.
I have another suggestion to make, because of the disaffected condition of portions of the northwestern part of Virginia pervaded by the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad, a highway owned and controlled by Marylanders, who are now in complete subjection to the Federal power. It seems important to me that a sufficient military force of our State should be exhibited and retained along that road, at important points west of Harper’s Ferry, and at least as far as the western slopes of the Alleghany Mountains; and as two such points I would indicate Piedmont, in Hampshire County, and Graiton, in Taylor County. The preservation of this road, I should presume, will be all important to the Federal power, and of correlative importance to us to have it in our power—if unable to hold it, to break it up at points, where it will be impracticable to restore or repair it in any convenient time. The numerous tunnels through the mountains, the numerous bridges across the rivers and streams, and especially the exjmnsive and complicated 51 R R—VOL II

Headquarters,
Fredericksburg, Van May 15, 1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir : In reply to the inquiry of the General-in-Chief of the 14th instant I have the honor to report that I have given the subject of the defenses of the river counties particular attention, and that the following points embrace my conclusions, viz :
1st. That those counties are greatly exposed to predatory inroads, and constitute an important portion of our line of defense.
2d. That there is a deficiency of arms and ammunition in those counties generally, for purposes of local defense.
3d. That the best method of supply and distribution is to arm such volunteer companies as may be thoroughly organized and mustered into the service of the State. (Please see General Orders, No. 9, of the 11th instant, and copy of a letter, of this date, to a committee of gentlemen from Lancaster County, Virginia, connected with this subject.) To insure proper accountability, receipts of captains of companies mustered into service should be taken for all arms and accouterments.
4th. The establishment of camps of instruction at one point in each county, and, as nearly as practicable, in exposed districts.
5th. I also respectfully recommend that the militia be ordered to hold themselves in readiness for service, in their own defense, at all times, while engaged in their own avocations, and without expense to the State.
6th. I have furnished sixty muskets, one thousand ball-cartridges, and one hundred and twenty flints, on the requisition of the committee from Lancaster County, for Captain Kobinson’s company, which will soon be mustered into the service of the State.
I have deemed it expedient to muster in two companies in that county, as a basis on which the militia may rally, in the event of invasion, as well as to preserve the tranquillity of the community.
These companies, and an equal number from each of the neighboring counties, will probably be required to make up two regiments of infantry and riflemen in the district I command, for the active service of the field.
Should the plan thus far pursued (supposed to be in conformity with the commanding generals views) not correspond with the existing policy, I shall hope to receive early information, so as to adopt an approved rule of action.

In obedience to your order of Saturday evening last, my attention has been given to the defense of this city.
Three topographical parties are now in the field, and by Thursday I expect the examination will be sufficiently advanced to enable me to locate and lay out such defensive works as will give employment to all the laboring force at the disposal of the city authorities.
The examinations made in person have brought me to the conclusion that four or five strong redoubts on points to be selected well in advance of the city limits will afford all the protection required at this time, and be fully within its means to construct and of the State to defend them.

Lynchburg, Va., May 16, 1861. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General, Virginia Forces:
Colonel : I arrived here this morning, and have assumed command of the Virginia volunteers mustered into the service of the State at this place. It was not possible for me to get here sooner, as I was compelled to make some preparation to enable me to go into the service. I find that Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne has mustered into the service two companies of cavalry, one from Lynchburg and the other from Bedford; also, seven companies of infantry, two from Lynchburg, two from Bedford, two from Botetourt, and one from Floyd. Two companies reached here this evening from Roanoke, and will be mustered into the service to-morrow. The company of cavalry from Lynchburg, commanded by Capt. John S. Langhorne, has sabers, but no other arms. The company of cavalry from Bedford, commanded by Capt. William E. Terry, has about fifty sabers, leaving twenty odd without any arms, and those having sabers have no other arms. Three companies, belonging to the Twelfth Brigade of Militia, were reported by the adjutant-general of the militia as armed. The infantry companies have no arms whatever, and I imagine that there are no companies in the counties for which this place is the rendezvous which are armed. I know such

﻿852	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
is the case in the Twelfth Brigade, composed of the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Franklin, Henry, and Patrick. All the armed companies were ordered into the service by the governor some time since. If, therefore, five regiments of infantry and riflemen and one of cavalry are mustered into the service at this place, and they are armed here, it w ill be necessary to have sent here near five thousand stand of muskets and rifles, and the same number of sets of accouterments, and about one thousand arms for cavalry, and the like number of sets of accouterments. Some of the companies already here have knapsacks, but most of them are without them, and those likely to come hereafter will be entirely unprovided in that particular. There are not quite enough tents, of an inferior quality and make, for the troops that are here, and no suitable material is to be found at this place for making more. There are not enough mess-pans and camp-kettles for the troops that have been mustered into service, and the assistant quartermaster, Captain Gilmer, informs me that he has orders from the head of the Quartermaster’s Department to make no contract for the manufacture of any articles without orders from headquarters. There are several establishments here in which mess-pans, camp-kettles, and canteens can be manufactured, and I suggest that orders be given to that effect. If knapsacks cannot be furnished from Richmond, the men can make out pretty well by rolling up their clothes in their blankets and wrapping pieces of coarse cloth around them ; and there are several large tobacco factories, which are idle, and can be procured as quarters for the troops, so that if arms can be furnished we can get along. If there are plenty of good flint-lock muskets they wflll do very well if percussion muskets cannot be furnished to all.
I find matters here in quite a confused state, owing to the inexperience of the officers of all the departments. Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne has made no apportionment of troops among the counties to rendezvous here, and, in fact, has made no call, specifying the number to be received at this place. He has merely given notice, in the papers, that he would muster into service volunteer companies from the counties designated. This has produced a good deal of uncertainty and confusion. I do not wish this to be considered as a complaint against Colonel Langhorne. It results from his entire want of experience in such matters. I am satisfied he has been endeavoring to discharge his duty faithfully; but I would very respectfully suggest that it is rather out of the usual course to intrust to a mustering officer, of interior rank, so large a discretion in regard to calling out volunteers. It strikes me that a call stating the number of regiments to be received here and the number and kind of companies to be raised in each county would facilitate the business very much. Some of the counties, as, for instance, Henry, Patrick, Carroll, Giles, Mercer, Tazewell, Wise, Buchanan, and McDowell, are remote from the lines of railroad, and cannot be communicated with very expeditiously; and, therefore, it is important that the call upon them should be definite. I would also suggest that it is not likely that there will be more cavalry companies from the counties east of the mountains except the two already mustered and one from Franklin unless, perhaps, one may be raised in Campbell. The counties west of the Alleghany must be relied on to furnish the remainder of the companies required to make out a regiment. Colonel Radford has reported, and he would prefer having command of the regiment of cavalry, and I think it would be better to give it to him, as he will, in all likelihood, be the only colonel that will be available who has had experience as a cavalry officer. I do not understand exactly the

## p. 853 (#869) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC----------CONFEDERATE.	853
last orders in regard to tlie troops from Campbell, Bedford, Botetourt, Boanoke, and Craig (letter from Major-General Lee, of May 9). Am I to organize a regiment out of said troops, and give Colonel Badford the command of it, or shall I give him command of the whole, including the cavalry companies, and order him to report with them to Colonel Cocke ? Shall I send off said troops before they are armed, or wait for their arms %
Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne informs me that he received instructions to send Captain Moorman’s company (called the Beauregard Bifles) to Richmond, to be armed. The order, however, has been mislaid, and, as he may have misunderstood its tenor, and the instructions are inconsistent with the orders to me to send the troops from Campbell, &e., to Colonel Cocke, I have thought proper to wait for further orders, which, for dispatch, can be sent by telegraph, if the company is to be sent to Bichmond.
A Mr. Eugene Carrington has exhibited to me an order from Major Ficklin, quartermaster, appointing him transportation agent here, and directing all orders for transporting troops, &c., from this place to emanate from him. I had thought that the quartermaster here would have control of the arrangements for transportation from this point, but I confess I am little acquainted with such matters, and I submit whether the appointment by Major Ficklin of a transportation agent here (while there is a quartermaster here) is regular.
I hardly think much can be done in the way of arming cavalry companies with double-barreled guns in this region. A number of the men have not got them, and have not the means of purchasing them if they were to be had.
You will pardon the length of this letter, but I thought it better to embrace all the matters about which I want instructions, and about which it is necessary to communicate with you, in one letter than several.

Sir : A reply to your communication of the 14th instant, as well as to the reference to me of Colonel Mallory’s letter of the 13th, directed to Governor Letcher, is contained in the following statement: Immediately on my return here, learning that Yorktown had been threatened by a U. S.' steamer, and that a creek, a short distance below, had been entered by a barge, filled with men, with as little delay as practicable I sent the Irwin Guard, to protect, to the extent their strength would allow, the citizens of the town and county near5 and, on the same day, went there myself. After careful inquiry, I came to the conclusion that no landing was contemplated or had been, and that the alarm was groundless.
From Yorktown I went to Hampton, for the purpose of calling into service the volunteer force in the vicinity. On the road I was informed of the demonstrations (alluded to in the letter of Colonel Mallory) by the garrison of Fort Monroe, and, in consequence, determined to see Colonel Dimick, at present commandant of the fort, and ascertain, if possible, the cause of the encroachment. On the 14th (Thursday) I requested

and obtained an interview with him. He informed me that in taking possession of the spring west of Mill Creek he had no other object than to get water for his garrison, and that unless the safety (health) of his troops required an expansion of the area within the Government limits, for encampments, &c., he had no idea, under existing circumstances, of an aggressive movement. He frankly told me at the same time that he did not know in how short or long a time these circumstances might be changed. He laughed at the idea of violence being contemplated towards Hampton. He expressed great regret at the present state of things, and was kind and conciliatory. We agreed it would be better for the guards not to approach too close together. Accordingly I gave orders to the guards from Hamilton not to go within half a mile of the fort. Judging from the means of information within my reach, and from wiiat I saw and heard near the fort (I was not admitted beyond a point near the gate, on the outside), I have no hesitation in asserting that no mules or horses have been landed there in any numbers, and that the force is not sufficient, in any respect, to warrant the supposition of an invasion from that quarter. I shall endeavor to keep you informed of any important changes in the state of things around Fort Monroe.
While in Hampton I directed the formation of a camp of instruction and observation, within about three miles of the town, to be commanded by Major Gary. This camp will be the rendezvous of five companies, numbering about three hundred and twenty men. It is as well to say that this camp will not cost the State anything, the material being furnished by the county. The same is true of the camp near Williamsburg. Major Cary is instructed to maintain a system of patrols, and to keep pickets at the most important points and landings 5 also, to obstruct the roads, as far as is compatible with their use by the neighborhood.
In addition to the five companies, there are seven foot and one horse company (about 500 men) ready, or very nearly so, to be mustered into service. Of these 820 volunteers not more than 300 are armed, and of the 300, at least 150 have only flint-lock muskets. There ought to be four hundred percussion-lock muskets sent at once. As yet I have received but two hundred and fifty flint-lock guns, and a part of them cannot be used, being imperfect.
No further orders have been received by me respecting the militia. Colonel Mallory wishes to know who has the control of his regiment. The question as to my power to call them out ought to be settled. The post at Yorktown, I infer, is not under my jurisdiction. I shall, with pleasure, afford to the officer in command there all the aid I can. Are the approaches below Yorktown to be under the supervision of Major Montague, also ?
As the quartermaster for this district has declined, allow me to remind you of Mr. Saunders, better qualified than any one else I know.
The adjunct professor of mathematics at William and Mary College has, for several weeks, been engaged in examining and surveying the county here for the defense, and it would be proper to give him an appointment in the civil engineering department of the State. The name of the gentleman is Snead.
A half a dozen cadets could be most usefully employed in the camp of instruction here, and I respectfully ask that this number be sent.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. S. EWELL,
Active Virginia Volunteers.

Col. R. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General Virginia Army, Richmond, Va.:
Colonel : In my last report I stated that I would first get possession of the arms consigned to Major Goff, and then try to collect a force and occupy this jdace. I accordingly sent a messenger to Major Goff, at Beverly, about fifty miles distant, and proceeded to ascertain what force I could get, its condition, and the sentiment of the people in the counties of Taylor, Barbour, and Harrison. I also sent orders to the captains of companies, supposed to be armed, in the surrounding counties, to bring their companies immediately to a designated point, near Grafton, and there await my orders. The messenger from Beverly returned with the reply that nothing had been heard of the rifles, nor had Major Goff* been informed that they were to be sent to him. This is a serious disappointment. Several companies in this vicinity are organizing and expecting to be furnished at once with arms and ammunition. I found a company organizing at Pruntytown, in this county, which will be ready to receive arms in a day or so. There is another at Philippi, in Barbour County, awaiting arms, and another in Clarksburg which will soon be ready. I have seen the officers of these companies. There are other companies forming in the surrounding counties, but all without arms and ununiformed. This force, when received, will not for some months be more effective than undisciplined militia. There are but two companies in this vicinity known to be armed. One of these, Captain Bogges?, at Weston, about forty-five miles distant, has the old flint lock musket, in bad order, and no ammunition. The other, Captain Thomi> son’s, at Fairmont, twenty miles from this place, has a better gun, and some ammunition. These companies are now marching towards this point; are ordered to do so, at least. This is the only force on which I have to depend, and it is very weak, compared with the strength of those in this section who, I am assured, are ready to oppose me.
I have found great diversity of opinion and much bitterness of feeling among the people of this region. They are apparently upon the verge of civil war. A few bad men have done much mischief by stirring up rebellion among the people, and representing to them the weakness of the State, and its inability or indisposition to protect them, the power of the Government at Washington, and their willingness to give any aid required to resist the State authorities. I am too credibly informed to entertain doubt that they have been and will be supplied with the means of resistance. They and their accoiniffices have also threatened the property and persons of law-abiding citizens with fire and the sword. Their efforts to intimidate have had their effect, both to dishearten one party and encourage the other. Many good citizens have been dispirited, while traitors have seized the guns and ammunition of the State, to be used against its authority. Arms in the hands of disbanded volunteer companies have been retained for the same avowed purpose. The force in this section will need the best rifles. Those at Harper’s Ferry, which were injured by the fire,if fitted up, will do very well, as there will not be the same use for the bayonet in these hills as elsewhere, and the movements should be of light infantry and rifle, although the bayonet, of course, would be desirable.
I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,
GEORGE A. PORTERFIELD,
Colonel, Virginia Volunteers.

Colonel: Pursuant to instructions from Colonel Jackson, based upon a letter to me from Colonel French, aide-de-camp to his excellency Governor Letcher, I have this day assumed command of the Maryland volunteers in this State. Numbers of the men, and especially a large number of the most valuable of the officers, have gone to Richmond and other points in Virginia. As it is very desirable that all the Maryland men should be together, I respectfully request an order to be issued tor them to report here, or at such other point as the General-in-Chief may designate. I can control about three thousand two hundred of active and generally well-drilled men from Baltimore and vicinity. Until better arms can be procured, I shall proceed to arm them with the flint lock muskets issued to Mr. T. Parkin Scott, of Baltimore, by Governor Letcher.

There are some of the Maryland volunteers who object to serving under Colonel Thomas, and, in order to secure their services, I would suggest that they be mustered into the service of the Southern Confederacy, and that none except those who muster into the service of Virginia be placed under the command of Colonel Thomas.

Should the contemplated conditions justify it, I request that the two officers named in the postscript (should it meet their own views) may be ordered to join me forthwith.

Sir : Your letter of the 15th instant is in hand. The engineers who examined York Biver considered Gloucester Point the lowest available position for a battery for the defense of the entrance of that river. It is difficult to procure men enough to man the battery already erected, and, by increasing posts, this difficulty would be enhanced.
Colonel Taliaferro has been previously directed to muster the troops from the county of King and Queen into the service of the State, and to form a regiment at Gloucester Point of the troops from the three counties of Gloucester, Matthews, and King and Queen. It is hoped that sufficient troops from those counties will be obtained for the defense of their homes.

Under the authority of the governor, by his proclamation of the 3d instant, you are authorized to extend your call for volunteers to the county of Matthews. It is hoped that you will collect troops enough from the counties of Gloucester, King and Queen, and Matthews to form at least a regiment, to which your force should be extended. It is not desired to take private houses, unless the exigencies of the service imperatively require it. A proper hut can be erected for a hospital. There are no military engineers available for laying off* the rear defenses you desire, and it is hoped that the naval officers and others with you will be able to perform the duty. It is probable that the laboring force in the neighborhood will be sufficient to perform the work required on these lines of defense. Blank forms, &c., have been directed to be forwarded to you from the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments.

If taken up that road for safety, it should be taken to Leesburg or its vicinity. General Lee thinks it would be better (if practicable) to obtain the co-operation of the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire and the Alexandria and Orange Eailroad Companies in the construction of a temporary track connecting the two roads, to run the cars of the Loudoun and Hampshire Eoad out on the track of the Orange and Alexandria Eoad at night, as a precautionary measure.

Colonel : I have received your letter of the 16th instant, in relation to your visit to Hampton, for the purpose of calling into the service of the State the volunteers from that region. Your report, in reference to affairs at Fort Monroe, is satisfactory, and it is hoped your arrangements for procuring information will be sufficient to secure intelligence of what transpires.
You will give orders to Major Cary, commanding the camp of instruction and observation, to attend rigidly to the instruction and discipline of the troops, to keep a strict watch on all military movements, and to keep you advised. He will endeavor to quiet the apprehension of the citizens, act strictly on the defensive, and be ready at all times to take the field, under such orders as he may receive from you. Four hundred percussion muskets, with a supply of ammunition, have been ordered to King’s Mill for you.

Major Montague is in command of the troops stationed there for their protection, &c. The troops and operations below Yorktown are under your control and direction. There are no cadets available for duty with you. It is hoped that some young officers, acquainted with military instruction, may be sent you.

Sir : I have been gratified at the reception of your letter of the 15th instant, giving an account of your visit to Harper’s Ferry. I had hoped that the Maryland people would relieve us of the necessity of occupying the Maryland Heights. Colonel Jackson was directed to give to their occupation the appearance of its being done by the people of that State, and not to take possession himself till necessary; but the time has been left to his discretion which I am sure will be wisely exercised. There is no doubt, under the circumstances, of our right to occupy these heights.
Measures have been taken, more than three weeks ago, for securing the control of both branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Eailroad and for throwing a force into the disaffected region of the State; to carry out which Major Loring has been sent to Wheeling to protect the terminus of the main road, and Colonel Porterfield has been sent to Grafton, with instructions to concentrate there three regiments, at Parkersburg one regiment, and at Mo.undsville one regiment. These measures having in part failed, several companies have been sent from Staunton to Beverly, with instructions to gather strength as they passed through the country for Colonel Porterfield’s command. By these means it is hoped that a considerable force has been concentrated at Grafton by this time, and loyalty in some degree engendered in the disaffected region of which you speak.

E. S. GARNETT,

Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 21,1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : The force now assembled at this place and its outposts consists of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Virginia Regiments; the Fourth Regiment from Alabama; two regiments from Mississippi; five companies of Virginia Artillery; eight companies of Virginia Cavalry ; lour companies of Kentucky Infantry, and some small detachments, amounting to seven thousand seven hundred men, of whom it may be said that seven thousand are available for active service in the field, well armed.
On Sunday, the 19th, I inspected the Alabama regiment and the Third and Fourth Virginia. Yesterday it rained so continuously that nothing could be done. In the evening I visited the position opposite the Point of Rocks, distant twelve miles from this point, where Captain Ashby, of the Virginia cavalry, an excellent officer, is stationed, with two companies of cavalry, six pieces of light artillery, and a company of riflemen, together with some men from Maryland, only a part of whom are armed. His cavalry is employed in active reconnaissance of the surrounding country, and his artillery has complete command of the bridge crossing the Potomac, the piers of which are mined, and can be instantly destroyed, in case of necessity; in addition to which, he holds possession of the road at the Point of Rocks in such manner as to prevent the passage of a train.
I have not yet visited the Maryland Heights, where redoubts are now going up; but, from frequent conversations which I have had with Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan, the officer in charge of the work, I am convinced that but little more is necessary to render that part of the ground quite secure. Of this, however, and other subjects, I shall be able to give more definite information in a more detailed report.
The Maryland Heights being out of the question, the most probable line of approach would be by Hagerstown and Shepherdstown, making the attack from the northwest. But the precautions of Colonel Jackson have rendered such an approach a matter of great risk. At Shepherdstown we have the bridge, and the conformation of the ground is, I understand, all in favor of the resisting force.
The troops here are all raw and inexperienced—wanting even in the first elements of the school of the soldier—and there is a great scarcity of proper instructors. Many of the captains are singularly ignorant of their duties. Guard duty is very loosely done; and, indeed, there is apparent on every side the mere elements of men and arms, without the discipline and organization of an army. There is a sad deficiency in clothing and in camp and garrison equipage; and I fear that the exposure to which the troops have recently been subjected in the cold, rainy weather will swell the list of sick, already large. To make up, however, for this loose state of things, so striking to the professional eye, it must not be forgotten that a fierce spirit animates those rough-looking meir; and, if called upon, even now, to meet their enemy, I have no fear of the result of battle. There is a determination abroad among men

who have collected from far and near to give a summary chastisement to any force which may have the hardihood to invade the soil of Virginia. This spirit is invincible.
This afternoon I shall endeavor to reach the Maryland Heights. Tomorrow I shall finish my inspection of the troops, and will muster into the service of the Confederate States nine companies of Maryland volunteers, who are exiled from their State, and are here drawing rations, and are anxious to serve for the war.
On Friday or Saturday I will return to Eichmond, visiting General Cocke’s command en route, and will then submit my report in full to Major General Lee.
I have not asked Colonel Jackson his opinion on the subject, but my own is that there is force enough here to hold this place against any attack which, under the existing state of affairs, may be contemplated.

Williamsburg!, Va., May 21,1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
Sir : The receipt of your communication of the 20th instant is hereby respectfully acknowledged. In a letter received to-day from Major Cary, there is the following: u It is evidently the purpose of Colonel Dimick to take possession of a portion of Virginia soil.” I think so too, if his garrison requires more space. I have prohibited a useless and hopeless resistance to this until Colonel Dimick is at least out of the range of the Old Point guns with the force that may accompany him. It is difficult to manage Hampton. The people are excitable and brave even to rashness, and are unwilling to seem to give way. It (Hampton) might, on the approach in force of the Federal troops, be evacuated by the military, and the remaining citizens ought to make terms, unless, indeed, it is made a second Saragossa. I doubt if, from the nature of the buildings, this could be done. For the adjutant of the battalion here, I wish to appoint Prof. E. Taliaferro. He has not much military experience, but has great intelligence, is firm and cool, has industry and activity, and is to be depended upon. I prefer him to any one I know here, and ask authority to appoint him from the ranks, or else to have him elected a supernumerary officer of a volunteer company, that I may appoint him. There are no field pieces here yet. Excuse me for calling your special attention to this fact. Before knowing your intention to order troops to Yorktown, with Captain Meade’s assistance I adopted a line of defense on the land side, covering the road from Old Point, the Poquosin Eiver, and, in fact, from every landing on the York Eiver below Yorktown. The plan was to repair the redoubt built by the British for the defense of this or these roads, and to erect another small redoubt ; both to be defended with field pieces. The two hundred and forty men now in Yorktown, for the defense of the battery of two guns, could not hold the place against a field battery, muskets not being able to cope in an open country with a well-appointed battery. This fact, or advice, is not stated to inform you, but as a mode of making known the necessities of the force at Yorktown. Major Montague and myself are on the most friendly terms, and, if you approve of it, I am perfectly willing to aid him in the repairing and

construction of the field works in question or to point out the plan. It is beyond doubt that the land approach to Yorktown is in greater need of protection than the water. If the defense of Yorktown had not been within my control, as it was before Major Montague was sent there, it would not be proper for me to write of it as I have done. Under the circumstances there is, I hope, no impropriety in addressing you on the subject.

Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 21, 1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
General: Since this place has been strengthened by additional troops and artillery, so as to give confidence to our people, there has been a manifest improvement in public sentiment in this county; but I regret to say that in Berkeley things are growing worse, and that the threats from Union men are calculated to curb the expression of Southern feeling. While I have been unwilling to diminish the force here, yet, for the purpose of checking the disloyalty there, I have ordered the regiment from Jefferson opposite to Williamsport. You speak of concern at the want of alacrity on the part of companies west of here. This is partly due to their unarmed condition and want of a secure place of rendezvous. If no better plan is practicable, I would suggest that a force destined for the northwest be assembled, ostensibly for the defense of this part of the State, at Winchester, or some point near here, and that the moment that the governor’s proclamation announces the ratification by the people of the ordinance of secession, such troops be put in the cars, as though they were coming to this place, but that they be immediately thrown into the northwest, and at once crush out opposition. This force need remain there only for a short time, until the local ones could be armed. You will pardon me for urging promptness in what is to be done for that section of the State. Any want of this may be disastrous.
I send herewith a letter from Captain Shriver, of Wheeling, who has been on a visit here. I wrote to Colonel Garnett that Colonel Huger had gone on to Eichmond, for the purpose of procuring whatever may be necessary for the efficiency of the heavy batteries $ but I regret to learn that he has been delayed by sickness on his way. Should he not reach Eichmond before this letter, please forward a large supply of ammunition for ten 24-pounder guns, if it can be spared. Should Colonel

Sir: The examinations preparatory to commencing work for the defense of this city are far enough advanced to enable me to select the sites for two redoubts on the cordon it is proposed to occupy. The first will be on the eastern side of Marion Hill, commanding the road leading up the river, and the country generally to the eastward; the second will be on high ground, near Tuder & Co.’s nursery, and quite near to the ravine of Gillies Creek. It is proposed to make the redoubts of sufficient capacity to contain garrisons of six hundred men. For a more perfect defense of the tongue of land between James River and Gillies Creek some two or three small redoubts are needed, in consequence of the irregularities of the ground, which is much cut by abrupt ravines. I do not propose commencing them immediately. The two principal redoubts may be ready for a laboring force on Thursday next, if you approve the foregoing suggestion. On the accompanying tracing the locations are indicated by the letter R in red. As soon as the lines of the works are traced on the ground, a requisition will be made for the ordnance required for arming them. The topographical examination between Gillies and Shockoe Creeks is not sufficiently advanced for continuing the cordon around that section, but it is believed that works can now be laid out, so as to give full employment to all the available labor at the disposal of the city authorities.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
ANDREW TALCOTT,
Engineer.

II. Col. John B. Magruder, of the Provisional Army of Virginia, is placed in command of the troops and military operations on the line to Hampton. He will establish his headquarters at Yorktown, take measures for the safety of the batteries at Jamestown Island and on York River, and urge forward the construction of the defenses between the heads of College and Queen Creeks, in advance of Williamsburg. The orders heretofore given to Lieut. Col. B. S. Ewell, Virginia volunteers, are referred to him for execution. Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell, with the troops under his command, will be stationed at the defenses in front of Williamsburg, and Major Cary on or near the Southwest Branch of the Back River, where it is crossed by the main road from Hampton. Authentic information of what occurs at Fort Monroe, and the operations of the U. S. forces, if important, will be forwarded to headquarters. Col. L. G. He Russy, with his regiment of Louisiana volunteers; Col. H. H. Hill, with his regiment of North Carolina volunteers, and Col. T. P. August, with his regiment of Virginia volunteers, will report to Colonel Magruder for service under his command.

Brig. Gen. M. L. Bonham, C. S. A.:
General : In the execution of the orders with which you have been furnished, relative to the command of the Alexandria line of operations, I need not call the attention of one as experienced as yourself to the necessity of preventing the troops from all interference with the rights and property of the citizens of the State, and of enforcing rigid discipline and obedience to orders. But it is proper forme to state to you that the policy of the State at present is strictly defensive. No attack, or provocation for attack will therefore be given, but every attack resisted to the extent of your means. Great reliance is placed on your discretion and judgment in the application of your force, and I must urge upon you the importance of organizing and instructing the troops as rapidly as possible and preparing them for active service. For this purpose it will be necessary to post them where their services may be needed and where they can be concentrated at the points threatened. The Manassas Junction is a very important point on your line, as it commands the communication with Harper’s Ferry, and must be firmly held. Intrenchments at that point would add to its security, and, in connection with its defense, you must watch the approaches from either flank, particularly towards Occoquan. Alexandria in its front will, of course, claim your attention as the first point of attack, and, as soon as your force is sufficient, in your opinion, to resist successfully its occupation, you will so dispose it as to efiect this object, if possible, without appearing to threaten Washington City. The navigation of the Potomac being closed to us, and the U. S. armed vessels being able to take a position in front of the town, you will perceive the hazard of its destruction, unless your measures are such as to prevent it. This sub-55 R R—YOL II

Gloucester Point, Va., May 22,1861. General E. E. Lee, Headquarters Yirginia Forces, Richmond, Ya.: General : On my arrival here I presented your letter to Colonel Taliaferro, and soon had a conference upon the object of my visit. This place is literally without defense against a land attack. A force of five hundred men, landed within a day’s march, with even a feint by water, could take, by prompt movements, every gun. Mr. Clarke, the engineer here, is appointed by Colonel Talcott, and does not consider himself under the command of Colonel Taliaferro. This want of concert prevents unity of action and concert of measures. I could not therefore, without authority from you, urge the citizens to send laborers here to be directed by Mr. Clarke. His time and attention are much required by the works now in progress. I leave at once for Matthews County, in company with Major Page, where one or two companies are reported as organized.

Headquarters, Fredericksburg, Fa., May 22,1861. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir : I have the honor to state, for the information of the commanding general, that I have not been able to push the organization of volunteer companies forward with sufficient rapidity to make up a force of sufficient strength (under discipline) for our sole reliance, in the event of an attack on our Potomac coast, within a brief period of time.
I am under the necessity of manning the batteries by companies of volunteers, in consequence of the ineffectual efforts of the naval officers to enroll men for that service; and, indeed, I have been obliged to perform work on those batteries by detail for the want of laborers. It is to be observed that Captain Walker’s battery has not, therefore, thus far (in spite of the united efforts of the captain and myself), been put in readiness for the field, being deficient in men and equipments, and this is the only field battery in the department.
The above-noted employments, in connection with the necessity of covering the batteries and the avenues of approach to this city, have absorbed my volunteer force to such an extent that, if attacked by the enemy in great numbers, re-enforcements will be necessary 5 say at least one thousand well-disciplined volunteers and a field battery.
If occasion demands, I propose telegraphing to you for such force (well supplied with ammunition) the moment it is apparent that it will be needed, to repel actual invasion, with the confident hope that it will be sent.

panies of artillery, and a naval battery, amounting, in the aggregate, to about eight thousand men, of whom about seven thousand three hundred are able to go into combat, well armed. The five regiments of infantry from Virginia have good arms, but are very deficient in cartridge-boxes, belts, and ball-screws. The Alabama regiment is well appointed, has brought its tents and camp equipage, and is well clothed. Arms in good order. The two regiments from Mississippi have with them their tents and camp equipage, but are not satisfied with their arms, which are chiefly of the old flint-lock musket altered into percussion. As usual with troops of this description, they all want rifles. They were informed that, for the present, they must rest contented with such arms as it was in the power of the Government to give them. One of these regiments (the Eleventh), under the command of Colonel Moore, is very superior to the other (the Second), under Colonel Ealkner. The latter is badly clothed and very careless in its appointments. The officers are entirely without military knowledge of any description, and the men have a slovenly and unsoldier-like appearance. The other regiment seems to take much pride in its appearance, and is endeavoring to improve itself by military exercises. All the infantry regiments are drilled daily in the school of the soldier and company, and valuable assistance in this respect is received from the young men who have been instructed at the military school at Lexington. But there is no ground in the immediate vicinity upon which the maneuvers of a large battalion can take place, consequently there is a lamentable want of knowledge of the first principles of formation into line and the changes of front and breaking into column. There are no regular regimental parades established, upon which to form quickly, in case of alarm. The Virginia regiments are only partially supplied with tents, and the main body of them are quartered in houses in the towns of Harper’s Ferry and Bolivar. Crowded together, as they necessarily are, I fear that utter confusion must be the consequence of any sudden movement. I speak, of course, only of the present. Undoubtedly a proper course of instruction must produce its good effects, and it is to be hoped that a steady improvement will take place. The attention of General Johnston has been called to these important points.
The artillery companies are drilled in the school of the soldier, without arms. There are no artillery horses, and therefore there is no such thing on the ground as light artillery. There are but four light pieces with Captain Pendleton’s company at Bolivar, at which the men are instructed in the manual of the piece. There are six guns with Captain Imboden’s company at the Point of Bocks. At this place also Captain Ashby is stationed, with two companies of cavalry and two hundred infantry, his total force amounting to four hundred men, one hundred and thirty-three horses, and six guns. His two positions are immediately at the bridge crossing the Potomac from the Point of Rocks and at the Potomac Forge half a mile distant. His cavalry covers the country for twenty miles to his rear, while his attention is immediately given to the line of railroad from Baltimore, which passes the Point of Rocks on the Maryland side. I am quite confident that, with the vigilance which is exercised by Captain Ashby, no enemy can pass the point which he is directed to observe. Should he be assailed from his rear, say by way of Leesburg, he could easily cross the bridge and retreat upon Harper’s Ferry 5 and in doing so destroy the bridge, the piers of which are already mined for such a contingency.
The naval batteries, under Lieutenant Fauntleroy, are placed on the northern and southern salients of the village of Harper’s Ferry, and

envelope with their fire the whole of the town of Bolivar and the approaches by the immediate banks of the Potomac and Shenandoah Bivers. There are at this time but two 32-pounders in position in each battery on plain platforms, and the guns on ship’s carriages. It is intended to increase the number of guns in each battery to six. These batteries would be very formidable in resisting an attack upon the town of Harper’s Ferry.
The cavalry, under Lieut. Col. J. E. B. Stuart, is in very good condition, and quite effective. Their arms are a small-sized revolver and a saber; no carbines. The horses are good, and all the men ride well. They are made exceedingly useful in the duties of scouts and vedettes, covering a considerable extent of country to the front.
The hospital department is very deficient in every respect. There are a few beds in the general hospital, but there is no provision whatever made for the care of wounded men, in the event of an engagement taking place. Bequisitions for medicines and for hospital stores have been made on the surgeon-general at Bichmond, and he is now earnestly endeavoring to supply the wants of this department at Harper’s Ferry. The general state of health in the regiments was good, and there was no epidemic of any kind. Exposure to many cold, rainy nights had caused some severe colds among the men from the extreme South, and there were some cases of the ordinary camp diseases, but nothing very serious.
The clothing of the troops is not abundant, and, in the regiment from Mississippi, under Colonel Falkner, almost every necessary is wanting. They seem to have come away from home without making proper preparations in this respect, and, indeed, it would seem that they expected to receive on their arrival in Virginia all the appointments of a soldier. Fortunately the approach of warm weather will obviate the necessity of a full supply of clothing for these men; otherwise they could not enter upon a campaign in their present condition. I recommend an early attention on the part of the proper officers to this important subject of clothing.
In regard to camp and garrison equipage, so much is required that I do not consider it necessary to enter into particulars. From what I can learn of the deficiency of such articles in the adjacent country and even in Bichmond, it will be necessary for the Quartermaster’s Department to cause everything of the nature referred to to be made, and this should be done at once. The supplies of subsistence are abundant, except in the item of bacon. There is plenty of beef, and a large quantity of flour on hand, enough to last many months. In view of the defense of the immediate position at Harper’s Ferry, there is now there an ample force for that purpose. The enemy can make no successful attack, either by the way of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad or by the Maryland Heights, both of which approaches can easily be defended. The principal direction by which an attacking force would move would be by crossing the Potomac from eight to fifteen miles above by fords which are known to be practicable, and then, moving circuitously, come in by the roads leading to the northwestern approach to the Ferry. The troops moving out could meet the enemy in several good positions, and, if forced back by superior numbers, could yet take up their lines on the edge of the town, and, with the assistance of the artillery, could defy and beat back five times their numbers with perfect ease.
Under the existing state of affairs, that is, with the means at hand, for offensive operations coming from Baltimore or Pennsylvania, Harper’s Ferry may be looked upon as perfectly safe. But if the war is to

assume much larger proportions, it might be possible for the enemy to shut up our force now assembled there, and, with superior numbers, X>ass on with a heavy force and occupy the valleys beyond, in Western Virginia. If this should ever be suspected to be the plans of the enemy, of what use would it be to hold on to Harper’s Ferry ? In such a state of affairs, it would be much better to abandon the Ferry altogether, remove the machinery, destroy the buildings, blow up the bridge, and move out into the valleys, and thus maneuver against the advancing enemy ; in addition to which a force should be sent at once up the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad to blow up the tunnels, and burn the bridges on Cheat Biver, and otherwise cause such damage to the road as to render impossible the passage of a force from Wheeling or Parkers^ burg.
I inclose a small sketch of the position at Harper’s Ferry, the various roads in the vicinity being marked by red lines.
The major-general commanding will understand that a report of this nature, being that of raw volunteers, just arrived (from long distances in several cases), is not of so minute a character as it would be with troops of better training and of more experience in war.

Sir : The inclosed letter was received by me this morning from Major Cary. It seemed to be so important that I immediately started for this place. There has been a large accession of force at Old Point. (For the details see the inclosed report of Major Cary.)* Finding, on my arrival here, that Major Cary had gone to Old Point to see General Butler, and considering it better for me to be present at the interview, I followed, and was, after getting in proper form within the pickets of the Federal troops, unceremoniously dealt with ,• was taken prisoner and marched into the fort.

collision between our scouts. I could only gather from him that it was u a military necessity” for him to occupy our land for an encampment, and that he could only say that, if he was not interfered with by bodies of armed troops, he would molest no one. He indicated his determination to take possession of anything which he might deem necessary for his use. In accordance with these principles he has taken three of Colonel Mallory’s negroes, which he has refused to give up on application. I dispatched to Colonel Ewell a detailed account of a reconnaissance which they made on yesterday to this place.* They marched a regiment of about eight hundred men, supported by a battery of six brass pieces, and perhaps a still further reserve. I presume Colonel Ewell has forwarded it to you. They are now encamping, or rather apparently selecting their ground, about three-fourths of one mile distant from this place. I demanded of General Butler that he should see into the reason of Colonel Ewell’s arrest, which he promised me, just as he left (when for the first time I heard of it), that the matter should be attended to. If he is not released in the morning I shall make a more formal demand under a flag of truce. As it will take my messenger nearly all night to reach the river connection in the morning, I must bring this to an abrupt close, craving your indulgence for its desultory character.

Headquarters, Fredericksburg, Va.7 May 24,1861. General R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir : I have the honor to state, in answer to the communication from the commanding general of the forces, dated the 13th instant, that I cannot spare the two companies from Richmond (Captains Wise’s and Cunningham’s), without irreparable injury to the service for some time to come. These companies, under the command of Colonel Cary, are now (in conjunction with other forces) covering the Potomac batteries and avenues of approach, becoming acquainted with the character of the district and its natural defenses, thus rendering their services indispensable.
I have also to state (on information) that the officers and men in said companies are anxious to remain here, to be incorporated with a regiment about being organized. Their return to Richmond, it is said, would give the greatest dissatisfaction, and very probably break up these fine companies.
The receipt this morning of private advices from Washington warrants the belief that the enemy contemplate striking a blow without much further delay. Under these circumstances, as I am not able to place a sufficient force for the protection of the upper border of Stafford County, from which, if a landing is once effected, a flank movement will endanger the efficiency of the Aquia Creek battery, and as the force for covering the battery on the Potomac Creek is not of sufficient strength to do full justice to the position, I respectfully recommend that one thousand well-disciplined volunteers be sent here, with a battery of four rifled or smooth-bore field guns for immediate service. With this reenforcement I shall hope to prevent the enemy from effecting a landing or advancing before additional force may be concentrated against him.
I respectfully represent that a successful debarkation of the enemy on this part of the Potomac coast would in all probability drive a large portion of the population from between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers, possessing themselves of a large amount of supplies, (necessary for the support of the people and our forces), and thus carry

demoralization and alarm throughout the State, from the fact that a successful invasion of our soil had been effected. The position of the enemy once attained between the Potomac and the Rappahannock Rivers, a fertile region, filled with supplies and resources, would, from its natural advantages, become a most important possession, from which it would be difficult to dislodge him.

General Benj. Huger, Comdg. Virginia Forces, Norfolk, Va. : General : I wish to -call your attention to the condition of Craney Island. It is the first point that will arrest the passage of a vessel to Norfolk) it is the most exposed and the least prepared for defense. I cannot urge upon you too strongly the necessity of putting it in good condition. More troops should be ordered there, and laborers, if practicable. If laborers cannot be obtained, the troops must work at the trenches at that point and all others within your lines of defense. A North Carolina regiment will leave here to morrow for your post.
Very respectfully, &c.,

Colonel : Your letter of the 24th instant* has just been received. I understand there is no cavalry at Fort Monroe, no baggage wagons, and but one company of light artillery. I do not think an immediate movement by land may be expected, but 1 wish you to be prepared for any emergency. According to reports in this office, there must be three companies of cavalry under your command. 1 will order to you five more. We have no wagons yet for service with troops in the field. It is supposed that you will find no difficulty in procuring wagons and teams in the neighborhood, as many persons in that section of the country engaged in the wood trade, which is now suspended, must have them on hand. You will please see what arrangements you can make for hiring or purchasing the same through your quartermaster, and let him make a report to the chief quartermaster at this place.

Colonel : Two 12-pounder brass pieces have been directed to be sent you at Yorktown, which may be applied to the land defenses either below Yorktown or Williamsburg, as you may deem best. Two 8-inch columbiads are also sent to you at Yorktown, and, if not wanted for the water defense, they had better be applied to the land, either there or at Williamsburg. I again urge upon you the necessity of the line of defenses between the heads of Queen and College Creeks, about which Colonel Ewell has already received instructions. Colonel Ewell had better be directed to apply all the force he can procure to the erection of those lines. Captains Fives and Meade, of the Engineer Corps, are on duty in the peninsula, and subject to your orders. Should the lines below Williamsburg not have been surveyed and laid out, they had better be put at it directly.

Sir : I have not been able to see Colonel Ewell since my arrival here. We learn from Mr. White, a member of your troop, that you are probably at Back Eiver, and that you have been joined by a company of rifles and one of artillery, the latter with two or three pieces. If so, you must be very careful not to be cut off by a larger party getting in your ' rear. It would be difficult for you to bring off your pieces if the enemy got in your rear. You will therefore keep mounted sentinels at night at or near Newport News wharf, on your right, and at all the proper points on your left; and should you "discover a design to cut you off, you must withdraw in time to prevent it. It would be very desirable

to have the artillery drawn by horses or mules. Ordinary wagon harness will answer, and the people of the country ought to furnish the horses. If you cannot get the horses you will lose your pieces, if the enemy choose to send a force up James Eiver much larger than yours. I therefore think that you had better send your artillery to Hood’s Mill, about ten miles from here. Place it strongly there, protected by your rifles, and keep your cavalry, as usual, in sight of Fort Monroe. In this way you would show front to the fort, and place your guns and rifles in safe connection with this point.

Colonel : I have received your communication of the 25th instant. In reply, I would state that I do not think it advisable to receive the company of cavalry from Gloucester. The Varina Troop, Capt. Abner Aiken, and a company from Charles City County, have already been ordered to you. The insufficiency of forage, to which you have alluded, and the unsuitability of the country for the action of cavalry, densely covered as it is by woods and intersected by creeks, nearly render it necessary to diminish the number of companies which you were yesterday informed would be sent you. I request that you will inform me how many companies you will need and how many can be provided for, as it is impossible to send you forage from Richmond.

If, after the arrival of the Second Regiment Tennessee Volunteers and the battery of four 6-pounders, you deem your force still insufficient to hold the enemy in check until other re-enforcements could reach you, it is suggested that you might draw from the counties before mentioned such companies as might be best spared from their present localities. If your mounted force is not already sufficient, and the service of Captain Cauthorn’s company is deemed indispensable, you can muster it into service.

hundred men. The statement includes what is still in the Ordnance Department, and is exclusive of the twelve or fifteen rounds issued. I respectfully suggest the importance of instant measures to send an additional supply as soon as possible. There is scarcely half enough here for an action.
We are observing the river from Williamsport to the Point of Rocks, at least thirty miles. Our force is too small, however, to prevent invasion by an enemy strong enough to be willing to attempt it. To hold this point and observe the river above the Point of Rocks would require fifteen or twenty thousand men. This position can be turned easily and effectively from above and below. After turning it, an enemy attacking in the rear would have decided advantage of ground against so small a force as our present one. Should the enemy cross the river the troops in this vicinity would be best employed in trying to retard his advance into the country. Their utter want of discipline and instruction will render it difficult to use them in the field. I beg to receive the views and instructions of the Commander-in-Chief in relation to the manner in which the troops under my command can best be used. I am procuring wagons to march, if necessary.
Captain Ashby, commanding near the Point of Rocks, was instructed by my predecessor to break the railroad whenever he found such a measure necessary for his defense. Those instructions were repeated by me. Captain Ashby reported this morning that in consequence of intelligence just received he was about to throw a mass of rock upon it, by blasting.
Most respectfullv, your obedient servant,

Memorandum in relation to Harper’s Ferry.
[May 26, 1861.]
There is no danger of attack in front, but the position is easily turned by crossing the river above or below. The present force is not sufficient for defense against a superior one, attacking from the Virginia side. Relief, in case of investment, could not be furnished. Considered as a position, I regard Harper’s Perry as untenable by us at present against a strong enemy. We have outposts at the Point of Rocks, near the ferry at Williamsport, and the bridge at Shepherdstown, the extreme points being at least thirty miles apart. Our effective force, including those detachments and two others on the opposite heights, is about five thousand men, with one hundred and forty thousand cartridges and seventy-five thousand percussion caps. The only way in which this force can be made useful, I think, is by rendering it movable, and employing it to prevent or retard the enemy’s passage of the Potomac, and, should he effect the crossing, in opposing his advance into the country. This I shall endeavor to do, unless instructed to the contrary. Orders to provide wagons have been given. Cartridges have been made at the rate of four thousand per diem. I have directed increase of the force employed. Bullet-molds and cartridge-paper are wanting, and may not be^ procured.

The effect of either of these movements will be to cut off your communication with Bichmond, and I take the liberty of calling your attention to this, as I know the pressure of the duties now upon you.

Headquarters, YorTctown, Yu., May 27, 1861.
Col. E. S. Garnett :
Sir : The women and children have been passing here all day from Hampton, and Major Cary also is retreating on this place with about sixty-five men, out of some two hundred, which he had a day or two since—the remainder of his men being occupied attending to their retreating families. He left two pieces of indifferent artillery behind him within three miles of Hampton. I sent down for these to-night, and think they will be here, or at least in a place of safety by daylight. Since my last dispatch, which I sent through Colonel Ewell, further intelligence has reached me, to the effect that a large body of troops, some two thousand five hundred or three thousand, perhaps exaggerated, marched out of Old Point by the head of Hampton Creek, the bridge by Hampton having been burned, passed through Hampton, and marched to Newport News and united with those who landed there to-day, making, by the smallest accounts, five thousand men. The statement with regard to the number of troops may be inaccurate, but from official reports, from Major Cary and otherwise, there is a very considerable body of Federal troops occupying that place, from which they can march to this place in one day with ease, or can reach this place more rapidly by landing their troops at Grove Landing, on James River, about eight miles from here, and over a road not easily defensible by inferior numbers. This landing is on my right and rear, being, as I said before, only eight miles from here and seven miles from Williamsburg, the distance from the latter place to this being twelve miles, and Williamsburg itself being northwest from us. Colonel Ewell reports to-day that he has only one hundred and eighty men under his command, and Colonel August, whom I left there because I saw that Williamsburg was very much exposed, has only between six and seven hundred men.
I shall urge upon Colonel Ewell your instructions in reference to the defenses between the heads of Queen and College Creeks, directing him to employ all the officers and soldiers of his command as laborers, all the troops here being employed night and day in this capacity. To-day he informs me that he has moved his force and that of Colonel August towards Grove Landing, keeping, however, I presume, his laborers employed upon the defenses between Queen and College Creeks and in

front of Williamsburg. I have not had a moment’s time to examine the country farther than within the circumference of seven or eight miles. I therefore have not been to Williamsburg. I am perfectly satisfied, however, that if the enemy land in force at either of the places on the James River above mentioned and march upon Williamsburg, it will fall, unless strongly re-enforced, or unless I march to operate on his flank and rear while he is making the attack, in which case I should leave this point entirely uncovered and expose it to an attack in its rear from Fort Monroe. This place carried, Gloucester Point is commanded, and the enemy’s ships enter York River. In case of such an alternative, I should decide to defend this place to the last, unless I was satisfied that I could march upon the enemy, beat him, and return in time to meet an attack from the neighborhood of Fort Monroe. Anticipating before I left Richmond that the landing places below Jamestown Island would soon become insecure, I wrote from the depot to the Quartermaster-General a note, begging him to send some lighters of an appropriate kind to ply between Jamestown Island and the mainland on the road to Williamsburg, to enable the commanding general to throw rapidly into the latter place, if he thought proper, the necessary troops and supplies. I do not know if this has been done. It is absolutely necessary that the facilities of both rivers should be used to the utmost to carry on vigorously military operations in the country embraced between them. I know the troops are needed on every line, but I believe I cannot overrate the importance of preserving a numerical superiority of all arms over the enemy on the line of operations between this place and Jamestown, the lowest defensible points on the two rivers, while the works between Queen and College Creeks are being erected. I would respectfully represent, therefore, that the line from Yorktown to Jamestown be occupied by from eight to ten thousand men, and the defenses at the extremities—that is, at mouth of York River and Jamestown Island, be strengthened in every conceivable manner. I wanted Colonel Ewell to cause to be collected the most combustible materials at the wharfs at the landings below Jamestown Island, and to cause these wharfs to be burned whenever the enemy, in great force, makes an unmistakable demonstration to land. I close for fear of detaining the steamer. The second navy gun is in position, and I hope the third will be to-morrow night.
Major Cary and his command have just arrived, confirming the report of a large collection of troops at Newport News, and the presence, near that point, of a large fleet, destination unknown. I beg leave to call the attention of the General-in-Chief earnestly to the fact that there are but fifty rounds of ammunition for the navy batteries, the shells being without fuses, and, if four guns were mounted, there would be only about twelve rounds each. The navy officer reports a coil of heavy rope needed to make wads with. Please also direct one hundred rounds of ammunition to be sent for a 6-pounder gun, brought in by Major Cary, and one hundred rounds for a 12-pounder howitzer, likewise brought in by him. The formal requisition will be sent afterwards.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Colonel, Commanding Hampton Line.

Sir: I have this moment an express from Lieutenant-Colonel Mc-Causland, at Buffalo, dated yesterday, stating, “The Government has sent two hundred men to Gallipolis, and will have six hundred more there to-day. We are informed that they are intended to attack this camp. Send down all the troops you have.” In addition to this, reliable information reaches me that large numbers of troops are concentrating at Oak Hill, twenty-three miles back of Gallipolis, and also at other places along the border. My idea is that these troops have been thrown into this proximity in order to overawe the loyal citizens of that region. For further particulars I beg leave to refer you to the bearer, of this, Mr. David Kirkpatrick, a resident of this valley, and a well informed man.

Falls of Kanawha, Ya., May 27,1861. Col. B. S. Garnett, Adjutant- General:
Sir : I avail myself of a few moments’ delay of the stage to explain more fully the nature of my communication this morning. I consider it of sufficient importance for the employment of a special messenger, and accordingly have instructed the bearer, Mr. Kirkpatrick, to convey this in person, and to telegraph from Staunton its import. I shall of course proceed to Buffalo as rapidly as possible. The idea is that the enemy intend crossing the Ohio Biver, to attack the camps at Buffalo. Unless they come in greatly superior force, we shall drive them back. On the other hand, if his numbers are large and the disaffection of the inhabitants strongly evinced, I shall take the most defensible position I may find, and rally the volunteers now in process of formation in the adjoining counties. Great excitement prevails in this region. The divided sentiment of the people adds to the confusion, and, except the few loyal companies now mustered into the service of the State, there are few of the people who sympathize with the secession policy. I send a special messenger (Mr. Kirkpatrick), because he is familiar with the whole of Ohio border, and can give you valuable information as to the resources, distances, &e. Mr. Kirkpatrick is reliable and intelligent. It is very desirable that Mr. Kirkpatrick should be the purveyor of some supplies for the troops which cannot be procured here. I beg that the quartermaster may be instructed to forward by him material for tents, three hundred blankets, five hundred cartridge-boxes (musket), and ten thousand percussion caps (rifle), &c.
In great haste, yours, respectfully,

[Col. Garnett:]
Colonel : I reported to you on the 26th instant, for the information of the Commander-in-Chief, that the troops under my command are observing the river from Williamsport to the Point of Eocks. I will now give what was then omitted—the precise disposition of these troops:
Colonel Allen is opposite to Williamsport, thirty miles above, with his own regiment, two companies of Colonel Hill’s, and a section of artillery. The position cannot be defended by such a force, the ferry at Wiliiamsport being at the vertex of a horseshoe, five or six miles in length, having another at each heel. A company of cavalry and a section of artillery guard the bridge at Shepherdstown. There are two companies of infantry, two of cavalry, and six field pieces, with their men, at the bridge at the Point of Eocks, twelve miles below, and a company of cavalry at the Berlin Bridge, halfway to the Point of Eocks. Preparations have been made to break each of these two bridges and the railroad bridge here. It is more than forty miles from Williamsport to the Point of Eocks. A detachment of three hundred and fifty infantry occupies a point on the Maryland Heights, one and a half miles from the near end of the crest of the ridge, and two and a half miles from Harper’s Ferry. The crest of the ridge beyond the Shenandoah is guarded by two companies of infantry.
In the present state of the river no force that could be detached from this place could prevent its passage by an enemy. In a few weeks, or even dafs, when fords will be numerous, an army will be necessary to guard the Potomac above, as far as the western line of Berkeley. With this point occupied, as it is, some five or six thousand men, judiciously placed between Martinsburg and the line, and a reserve of about the same force within striking distance of each, invasion would be difficult. As matters now are, the enemy can easily seize Martinsburg, in the heart of a disloyal population, and nearer than Harper’s Ferry to Winchester.
If the Commander-in-Chief has precise instructions to give, I beg to receive them early. I have prepared means of transportation for a march. Should it be decided that the troops should constitute a garrison, this expense can be reduced.
Your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTOK

[Chap. IX.
Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 28,1861.
Consultation on the condition of Harpers Ferry and its defenses reduced
to writing.
The plan of the enemy, indicated by his movements, seems to be a cautious approach to, and entrance of, disaffected districts, securing his advance, if possible, by securing the sentiments of the peojffe. In the district to the northwest of Harper’s Ferry these tactics will be the best he can follow, on account of known Union proclivities and the vicinity of the frontier.
Large bodies of troops are gathering at Carlisle and Chambersburg, the number already reported (probably exaggerated) being fifteen thousand. When ready to move they will occupy Martinsburg, crossing at Williamsport and Shepherdstown. Martinsburg is well known to be disaffected. His line, established from Martinsburg towards Shepherdstown, has an excellent base, and communications very difficult to interrupt by the Hagerstown and Cumberland roads, and very seriously threatens, not only Harper’s Ferry, with its present forces and conditions, but our whole line of operations. Martinsburg is nearer to Winchester than the Ferry, and access easy. Our holding Winchester is necessary to maintain the Ferry. To hold this post, then, either as a fortress, a point fflappui, or as a condition of the defense of the Virginia Valley, we require a force of from twelve to fifteen thousand men, of which two regiments should be cavalry. The force now at the Ferry (about five thousand effectives) might remain as at present, while the main body should be posted centrally, as at Burns’ Ford, on the Ope-quan, where a strong position might be selected, and, if necessary, defended by lines. The strengthening and re-enforcement of this force, as now constituted, seems to have ceased when most necessary. It is essential that supplies of ammunition (especially of equipments of shoes) should be forwarded in quantity, otherwise, without the arrangement designated, we are so deficient in ammunition that this force jnust, on the advance of the enemy, move out from the Ferry and maneuver, to prevent being shut up in a cul-de-sac.
The plan sketched above will absolutely force the enemy to very great delay and vastly extended preparations. It continually (by way of Leesburg and the eastern slope of the ridge) threatens the District of Columbia. If, however, he is beforehand with us (besides the present disastrous results), he gains what may take time, means, and men, on a similar scale, to recover.

As to their state of forwardness, the works have not yet been fully planned by the engineers. One very important has been and is progressing rapidly. A large number of the hands (nearly or quite five hundred), including a part of the volunteer force, are at work. I see no occasion for further delay. I beg you to call the attention of the Commanding General to the fact that the force now here is not sufficient to repel a serious attack. If Yorktown, Jamestown; or the defenses below Williamsburg fall, the way will be open to Eich-mond. To defend them, more troops are necessary, well supplied with artillery. Colonel Magruder is well convinced of all this. So far as he has mentioned his opinions to me, his views coincide with mine, and thus I am more fully convinced of their correctness.
With high respect, your obedient servant,

Sir : There are, including the volunteers, five hundred men at work on the defenses below Williamsburg. There has been some delay, I think, in consequence of the necessity of allowing time to the engineers to complete their reconnaissance. These defenses will be pushed forward with all possible dispatch. Unless artillery is furnished to defend them with, I fear they will avail but little. There ought to be two light batteries at least. Now there is not a piece. Your immediate attention is asked to this.

I recommend, most urgently, that the light batteries asked for by Colonel Ewell be furnished without delay. If they are sent mounted and without horses, harness, or caissons, they will answer.

Not having the requisite staff, I have to allow them to use acting appointments, without pay, to perform the duty. Such articles as they find it necessary to procure, I must order paid by the quartermaster here, Capt. J. A. Johnston, who, I am happy to inform you, has now entered upon his duties. The law of Yirginia gives volunteers an allowance in money for clothing; but, as the men are not paid, the volunteers, especially those from distant States, can get no clothing, as they have no money to procure it with. I will have to get for them the articles which are absolutely necessary, and have the amount advanced deducted from their pay. I find officers here without means of procuring provisions. I will have to ration them, or give them means to buy food, and deduct it from their pay. I mention these necessities, that you may, if you think proper, cover such cases by a general order. The Federal forces seem establishing themselves at Newj>ort News. They have landed some ordnance and many stores. All the transport steamers have left but one.

Headquarters, Yorktown, Va., May 29, 1861. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces :
Sir : I sent to Hampton for the two pieces left by Major Cary’s command, and succeeded in bringing them up. I sent last night a detachment of light artillery, acting as cavalry, to bring up some spades, shovels, &c., with a large quantity of rope, &c. They have arrived. I hope to be able to leave here to-morrow, with some cavalry and light artillery, to protect the people near Hampton at least, and would like to take down my command of infantry, except three companies of the Yirginia battalion, if I thought that troops from Eichmond could be sent to Williamsburg, and between that place and this. I do not like to leave Yorktown exposed to be taken from Grove Landing. I am anxious to attack, to make the enemy stay within his own immediate neighborhood. Lieutenant Thornton, who is now sick, is my acting assistant adjutant-general. He has had no experience. I have nobody but my nephew, Mr. Magruder, who is a citizen, and Mr. Stanard, who is a private. Captain Lambert, assistant quartermaster, is at Williamsburg, where a quartermaster ought to be stationed. I must have an efficient one here. The whole of my time nearly is occupied in doing other peopled duties. I merely speak of this, as it prevents me from being as useful as I desire. I think that Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, if he could be spared, would be of great service here.
There is corn and long forage enough in the lower part of the peninsula and about here for one thousand horses, as I am informed by Major Cary, Virginia volunteers. He knows the country. The defenses here and at Williamsburg and vicinity are progressing rapidly.
More troops are necessary at Williamsburg, and between that place and this, or rather facing Grove Landing. All the property of the citizens near Hampton, except that of Union men, will fall into the hands of the enemy, except also that which I can cause to be saved. To-day, for the first time, I have had the use of cavalry. Captain Douthat marched forty-seven miles yesterday, and joined me Jast night at 11 o’clock. I send him to-night near Hampton, with Captain Brown’s artillery, to protect the people, save their property, and, if possible, to cut off some of the enemy. The number of Federal troops at Newport News is probably between five and ten thousand, as they were landing troops from Monday, perhaps half the daylight, till after dark on Tuesday. There are no vessels there this morning. I do not think there are more than five thousand men at the most. I shall probably go down in person to-night or to-morrow morning.
This place has been most carefully examined by me as to its capabilities of defense, at a distance or near, and I am satisfied that it cannot be taken by any number of men that can be brought against it, if it is properly intrenched and defended by a sufficient number of men 5 that is, as long as the mouth of the river is secured by the batteries on this side and on Gloucester Point, which I think will be the case when all the guns are in position that are contemplated. There are here, of all arms, two thousand five hundred and four officers and men. I left Colonel August’s regiment at Williamsburg because I saw that it (Williamsburg) was unprotected. Two regiments of infantry, in addition to the present force, would make this place I think perfectly safe. Since I last wrote, it has been greatly strengthened. Two regiments of infantry, more if possible, should be sent to Williamsburg. I have invited the magistrates of the adjacent counties to meet me here this afternoon, at 5 o’clock, to have all the wagons in the counties collected, and to be

Intelligence was brought me this morning, from a gentleman residing near Hagerstown, that 1,600 troops arrived in Chambersburg on Tuesday and 5,000 yesterday, making, with the 3,500 there before, 10,100, with plenty of artillery (quantity unknown), many wagons and horses. A note was shown me yesterday, written in Hagerstown on Wednesday afternoon, by a woman, in which it is said that such a force is to move to the Potomac (with baggage wagons) from Chambersburg through either Hagerstown or Greencastle.
In another note (from an officer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), it is said that large forces are to enter Virginia somewhere between Cumberland and Hagerstown to meet Ohio troops. The Northern papers confirm this.
An officer of the railroad told me here that news of the occupation of Grafton by U. S. troops is brought by telegraph. We can learn nothing from the west, nor beyond the range of persons specially employed. Should the enemy cross the river above, we cannot learn when the Ohio troops join them, nor in what numbers.

On good authority, I believe the landing at Newport News to be a sanitary measure, and the enemy’s forces there do not exceed thirty-five hundred men. If I may be permitted, and the troops in Yorktown can co-operate with me, I think I can (say two nights hence) cross the James Biver and strike him a blow, and then retire.

General Joseph E. Johnston,
Commanding, cfee., Harper’s Ferry, Va. :
General : I received, on my return from Manassas Junction, your communications of the 26th and 28th ultimo, in reference to your position at Harper’s Ferry. The difficulties which surround it have been felt from the beginning of its occupation, and I am aware of the obstacles to its maintenance with your present force. Every effort has been made to remove them, and will be continued, but with similar necessities pressing on every side you need not be informed of the difficulty of providing against them. The arrangements made ard positions taken by the troops under your command are judicious, and it is hoped that sufficient re-enforcements can be sent you to enable you to occupy your present point in force and carry out the plan of defense indicated in your communications. Great reliance is placed on your good judgment, the skill of your officers, and the ardor of your troops, and should you be attacked by a force which you may be unable to resist at all points and to keep beyond the frontier, you must move out of your position and destroy all facilities for the approach or shelter of an enemy. Concentrate your troops, and contest his approach step by step into the interior.
With a view of making your column movable, the Quartermaster’s Department was ordered, some weeks ago, to provide all the wagons they could, and I was informed that agents were sent to the country east and west of the Blue Bidge for the purpose. The little use for wagons, save for farming purposes, makes their collection difficult; but by the efforts of the Quartermaster’s Department and the means you have taken it is hoped you may be provided.
Ammunition has been sent to you. The supply was necessarily limited, in consequence of the calls from other points. Can you make arrangements to provide an auxiliary amount for your command %
I have informed you of the military arrangements east of the Blue Bidge. A large force is now collecting in front of Alexandria, and General Beauregard has been sent to command it. Its presence will make the enemy cautious in approaching your rear south of the Potomac, and in that event I hope you will receive timely intelligence, through the light troops under Colonel Ewell, extending to the Leesburg road. Should such a movement be made, as was suggested in a previous letter, you are expected to use your discretion as to the best mode of meeting it.

Tennessee Regiment, now at this place, Colonel _ Turney, has also been directed to report to you as soon as practicable. With this re-enforcement, and such as you may be able to obtain from the valley, you may probably hold your position and prevent the passage of the Potomac by hostile troops until further troops can reach you.* I think that no troops from Ohio have yet reached Grafton, as a special messenger from Colonel Porterfield reports the contrary, and that certain bridges on the Parkersburg road had been burned. Some little time must therefore elapse, in all probability, before a movement can be made against you from that direction. Information of the movements of troops in that direction might be obtained from friends in that region.

Sir : Your telegraphic dispatch of yesterday to the governor of the State, for ammunition for Captain Waiker’s battery, was referred to the General Commanding, and the Ordnance Department has been instructed to supply it as far as practicable. The General regrets to have to remind an officer of your experience of the propriety of adhering to the usages of the military service in relation to official communications. Your application for ammunition should have been sent for his action. He feels constrained to call your attention also to the necessity of economizing the ammunition issued to the troops. The straitened means of the State are taxed to the last degree to provide for the first wants of the troops in this respect. As understood by him, the recent exchange of shots between your batteries on the Potomac and the enemy’s vessels could have no other result than to waste ammunition and to expose our condition and the strength of the batteries, which was probably the object of his visit.

Camp Johnston, Van May 31, 1861.
Brigadier-General Johnston:
Sir : I have the honor to report the following information, just obtained :
The Federal troops concentrated at Chambersburg number thirteen thousand. The advance guard, of three thousand, left there at lp.m. for Hagerstown, where they will encamp to-night, from which force vedettes are to be thrown into Williamsport. Two companies are said to have been sent towards the river above (point not known), supposed to be at a ford. From the accompanying map you will see our position. The ford northwest of camp is susceptible of good defense. The one opposite Williamsport can be protected without difficulty by the enemy, if they have artillery.
The communication in pencil is from a perfectly reliable source. I would wish positive instructions, and, if to make a stand, re-enforcements. My line of defense is too extended for my present force. Owing to disaffection in Captain White’s cavalry, they are not as efficient as they should be, and incompetent to guard the river.
Your most obedient servant,
J. W. ALLEN, Colonel, First Infantry.
[Inclosure No. 2.]
Martinsburu, Va.,--------------, 1861.
According to the best information to be obtained here, Colonel Porterfield left Grafton last Monday, with his command, of about one thousand five hundred men. He went to Philippi, in Barbour County, where he probably awaits re-enforcements, expected from the valley. The U. S. troops from Wheeling, to the number of about two thousand, arrived at Mannington (forty miles west of Grafton) last Monday, and stopped to repair two small railroad bridges which had been destroyed near there. The repair of the bridges could not detain them over three or four days. Nothing definite is known here about the U. S. force advancing from Parkersburg to Grafton, but some of the railroad bridges on that line are believed to have been destroyed. There was no military force of either side at Grafton on Wednesday at 4p. m.; but some of the Union men of the neighborhood were gathering there, with such arms as they could get at home.
The above information, meager as it is, is all that we have, and is reliable as far as it goes. The bridges between this and Cumberland should by all means be burned (especially the bridge over the Potomac proper). Small bridges are but a small hinderance, in point of time, to an army, and recollect the railroad is to be the means of precipitating the immense body of men from Ohio and west of Ohio, who are to occupy our Virginia. Only important bridges will present obstacles, as to time, of any material value. West of Cumberland there are also important bridges, but I fear they are in the hands of Union men, and a little force would be required.

The commanding officer at Jamestown has been instructed to transport these guns at once to the neck of land, from which place you will remove them to the works for which they are intended.

[Col. Garnett f]:
Sir : I have just returned from a reconnaissance of the country between this point and the neighborhood of Hampton and Newport News, and have received the most accurate information. There are about nine thousand troops at both places. They are generally in a most disorganized state. Troops are, however, arriving daily. Dr. Cuyler informs Col. Carly S. Jones that no movement would be made until there were fifteen thousand troops at Fort Monroe and Newport News together. This, he supposed, would be within ten days. I am pushing forward the defenses here, and hope to be fully prepared.
I designed an expedition to dislodge the Federal troops from Newport News, which I was informed was almost in a defenseless state as to fortifications; but the regiment from Virginia, under Colonel August, was not ready to take the field, for want of shoes and other necessaries, and I ascertained at the last moment that the position of the troops at Newport News was much stronger than I had been led to believe. I therefore gave it up, and substituted for it one of reconnaissance, and to afford some relief to the frightened people of the country near Hampton. I found that the country was rich in supplies for horses, and that the presence there of two companies of cavalry and one of sharpshooters with a small gun would afford all the protection necessary to induce the

farmers to remain and finisli the cultivation of tlieir crops. I shall send three companies there very soon.
There is some difference of opinion here as to the rank of Colonel Hill, of the North Carolina regiment, and myself. I think I rank him, but am of the impression that it is a subject of some feeling on his part. He has, however, obeyed my orders so far, and I presume will continue to do so. I have been obliged to do almost all the duties of the staff myself until now, when I have the services of Captain Cosby and Captain Lambert, assistant quartermaster 5 the latter wholly without experience. I hope in a few days to have a more perfect organization.
I do not think we shall be attacked by troops coming from Fort Monroe by land over the Peninsula, but that if attacked it will be by sea and by land (from Grove Landing) at the same time. The steamer is waiting. I hope to be able to write more fully to-morrow.

Sir : I have received your letter of the 1st, inclosing report from Colonel Allen and a paper in relation to affairs near Grafton. In reference to the last, the latest reports received from Colonel Porterlield are more favorable than the report from Colonel Allen. A party has been ordered to secure the road at Cheat River and east of it, which I hope will effectually prevent its use. As regards Harper’s Ferry, its abandonment would be depressing to the cause of the South, and I have thought it possible that you might detach a portion of your force towTards Martinsburg, the occupation of which, or a point on the Opequan, would strengthen your posts in front of Williamsport and at Shepherds-town. In addition to the First Tennessee Regiment, a regiment from Georgia has been ordered to join you.

Dear Sir : I arrived here on the 1st, at 2 p. m., and immediately examined the site of this encampment and the place of its proposed defenses. The former is an open country, traversed by good roads in every direction, without any strong natural features for the purposes of defense, and without running water nearer than three miles, except a few small springs at half that distance. The plans of the works are good, but too extensive to be finished in less than two or three weeks, and cannot be garrisoned with less than from three to four thousand men. As this position can be turned in every direction by an enemy, for the purpose of destroying the railroads intended to be defended by

it, it becomes a question whether these works could be held more than a few days when thus isolated.
I have reconnoitered closely several of the fords on Bull Hun and one on Occoquan Run (about three miles from here), which offer strong natural features of defense j but they are so numorous and far apart that only a much larger force than I have here at my command (say not less than from ten to fifteen thousand men) could hope to defend +hem all against a well-organized enemy of about twenty thousand men, who could select his point of attack. I must therefore either be re-enforced at once, as I have not more than about six thousand effective men, or I must be prepared to retire, on the approach of the enemy, in the direction of Richmond, with the intention of arresting him whenever and wherever the opportunity shall present itself, or I must march to meet him at one of said fords, to sell our lives as dearly as practicable. Badly armed and badly equipped as my command is at present, with several of its regiments having but one or two field officers, and having hardly any means of transportation, it would be expecting too much that I could meet with success the Northern foes that are preparing to attack us within a few days with all the advantages of arms, numbers, and discipline. I beg, however, to remark that my troops are not only willing, but are anxious, to meet the enemies of our country under all circumstances.
I remain, dear sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. T. BEAUREGARD.
Headquarters Yorktown, Va., June 3,1861.
Colonel Garnett :
Sir : There are now here, at this post, including officers and men, sick and extra duty, about three thousand four hundred. Colonel Ewell has only about four hundred. I shall station at or near Grove Landing two companies, to fall back upon Colonel EwelPs command, and at Blow’s Mill, four miles this side of Grove Landing, and on the road to this place also two companies, both infantry. I shall also detach a company of rifles from Hampton to that part of the country, and two companies of cavalry, as I stated yesterday. This will make our force about three thousand here, but will leave Colonel Ewell much exposed. As to calling out the militia, this country is so thinly populated that it cannot be depended on. Colonel Ewell, who is with me now, thinks that it will amount to one hundred and fifty men, all told, and these not effective, and not to be relied on. The reason of this, Colonel Ewell says, is that there are many disaffected men in Elizabeth City and the lower part of York County 5 many also being obliged to stay at home on account of the occupation of the country by Federal troops. A large accession of force of infantry and artillery ought, therefore, to be made to this command, in order to secure the line from Jamestown Island and to York River—at least four thousand more. Our lines here are very extended. Our outward right flank defenses are nearly completed. We have a breastwork connecting the old English fort with the head of the ravine, which latter is in front of our position. The old fort protects our left. The navy battery has three guns mounted 5 a fourth will be in position in a day or two. The work itself has been inclosed. I think it labor thrown away upon it, as, if our other positions were carried, we could not find shelter in this inclosed work for one-third of our men. As the plan was arranged before

I came down, I did not interfere. It is intended to strengthen our left by making works which will require regular approaches, if we have time. When once strongly fortified, I shall always be able to defend this work, at least until an army from the interior can raise the siege by beating the besiegers. We expect to be very strong by the end of this week. While this is going on, abattis will be thrown across many of the roads leading to this place, only two being left open for public use, and defenses will be thrown up at all favorable points. The axemen, to make the abattis for exterior defense, go out to-morrow.
I have directed Captain Meade to state how many additional guns he considers necessary for the defenses about to be erected and those now in existence, and how many men will be required to man the various works. I will forward it to the General-in-Chief as soon as made out. I shall be able to supply corn and hay to all the cavalry from this part of the country, if wagons can be sent to me. There are very few about here. I have made a requisition for fifty. Instead of waiting for the whole number, I request that as many as can be obtained be sent, with drivers and teams of course. Tents are absolutely necessary for troops acting in the field. The cavalry, with the exception of Douthat’s company, have no tents, and the houses here are all occupied. I have directed the assistant quartermaster to-day to get boards from a steam saw-mill about seven miles above this place, with which to build sheds for mules and horses. Requisitions for tents for the Third Virginia Regiment are in the hands of the Quartermaster’s Department, and approved, but they have none. Not more than one-third of the force works on the defenses; the rest are drilling. Colonel Ewell has been directed by me to cause the men under his command to work at the defenses intrusted to him, and also to employ, or impress, if necessary, as many negroes as he requires for this purpose.

Fredericksburg, Va., June 3, 1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces :
Sir: I received last evening the General’s views respecting my telegram to Governor Letcher of the 31st ultimo. The views expressed are admitted, on general principles, as correct The General is not probably aware of the return through my office, on the morning in question, if my memory serves me, of the requisition of Captain Walker for ammunition, made some days previously, without having been filled, on the ground of an omission to state the amount of ammunition on hand. I have been informed also that the General was then absent at Manassas Junction. As I approached the scene of action that morning the firing had become rapid and heavy, and there was reason to believe that a crisis was rapidly approaching. Under these circumstances I wrote the telegram, and instructed a clerk, sent to Fredericksburg for that purpose, to send it to the governor, and also to your office. I had been authorized, on entering on duty, immediately on the secession of the State, to communicate directly with the governor on matters deemed by me of material importance. The effort to sustain our cause and to supply Captain Walker’s rifled guns was thus accomplished, enabling me to carry under my personal charge a full supply of ammunition for it upon the field in the midst of the action on Saturday.

Military commanders, I have found from an experience not very limited (and to which the General has been pleased to refer), sometimes sacrifice forms to impending necessities. On the subject of the expenditure of ammunition, the General has not been more solicitous as to its economical use than I have constantly been. Thus far it is well known that the naval batteries are under the exclusive command of the naval officers, and I have had only to assist in locating them, to furnish the men and most of the materials to build them, and (when erected) toman and protect them at all times, much to the prejudice of my volunteer organization, and have never ordered the firing of a single gun from one of them.
I have reason to regret that the General should have, apparently, judged as to* the character of our operations from information possibly derived from irresponsible sources. I trust that the General will believe that, so far as depends upon myself personally, I shall make the best use of such force and material as may be furnished me and as I can raise and collect.
It is to be observed that, although our forces have not suffered, I should not be willing, trusting to rumor and observation, to assure the enemy so readily for loss sustained.

Sir : I have intelligence from the other side up to 3 p. m. yesterday. No Federal troops at Hagerstown, Boonsborough, or at any other point in the valley. At Chambersburg there are said to be some ten or twelve thousand men, though my informant believed that their number was exaggerated.
A true friend from Maryland, living three miles from this post, came over last night with information that on Sunday a prominent Eepublican, of Washington County, Maryland, named Cook, accompanied by a Pennsylvanian, in citizen’s dress, wrere at Mercersville, about three and a half miles above this place, and at other points along the canal above that point, engaging boats and scows, to be used in passing the river. Cook said to one of the persons, from whom he obtained a ferry-boat, that, in the course of the next week, there would be twenty or twenty-five thousand rqen thrown into Virginia upon this line; that they proposed to cross the river at three points, viz, Mercersville, Slackwater Ham No. 4, about six miles above this, and at Williamsport 5 and that the three columns would concentrate at a point on the railroad not far from Kerneysville. There is a great congregation of canal and ferry boats at Slackwater Ham No. 4, with which they could speedily bridge the river at that point. I have a large ferry-boat secured on our side in Ham No. 4, with which I can cross over twenty-five or thirty men at a time. The enemy’s boats have no other guard than their hands on board and some canal hands, perhaps one hundred and twenty men in all. I think, with my company, I could, if desirable, destroy all of the boats by crossing the river in the night and burning them.
I obtained two kegs (twenty-five pounds each) of powder from Maryland on yesterday. I have more of the article now than I have immediate use for. I shall, however, continue to procure all that I can. Please direct me where tQ send it. If desired, I can forward it to Winchester. There is a good macadamized road from here to that place. If not already known to you, allow me to call your attention to a ford across the river at (just below) the mouth of Antietam Creek, four and a quarter miles below this point. It is a good ford, and is now passable, and the approaches on either side very good. My force of cavalry is too small to enable me to guard it.

To the good People of the Counties of Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince
William :
A reckless and unprincipled tyrant has invaded your soil. Abraham Lincoln, regardless of all moral, legal, and constitutional restraints, has thrown his abolition hosts among you, who are murdering and imprisoning your citizens, confiscating and destroying your property, and committing other acts of violence and outrage too shocking and revolting to humanity to be enumerated. All rules of civilized warfare are abandoned, and they proclaim by their acts, if not on their banners, that their war-cry is u Beauty and booty .” All that is dear to man, your honor, and that of your wives and daughters, your fortunes, and your lives, are involved in this momentous contest.
In the name, therefore, of the constituted authorities of the Confederate States, in the sacred cause of constitutional liberty and self-government, for which we are contending, in behalf of civilization and humanity itself, I, G. T. Beauregard, brigadier-general of the Confederate States, commanding at Camp Pickens, Manassas Junction, do make this ray proclamation, and invite and enjoin you by every consideration dear to the hearts of freemen and patriots, by the name and memory of your revolutionary fathers, and by the purity and sanctity of your domestic firesides, to rally to the standard of your State and country, and by every means in your power compatible with honorable warfare to drive back and expel the invaders from your land. I conjure you to be true and loyal to your country and her legal and constitutional authorities, and especially to be vigilant of the movements and acts of the enemy, so as to enable you to give the earliest authentic information to these headquarters or to the officers under my command. 1 desire to assure you that the utmost protection in my power will be extended to you all.

been given to me. Do these troops constitute a garrison or a corps of observation ? If the former (which your letter of the 3d implies somewhat), it is to be considered that our only defensible position has a front of nearly two miles; that the supply of ammunition is not more than sufficient to repel one vigorous assault, and that the position could not then be evacuated, as the enemy would be nearer than ourselves to the only line of retreat—that through Loudoun. If as a corps of observation, it will have a task which the best troops would find difficult, for the enemy north of us can find crossing places too numerous for this force even to observe, and, while watching them, it is likely to be cut off by the troops from Ohio, who you know are commanded by a man of great ability. The operations of these troops and those from Pennsylvania will no doubt be combined. A retreat from the presence of an enemy is the most difficult of military operations to the best troops. To very new ones it is impossible. It would very soon become a flight.
You say that u the abandonment of Harper’s Ferry would be depressing to the cause of the South.” Would not the loss of five or six thousand men be more so ? And, if they remain here, they must be captured or destroyed very soon after General McClellan’s arrival in the valley. Might it not be better (after the troops here have delayed the enemy as long by their presence as they prudently can) to transfer them to some point where they may still be useful?
We have, according to the statement of the Master of Ordnance, about forty rounds of ammunition, besides eighty-two thousand five hundred cartridges, just received, which makes an addition of about four rounds, as there are with them but twenty-two thousand five hundred caps.
Notice of the arrival of the Tennessee regiment in Winchester is just received. The colonel informs me that they are without percussion caps.
Our troops are not equipped for a campaign. More than two regiments are without cartridge-boxes. Most of them having traveled by railroad, use trunks and valises, instead of knapsacks, and few are provided Avith shoes fit for marching.
With money I could have obtained more caps probably. I have not thought it worth while to provide a supply of provisions out of proportion to that of ammunition.
I offer these opinions for what they are worth, thinking it my duty to present them to you, and being anxious to conform closely to whatever general plan of operations has been determined upon. I beg you, therefore, to let me understand my position.

tlie invading army, which is reported to he on its march towards Lewis-burg, which may as probably be directed towards the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, by any of the various routes between that indicated in the valley of the Big Sandy River. You must needs rely upon the arms among the people to supply the requisite armament, and upon their valor and knowledge of the country as a substitute for organization and discipline. If there be any who have arms beyond their X)Ower or will to use, you can take them, with such arrangement as the case may indicate for future settlement. As your transportation will of course be very limited, and the service of such character as will indicate the lightest practicable train, the troops must be taught to rely upon the supplies of the country, but not be permitted to take them except through officers authorized for that purpose, and they should be instructed always to make prompt payment, or to give such receipts as will insure early and adequate remuneration. All officers commanding separate parties should be instructed to unite with the greatest vigilance and closest scrutiny the highest regard for the personal and j>roperty rights of all with whom they may come in contact, save the common enemy of the State, towards whom the rules of war, as known to civilized nations, will be applied.
The imperfect information possessed of the force and objects of the enemy do not permit sj)ecific instructions either as to your line of operations or the movements to be made. You must exercise a sound discretion, so that all your efforts may tend to the result of repelling the enemy if possible, and if not, of checking him as near the border of our territory as may be practicable. If the disparity of numbers should be very great, your defensive positions will for the present necessarily be retired to the mountain passes, and sorties against the enemy should always be so made as to embarrass and delay his movements without hazarding the loss of detachments from your command, teaching them to wait until you have the means to strike a blow which shall be effective. The several officers of experience who have been directed to report to you will be assigned by you to such duties as the necessities of the case may require.
General Flovd, who has been appointed a brigadier-general, has been specially charged with the protection of the line of the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. It may well occur that a junction of your forces may become desirable, in which event each should exhibit his letters of instructions to the other, so that you may cordially co-operate to attain the common object of both. In the event of such a junction, and whilst serving together, General Floyd, being senior by commission, will, according to the Rules and Articles of War, command the whole.

Major : Your letter of June 6 has been received,# and I desite to express my approbation of your conduct in forwarding re-enforcements of men and supplies of arms, ammunition, provisions, and clothing to Colonel Porterfield, at Beverly.
Brig. Gen. B. S. Garnett has been appointed to the command of the troops at Beverly and in that region, and will proceed there at once. All the troops that can be spared from this point will be forwarded as last as practicable to General Garnett, and it is hoped that these, in addition to the forces now there and those which can be hereafter raised in that region, will form an adequate force for the protection of the northwestern part of the State.
I am, very respectfully, &c.,

Commanding, cfic., Harper’s Ferry, Fa.:
General: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 6th instant. The importance of the subject has induced me to lay it before the President, that he may be informed of your views. He places great value upon our retention of the command of the Shenandoah Valley and the position at Harper’s Ferry. The evacuation of the latter would interrupt our communication with Maryland, and injure our cause in that State. He does not think it probable that there will be an immediate attack by troops from Ohio.
General K. S. Garnett, C. S. Army, with a command of four thousand men, has been directed to Beverly, to arrest the progress of troops towards the Shenandoah Valley. Col. Angus W. McDonald has also been sent to interrupt the passage of troops over the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad. It is hoped by these means that you will be relieved from an attack in that direction, and will have merely to resist an attack in front from Pennsylvania.
An effort will be made to send you cartridge-boxes and knapsacks for the two regiments that are without them, and also an additional supply of ammunition. Greater mobility might be given to your forces by directing their surplus baggage, trunks, valises, &c., to be returned home or sent to some place of safety. Another regiment from Georgia has been ordered to report to you, viz, Colonel Gartrell’s. It is hoped that you will be able to be timely informed of the approach of troops against you, and retire, provided they cannot be successfully opposed. You must exercise your discretion and judgment in this respect, to insure, if possible, your safety. Precise instructions cannot be given you, but, being informed of the object of the campaign, you will be able to regulate its conduct to the best advantage.
I am, general, &c.,

Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee, Commanding Forces of Virginia:
Sir: The great difficulty of communicating with and supplying our batteries on the Nansemond Kiver has retarded the work on them, and been of serious inconvenience to us. I determined to put a small steamer on the river, and on the night before last Capt. A. Sinclair took the small steamer Eoanoke, which Commodore Forrest had chartered and put at my disposal. Captain Sinclair ran her in very handsomely, without being discovered by the guard-boats of the enemy, and she is now on the river; and, in connection with the railroad to Suffolk, puts us in easy communication with all the batteries on the Nansemond Eiver.

A proclamation.
The delegates of the people of Virginia, in Convention assembled, having by their ordinance passed Aqml 25, 1861, adopted and ratified the Constitution of the Provisional Government of the Confederate States of America, ordained and established at Montgomery, Ala., on February 8, 1861, and the State of Virginia having been, by an act of the Confederate States, passed May 7, 1861, admitted as a State into the Confederate Government, and the President being, under the Constitution of the Provisional Government of the Confederate States, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the Confederate States and of the militia of the several States when called into the service of the Confederate States:
Now, therefore, I, John Letcher, governor of Virginia, by and with the advice and consent of the executive council, do hereby transfer to the authorities of the Confederate States, by regiments, all the volunteer forces which have been mustered into the service of Virginia, and do order a like transfer, by regiments, battalions, squadrons, and companies, of all volunteers or militia, as the same shall be formed, and their services may be required.
I further hereby transfer to the authorities of the Confederate States the command of all the officers, seamen, and marines of the Provisional Navy of Virginia, for service in the Confederate States.
I do further order that all officers of the Virginia service now on duty in any of the departments of the staff continue to discharge their respective functions, under the direction and control of the President, until otherwise ordered; and that all quartermasters, commissary, and medical stores belonging to the State and in charge of said officers, to be turned over for the use of the Confederate States, upon proper receipts for the articles turned over, to be forwarded to the accounting officer for settlement. All moneys in charge of any of the departments will be forthwith returned into the treasury of the State.

Lynchburg, Va., June 8,18G1. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Colonel : I received your dispatch to-day, and answered it in the same way, but imperfectly. There is no company of cavalry here fully armed. Two companies have double-barreled shot-guns, bought by their counties, but no sabers, and are but beginning to drill. There are two companies tolerably well drilled, with forty or fifty sabers each. One has no guns and the other a few. There are two other companies, one of which has about forty sabers and a few guns, just commencing to drill. There are about a hundred flint-lock pistols, which have been gathered from old companies. A number of sabers, of old patterns, have also been collected. All the companies want cartridge-boxes and cap-boxes. I have sent off to Henry County for some sabers and pistols which I am informed are there. All the companies here are well mounted, and would make fine companies if there were arms for them.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel Garnett :
Sir: I have the honor to report that I received official intelligence, on the Gth instant, from Major Montague, in command at this point, that this position, held by three companies Virginia volunteers, two howitzers, and two troops of cavalry, was about to be turned by a force from Newport News, as well as one up the Poquosin River. I ordered Colonel Stuart, in command of four companies of Virginia volunteers,

at that moment i)repared to march, to Blow’s Mill and Grove Landing, and Colonel Hill’s regiment of North Carolina volunteers to proceed at once to meet the enemy at the point threatened. This movement I intended to have made, at all events, on the following day. Colonel Hill met the command of Major Montague at the Half-way House, the latter having retreated, after consultation with his officers, from this position. Colonel Hill dispatched Major Montague’s command to guard the Po-quosin River, and proceeded with his regiment and two pieces of artillery to occupy and fortify this place. Colonel Stuart, in obedience to orders from me, proceeded to the bridge, on the Newport News road, which enters the York two miles above the Half-way House, and destroyed the bridge over the stream at that point, and blockaded all the country roads above it, thus rendering it almost impossible to1 turn this position without a march of at least twenty miles. On the same evening (the Gth) I inspected Colonel Stuart’s work, and slept at the Half-way House.
On the 7th I reconnoitered the Poquosin River and roads leading to it on this side, occupying the remainder of the day in devising means to supply the force here with provisions and forage.
The next day (yesterday) I arrived here, and found that the works under Colonel Hill had advanced very rapidly. In the course of these operations several collisions took place between our scouting parties and those of the enemy very creditable to our troops and citizens. Three of the latter, on horseback, met with nine of the enemy on foot, and an exchange of shots resulted in our killing one, wounding another, and taking a third prisoner. I remember the names of but two: Mr. Scott, of Texas, and Mr. Ben. Phillips, of Elizabeth City.
Previous to the arrival of Colonel Hill at this post, Captain Werth, of Virginia volunteers, then in command, proceeded to Newport News, with a small body of horsemen, for the purpose of reconnoitering. Being at the head of his men, he found himself in the enemy’s lines before he was aware of it, and, coming suddenly upon a working force, consisting of a commissioned officer and over twenty privates, he killed the commissioned officer and one private with his revolver, and the rest fled into camp, crying out, “The Virginia Horse! The Virginia Horse!” The troops encamped on the outside of the trenches rushed into them in confusion, amid which he retired to his command and returned home. Since then Newport News has been re-enforced by at least one thousand men.
Yesterday, at 1 o’clock, I received a note from Colonel Hill, stating that a considerable body of Federal troops were advancing towards his post. The cavalry having been temporarily withdrawn to the Half-way House for forage, I immediately dispatched the Hampton Troop, Captain Phillips, to report to Colonel Hill, and proceeded to this place in person. On my arrival here I found that Colouel Hill had disj>atched a portion of Company F, North Carolina regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, and a howitzer, under Major Randolph, and another detachment of Company E, same regiment, under Major Lane, and one howitzer, under Lieutenant Wight, by different roads, to attack, and, if possible, cut off this party. The Federal troops were robbing a house when the detachment first named came in sight of them. They fled, about eighty in number. Our party gave chase. Not being able to overtake, Major Randolph discharged his howitzer into them, which appeared to take effect. They fled in great confusion, after having fired several shots, leaving one soldier, who was made prisoner, and who is now in camp. In the mean time, our other detachment, under Major Lane, met with a party of Federal troops, upon whom they fired, with what effect was not 58 r r—VOL h

known, and made one prisoner, who is also in our camp. Both of these belonged to the New York volunteers. In further explanation of this affair, I inclose an extract of a note just received from Captain Werth, on picket guard. He says:
The Rev. Mr. Adams came from Hampton last night. He saw one cart-load of wounded carried into Hampton last night, and two more carried in his buggy, which had been impressed for the occasion. A Colonel Pierce had command of the marauding party, three hundred strong. Mr. Adams learned in Hampton, from the officers, that Hampton was to be made a strong military post in one or two days. The enemy are much excited, and swear vengeance against the Virginians for their impudence.
I inclose a note in pencil from a perfectly reliable source. I omitted to state that, in place of Colonel Stuart’s, I ordered Colonel August’s whole regiment to proceed to Grove Landing, and to fortify at once strongly, in such a way as to protect his musketry and make a landing extremely difficult. Several regiments of troops ought to be in that neighborhood immediately. Grove Wharf is held ready to be destroyed, but it will take some time to effect it thoroughly. In mean time I would respectfully suggest that several steamers, loaded with provisions, wagons, harness, mules, ammunition, and men, be ordered to that point and landed, and that Mr. Haskins, who 1 believe is the owner of many steamboats, be directed to have one far down the river, to watch the enemy while these operations are being effected, and that as soon as they are concluded orders direct from headquarters be sent to Colonel August to burn the wharf immediately and effectually.
This command has been on the point of starvation here, on account of want of transportation. The means of transportation are absolutely necessary to enable me to keep the field. I can scarcely support this small command, and am exceedingly anxious to have the Louisiana and Georgia regiments in a similar position to this on the Warwick road. During last night I had a bridge built and thrown over Back Biver, to enable me to get at the enemy more easily. I hope to have another one in front of Hampton in a few nights. Both to be destroyed as.occasion may require.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDEK, Colonel, Commanding Southeastern Department.

Winder’s, Ya., June 9, 1861.
Colonel Maortjder:
I did not return from Hampton last night till after 11 o’clock. From all I could learn, I am satisfied that Hampton is within a few days to be occupied as a military post by the Federal troops. Probably the affair of yesterday may hasten this event. That the town is strongly guarded every night, and that during the night all is quiet, but during the day, particularly yesterday, all sorts of plundering was going on, both in town and country ; that Colonel Duryea has been superseded by Brigadier-General Pierce; that no protection or right of ingress or egress, in relation to Hampton, would be allowed to any but those who would take the oath of allegiance to the United States. This, in a nut shell, is about the amount of the information I gained. I learned also from a Captain Wilson that it was in contemplation soon to attack Yorktown with forty thousand men. I could ascertain no suspicion of a military position below Yorktown. I heard nothing of a naval attack at York.

JNO. WITHERS, Assistant Adjutant-General,
Camp Mason, Leesburg, June 9, 1861. Lieut. Col. Thos. Jordan, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : Inclosed please find a memorial from a committee on behalf of the citizens of this county, asking for additional forces for the defense of this point. If it is the design of the military authorities to defend this portion of Virginia, then it is very important that additional forces should be concentrated here. I feel very sensibly the importance of this fertile country to the subsistence department of our army and that of the enemy. Besides, if a good force be placed here, it will cut off the enemy from one of the routes to Harper’s Ferry. I earnestly second the wishes of the petitioners, and ask that at least twenty-five hundred men be sent here.
I have just learned from reliable information that there are ten canal-boats in Georgetown loaded with provisions and ammunition. 1 am assured from a clergyman who has been across the river that this information is reliable. With the additional force asked for we would probably be able to cut to pieces any force that they may send up, under the impression that we have only a few hundred men here. Send the force asked for if the exigencies of the service will allow it.
I have no information of any movement of the enemy on this side the river.
Your dispatch was received to-day in regard to tearing up railroad and burning the ties. Will you inform me whether I am to put the troops here at that work and stop their drill ? The guard duty here is very heavy, and if a force has to be detailed for the purpose indicated it will break up our drill, which is very important to our raw, undisciplined troops. Your orders shall be obeyed.

The undersigned, a committee in behalf of the citizens of Loudoun County, respectfully represent that it is our impression, in which we believe you concur, that the military force at Camp Mason, under your command, is totally inadequate to the protection and defense of this portion of the State of Virginia, which we are assured is attractive to the enemy, for the following reasons:
1st. We border upon the Potomac River, which forms our boundary

[Chap. IX.
for thirty miles, upon which there are not less than thirteen fords and ferries. Leesburg, the county seat, is within four miles of the nearest crossing. We are within thirty miles of Washington City, whence we can be approached by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which runs parallel with the Potomac River, and by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at the Point of Rocks.
2d. We are a large wheat and corn growing country, with heavy crops of the former now nearly matured. There are not less than twenty thousand cattle now being grazed in the county, a large proportion of which are fat and ready for market, and at least one thousand of these are upon the flats of the river. This is exclusive of the dairy stock, hogs, sheep, &c. There are large amounts of flour, bacon, and grain of last year’s growth. A very important item must not be omitted 5 that is, a large stock of the finest horses, suited to cavalry and artillery service.
We deem it well worthy of serious consideration that there is a large Union element in Loudoun, and that it is the policy of the Federal administration to intervene in their behalf. In view of these considerations, and of the fact that the Federal papers have frequently spoken of Leesburg as an eligible position for a camp for the Federal forces, by reason of its healthfulness and the productiveness of the surrounding country, we feel it highly important that a force of troops shall be immediately stationed here sufficient to successfully repel invasion, and respectfully beg that you will exert your influence to attain this end.

Sir: The sentiments ascribed to many of the inhabitants of the towns in Virginia on and near the Potomac border may render it important to place them, for a time at least, under close surveillance.
I am instructed to state that Mr. James M. Mason, who, from his residence in that quarter of the State and intimate knowledge of its inhabitants, can probably best advise you, has been instructed by the President to indicate to you such points as in his judgment should be placed under such care, and it is the wish of the President that Mr. Mason’s suggestions in this regard should be considered by you, and, so far as consistent with your judgment and authority, that you place it in his power to give them effect.

of the United States will hereafter employ rifled cannon, of large caliber, at long range. It is reported that such means will be employed. It is therefore advisable that the batteries should be rendered as secure as possible by the application of some such means as were so successfully employed at Charleston. Railroad-iron, laid at an angle of about thirty degrees with the horizon, on the exterior slope, the upper ends not projecting above the exterior crest, would probably answer the purpose. If such an arrangement can be made, you are authorized to procure the iron and apply it where in your judgment it may be required.
It is not unlikely that for the attack of these batteries the enemy will provide himself with iron-plated vessels. In this event the shots from the batteries should be so directed as to strike the water short of but near the vessel, so that after the rebound they might strike below any eave which may be presented near the water line and at right angles to her sides. The accompanying sketch* expresses the idea herein contained.

Unless any of the rolling stock can be transferred to the Orange or Manassas Railroad, it must be destroyed immediately. Should it not already be demolished, the gondola and flats must not be permitted to fall into the hands of the enemy.

June 10,1861.
President Jefferson Davis:
Dear Sir : Having the best interests of our country at heart, and having taken an active part in the welfare of this county from the first appearance of danger to the present hour, I feel confident you will hear me. While I have no doubt of the success of the South in casting off the Northern yoke ultimately, I must say that this is the last appeal from me, at least for the protection of this section—this county and Greenbrier—that I ever expect to make, and I very much fear that it is already too late for you to prevent our being overrun to some extent, perhaps totally. Our interests have no doubt been cared for, but there has been too little energy at work, and the view has been a short-sighted one. Three weeks since it would have been quite an easy matter to have taken possession of all Western Virginia, except Wheeling, and perhaps that also; but now it is very doubtful if twenty thousand of the best-armed men we have in the State will do it. The few troops we have had out there have had no other effect than to gather in a still stronger force of the enemy, and they are doing their best to carry off and destroy everything upon which a large army can subsist, having entire control of all the railroads and almost the whole country. If not driven back soon, we have no hope of anything being left to support our army now or hereafter, and you will find it next to imiiossible to take provisions for an effective force a distance of one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles, on common road wagons, from the Central Eail-road. Two weeks since this thing was not half so gloomy. In less than two more we shall be overrun, unless there is a far greater force than we have any knowledge of being sent us. The enemy is now within a few hours7 march of our county lines. We have no force at all beyond Huttonsville, and a great part of it far this side—some on the Parkersburg and some on the Marline Bottom roads. Our force all told is not more than from twelve hundred to two thousand. The last account we had from them was on the 7th. They were not more than half armed, and had not ammunition sufficient for more than one round to the man. I sent fifty miles to Covington, and only got seventy-five pounds of powder, but no lead. We have got some fifty pounds of old lead pipe, &c., which we sent on this morning, with powder. I wish I could tell you our situation.
Our county is loyal to the South j only thirteen votes against secession ) population less than four thousand. We laid a war levy of $15,000. Have sent out four volunteer companies, and in all nearly five hundred

soldiers out of about six hundred and fifty militia. There are not men sufficient left to raise our crops or save our harvests. We have urged our governor time after time, again and again, to grant us arms, ammunition, and men. Our wants are this hour still further than ever from being supplied. Last night at 11 o’clock we started a special messenger to the governor or yourself, which is the fourth time we have done so. The enemy still advancing, our danger increasing, our arms and men nearly all gone from the county, no ammunition nor hopes of getting any in time to stay the enemy, we have done all that we can do up to this hour. Will you help us ? Can you help us in time ? One short week, and I fear it will be too late. Many of our best families have their carriages in readiness to move; many more are having their wagons prepared. All that can go I fear will soon be on the move. Then woe to those who are left. Nothing but destruction awaits our houses and barns. Our waving fields of grain and grass, our thousands of cattle, they will soon possess. On my own grass I have from one hundred and fifty to two hundred head of good beef cattle. I have no hope of anything being saved unless you can send on a large force at once.
It seems there has been no one capable of managing the business out northwest. They have suffered themselves to be routed and robbed of everything, or nearly so, and stripped of ammunition and clothes. Provisions could still be had in the Randolph Yalley if the enemy were removed. One of our officers told me on yesterday that there was no question but an army of twenty-five thousand men could be provisioned for a considerable length of time out there. Many large farmers would willingly give all they have. The coming harvest is promising, and will soon be ripe.
Our enemies declare they are determined to take Pocahontas and Greenbrier. This our officers told me this morning, and this will take them to the top of the Alleghany Mountains.
I have now, Mr. President, in a homely manner, tried to tell you a few stubborn facts, and it does seem to me that our case is a hard one. I have three sons in the Army. Two of them came home from the West for this jmrpose. I have spent all my time for more than a month past trying to aid, and took one trip to Richmond, and now I am done writing. I will take my rifle, shot-gun, pistol, and cutlass, relying upon the God of battles, and go to meet the enemy.
Ask Col. Paul McNeil, in Convention, if you doubt one assertion.
Respectfully, yours,
JOHN H. RUCKMAN.

General : The preparations which are understood to be making at Old Point Comfort indicate an early movement of the U. S. troops. While so many points are threatened, it is difficult to say which may be attacked. Great vigilance and alacrity will, therefore, be required at every point, to prevent surprise. The first of the water defenses that will be reached in approaching Norfolk will be those at Sewell’s Point and Craney Island. During my visit at Norfolk these points were in a weak condition and feebly garrisoned. I hope the defenses have

been completed and provided with sufficient garrisons. Each should be commanded by an intelligent and active officer, and of some experience. I hope there are many in your command. The batteries at both places should be provided with works, to prevent their being taken in reverse.
Should the enemy desire to cut off your communication with Richmond, the possession of the battery at Pig Point would become important to them. Its defenses should, therefore, be looked to, and every arrangement made to prevent its surprise and capture. The troops that I have endeavored to collect at Suffolk, being prepared for service, under an efficient officer, may enable you to hold command of the railroad and prevent its destruction. Should a movement be made upon that point, information should be immediately communicated, if possible, to Weldon and this city, that troops may be concentrated from these points and Norfolk to oppose it. It is thought probable, from the conduct of the enemy at other points, that when an attack is made it may be expected at the dawn of day. Every preparation should, therefore, be made at night for such an event.
The officer commanding the troops near Hampton has been directed to watch the movements of the enemy encamped at Newport News, &c., and should preparations for their embarkation be discovered, to press upon them, with a view both of retarding their embarkation and of retaining as large a force as possible in their camp. No great reliance can be placed upon this operation, however, unless it can be discovered that the batteries on York or James Rivers are not to be attacked, as the security of the batteries will have to be attended to by the troops on that line.

R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Lloyd’s, Va., June 12, 1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, &c. :
My Dear Sir : Since I left Richmond I have been thinking of the rumor that the real attack upon Richmond would be made from the Rappahannock River. Whether the plan has been laid I know not; but I fear it is feasible, and, as you cannot be acquainted with the topography of the country, I will say why I think it practicable. The only defense to bar the passage of our steamers on the Rappahannock, up to the head of tide, is a little fort (Lowry), w7hieh is now being erected, about thirty miles from the mouth of the river. This fort is four and a half miles below Tappahannock, the county seat of Essex. Should an army be landed a little below the fort, it would cost but little to silence it, and then the whole Rappahannock Yalley would be thrown open to the hostile fleet. This valley abounds in supplies of food, and is thickly populated with negroes. From Tappahannock to the junction of the Central with the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad, in Hanover, is a distance of from twenty-five to thirty miles. The obstacles to the march are mainly to be found in the Mattapony and Pamunkey Rivers. The Mattapony, where it would be crossed on the route, is so narrow7 and shallow as to present a military obstacle of small importance. The Pamunkey, near the junction, is fordable, except at high water. Both have wmoden bridges, but these might be burned. Once at the junction, an invading army might take either of two railroads, and reach Rich-

mond in a run of twenty miles; or it might, by a march of forty miles, upon the Central Eailroad, put a strong force at Gordonsville, the junction of the Lynchburg and Alexandria Bailroads, and cut off the communications of our Manassas Gap army. The last could not be reenforced from the south or west, except from the valley, through the Manassas Gap Eailroad; nor with the Hanover Junction, in the hands of an enemy, could Eichmond be re-enforced, except from the south side of James Biver. As a strategic point, would not Hanover Junction be more valuable to an enemy than Harpers Ferry itself? Indeed, would not its possession secure Harper’s Ferry? In what way can this be prevented at the least cost in men and money ? I answer as follows:
About eighteen or twenty miles below Fort Lowry, and eight or ten miles below Urbana (one of the reputed places of her sound debarkation), is a point from which the channel can be commanded. I forget the name of the point, but the Coast Survey chart (to be found in Eichmond) will show it, and Lieutenant-Governor Montague, who lives in that county, can describe it. I am told that this chart proves that a fort at this point, in Middlesex, on the south side of the river, and one opposite to it, on the north side, would command the channel completely. Indeed, no vessel could pass up at a greater distance than one and a quarter miles from the Middlesex Point, which is within the range of rifled cannon. This being done, the enemy (if they landed with a view to a march upon Hanover Junction or Eichmond) must land below the fort, which is below Urbana.
NTow, at Urbana is Urbana Creek (a deep creek), bounded by marshes, which runs to within two or three miles of the Dragon Swamp, a military obstacle of the first class. A part of this distance of two or three miles was densely wooded ten years ago, and I suspect that not more than half of it is as yet cleared. On such a neck of land a small force could retard the advance of an army long enough to assemble in sufficient strength to resist it. The length, too, of the march would be thus increased some thirty miles to the junction and fifteen or twenty miles to Eichmond. There would also be another advantage in these lower forts. Nearly the whole valley of the river and most valuable oyster beds would be protected. These oyster beds, without these forts, lying below Fort Lowry, will be in the enemy’s hands. I know that there are some difficulties in throwing up these forts. Our steamers are in the river, but still, with a covering force, and with even a small covering force, it could be done, I presume.
On the northern neck side, the three lower counties of Eichmond, Lancaster, and Northumberland could easily furnish one thousand men, without takiug away the men from Fredericksburg. On the southern side the counties of Essex, Caroline, King and Queen, and Middlesex could furnish twelve or fifteen hundred men without robbing any of the present forts. The men on the southern side, if placed under the command of a regular officer (such a man as Major Hetli is described to be), and aided with a battery, would not only cover the fort on the Middlesex Point, but would, perhaps, resist the march of an army between Urbana Creek and the Dragon Swamp long enough to procure re-en-foreements, through steamers from Fredericksburg (where there are two steamers), also to scour the country along the line of march. Unless this covering force could be commanded by a good officer, and a u regular,” it would not be of much assistance; but under a good commander it might be relied upon.
I know it is presumptuous in me to offer military counsel. No man could know less of such matters. But there are topographical details

with which you could not be acquainted, and so much hangs upon the defensive measures now being taken that I have ventured this letter, although I feel that your time is too important to be wasted on idle suggestions.
If you will show this letter to General Lee, I think he will confirm my topographical description of the country.
Whether the strategic importance of the Hanover Junction be such as I suppose, and whether the march upon it be as practicable as seems to me, both you and he can judge far better than I can; but I cannot be mistaken in supposing that the subject is worthy of your attention and study.
I ought to add to this letter (although it is already a long one) that, notwithstanding Fort Lowry, troops could be landed on the Bappahan-nock at not more than thirty-five miles from the Hanover Junction.
Very truly and faithfully, your friend,

Headquarters,
Harper’s Ferry, Fa., June 12, 1861. General B. E. Lee, Commanding:
General : I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 10th instant informing me that two regiments from Lynchburg have been ordered to report at Harper’s Ferry. Permit me to urge most respectfully the importance of equipping the troops ordered to this place before putting them en route. Ammunition and means of transportation cannot be obtained here. Without them, additional troops only make this command more helpless. Before the arrival of the Tennessee and Georgia regiments, our supply of ammunition and means of transportation were far too small. The further division makes us no more able to fight, and unable to march. It is much to be regretted, I think, that the Tennessee regiment was admitted into the service. It is without accouterments, instruction, or subordination.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier-General, C. Army
Executive Department,

General Beauregard, Comdg., dec., Manassas Junction, Va.:
My Dear General : Colonel Jones delivered to me your letter of the 12th instant,* and, as suggested by you, I conversed with him of the matters to which it related. Your information may be more accu rate than we possess in relation to the purpose of the enemy, and I will briefly reply to you on the hypothesis which forms the basis of your suggestions.
If the enemy commences operations by attack upon Harper’s Ferry, I do not perceive why General Johnston should be unable, even before overwhelming numbers, to retire behind the positions where the enemy would approach him in reverse. It would seem to me not unreasonable to expect that before he reached Winchester, the terminus of the railroad in his possession, the people of the fertile and populous valley

would rise in mass to aid him in repelling the invader. But suppose it should be otherwise, he could still, by retiring to the passes on the Manassas Railroad and its adjacent mountains, probably check the progress of the enemy, and prevent him from either taking possession of the valley or passing to the rear of your position. We hope soon to re-enforce you to an extent equal to the strength you require by the junction of General Johnston, and I cannot doubt but that you will agree with me that you would then be better circumstanced to advance upon Alexandria than if General Johnston, by withdrawing from the valley, had left the enemy the power to pass to your rear, to cut your line of communication, and advance to attack you in reverse while you were engaged with the enemy in front.
Concurring fully with you in the effect which would be produced by possession of Arlington Heights and Alexandria, if your rear is at the same time sufficiently covered, it is quite clear that, if the case should be otherwise, your possession, if acquired, would be both brief and fruitless.
To your request that a concerted plan of operations should be adopted, I can only reply that the present position and unknown purpose of the enemy require that our plan should have many alterations. I have noticed your converging lines upon Richmond, and it can hardly be necessary to remind you that we have not at this time the transportation which would enable us to move upon those lines as described. Should the fortune of war render it necessary to retire our advance columns, they must be brought mainly upon railroads, and that of Harper’s Ferry would come by your present position. It would therefore be a necessity that General Johnston’s columns should make a junction with yours before yours retired; but I have not anticipated the necessity of your retreat, and have struggled rather to increase your force, and look hopefully forward to see you enabled to assume the offensive. Had I been less earnestly engaged in providing for yours and other commands, I should have had the pleasure of visiting you before this date.
Two regiments have been sent forward, neither of which had reached you at the date of your letters, and you will soon receive further re-enforcements. They are not trained troops, but I think they are better than those of the enemy, and the capacity which you have recently exhibited successfully to fight with undisciplined citizens justifies the expectation that you will know how to use such force as we are able to furnish.
Very truly, yours,

You had been heretofore instructed to exercise your discretion as to retiring from your position at Harper’s Ferry and taking the field to check the advance of the enemy. It is to be inferred from the papers now transmitted that you have considered the authority given as not equal to the necessity of the case—that you must needs

[Chap. IX.
retire before the enemy was present, or otherwise that you would be unable to avoid capture, and would not be permitted to fight in retreat. In all the directions which have been given to you you will not have failed to perceive that, relying equally on your sound judgment and soldierly qualifications, it was intended that you should judge of the necessities of your condition and of the means best adapted to answer the general purpose of the campaign. As the movements of the enemy could not he foreseen, so it was impossible to give you specific directions, and the cause of the country could only be confided to one who, like yourself, was deemed entirely competent to decide upon events as they arose.
We have no reliable information that the enemy is at Cumberland, and had hoped that he could not so soon be able to reach that point. We had not anticipated that he could turn your position without your being apprised of it in time to make your movements conform to that fact. As you seem to desire, however, that the responsibility of your retirement should be assumed here, and as no reluctance is felt to bear any burden which the public interests require, you will consider yourself authorized, whenever the position of the enemy shall convince you that he is about to turn your position and thus deprive the country of the use of yourself and the troops under your command, to destroy everything at Harper’s Ferry—the bridge across the Potomac, platforms, and trestle work included—which could serve the purpose of the enemy, and retire upon the railroad towards Winchester, carrying with you all the rolling stock and destroying the road behind you. Should the people of Winchester and the surrounding valley rally to your aid in such numbers as to enable you to resume active operations, you will avail yourself of the first opportunity to attack the enemy, and endeavor to drive him from his purpose of invasion, and to do as much else as possible. The ineffective portion of your command, together with the baggage and whatever else would impede your operations in the field, it would be well to send without delay to the Manassas road.
Should you not be sustained by the population of the valley, so as to enable you to turn upon the enemy before reaching Winchester, you will continue slowly to retire to the Manassas road, upon some of the passes on which it is hoped you will be able to make an effective stand even against a very superior force. To this end it might be well to send your engineer to make a reconnaissance and to construct such temporary works as may be useful and proper.
The position of Harper’s Ferry, as has been heretofore stated, is deemed valuable because of its relation to Maryland and as the entrance to the valley of Virginia, the possession of which by the enemy will separate the eastern and western sections of the State from each other, deprive us of the agricultural resources of that fertile region, and bring in its train political consequences which it is well believed you cannot contemplate without the most painful emotions. If, therefore, much reluctance has been exhibited to a retirement from your position, you will not fail to appreciate the motives which have led to it. Should you move so far as to make a junction with General Beauregard, the enemy would be free immediately to occupy the valley of Virginia and to pass to the rear of Manassas Junction; so that, unless the proposed attack upon Alexandria should be prompt and successful, you would soon be cut off both from re-enforcements and supplies until an army could be sent large enough to defeat that before which you had retired, and you know too well our condition to render it necessary that you should be informed that this could hardly be done before the enemy could make a

conjoint attack upon you by bis armies both front and rear. Troops are now coming forward from the Southern States, and it is to be expected that within a week General Beauregard’s position may be re-enforced by troops equal in number to that which is reported as the effective portion of your command. If you have until then covered the valley of Yirginia, General Beauregard may thus with more probable success advance upon Alexandria than by the junction of your command with his by surrendering the valley of Yirginia to the enemy. It is not expected that you will believe that mere numbers will give you strength, yet it is hoped that the people fighting for their homes and their liberties, with even a small number of instructed troops, may enable you to operate successfully against such forces as are opposed to you; and it is but justice to add that the greatest confidence is placed upon your capacity to inspire others with the soldierly qualities you have so often exhibited, and that the most unlimited confidence is reposed in you both as a commander and a patriot. For these reasons it has been with reluctance that any attempt was made to give you specific instructions, and you will accept assurances of the readiness with which the freest exercise of discretion on your part will be sustained.

General Johnston finds himself unable to maintain his position at Harper’s Ferry, but the President still hopes, if compelled to retire by the enemy passing to his rear, that he will fall back upon the people of the valley, assembled in such force as to enable him to assume the offensive, and perhaps to crush the invading column.

Sir : I overtook Colonel Heck’s command at this point to-day, seven hundred and fifty strong, with four pieces of cannon. I shall reach Colonel Porterfield to-morrow. Accounts from the front are not very encouraging, very contradictory; but, as the information, in my judgment, is not reliable, I will defer giving you details until I reach Huttonsville, and can get something authentic. The condition of things is due to the want of proper officers to conduct the reconnoitering. The cavalry of this region is entirely raw; the officers without experience or confidence. The purpose of this letter is to beg, urgently, that three or four officers of experience, to conduct reconnoitering parties, may be sent me at the earliest possible moment.

Sir : The defensive works about Eichmond are progressing so slowly, from the want of laborers, that I think it proper to call your attention to the subject, that you may submit it to the city council for their consideration and action. I beg leave, also, to suggest that all available persons in and about Eichmond be organized for the defense of the city; that they provide themselves with such arms as each can procure, and that arrangements be made for the fabrication of suitable ammunition. These are intended as precautionary measures, which can better be made now than upon the eve of the emergency, should it arise.

We received no arms from the State or Confederate States authorities. About one-third of the militia who turned out had no arms at all 5 the others had their own, or such as they could procure.

Yorktown, Ya., June 15, 1861.
General B. E. Lee:
Sir : As I am left in temporary command of this post, I hope that I will be pardoned for making a few suggestions. The enemy is burning for revenge for his total rout at Bethel Church. There can be no doubt that he will attempt to take this point either by a night surprise or by a regular siege. We are totally unprepared for either alternative. The development of our lines is so great that they cannot be manned by less than six thousand troops. Now we have no siege guns at all. Our forces are now divided between Bethel Church, Grove Landing, and Williamsburg. We are therefore liable to be beaten in detail with our present weak force, and the York line may be lost at any moment. At this time there are scarce three thousand men in Yorktown, and our lines cannot possibly be defended with fewer than six thousand. Permit me, then, to urge that more troops may be sent here, and that some dozen siege guns be mounted in our batteries. I understand that the Bifle Bangers from Florida are exceedingly anxious to come here, and, as they are all experienced hunters, their services would be of great value to us.
With great respect,
D. H. HILL,
Colonel First Regiment North Carolina Volunteers.
Headquarters, Richmond, Van June 15,1861. His Excellency John Letcher, Governor of Virginia:
Sir : Agreeably to your request, I submit a statement of the military and naval preparation for the defense of Virginia, from the period of her separation from the U. S. Government to the date of transfer of the military operations of the State to the Confederate Government. Arrangements were first made for the establishment of batteries to prevent the ascent of our enemy by hostile vessels. As soon as an examination was made for the selection of sites, their construction was begun and their armament and defense committed to the Virginia Navy. Preparations were also begun for receiving into the service of the State volunteer consumes, and for organizing, arming, and equipping them. Mustering officers were appointed, rendezvous established, and provision made for their subsistence and shelter. The primary estimate of the number of troops, of all arms, required, based upon the points to be defended, amounted to fifty-one thousand men. The estimated quota of each portion of the State has been furnished, except from the western

section. Arrangements were made for calling out the volunteers from the western section at the same time and in the same manner as from the eastern section, but as yet it has been feebly responded to.
Comidete returns from the troops in the field have not, and, from the nature of things, cannot for some time be received; but, from the best source of information within our reach, the number of Virginia troops is about 35,000. This amount probably falls below the real number, for, referring to the report of the Colonel of Ordnance, it will be seen that he has issued 2,054 rifles and carbines and 41,004 muskets, in addition to pistols and sabers to the cavalry. Thirteen thousand arms have also been issued from Lexington, making a total of 56,658. Seven thousand of those from Lexington and several thousand from the arsenal at Eichmond have been issued to troops from other States; but as many of the Virginia companies, supposed to be about 5,000 men, were armed and equipped when received into the service of the State, should the number of unarmed companies from other States not differ materially from the number of armed companies of the State, the number of Virginia troops in the field may be assumed to be about 40,000. When it is remembered that this body of men were called from a state of profound peace to one of unexpected war, you will have reason to commend the alacrity with which they left their homes and families and prepared themseives for the defense of the State. The assembling of men, however, was not the most difficult operation. Provision for their instruction, subsistence, equipment, clothing, shelter, and transportation in the field required more time and labor. Ammunition of every kind had to be manufactured. The carriages of the guns for river, land, and field service had to be made, with the necessary implements, caissons, battery wagons, &c. One hundred and fifteen guns for field service have thus been provided, from which twenty light batteries, of four guns each, have been furnished, with the requisite horses, harness, &c.
For the defense of James Eiver, two batteries and two steamers have been provided, mounting, altogether, forty guns, ranging in caliber from 32-pounders to 8 and 9 inch columbiads. Arrangements are also in process for mounting sixty guns, of different weights, on the defenses around Eichmond, and a naval battery of 6 to 12 pounder howitzers is in process of organization.
On York Eiver three batteries have been constructed, mounting thirty guns, of caliber similar to the guns on James Eiver.
Sites for batteries on the Potomac have also been selected, and arrangements were in progress for their construction; but the entire command of that river being in the possession of the United States Government, a larger force is required for their security than could be devoted to that purpose. The batteries at Aquia Greek have only been prepared. Twelve guns are in position there.
On the Eappahannock Eiver a four-gun battery of 32 pounders and 8-inch columbiads has been erected.
Six batteries have been erected on the Elizabeth Eiver, to guard the approaches to Norfolk and the navy-yard. They mount eighty-five guns, 32-pounders and 8 and 9 inch columbiads.
To prevent the ascent of the Nansemond Eiver and the occupation of the railroad from Norfolk to Eichmond, three batteries have been constructed on that river, which will mount nineteen guns.
The frigate United States has been prepared for a school-ship, provided with a deck battery of nineteen guns, 32-pounders and 9-inch columbiads, for harbor defense. The frigate Merrimac has been raised

and is in the dry-dock, and arrangements are made for raising the Germantown and Plymouth.
In addition to the batteries described, other works have been constructed for their land defense, exceeding, in many instances, the works on the batteries themselves. An extensive line of field works has been erected for the security of ^Norfolk on the sides towards the bay. Re-doubts for the same purpose have been constructed at Jamestown Island, Gloucester Point, Yorktown, and across the neck of land below Williamsburg. I have confined myself to a general narration of operations, and for the details refer you to the reports of several chiefs of staff.

There is no evidence of a disposition on his part to land in this vicinity, and I am obliged to think that the force here is unnecessarily large. To all appearances the Federal forces will be directed against Manassas Junction and Harper’s Ferry. If those places fall, this position will be unnecessary, as he will have opened for himself a more direct route to Richmond. I beg therefore respectfully to suggest that after leaving a sufficient guard for the batteries, say 500 men, it will be better for me to march with the great body of my command to Manassas, or some other point where they can be made available, to resist the first great onslaught of the enemy. It may be the time for this move has not yet arrived, and my only object now is to inform you that if you agree with me in opinion as to the enemy’s intention, I can at very short notice march from here with three regiments of volunteers and two batteries of artillery.

Colonel : Your letter of the 14th, directed to General S. Cooper, has been received. The result of your examination of the James Biver is different from the conclusion arrived at by the engineer and naval officers to whom that duty was assigned. They supposed that a battery at Day’s Point would not command the passage of James Biver, and therefore established it at Jamestown Island. A battery at Day’s Point was considered to be advantageous in other respects, but, as it would require a larger covering force for its security than could then be assigned it, its construction was necessarily postponed. Since the concentration of troops at Suffolk has become possible, arrangements have been commenced for its erection, and it is hoped it will not be too late for the benefit proposed.

Headquarters, Richmond, Va., June 16,1861. To the Commanding Officer Yorktown, Va. :
Col. D. H. Hill’s letter of the 15th instant has been received. The advantage to the enemy of his possession of Yorktown will be sufficient to induce him to adopt every means to take it. It is hoped that every precaution will be adopted to prevent its being carried by surprise. Should it be besieged, measures will be taken for its relief. There are no siege guns at present available for your post. Be-enforcements will be sent to Yorktown as rapidly as the arrival of available troops at this point will permit. Should the works at Yorktown be too extensive for defense by the troops now there, it will be advisable, if possible, to contract the lines, so as to render them defensible by the force you can command for that purpose.

The Buckhannon Pass is occupied by one regiment of infantry, a half battery, and a company of cavalry. I made a forced march by night to reach these passes, in consequence of having heard that the enemy were moving from Philippi to Buckhannon. I presumed his object to be to get possession of the two passes, and thus shut up my force in the valley of Beverly, Huttonsville, &c.
The other troops in rear have not yet arrived. Major Williams, on engineer duty, reported this afternoon, but I doubt whether anything can be done for this pass. It is not so formidable as I had been induced to suppose, and would present no difficulty to good light infantry.

This is not enough; 4,500 more troops are necessary to secure this line, and fifteen heavy guns. There are at Norfolk, I am informed, many 32-pounders on navy carriages. They would answer here very well. The enemy will come on this line provided with heavy siege guns. Now we have time, if the 32-pounders from Norfolk can be ordered and sent, to put them in position, and to foil the enemy in every attack. Many are needed for this place and Williamsburg also. If the enemy lay siege to this fort and those before Williamsburg with heavy siege guns and men armed with the long-range muskets, it will be impossible to hold either with light field pieces and common muskets. We are now strong enough to prevent being stormed, I think, provided our lines are filled with men, which is not the case now. The heavy guns are absolutely necessary, and without loss of time. So are men. Four more regiments, of one thousand effective men each, or five regiments of the ordinary strength, with the heavy guns asked for, would put anxiety to rest as to a successful attack on Richmond from this quarter. I have here asked for the smallest number. I again ask the attention of the headquarters of the Army to the fact that no fuses are furnished the shell for the navy battery here, and that the amount of ammunition for that battery is ridiculously small (forty-seven rounds, without fuses, to each gun). I sent a good fuse-maker to Captain Barron the other day— Anderson—who has been employed at Fort Monroe in the ordnance department for many years.
I cannot too urgently press upon the consideration of the headquarters the immediate necessity of having the heavy guns from Norfolk or elsewhere at this place. The defense of Richmond is here at Williamsburg and Jamestown, and the men and guns are necessary to that de-

Same at King’s Mill. Also one company on the King’s Mill road, at Tetter’s Keck, and another on Spratley’s farm. A redoubt will be built at once, which will command the King’s Mill Landing, and one at Spratley’s farm, which will enfilade the shore between King’s Mill and the Grove. This latter must be furnished with two columbiads, which I have to request may be forwarded to Jamestown, care of Captain Rives, Engineers, with their carriages, ammunition, &c.

General : In answer to your letter of the 15th instant, addressed to General S. Cooper, I have to state that, until the plans of the enemy are more clearly disclosed, it is not considered advisable to reduce the force in the vicinity of Fredericksburg, lest that place might fall into their hands, and thus open a short and convenient line to Richmond. It is, however, desired that you keep your command in condition to move at any point when required, leaving a sufficient force to maintain the batteries. It has been stated to me that troops have been stationed at Mathias Point, Colonel Brockenbrough commanding, and that their position is unmasked and unprotected. It was designed to occupy this point with a battery, for the purpose of commanding the passage of the Potomac. Kot having sufficient troops to secure it, its construction was postponed, and the guns have been applied, I presume, to other points. If your force is sufficient, I would suggest the project of its erection be resumed. Captain Lynch, of the Kavy, had the matter in charge, and is informed of the circumstances of the case. Everything should be prepared, before breaking ground, for its rapid construction, and troops sufficient for holding it at the spot.

I have already informed General Holmes, through his aide, Colonel Lacy, of the necessity of establishing a battery and supporting force at the mouth of the former creek, but I am unable to do so at present for the reason given above; hence I would be happy to have him do it if in his power. I would suggest also the necessity of establishing immediately a telegraph station near your headquarters and another near those of Lieutenant-Colonel Green, at Camp Chopawamsic, near Evans-port, so as to be in telegraphic communication with this place, via Richmond, for a most thorough and perfect concert of action must exist between our different military departments to insure victory to our arms and success to our glorious cause.

I disagree with General Beauregard as to the propriety of detaching any part of this command.
The point designated by him is entirely out of reach of Aquia Creek. If this command is relieved, it should be on the supposition that there is no danger to be apprehended of an invasion from near here, and in that event nearly the whole command should be sent.

Sir : I have had reports for a week past that the Lincoln forces were putting artillery on the Ripraps. I presumed at the time it was to prevent small vessels from passing to the southward of it.
On Saturday afternoon the command at Sewell’s Point was surprised by a rifled shell passing just over the battery, and exploding some hundred yards beyond. Some eight or ten shells were fired, but no others fell so near the battery. Some went near the camp of the Georgia battalion, near half a mile distant. The distance from the Ripraps to the battery is about three and five-eighths miles. I immediately ordered a lighter load of railroad iron sent down, and commenced work, securing the magazine and battery from the effect of these shells, and, as it is a long shot, the men will learn to dodge them. I am pushing on the work of fortifying the battery. The shells proved to be 32-pounder calibqr, of Sawyer’s pattern, flanged projectile, covered with composition metal, and having a concussion fuse. They did not fire at all yesterday (Sunday). Last evening I received a report that a small propeller was lying

General : On the morning of the 16th intelligence was received, apparently reliable, that no enemy is advancing on Eomney, and that the large body of troops collected near Hagerstown would cross the Potomac yesterday. The troops under my command were therefore directed to this point, on the road from Hagerstown to Winchester, the main route from Maryland into the valley of Virginia. We are twelve miles in advance of Winchester. My only hope from this movement is a slight delay in the enemy’s advance. I believe his force to be about 18,000; ours is 6,500. Lieutenant-Colon el Stuart, commanding our small body of cavalry, sent me intelligence last night that the Federal troops encamped yesterday afternoon about eight miles from Martins-burg (seventeen miles from this place) on this road.
I will endeavor to conform as nearly as circumstances may permit to the instructions received from you on the 15th. The want of ammunition has rendered me very timid.

In the letter to you of the 15th, if the instructions seemed to you specific, be assured it was only intended to respond to the desire manifested in the letter communicated by you, and both then and theretofore and now the fullest reliance was placed in your zeal and discretion, and you are expected to act as circumstances may require, only keeping in view the general purpose to resist invasion as far as may be practicable, and seek to repel the invaders whenever and however it may be done. In order that all disposition may be made to meet your wants it is necessary that you should write frequently and fully as to your position, and the movements which may be contemplated by you. Since the date of my last letter to you re-enforcements have been steadily sent forward to the camp at Manassas June-

tion, and others will be added to that force and to yours, as the current of events may determine us to advance on one line or the other. Should we not be able to assume the offensive with prospects of success the war must for a time remain one of positions, and active operations be carried on against small detachments and lines of communication. If the enemy should advance boldly, the latter operations will become to you more easy and to him more injurious. It is needless to tell you that we are poorly supplied with disciplined troops and with transportation for maneuvering in the field, and you will therefore readily understand why we have not sought to accumulate in your command before receiving requisitions from you and before being in a condition to instruct you to advance.
Our information here—much less perfect than your own—has not led to the conclusion that a main attack was now contemplated upon your line of operations, but we have not failed to observe indications of a purpose to make such attack hereafter—probably not before affairs in Western Virginia remove the apprehensions of the enemy as to popular resistance in that quarter. We have, however, endeavored to use the limited means at control so as to meet the contingency of attack either by way of Harper’s Ferry or by Alexandria, as the case might be, should either occur before we were ready to shift the campaign to suit our own views. The advance upon Eomney was most probably only intended to capture the arms which had been placed there, and a painful rumor is in circulation here that this was near being effected by surprise, on account of the neglect to have scouts and pickets on duty sufficiently far in advance to gain timely warning of the approach of an enemy. You will in the manner which you may deem most effective enforce upon all the troops under your command the necessity of the greatest vigilance and activity on picket and reconnoitering duty. If the inhabitants of the valley have rallied with spirit to your standard, you will no doubt find among them men well suited to the duty of scouts and guides. As far as it may be practicable you will seek to strip the country which may be possessed by the enemy of those things which may be most available to him, especially horses suited to the military service and herds of beef cattle. If it be possible to do so, it is desirable that the gun-stocks, gun-barrels, tilt-hammers, &c., which have not been removed from Harper’s Ferry should be brought away and sent forward for our use elsewhere.
Ee-enforcements will be sent to you of such character and numbers as you may require and our means will enable us to afford $ and here I would enforce upon you the necessity of communicating promptly all reliable information which you may obtain in relation to the enemy. The reports which we receive from other than official sources are so often incorrect that no action can possibly be based upon them.

It is important that yon particularly watch the landings in the vicinity of Grove Wharf, on the left bank, and Stonehouse Wharf, on the right bank, below Jamestown, and endeavor to give notice to the troops on either bank. A body of infantry guard the former point, and a troop of cavalry, commanded by Captain Ruffin, patrol the country about BurwelPs Bay, to convey intelligence to the troops at Suffolk. It is suggested that you establish a system of signals, as a means of communication with the troops, and take every precaution not to jeopardize the safety of your boat by proceeding too far beyond the protection of the guns of the batteries.

The want of these connections has seriously retarded the operations so far, and they may become more important. All the guns, ammunition, &c., from Norfolk, on reaching Petersburg, have either to be transported across the Appomattox to the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, or forwarded to the Richmond and Danville Railroad, and to be again transported at Richmond. The transportation of troops has also been delayed in the same manner.

General S. Cooper, Adjt. Gen. (7. S. Army, Richmond, Fa. ;
Sir : I have the honor to report that I now occupy this post with the Second Louisiana Regiment, the Zouaves, to which I have attached the York and Warwick companies, two batteries of artillery, and some cavalry, and that the Georgia regiment is so placed in our rear as to be able to watch the Poquosin River, to fall back upon Yorktown, or to support Bethel.
Yesterday a flag of truce was borne by Mr. Butler, aide-de-camp to General Butler, who was accompanied by Mr. Winthrop, brother of Major Winthrop (who was also on the staff of General Butler), and was killed on the 10th. The object was to ask the body of Major Winthrop. I had it disinterred and escorted by a detachment of artillery and a troop of dragoons to a farm-house beyond our works, where it was delivered to Mr. Butler with military honors to the deceased.
One of our vedettes, Private Prior, was cut off the day before yesterday, and killed. A lieutenant of Captain Adams’ company of horse was shot in the leg by a picket of the Georgia regiment. I had directed a bandeau of white to be worn by our forces, but the Georgians had it not. The wound, though severe, is not considered mortal. Badges prescribed are worn now by the Georgians, and I hope no mistake of this serious nature will again occur.
I requested in a letter from Grove Landing that Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, Fifteenth Virginia Infantry, might be appointed colonel, and ordered to report to me. I have attached the York and Warwick companies to the Zouaves, partly in order to give the battalion a colonel. In fact, the captains of the Zouaves called upon me in a body, and stated that they would be obliged to resign and serve as privates unless something was done, their lieutenant-colonel being, though a brave and good man, entirely without energy or the faculty to command. Whilst reminding them of the impropriety of their course, I saw that they were actuated by no ill or ignoble feeling. I ordered them here, under the command, of course, of their lieutenant-colonel, and they obeyed promptly$ but I am most anxious to have a colonel for this battalion—a man of some knowledge of his profession, and firmness—and I have learned it would not be distasteful to Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens himself, who will still be lieutenant-colonel. Please let this be done with as little delay as possible.

The nights are cold, and there is much rain in this mountainous region. Sickness is therefore to be apprehended. In addition to this? they are obliged to carry their ammunition in their pockets, and that which escapes the rain is ruined by the perspiration of the men and the wearing out of the paper cartridges. I asked before leaving Staunton for one thousand cartridge-boxes, but I suppose it will be some time before I shall see them.

General : I have been ordered by Col. L>. H. Hill, temporarily in command at Yorktown, to see you in reference to a letter recently written by him requesting re-enforcements and that some heavy guns should be sent for the interior lines at Yorktown. At present there are in Yorktown, besides the field pieces of my battalion, four columbiads in the water battery, two brass 12-pounders, one 12-pounder navy howitzer, and two iron 6-pounders. The interior lines are very extensive, not less than three-quarters of a mile in length, to some extent commanded by the heights north of the morass, which are too extensive to be occupied, and on the east there is a level, open country, traversed by the roads from Hampton and Wormley’s Creek, favorable to the erection of batteries by the enemy. To render the place tenable, if attacked by a force with a siege train, I respectfully submit that we should have at least twelve heavy guns, eight of them to be mounted on the eastern lines, three on the southern, and one on the western, to command the road from Williamsburg. I find that Captain Ingraham, the Chief of the Naval Bureau of Ordnance, can supply us with eight 32-pounders of twenty-seven hundred weight, and four 42-pounder carronades with navy carriages. These guns are well suited to our purposes, the former firing round shot and shell effectively, and the latter firing grape shot for short ranges, such as are to be found on the northern lines, facing the morass. Captain Ingraham can also furnish four boats, capable of transporting four or five hundred men, which will be very useful in preserving the communications between Yorktown and Gloucester Point. I respectfully ask permission to receive these guns and boats. Two of the guns are at Gloucester Point and two at West Point ; but Captain Whittle authorizes me to say that they are not ready for them at either place, and that he should prefer seeing them mounted at Yorktown.
The Secretary having given me an order for thirty-six horses, to supply the loss of eight in the action of the 10th instant, to mount four men for each of the six navy howitzers in my battalion, to mount two chiefs of caissons, and to furnish two spare horses for the two batteries, I respectfully ask a detail of a non-commissioned officer and eighteen men to carry the horses to Yorktown.

The movements of the enemy indicate the importance he attaches to the position of the valley of Virginia, and that he has probably seen the power he would acquire, if left free to do so, by advancing as far as Staunton, and then distributing his force so as to cut off our communication with the West and South, as well as to operate against our Army of the Potomac by movements upon its lines of communication, or attacking upon the reverse, supplying himself at the same time with all the provisions he may acquire in the valley of the Shenandoah, and enabling him to dispense with his long train of transportation from Pennsylvania.

I have the honor to reply that my attention has been frequently and earnestly called to the subject of the defense of the Rappahannock, both as regards Essex and the surrounding counties. The battery at Lowry’s Point seemed to be most advantageous at first for the defense of Fredericksburg, because it was at the narrowest and most difficult portion of the channel, and because it could be best defended by the guns that were available. It was desired to place the battery as near the mouth of the river as possible, and attention was particularly directed to Gray’s Point and Cherry Point $ but it was found that the distance was so great as to require guns of heavy caliber, not then available, and works of such size as to be difficult of construction and protection. Those points were therefore abandoned. Recently the project for the construction of batteries at those points has been received, and a proper officer has made examinations to that effect. As soon as means can be provided the works will be commenced$ but in the mean time it is desired that the measure be kept secret.

As your force is not sufficient for the protection of the battery at Mathias Point, its erection, for the present, must be postponed; but I desire you to keep its establishment in view, as it is proposed to place one there when circumstances will permit.

Sir : I wrote to you yesterday from Beverly in relation to two additional companies of cavalry, but I am constrained to recur to the subject again to-day, to urge upon you the necessity of great dispatch in forwarding them to me. During the last two days the enemy have evinced great activity and boldness in pushing their scouts to within two or three miles of my position, on the approaches to it, and it has quite worn down my small cavalry force (two companies at this point) in watching and checking their movements. The force is too small to enable me to push heavy scouts as far to the front as I desire. My scouts have had one or two partial rencounters with those of the enemy, in which we have captured one of their men and two horses, and have killed one man and wounded others; but the service is too hard on the men and horses. The enemy are reported to be six thousand strong in Philippi, and about four thousand strong in Grafton, with six pieces of artillery (two rifled) at the former place; but these numbers vary very much. I do not think that they have more than seven thousand at Grafton and Philippi together. As I must keep one or two pieces of artillery in each of the passes now held by me, I hope it may not be deemed unreasonable if I ask two additional pieces. Gould I get rifled pieces1?

Headquarters, YorTctown, Va., June 20, 1861. Col. George Deas, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir: Having learned from the vedettes stationed on the Warwick road yesterday morning at 7 o’clock that a large body of the enemy was seen by himself and others on that road as high up as Lee’s store, nearly equidistant with our troops, after deducting the distance from that place to our position, and learning from Captain Levy, Louisiana volunteers, whom I had sent in the night before with a flag to General Butler, that there was every indication of an expedition of some magnitude being on foot, I determined to march without delay to this post, and, if the enemy had preceded me, to attack him in his rear. With this view, I sent a dispatch, by night express, to Colonel Hill, commanding at Yorktown, directing him to place one of his regiments about two miles in front of his works, and at the junction of the York and Warwick roads, by which the enemy, if he arrived before Yorktown before we did, would be obliged to pass. I intended to attack him there, but, having sent fresh vedettes to Warwick Court-House and Lee’s store, I found that a strong party of the enemy had marched out early in the morning to procure horses, mules, &c. The embarrassment of operating on the Peninsula with a weak force before a strong one is that, if you want to verify a report of a vedette, your force is cut off, and the important point to be defended at all hazards is in danger. This marching

and countermarching, however, not being understood, fatigues and dispirits the troops. Still, it must be done, as the enemy must be kept in his trenches and fortifications. I had no wagons with me except three loaded with provisions, and had to leave the cooking utensils, some few tents, and the extra rations of our men on the ground. I reasoned that, if the force of the enemy turned out to be large, and an attacking party on Yorktown, I should be in time to recover it by this course; if small, I could easily send for the articles left. I have already most of them here, and the rest will be here to night.
I shall continue to occupy the lower part of the country—Bethel and neighborhood—but must construct some intrenchments, both on the Poquosin River and on the Warwick road, before making a move with an infantry force.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Colonel, Commanding.
P. S.—I have the honor to request that Captain Stanard’s battery, now at the Baptist College, be sent to me, as the erection of intrenchments on the Warwick and Poquosin roads makes it necessary that I should have more field pieces.
Respectfully,

General Orders, )	Headquarters of the Forces,
No. 28. j	Richmond, Fa., June 20,1861.
On several occasions bodies of our troops have been surprised by the enemy under circumstances highly discreditable to the service, and. the general commanding is therefore compelled to notice these occurrences in a public manner, and to enjoin upon all a more careful attention to the subject of outposts and vedettes. It is impossible that a surprise can take place if a due vigilance is exercised, and outposts and sentries are well established on the approaches to any given point and strictly perform their duty. From some of the camps information is received that the troops have wasted their ammunition in the most reckless and shameful manner. Such intelligence is almost incredible, yet it is nevertheless true. One man has been killed and a number wounded by this abominable practice. The general hopes that there are not instances of this nature other than those which have been reported to him, and that the troops generally will pay regard to the importance of carefully handling their arms and economizing their ammunition, so vitally important at all times.

Sir : Agreeably to wishes expressed in your letter of the 16th Instant, a field piece, with ammunition, has been forwarded your command. A company of artillery, with field pieces, it is understood, is now being enlisted here for your command, and if it is completed to the number required by law will be mustered into service, and, with its battery, be sent forward. Captain Cunningham’s Company (F) was ordered on the 8th instant to repair to this city and report to you. It has, however, but recently arrived here, under some misapprehension of the order by the captain, who reports that the company has never been mustered into service, and that the men will decline the muster if required to proceed under the orders so soon.
As Capt. H. M. Mathews can be spared from the duty in which he is at present engaged he will be ordered to report to you. Three other officers will be directed to join you.

General : Your communication of the 12th instant has been duly received. In relation to the two regiments sent you, one from Georgia and one from Tennessee, the commanding general instructs me to say that these two regiments were selected by the President to be added to your command because they were thought to be fully equipped and in a good state of discipline. They were sent from Lynchburg, and did not pass through this city. He is grieved at your report of the inefficient state of the Tennessee regiment, but trusts that ere this a better state of things has been inaugurated.

General Joseph E. Johnston:
My Hear General : I congratulate you on the brilliant movement of Colonel Vaughn’s command. To break the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was essential to our operations, and if the bridge at Cheat River and the Grand Tunnel could be destroyed, so as to prevent the use of that railroad for the duration of the war, the effect upon public opinion in Western Virginia would doubtless be of immediate and great advantage to our cause.
If the enemy has withdrawn from your front to attack on the east side of the mountain, it may be that an attempt will be made to advance from Leesburg to seize the Manassas road and to turn Beauregard’s; position. The recent effort to repair the railroad from Alexandria to-Leesburg may have been with such intent. In that event, if your scouts* give you accurate and timely information, an opportunity will be offered you by the roads through the mountain passes to make a flank attack in conjunction with Beauregard’s column, and, with God’s blessing,, tu achieve a victory alike glorious and beneficial.
We continue to send forward re-enforcements to Manassas Junction.. On Monday and Tuesday a battalion of light artillery will go forward,, and every effort is made to reach a condition which will enable our forces* to shape the campaign by assuming the offensive.
I wish you would write whenever your convenience will permit,; and give me fully both information and suggestions. Colonel Thomas recently undertook to explain to me your wants as one authorized to speak for you, and to-day Mr. Staples communicated his impression of your views, necessities, and wishes. I am sure you cannot feel hesitation in writing to me freely, and trust your engagements will permit you to do so frequently.
With earnest wishes for your welfare and happiness, I am, very truly,, vour friend,

Governor Letcher, Richmond, Fa. ;
Sir : I am in receipt this morning of a letter from Colonel McKee, of the Louisville Courier, who has from time to time communicated such information as he thought would be of service to me, in which he incloses a letter from a friend of his in Cincinnati, dated June 19, in which he states as follows:
Two regiments of Indiana troops (the Eighth and Tenth) have just arrived here (Cincinnati) to-night en route for East Tennessee via Western Virginia. The information as to their destination I have confidentially from a colonel of one of the regiments I am well acquainted with, and believe this information, which I took some pains to pump from him, correct. The presence of the contemptible traitor seems to confirm it. I suppose you have means of communicating with the Tennessee leaders, and if, as I do, you consider the above item of any importance, by all means convey it to them as soon as possible. These men go to Marietta to-night, and to-morrow will be in Western Virginia. They, with several other regiments, are to co-operate with Brown-low and Johnson men. These two regiments are hardy-looking men and well armed.

Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
Manassas Junction, Fa., June 23, 1801. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to inform the Department that, in consequence of the large re-enforcements I have lately received, I have divided my forces into six brigades, as per inclosed statement,* and commenced a forward movement to protect my advanced position at Centreville, Fairfax Court-House, and Sangster’s Cross-Roads, and also to be within striking distance of the enemy, whose advance positions seem to be at and to the rear of Falls Church (seven -miles from Alexandria), where they have five regiments (First and Second Connecticut, First and Second Ohio, and Sixty-ninth New York), one troop of cavalry, and one light battery. They have also four companies at Annandale.
My advanced forces (three brigades of three regiments each) occupy the triangle represented by Mitchell’s Ford (Bull Run), one regiment; Centreville and a point half way to Germantown, one brigade; Germantown and Fairfax Court-House, one brigade; at the crossing of Brad-dock’s old road with the Fairfax Court-House and Fairfax Station roads, one regiment; at the latter station, one regiment and one battalion, and at Sangster’s Cross-Roads, one battalion. All these positions are in easy and short communication with each other and with these headquarters. Most of my cavalry is with the advance, scouting, reconnoitering, &c. One light battery is at Fairfax Court-House with General Bonham’s brigade, and another is to be sent to Centreville to act with Colonel Cocke’s brigade. I unfortunately have none to spare for my other brigades. I have thrown eight miles in advance of the latter town or village one battalion of infantry and two companies of cavalry to observe the country towards the Potomac and the movements of the enemy in that direction. As already reported to the Department, one regiment (Sloan’s South Carolina) has been ordered to Leesburg, to assist Col. E. Hunton in the defense of that important position. I regret much my inability to send him some artillery.
I must call the attention of the Department to the great deficiency of my command in ammunition, not averaging more than twenty rounds in all per man. If I were provided with the necessary materials, molds, &c., I think I could establish here a cartridge manufactory which could supply all our wants in that respect. Could not a similar arrangement be made at all hospital depots, State arsenals, penitentiaries, &c.! To go into battle each soldier ought to be provided with at least forty rounds of cartridges, and not less than sixty rounds in reserve.

This inquiry is now submitted to you for your reply at your earliest convenience. If certain allegations in respect to the general’s habits and daily condition, which have been made to General Lee, are correct, he certainly would not be a fit person for this responsible duty. In addition to this, also, it is believed that the population from which these regiments would be taken is by no means loyal to the cause of Virginia in the present state of affairs.

still occupying Hagerstown and Williamsport, the main body being in the former place, and six or eight thousand men under General Cad-walader in the latter.
He says that General Patterson has been corresponding with the authorities of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in relation to repairing the road, and talks of occupying Harper’s Ferry. Should he do so with less than ten or twelve thousand men, an equal force attacking him would have the advantage of ground.
Colonel Jackson, who is in the neighborhood of Martinsburg to supj>ort the cavalry which is observing the enemy, has, according to his instructions, destroyed all the rolling stock of the road within his reach. I have directed him to have such of the large stock of coal as the inhabitants require sold to them, and accounts to be kept of the sales, and the proceeds to be used in purchasing provisions in the neighborhood. I have had the pleasure to receive the order for Capt. W. E. James to report to me with his company of cavalry. We require three or four more companies of that arm from the great extent of country to be observed. Another officer capable of commanding a brigade and four or five competent to the duties of quartermasters and commissaries are greatly needed. In this connection I recommend the appointment of Lieutenants Davis and Morgan as assistant quartermasters. They have proved themselves competent to the discharge of the duties of that position.

They yvill take with them two 6-pounder iron guns, with ammunition, two hundred tents, and the following articles of clothing, viz, seven hundred and twenty overcoats, one thousand pairs of socks, and six hundred pairs of drawers. I am informed by the Quartermasters Department that at present there are no shirts on hand, but that the number called for in your requisition (five hundred) will be forwarded, together with the balance of the over-coats, as soon as made.

The resignation of the five officers of the Zouave battalion therein mentioned, the dissatisfaction of the men, and the inability on the part of the officers to control in this battalion, as reported by you, have been sources of great regret to me. There are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the promotion of Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, of the Fifteenth Regiment Virginia, to the command of the regiment you propose forming by the addition of two companies of Virginia volunteers to this battalion, nor is there any officer of the Army now available to be assigned to this command. I desire you to direct Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens to proceed to Richmond and report to me at these headquarters, and beg to be informed if there is no officer of the Zouave battalion, in your judgment, capable of commanding and managing it.

Hdqrs. Twenty-seventh Brigade Virginia Militia,
Raleigh Court-House, Va., June 25, 1861. General Wm. H. Richardson,
Adjutant-General Virginia Militia, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to report, through yourself, to his excellency the governor and commander-in-chief, that I have just reached home, after a visitation of the One hundred and twenty-sixth, One hundred and forty-second, One hundred and eighty-fourth, One hundred and ninetieth, One hundred and eighty-seventh, and One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiments of line, during which, in the unavoidable vacancy in the office of brigade-inspector (caused by Linkon’s assignment to volunteer service), I trained the officers, reviewed and drilled the six regiments. By my addresses to the several regiments, to the county courts, and to the people, wherever assembled, I have been most successful in getting up a patriotic union of men, hitherto of various shades of opinion, for the defense of Virginia, and also in promoting the formation of volunteer companies, some now in the field, and several to march in a few days.
Nicholas County, One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiment, two companies, one in camp; Fayette County, One hundred and forty-second Regiment, three companies, in the field; Raleigh County, One hundred and eighty-fourth Regiment, two companies, one already gone, and one to leave Monday; Wyoming County, One hundred and ninetieth Regiment, one company; Logan County, One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiment, two companies; Boone County, One hundred and eighty-seventh Regiment, two companies, another forming; one marches to-day; one in camp. In all, twelve companies.
Thus the governor will perceive that one brigadier of Virginia militia has attempted to fulfill his responsibilities, and is ready, whenever called upon, to take the field at the head of his brigade.
With respect to some partial, and, as it seems to me, irregular and
'Not found.

﻿952	OPERATIONS IN MP., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
impolitic orders, emanating from the lieutenant-colonel (McCausland) of the Kanawha Talley volunteer forces, it is my duty to complain to his excellency. These orders, in the name of the governor, call for drafting one or two hundred men in a county. This is unnecessary, and it harasses the people, because I find each county and regiment ready to furnish as many volunteers as it is prudent to take away from these western counties, in which there are many disaffected persons whom it is necessary to watch and restrain until our State can get rid of them or punish them. If the governor should require any number of men from my brigade to be drafted, I ask that I may execute the governor’s orders. Recently an irresponsible man, named Hutchinson, brought one of these little one hundred-men orders, and pretended he had authority to draft. These irregular attempts to draft I will oppose until the governor shall otherwise direct, with respect to drafting a company out of the One hundred and forty-second Fayette Regiment on any pretext such as that. The people of that gallant county will not volunteer. Their having three companies in the field for some time completely proves the injustice of these little irregular drafts. The truth is, these will greatly injure a general draft when required by the public exigencies, as may soon be.
With great respect, sir, your most obedient servant,
ALFRED BEOKLEY,
Brigadier-General, Commanding Twenty-seventh Brigade.
P. S.—The official return of brigade will be forwarded in a few days. Inclosed I send the certificate of election of a new company, formed last Saturday, of one hundred and thirteen men.
Headquarters, Romney, Va., June 25,1861.
Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : On the 5th instant I had the honor to receive at the hands of the President the commission of colonel of cavalry in the Army of the Confederate States, accompanied by an order to perform certain services therein specified. On the 7th instant I reported myself to General Johnston, and exhibited to him the order alluded to. He informed me that such were the exigencies of his command that he could not spare a single man. Without some organized force, around which to rally volunteers, it was evidently vain for me to move towards the point at which the service was to be rendered, as I would have been pleased to have done with even one company of cavalry. Therefore I lost no time in sending out agents in the valley and Piedmont, and have met with success far beyond my most sanguine expectations, as this bids fair to become a popular arm of the service.
On the 15th Capt. Turner Ashby, commanding a troop belonging to Colonel Hun ton’s regiment, reported that he had obtained from General Johnston permission to join his own regiment, and from Colonel Hun-ton he obtained permission to join my command on the 14th instant; therefore his troop joined me at Winchester. On the 17th Captain Gaither, with a troop of Marylanders, joined me at the same point, with most of his men mounted. On the same day I had ordered both of these tooops to march to this place, to leave Winchester in the afternoon. In the mean time I learned that General Johnston’s command was drawn up in line of battle, expecting an attack. This induced me to

countermand the marching orders which I had given to Captains Ashby and Gaither, that my men should have their part in the expected engagement. On the morning of the 18th, having learned enough of the enemy’s position to convince me that there was no danger of an immediate attack, I ordered the above-named captains to move forward with their companies to this place. Since that time I have been joined by a full company of mounted men from Shenandoah County, commanded by Captain Myers, and another from the County of Page, commanded by Captain Jordan. Captain Bowen has tendered me another, expecting to join me here to-day or to-morrow with his company from Warren County. Captain Wingfield joined me with his company on day before yesterday. Captain Shands, from the county of Rockingham, joined on yesterday with twenty-five men, and expects the arrival of his recruiting agents in a day or so with men sufficient to fill up his company. Besides these, a full company, raised by Mr. Isbell from the county of Jefferson, report that they will join me in a few days. In addition to these organized companies I have with me volunteers from the States of Alabama, Kentucky, and Maryland, as well as from Hardy County, this State, under favorite leaders, in squads of from ten to thirty-five men, who wait to join their respective captains, now busily employed in raising full companies, though not yet reported as ready to join me. These different squads, for their more efficient service, I have temporarily attached to different companies already organized. Among these last-named men are some of the very best for the peculiar services of partisan and border war. That the organization of my command may be the more thorough and efficient, my plan is that the men of the different companies shall see some service under the officers now commanding them before they are fixed in their positions by election and commission. Further, it is my intention and the basis upon which I have thus far acted, although I can get from loyal and true citizens of the Confederate States as many horses, saddles, and bridles, &c., as I may need, for certificates of value, to be paid by our Government, yet have I deemed it both right and politic to exhaust the supply in the hands of positive traitors and submissionists, that they, in holding the Confederate States certificates, may become interested in the success of our revolution. What I remarked above as to horses, bridles, &c., for my command, I have but to say as to all the commissary supplies needed for our maintenance. In this connection I will draw your attention to the important fact that the saddles which I have picked up here and there in these mountains are totally unfit for my service, in that they both hurt the horses’ backs and afford no secure seats for the riders. I beg, therefore, that the saddles promised, as well as the articles mentioned in the inclosed requisition, may be forwarded to me at this point, in care of Mr. Thornton Pendleton and Major Fun-sten, who will bring them with them to this place, and upon the receipt of the better saddles, so indispensable to me, I will turn over to the proper department all those which may be unfit for ranger service, as well as all articles whose places may be better supplied under the requisition herewith inclosed. Of sabers I have but few, and wish none others, as I much prefer the hatchet, weighing about a half pound, in their stead.

be spared from the different departments. When I set out to join the command at this place I left in Winchester an acting quartermaster, Mr. Thornton Pendleton, who to-day has come up to inform me that the quartermasters department of General Johnston will not honor his requisitions for my command. I am obliged, therefore, to ask that in advance of the full organization of my regiment, Mr. Pendleton be authenticated as the quartermaster to my regiment, that Captain Turner Ashby be commissioned as lieutenant-colonel, and Dr. O. R. Funsten as major of my regiment. To the last-named gentleman I am much indebted for the energy, zeal, and untiring efforts in raising volunteers; and while he has not had a military education, I know him to be brave and indomitable, yielding to no man in his devotion to our cause, and I doubt not but that he will be fully equal to the requirements of his position. I cheerfully recommend him for major. As to Captain Ashby, I need not speak of his qualities, for already he is known as one of the best partisan leaders in the service. Himself a thorough soldier, he is eminently qualified to command. I sincerely trust that the commission asked for may issue to him. As soon as the requisite companies are filled, which I believe will be in a few days, I will send in to be commissioned the names of the company officers.
In order that the demoralizing influences of campaign life, particularly those which attach to a border war, may be counteracted as far as possible, the Rev. James B. Averitt, of the Episcopal Church, has been induced by me to accompany the command as the acting chaplain of the regiment. Already have I seen the good emanating from the regular services and prayers of this clergyman, as we have among us not a few communicants of the church, and I need not mention to you the good effect upon the popular mind here which the presence of one whose life is devoted to God and his country will have. I ask, therefore, that this gentleman may be appointed chaplain of my command, and that his commission may issue for the same. I am the more anxious for this last-mentioned appointment in that in having a fully commissioned and authenticated man of God with us, aside from the positive good to the command, the charges of land pirates and other unenviable sobriquets already preferred against us as parties to this partisan warfare may be the more fully met and refuted. For this gentleman, therefore, I ask this appointment.
Touching the services rendered by my command since we have been here, I will state that three spies have been captured—one of Virginia, the two others from Maryland. They are now in the jail of this county. I will send on in a day or so a detailed statement of the facts bearing upon their guilt, asking for instructions in their cases. My men keep the entire county of Hampshire thoroughly scouted, as well for the protection of the persons and property of loyal citizens as to watch the approach of hostile forces.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

Camp Jackson, June 26,1861.
General S. Cooper :
My Dear Sir : I desire to furnish the President with some facts relative to the state of affairs in this region of the State, which it is important, in my judgment, he should understand. The remnant of the Union shriekers in this southwestern part of the State cannot relinquish the idea of building up a political power and party which will control affairs here and in the State generally. An important object with them is to get control of the military organization whenever they possibly can, and to prevent any where they cannot.
In the county of Washington, at Abingdon, a military depot was established by the direction of the governor for the reception of volunteers from the counties of Lee, Scott, Russell, and Washington. A good many men convened there, and after being mustered into the service of the State were sent to Richmond. After this a colonel appointed by the governor (Colonel Moore) was assigned to the command of the post. He is a worthy, brave, and excellent man, of the strongest secession opinions. A major was sent there with him.
Recently Mr. John A. Campbell, the present submission member of the Convention, from Washington County, has been parading the county with a view of raising what he calls “his regiment,” and left the impression that he had received the commission of colonel from the governor. There was convened about two hundred men under different captains at the Abingdon post, who refused to be mustered into the service, but who desired to stay in camp at public expense, under their own organization, awaiting the appointment of Mr. Campbell to a colonelcy, and in default of that determining to disband and go home. This is an expiring effort to keep alive the influence of the Union party in the county, and to extend it, if possible, to the surrounding ones. Colonel Moore refused to issue rations to these people unless they would muster into service, which they refused to do, and disbanded.
That little village is the seat of all Union-shrieking influences, and they are exerted to their utmost upon all volunteer companies that come there. I am sure the best thing that can be done is at once to order away all the companies now there to Richmond, and to break up the encampment. Lynchburg will answer every purpose now for a receiving depot for all the west, and Colonel Moore could be assigned to duty in the field, which he would be glad of. If Campbell is allowed to get the commission of colonel, and to establish himself at Abingdon, it will exert a very injurious influence in this section of the State, by encouraging the Union spirit, now struggling for life in the county of Washington, but which is in the ascendency in the adjoining counties of Carter and Johnson, in Tennessee. The brother-in-law of this man

Campbell is one of the prominent leaders of the Lincoln x>arty in Tennessee, a coadjutor of Johnson, Kelson, and Brownlow, and any exercise of military authority by his brother-in-law in Virginia would prove extremely baleful to the cause we have so much at heart.

I dispatched a steamer, with a flag, to Old Point yesterday, and sent a letter to General Butler, informing him I forwarded some persons (the captain and crew of a Prussian bark, wrecked on the coast-some ladies and children, &c.), whose private affairs required them to go Korth. He could not be found to receive the letter, and the boat was detained several hours, as it appears Major-General Butler had himself gone over to the Bipraps, and, while the flag of truce was flying in the roads, he was firing (seven shots) from Sawyer’s rifled-gun upon our works at Sewell’s Point. Kobody hurt.

Colonel : I have just had the honor to receive your letter of the 24th instant. You ask on the part of the governor if Brigadier-General Meem has been authorized by me to raise two regiments from the Third Division of Virginia Militia. I respectfully reply he was ordered to do so by me. Permit me to remind you that in calling out the militia I am compelled to use the officers set over them, and in the absence of any means of knowing their character must suppose that in times like these none but competent persons are left in high military places. If General Meem is such a person as you describe, let me suggest that the authorities in Bichmond hold the remedy in their own hands, not I. I think that the belief you express a that the population from which these regiments would be taken is by no means loyal” is erroneous. Your strictures upon my order to General Meem imply strong disapproval— I suppose that of General Lee. If I am correct in so understanding you, would it not be well to countermand the order in question at headquarters ?

Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond:
Sir : I received information yesterday from Major Hood, operating below with three companies of cavalry and one piece of artillery, that a steamer, with troops on board, landed on the other side of the Po-quosin Eiver, in a large barge, one hundred men at Mesick’s Point, where we had a vedette. The movement was evidently one of reconnaissance. They staid about fifteen minutes, re-embarked, and returned to Port Monroe. The day before yesterday Major Hood scoured the country to within two miles of Newport News, passing across it to the Warwick road; then to John Sinclair’s farm and New Market Bridge, and by the way of Back Eiver road to his station, at Bartlett’s, on the Poquosin. He did not meet or see any trace of an enemy. Yesterday, about evening, he learned that some three companies of the enemy had marched on the Warwick road, and taken up their position at Whiting’s house, this side of New Market Bridge. He detached a party last night to surprise the enemy, but on their arrival found that the enemy had returned to Newport News. These operations will continue. The day before yesterday I mustered in five infantry companies of militia, averaging some two hundred men, and one of cavalry. The infantry companies I stationed near their own houses, to meet three times a week, and in the mean time to attend to their crops and families. The larger number came from the Poquosin, supposed heretofore to have been of doubtful patriotism; but I think a large majority are true. I sent through Gloucester and this county yesterday for spades, shovels, &c., and my quartermaster required them from Eichmond.
It is necessary to make intrenchments and place a gun, protected by some infantry, at three or four points on this side of the Poquosin Eiver; also to fortify Harrod’s Mills, on the York road, and Young’s Mills, on the Warwick road. This line, thus fortified, could not be turned easily. From this I can operate in front of Bethel, to the north of the enemy, and be in reach of re-enforcements when pressed. If operations with infantry are carried on below this line, they will certainly be disastrous in the end, for there is not a position lower down that cannot be turned by the enemy, and in much greater force than ourselves, and should a disaster occur it would be complete, and involve, as a consequence, the loss, probably, of this place.
I do not mean that we should not make a dash into them with infantry and then return to our intrenchments. We must not stay with infantry sufficiently long in any one place below to allow the enemy to take it in the rear, it being in his power to do so at any time, if he knew our position perfectly. The flanks of the line I propose now to occupy are reasonably secure. The right is at the place designated by me to you before, and the left is thrown back to avoid the landing on the other side of the Poquosin. If the enemy becomes bold, while we are preparing, he will soon be taught prudence.
A company of the Fifteenth Eegiment Virginia Militia, mustered at Williamsburg, about a week ago, and which refused to march under its captain, I have had disarmed, marched here, and the ringleaders are now being tried. I have the guard-house full of zouaves, who will also be tried at once, the courts sitting without regard to hours.
This will be taken up by Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens, whom I send to Eichmond in obedience to your orders. Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens appears devoted to his duties, and, from my own observations, though

General : In answer to your letter of the 27th instant* I have to state that it has always been intended to erect a battery at Mathias Point, with a view of commanding the navigation of the Potomac, and guns, &c., have been prepared for the purpose. Its construction has been postponed, from the fact that it would be vigorously resisted by the troops of the U. S. Government, and from its exposed position would require a larger force to protect and defend it than was available. The erection of the battery is still desired if it can be accomplished; but if the point at Evansport will accomplish the same end, as you think probable, and as it possesses advantages which you mention, it is preferable to construct the proposed battery at said point; but before this can be decided on you are desired, with the aid of the naval officers on the Potomac, to make an examination of the river at that point, to ascertain its condition and character, and you are requested to do so as soon as practicable. There are three 9-inch columbiads now here that were intended for Mathias Point and can be used at Evansport if that point be preferred. There are no rifled 32-pounders. I think no unnecessary demonstration should be made to attract the enemy’s attention, either at Evansport or at Mathias Point, which might disclose our purpose.

Sir : Pursuant to your instructions, received last night, I dispatched Colonel Bate, with the effective force of his regiment present, to support Commander Lewis, C. S. Navy. I consider the command (about four hundred) unnecessarily strong, as Colonel Bate is positively ordered to take no part in the expedition on the water. I sincerely hope your excellency will not consider me extra cautious in this matter, for when we consider that an indispensable requisite to success would be the absolute concealment of three hundred or four hundred men on a comparatively small steamer, and those men untrained volunteers, and that this is only one of several other contingencies equally difficult to be reconciled, it seems to me that success would be miraculous.!

from the State to the Confederate authorities, I inquired of General Lee if this transfer involved the necessity of u mustering” the Virginia troops into the service of the Confederate States, but received no answer. Lieutenant Washington was desired to obtain an answer to this question when in Richmond recently, and brought an affirmative verbal one.
An order in relation to the muster of the Virginia troops at the end of June, which followed him from General Lee’s headquarters, contained nothing on the subject, so that I am still uncertain.
If this form is necessary, be so good as to give me instructions. I have had no official information of the transfer of the Virginia troops to the Confederate Government.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier-General, 0. 8. Army.
Headquarters,
Boring's Mill, Warwick Road, Fa., June 30, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux, about eighteen hundred strong, arrived here yesterday at 3 p. m., after a most arduous march, without meeting with the enemy, although we sought him under the guns of his works at Newport News.
The command started at 11 o’clock at night on the 28th instant, under my immediate orders, and marched, in a drenching rain, to near the points where the enemy’s sentinels were reported to be posted. Before our arrival, however, at that point, I caused a thorough examination to be made of the bridge at New Market and its immediate vicinity, and could find no evidence of its being fortified or even occupied. One of the objects of this night march, as I wrote the commanding general, was to surprise the enemy at that point, if in occupation of it, and to drive him back into his works. Finding no enemy here, I determined to pass, by a private road, to within a mile or a mile and a half of Newport News, to conceal my cavalry in the wood which skirts the road leading from that place to Fort Monroe, to place my infantry in ambush on a parallel road and near enough to give support to the cavalry, and await daybreak and the passage of parties between the two posts. I proceeded to execute this plan, not without hope, from the extreme inclemency of the weather and the suddenness of our movement, of being able to surprise and capture the work itself, which, I am told, is garrisoned by at least four thousand men. We had arrived in the immediate vicinity of the post, when a musket was discharged by one of our own men, and two negroes were seen running towards the enemy, making it very improbable that we should be able to accomplish our purpose by surprise. We nevertheless continued our march, and learning from a negro that some two hundred men of the enemy were quartered in a house near the work, I determined to surround it. It was now daylight. I therefore sent the cavalry in front of the house, while the infantry filed through a road in its rear, but, upon examination, it was found the enemy did not occupy it that night, having perhaps been deterred from turning out of their work by the violent rain. I nevertheless concealed my men a§ much as possible, showing a few of the cavalry, in order to entice a portion of the garrison to come out. They, however, remained close, and as I intended to return to Yorktown by the Warwick road, I marched up to this point, where I am establishing a post, stopping, however, three hours in sight of Newport News, in order to rest the men. We visited

many houses, which the enemy had pillaged the day before, and captured some negroes. We found a most respectable man (Captain Smith) and his family still living on their place, but subject to the threats, annoyances, robberies, and abuses of these unprincipled foes, who threatened their lives, as well as to burn their property, on the ground of their being secessionists. After leaving his house I addressed a letter to Col. Phelps, in command at Newport News, calling his attention to this improper and uncivilized conduct, and stating to him that it was not to be expected that the courtesy and humanity that had characterized our treatment of those who had fallen into our hands would continue if such conduct on the part of his officers and men was longer tolerated. I am satisfied this savage and cruel course towards individuals is in pursuance of orders from Washington, and in most cases to the disgust of the respectable portion of the officers, who are obliged to carry them out.
I leave Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux, with his battalion, here, and Stan-ard?s battery, with instructions to fortify his flanks and front, and to hold this position. I am in hopes that the demonstration of force made on this road now will rid the inhabitants, at least for a time, of the presence of the enemy.
The traitors in the neighborhood of Fort Monroe, through which we were compelled to march, no doubt communicated the fact as soon as we passed, for about daylight signal-guns were fired from the fort to give warning to Newport News.

While this matter is undecided, I would recommend that you adopt such measures as may be in your power to allay the apprehensions of the enemy as to the occupation by us of either point. Before breaking ground at the point that you may select for the battery, it will be necessary to have everything in readiness for its speedy construction and a sufficient covering force prepared for its protection. I will endeavor to send you another regiment as soon as one is available, and have to request that you will endeavor to recruit your force from volunteers of the surrounding counties.

To erect a battery there would be for the purpose of preventing the passage of the enemy’s vessels up the Potomac$ which, so long as we hold our present positions above, and can continue to hold them, is a matter of very little consequence. Nevertheless, the enemy must never be permitted to occupy and fortify the point themselves 5 and therefore, to prevent this, it will be necessary for you to keep a vigilant eye upon his movements, and to repel any attempt of the kind.

Sir: I have the honor to report that, while fortifying Young’s Mills and the mouth of Warwick Biver, on July 2, reports reached me that the enemy at Newport News Point, having been re-enforced from Fort Monroe, in consequence of our advance, would probably attack the position before I could make it secure, it being only eleven miles distant by land and an hour’s voyage by water. I therefore ordered down the Fifth Louisiana and Sixth Georgia Begiments, and placed them in reserve at and near Warwick Court-House, about two miles in the rear of Young’s Mills. I strengthened this place then by erecting intrench-men ts for guns and breastworks for men both at the mouth of Warwick Biver and in rear of the marsh connecting Young’s Mills with the mouth of the river.
On the 3d, late in the day, I received positive information that the enemy was passing large bodies of troops, with an extensive park of artillery, over Hampton Creek, and, as I had made Young’s Mills quite strong, 1 ordered several regiments to move, by a flank, to Harrod’s Mills, on the York road, placing the Georgia and Alabama battalions in a deep forest between the two positions, so as to render support to either.
I left Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux in command at Young’s Mills, with his own battalion of five hundred men, one company of rifles, two pieces of artillery, and one troop of cavalry, with written instructions as to the course he should pursue in any case that could occur. I proceeded then to Harrod’s Mills and commenced fortifying it. At 9 o’clock I heard that Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux had determined to go in person down on the Warwick road, near Newport News, to cut off parties of the enemy that might come out the next morning. I regretted to hear it, as I left him in charge of the important post at Young’s Mills. However, it was too late to prevent it, and early the next morning I received the intelligence that he had been killed in a skirmish with an advance party of the enemy, who, after one or two fires, fled, leaving our men in possession of the field, with a loss of two killed and one wounded on our side; that of the enemy not known precisely, but supposed to be four killed and wounded.*
Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux was a gallant officer and accomplished gentleman. His loss is much lamented by all the regimental officers as well as myself, and is deplored by his battalion. His remains were buried, with religious ceremonies and military honors, to-day, as well as those of Private Hackett. Subsequently metallic coffins arrived from Bichmond, and they were forwarded in them to Louisiana, at-

tended by six of his battalion. I mention these circumstances, as they may be of interest to his friends, should they inquire concerning him at the Adjutant-General’s Office.
I received to-night the inclosed letter. It is written by a negro who is perfectly reliable, and whose information has been very correct heretofore. His master, who is on my staff, and who is himself a man of great firmness of character and entirely reliable, believes the statement fully.
I go to Williamsburg to-morrow, and take with me fifteen hundred men. There will be then in and about Williamsburg only thirty-five hundred men, and five thousand here. There should be here at least seven thousand effective men, and at Williamsburg at least five thousand. The ground in front of Williamsburg affords a fine field for the play of guns of great range, and some long-range guns should be placed there if practicable. The place is very weak. There are very few guns, and they are of an inferior character. Altogether its weakness invites attack. I shall write from there to-morrow; but, in the mean time, ask for four more strong regiments, a battery of artillery, 12-pounders preferable, horsed and drilled. If there are no such batteries, then one of light artillery, well mounted and drilled. The road from Williamsburg to Richmond is plain and easy. The landing below is easy, and can be prevented only by the means pointed out by Captain Rives, who presented his views to Colonel Talcott on the subject. These recommendations involve two large guns, one at Spratley’s farm, on James River, to enfilade the landing, as far as or nearly to Grove Landing, and the other below the Grove, to enfilade it as far as Skiff Creek. Below this it is difficult and tedious, and involves a longer march. I am very uneasy about Williamsburg. If the enemy get that strong position between College and Queen’s Creeks, they will fortify it well, will mask their work, and march up to Richmond. Nothing is easier, unless these guns are sent. As to those brought from Gloucester Point to this place, I approve of it, because it was represented by me by Major Randolph (at least I so understood it) that the 9-inch columbiad in question was so placed as to fire up the York River. As the field in front of the old English fort affords a range of a mile and a half to two miles, such a gun was necessary here. Another was absolutely necessary to command the apple orchard, which itself commands all the rest of our position; therefore the enemy must not be allowed at any time to fortify it. This place taken, Gloucester Point falls. These are my convictions. The columbiads were put up in my absence. I respectfully ask to be informed if I shall have them dismounted. I am told there are two columbiads or 32-pounders at West Point not mounted. If so, I would like to have one sent to Gloucester Point. This would save the necessity of dismounting one here. I omitted to mention that I fortified Harrod’s Mills, on the York road, and then, on the 6th instant, I brought back the command, with the exception of Major Hood’s cavalry and one piece of artillery, which I left with him, and at his request sent the two companies of cavalry just arrived from Ashland to report to him. He has gone down the country to-night to try and surprise some of the enemy. After sending in the troops yesterday, I visited the Poquosin River and laid off, with Captain Meade, positions for batteries on the west side of this river, which I will have fortified if the enemy gives me time. I shall inspect at Gloucester Point to-morrow, and then proceed to Williamsburg, from which place I shall write again. While I shall

Dear Gentlemen of Yorktown: It is with much pleasure that I have taken this opportunity this morning to address you all with a few lines, in order to let you all know what I heard yesterday from a black man from our free town, Hampton. He says the Yankee guard is on the road from Fox Hill to town. They will not let any person pass nor repass, white nor black, on the account bf bringing news out of Hampton. All that is in have to stay in, and all that is out have to stay out. Lincoln’s and Butler’s white and black negroes are preparing for York and Williamsburg. They have two thousand negroes in Hampton. They report that their time is up; that they are getting ready to go home. But I heard that this is only a blind; so you all must be on a lookout, night and day, for Yankee negroes. They may make their appearance before my letter reaches you all. Agreeable to what I heard, I heard Samuel and William belong to Mr. Samuel Latimere; John Smith belongs to Mr. Thomas Latimere; Jack Allen belongs to Mr. G. Mears. These four boys are at the Point; so I heard. They ran away from Williamsburg. Jack, so I heard, came down by land, with a chain around him. He says he stole by the men on post while they were asleep with their blankets over their heads. These other three men came on the east side of James Biver until they came to a boat, then came down to Newport News Fort. They were taken there that night, and they put them in one of those tug-boats and carried to Old Point. They were taken before General B. F. Butler. He asked them where they were from. Williamsburg, sir. What have you all been doing there'? Working on batteries, sir. Good! You all are the boys for me; you all are the very boys; you all are worth money. Men, take good care of these boys, particularly; they are not to want for nothing. I will give you three passes to go and come when you please. You all three appear before me to-morrow morning again. You all must not be out the way. We all are going up to York, in short, and we want you all to pilot us up there, and show us how to get in the bateries, so we can go right to Bichmond. So you all and generals cannot be too particular and on a bright lookout. George Scott will be in the band too. Please do not tell this to wives nor servants. Burn this letter up.

General: Since I forwarded to you Colonel Jackson’s report* from Darkesville nothing has occurred worth mentioning. I waited in that position until yesterday, hoping that the enemy might, by leaving his strong post at Martinsburg, give us an opportunity to light. Becoming convinced that he had no such intention, I returned to this place last night, and am now having a few slight field works thrown up, under Major Whiting’s directions, to cover our cannon and militia. The latter are assembling; two brigades were called out, the commanders of which expect to have 2,200 men by evening.
General Patterson received two regiments day before yesterday, and several others are said to be approaching Martinsburg by Williamsport.
The service here requires a few more regular officers in quartermaster and commissary departments $ two more competent to command brigades, and one for adjutant-general.
• If we are beaten here, General Beauregard’s left will be very insecure.

General: Understanding that some difference of opinion exists with regard to the distribution of heavy ordnance between this place and Gloucester Point, and that the recent transfer to this post of a 9-inch shell gun has given rise to some dissatisfaction, I beg leave to submit my reasons for advising that transfer: The lines on the land side of this post are from a mile and a half to two miles in extent. For the distance of about one thousand yards from the point of intersection with the river east of the town to the marsh on the south of it the

[Chap. IX.
country is cleared to a distance of a mile in front of our works. Through this cleared space the roads from Hampton and Worm ley's Creek approach the line, and the ranges are a mile and more in extent. It was along these roads, and through ravines di verging from them, that Washington made his approaches and planted his batteries. Should the enemy bring a siege train from Old Point, or land guns from their vessels, which they may do within a few miles of us, they may erect heavy batteries between the roads from Hampton and Wormley’s Creek and for some distance west of the Hampton Eoads, which will destroy our works unless we have guns of equal metal on our side. I have ascertained that there are two ravines running from WormleVs Creek and the Hampton Eoads, wdiich unite eight hundred yards in front of our lines, and send out two branches, one to our left and the other two or three hundred yards farther to our right, affording a perfect protection to the enemy until within four hundred yards of our lines. They may make their approaches through these ravines without being seen, and at night might construct a parallel which light pieces of artillery could not destroy. To guard this portion of our lines, I made a requisition for eight 30-pounder navy guns of the class weighing 27 cwt., and submitted it to General Lee for his approval. He approved of it, and also of a requisition for four 42-pounder carronades, intended for the line along the march where the ranges are short. Only two of the 32-pounders were sent, and we were then informed that the remainder had been sent to General Beauregard, and that we could get no more of them. I then proposed to substitute for the six 30-pounders of 27 cwt. two 9-inch shell guns and a long 32-pounder of 61 cwt., intending to mount the latter on the old English redoubt in the center of our defenses, and to fire solid shot over the heads of our own men. The advantage of this position is that it commands the entire country around, and affords a very extensive field of fire for a gun of long range. We obtained one shell gun which had just arrived at Gloucester Point, and, hearing subsequently that two others had arrived, I went over during your absence, at Colonel HilPs request, to get another. I found that it was intended for an embrasuie in the water battery not yet opened, and designed to afford the means of firing on a fleet after it had passed the batteries of Yorktown and Gloucester Point and anchored above; and also to sweep the beach for a short distance, not exceeding two hundred yards, above the battery. Considering these rear defenses of the water battery of less importance than our lines on the land side, I advised the transfer of the gun. It is right to add that there were two shell guns at Gloucester Point not mounted, one of them intended for an elevated platform in the rear of the water battery, from which the beach below the battery is completely commanded, and the other to fire up the river, as above stated. The barbette gun is mounted, I am informed, making the tenth or eleventh heavy gun, I believe, in the water battery. The land defenses of Gloucester Point have two 32-pounders, and the ground admits of a cross-fire from these guns through most of its extent. I do not know the length of their line, but suppose it not to exceed one thousand yards. Our lines are certainly not less than one and a half miles, admit of very little eross-fiie, and are defended by two shell guns and two 32-pounders. We have five field pieces stationed here. Three are at Gloucester Point two iron 6-pounders and CabelPs battery of four pieces, which, having no field service to perform, should be counted as a part of the artillery at that post.

G. W. EANDOLPH.

General : I have just been informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, commanding our cavalry, that he has reason to believe that the enemy intends to advance upon us to-night (the distance is but twenty-two miles). The evidences are that it is the belief of the people living near the town, ascertained by his pickets, and that three days’ provisions were issued to-day, and that a United States lieutenant had mentioned it.
We are not prepared beyond the readiness of our men to fight. The field works have not been progressed with far enough to make them useful, and the militia is not provided with fixed ammunition, having received but powder and lead.

[General Cooper ?]
General : I was so unwell yesterday as to be unable to write fully, and therefore trusted to the information contained in the note from Colonel Edmundson,* of the correctness of which, in the main, I have no doubt. Similar information from other sources gives me the impression that the re-enforcements arriving at Martinsburg amount to seven or eight thousand. I have estimated the enemy’s force hitherto, you may remember, at 18,000. Additional artillery has also been received. They were greatly superior to us in that arm before.
The object of re-enforcing General Patterson must be an advance upon this place. Fighting here against great odds seems to me more prudent than retreat.
I have not asked for re-enforcements, because I supposed that the War Department, informed of the state of affairs everywhere, could best judge where the troops at its disposal are most required. The arms ordered by Colonel Thomas for the militia are not here yet. The two generals expect some 2,200, but at present we cannot arm them all, and they have their own ammunition to fix, being furnished with powder and lead.
Most of the regiments which have joined since my arrival have incompetent officers, and are therefore still uninstructed.

Department Headquarters,
Williamsburg, Va., July 9, 1861.
Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I inspected Gloucester Point yesterday afternoon, and found everything in good order; but am of opinion that more infantry is needed there. The enemy can land within five miles of this place, and bring against it a great force. If the land defenses are carried, the navy or water battery falls into their hands, and this battery, though commanded by that at Yorktown, is far the most effective against shipping. I have written Captain Whitt]e to send down the two 32-pounders now at West Point and not mounted, and will send one or both to Gloucester Point. Captain Cabell has only 6-pounder guns. He ought to have a howitzer 12-pounder, to assist in defending the land side. I have also to represent that the enemy can approach by the beach on York Biver in rear of the naval battery, and carry, or rather turn, completely the land defenses. To prevent this, and to properly man the works, there should, be sent to Gloucester Point another regiment, with these additions. I think Colonel Crump will hold the place against an immensely superior force. The 32-pounders I have ordered myself, but desire the 12-pounder howitzers and the additional regiment.
The extreme importance of the place, I think, fully justifies this disposition of means, if they can possibly be spared from other places equally exposed, and among these there are none so exposed as Williamsburg. I have collected, however, a considerable number of spades from private persons in Gloucester, and, after having used them to fortify, in some degree, positions of strength below Yorktown, I brought them with me last night, arriving here at 3 o’clock this morning, and turned them over to Colonel McLaws, who commands here. The Second Louisiana Begiment arrived here last night, and is now at work.
I have carefully examined the line of defense, as established before my arrival here, of which the redoubt, which was being erected when Major-General Lee was here, constitutes the center and main work. The line from College to Queen’s Creek, indicated in the full distance by Colonel Ewell as being only one and three-quarter miles in length, is represented to me by Captain Bives as being three and a quarter miles long. It cuts the city of Williamsburg at about its center, and it would be necessary to destroy more than half the town in front of it; besides, it would require more work to erect defenses on that line than to render formidable the line in front of it, where the redoubt is already finished. I have therefore decided, with the countenance of Captains Meade and Bives, of Colonel Ewell and Colonel McLaws, to erect four smaller redoubts on the advanced line, and these are now being erected, and rapidly.
1 inclose a report of Captains Bives and Meade as to the armament necessary for these works, and beg that the guns and ammunition for the same be sent as soon as possible. The enemy will advance as soon as he is prepared, and that will probably be soon. I ask for the smallest means, to enable me to defend this line with any reasonable certainty of success. The field guns ought to be furnished with horses

or mules, to enable me to advance with them, and to carry them oft* in case the force here should be compelled to fall back. I should be mortified to lose them, but could not help it if the means were wanting to remove them. I know the men can carry off some of them, but cannot depend upon such means for any distance. It is proper to prepare for advancing, for defending, and for retreating. Should we fail here, these guns would or might be wanted in Eichmond. We may not fail, but I am of opinion we have a long war before us, and cannot afford to lose any material.
The work contemplated at Mulberry Island, if that point is geographically situated as represented, would be of the greatest importance in defending this place and Richmond. If the enemy was forced, by such a work, to march up the Peninsula, there are several lines which would at once be fortified, where he would meet with very rough treatment or be repulsed. I think he would be entirely defeated. At present, and without this work, these lines can easily be turned, and landing made above them on James River. If it be decided to fortify at Mulberry Island, no time should be lost, and I would like to be informed of it, in order that I might give my attention to the lines spoken of.
I know the immense demands necessarily made on the resources of the country, and sincerely sympathize with those who desire (as I believe all do) to grant what is asked, but have not the power. Yet in justice to the common good, as well as to myself, I am constrained to add to these demands.

Sir: In accordance with your instructions, we have the honor to submit the following report on the number of guns required for the defenses in the vicinity of Williamsburg:
The number of guns “on hand at this place is two 12-pounders, in working order, with ammunition; eight 6-pounders, in working order, with ammunition; two 6-pounders, to be mounted in a few days. For the works now in course of construction at a minimum armament of two guns to each redoubt, there are required, in addition, eight pieces (12 or 24 pounder howitzers) for redoubts, and three heavy 8-inch colum-biads or 9-inch Daklgren navy guns for shore defense, viz, two at Spratley’s and one near Grove Wharf. Of the eight light pieces required, it is very desirable that four should constitute a mounted battery to be used in operating at favorable points beyond the works and to prevent a landing on the shore in the vicinity. Besides, it wrould be indispensable to protect any retreat that might be necessary to be made.

There are no troops with which you can be re-enforced at present. Two long 32-pounders, with a supply of ammunition, have been sent to you to-day, which you can apply to the defenses of Yorktown or Williamsburg, as you may think proper, and two 12-pounders will go lo you to-morrow, with a supply of ammunition, which you can dispose of in the same way. The facility of the enemy’s landing in the vicinity of the Grove Wharf, with a view either of attacking Williamsburg or Yorktown, is much lessened since the establishment of a battery at Day’s Point, which I hope will prevent their ascending the river. Watchfulness, however, on your part and every precaution must be continued. You can use your judgment as to applying the 32-pounders above mentioned at Spratley’s farm and below the Grove to defend that landing or to Yorktown and Williamsburg.

Colonel : If it is the settled policy of the general commanding to defer the establishment of a battery at Mathias Point, I beg respectfully to suggest that it will be better for me to withdraw the troops from there entirely and at once. The enemy can have no object in landing there, except to prevent our occupancy ;. and, if we withdraw our troops, it will be to them of no more importance than any other point on the river; whereas if we continue our forces there it will keep them constantly on the alert, and give to the point a fictitious importance which, in a military point of view, it does not deserve. We have now there some fifteen hundred men and a battery of artillery, all raw and almost entirely uninstructed. This force should not be reduced if the place is to be held; and, as they have a coast of seven or eight miles to guard, picket duties occupy them so constantly, that they have very little time and less disposition to drill. My wish is to bring them here, where they will be available for service, without having to perform a march of thirty-five miles, and where, under my supervision, the raw material can be converted into soldiers.

General : Your letter of the 10th instant has just been received. It is not the intention at present to establish a battery at Mathias Point, nor until everything is prepared, guns, troops, &c., for its speedy erection. It is, therefore, desirable, as you have already been advised, to allay the enemy’s anxiety in reference to that point. Had troops never been posted there, I think it probable, as you state, that it would be viewed as of no more importance than other points on the river. But their attention having been attracted to it, and as it must be known to exercise a command over the rivef, I now fear, if not held by us, it will be seized by them and defended by intrenchments which it might be difficult for us to capture. If it was known that there was no intention of constructing batteries there, their apprehensions on this subject might be allayed and the troops withdrawn for the present; and perhaps, by keeping the troops put of sight, and setting a vigilant watch, prepared at any time to prevent its occupation and intrenchment, it might be all that was necessary. But upon this point you must exercise your own judgment, taking especial care to retain the point in our own possession.

I am gratified to learn, from your inspection at Gloucester Point, of the good order that exists there. The facility for landing a large force by the enemy, for the purpose of carrying the water battery, has kept me anxious for the safety of that position, and I am glad you concur in the importance of holding and strengthening it. If possessed by the enemy, the navigation of York Eiver will be open to him. 1 had hoped that you would have been able to have re-enforced its garrision by troops drawn from the surrounding counties. Though anxious to do so, I am without the means of sending there more troops at present. In case of an attack on that point it will be necessary for you to re-enforce it from Yorktown. The last two 12-pounders that are mounted have been sent to you, and two 24-pounder howitzers will be sent to you next Tuesday, and some 42-pounder carronades as soon as carriages can be provided for them. I hope you will urge forward the completion of all the earthworks for the defense of that place, and arm them as well as you can. I will send an additional regiment as soon as one is available. As regards the defenses of Williamsburg, I hope you will push forward their completion on the plan adopted by you, and use in its armament such guns as you now have. The eight 24-x>ounder howitzers which you require will be forwarded to you as soon as carriages for them can be completed. I cannot now say whether the columbiads desired by you can be provided, unless they can be spared from other points, where they are now in position. I do not consider the guns proposed at Spratley’s and Grove Wharf so important now, since the battery at Day’s Point, on James Eiver, has been established, as stated in a previous letter. It will be necessary for you to make a requisition for such horses or mules as you may require to move the field guns. In reference to the proposed work at Mulberry Point, it will be commenced as soon as its necessity is ascertained, for which surveys are now being made, and, in connection with it, if found necessary, a battery is proposed for the opposite point.
Eespectfully,
E. E. LEE, General, Commanding,

Brooke's Station, Fa., July 12,1861. General R. E. Lee, Commanding Forces:
General: I cannot, take the responsibility of withdrawing the troops from Mathias Point on the condition that the enemy will not be permitted to land there, although I believe that if he does so it will be with an overwhelming force that cannot be successfully resisted by the command now there 5 and as it is too remote to be re-enforced from here and is not a favorable point from which the enemy can begin an invasive march, I cannot see why any importance should be attached to its possession, and this opinion is strengthened by the report of Captain Kennedy, C. S. Navy, that Evansport is quite as convenient a point for stopping the navigation of the river. But why think of the navigation at all ? If we invade it will be ours, as a necessary consequence ; if not, the stoppage of it would not materially affect the strength of our enemies.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Richmond, July 13,1861.
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston:
My Dear General : I have just received yours of yesterday, and am surprised at the extreme inaccuracy of the young officer who reported to you that about 15,000 volunteers, extremely well armed and equipped, were assembled in North Carolina, but were not accepted because they offered to serve for but twelve months. The truth is, that about ten days ago it was reported to me that three regiments for twelve months and five for the war were ready for service; they were all ordered to proceed immediately ; one of the twelve-month’s regiments arrived about three days ago, with a special request that, as they were mountaineers, they should be sent to General Garnett; they were imperfectly equipped, but as soon as ready were sent forward. Another, for the war, came yesterday; it was fully equipped, and to-day has gone to your column. Another, imperfectly armed and equipped, two days since was reported as subject to my orders at Danville 5 it is on its way here by my order. I have written and telegrajihed to hasten the movement of the troops promised and the organization of others, and have asked if they could not be raised that arms would be sent to me for troops who would promptly respond. So much for the fiction of the 15,000 men. The same story with variations has been circulated here, and you will not be surprised if, weary and heart-sick from fruitless exertions to obtain the troops necessary to re-enforce our different columns, I have come to speak harshly of men who circulate stories so destitute of truth. From Mississippi I could get 20,000 men, who impatiently wait for notice that they can be armed. In Georgia numerous tenders are made to serve for any time at any place, and to these and other offers I am still constrained to answer, a I have not arms to supply you.?? I have seen the opportunity which the incapacity of the enemy offered to beat his columns in detail, but have neither had the men nor the transportation to avail of the occasion. From day to day have sought such arrangements as would secure the more steady and rapid advance of the troops and then to leave here to share the fortunes of the Army in the field, but have never seen the occasion when I might go away without leav-

ing everything behind me in such condition as would cause my absence to be injuriously felt.
I will not weary you with details of delay and mismanagement, but I could not permit you to suppose that I had allowed any rule to stand in the way of the one great object of giving to our columns capacity to take the offensive and prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces. I recollect Captain Pendleton well, and when we were all younger esteemed him highly as a soldier and a gentleman. I some days since directed that he should have rank as a colonel and be put in command of the batteries of your army. General Lee’s attention has been called to your remarks about intrenching tools and the muskets which had been promised. He will endeavor to supply your wants. I realize the difficulty to which you refer of a retreat, and feel that it would expose Virginia to temporary, if not permanent, disintegration; it is therefore only to be contemplated as a necessity, and the evil consequences only to be repaired by such a vigorous attack upon the enemy east of the mountains as would drive them across the Potomac, and, by threatening the capital, to compel the withdrawal of Patterson within the strong in-trenchments from Alexandria to Arlington Heights; the results would certainly be doubtful, and if it failed nothing would remain to prevent the enemy from occupying the valley and cutting off the communication between our army and Eichmond. I have therefore resorted to a call for the militia in all the counties north of James Eiver from the Alleghany to the Atlantic. If they come with promptitude and spirit and the sixteen regiments which I hope for from the cotton States should arrive in time, we may yet drive the invaders from Virginia and teach our insolent foe some lessons which will incline him to seek for a speedy peace. I need not assure you that my confidence and interest in you both as an officer and as a friend cause me to turn constantly to your position with deepest solicitude.
I recollect but imperfectly the country about Winchester, and have feared that the position had but little natural strength if the enemy can turn it. He will not hazard an attack upon your intrenchments if he has the little sagacity which would be necessary to show him the advantage of pressing to the rear to seize the Manassas Eailroad, and occupy the strong places in the mountains through which it passes.*

Jamestown Island, Vu., July 13, 1861.
[General E. E. Lee :]
Sir: After a careful examination of the defenses here, I have directed the immediate erection of a redoubt for two guns at the eastern point of this island, so as to prevent a landing there and to defend the mouth of the creek, as well as to sweep the space between the redoubt, half way down the island, and that about to be erected at the point. In addition to this, the battery about to be erected will afford assistance to that on Spratley’s farm, so as to prevent a landing, if possible, on the beach on the mainland, between the mouth of the creek and King’s Mill. To furnish the work at the point with guns, I have directed the withdrawal of two of the four heavy guns now in the square redoubt in the middle of the island, leaving there two heavy guns, which will

do as well to prevent a landing in front of this middle redoubt as the four guns now mounted there. Captain Jones, of the Navy, and Captains Myers and Nichols, of the Engineers, concur with me in the opinion that this disposition of the guns and the erection of the work at the point are advisable. With this concurrence, I have ordered it to be done, to save time, there being but two 32-pounders (57 cwt.) sent to me, to be used either at Williamsburg or at Yorktown, in which I include Gloucester Point. I have but one of these with which to defend the landing at or near Spratley’s, and as a landing there would turn all the defensive works about Williamsburg, it is of the utmost importance that it should be prevented. I therefore propose the following distribution of guns, which do not seem to me to be of much use here, or whose places can be supplied by guns of inferior caliber, viz: 1st, one heavy gun, 8-inch columbiad (now mounted to defend the bridge and causeway lately made to the mainland), to be removed to the work at Spratley’s, and as the field of fire of this gun can be covered by a 6-pounder, to replace this with the latter. The work at Spratley’s will thus be furnished with two heavy guns. The two 32-pounders, mounted on the main work, look up the river, and could be much more strongly placed; one to defend the mouth of the creek, where Sprat-ley’s house is situated, just opposite the point of this island, and the other at a point below King’s Mill. If ships should pass all the batteries the fire of the two guns against them would be less important than if directed to prevent a passage) and it matters not whether this preventing a passage be at the work on Jamestown Island or at some lower point easily defensible, which, if carried, would enable the enemy to disregard and turn the defenses of the island. I therefore strongly recommend that these two guns also be turned over to Captain Rives, who is in charge of the defenses at and near Williamsburg, to use as I may direct. I do not know that Captain Jones, of the Navy, and Captain Myers, of the Army, the engineers in charge, entertain different views from mine on this subject. I do not think it proper, however, to withdraw any pieces from the island without referring the subject to the General-in-Chief, particularly as it will not probably cause more than twenty-four hours’ delay. I consider Jamestown Island as safer than any other place on the line of defense, even after the withdrawal of these guns.

It will be necessary to keep your preparations secret, and do nothing to attract the attention of the enemy to Gray’s Point. Troops will be required to cover the Point and to aid in the construction of the works. I have thought it probable that you could send down Major Ward, with two or more

Should you be able to spare a couple of field pieces, they would add very much to the protection of the battery, until its construction might be completed. They could then be withdrawn.

General : Your letter of the 13th, in reference to the defenses on Jamestown Island, has been received. I hope the additional redoubt which you have directed to be constructed at the east end of the island and the division of the guns in the midway redoubt maybe advantageous. I do not consider it advisable, however, to diffuse your force over too large a space, and it was this consideration that induced the location of the midway redoubt on its present site. I have only to repeat, in relation to the landing at Spratley’s, King’s Mill, &c., that the construction of the battery at Day’s Point and the projected batteries at Mulberry Point, and the one opposite, will render them more secure, and diminish the danger of an attempt upon Williamsburg by that route. NTo means, however, must be neglected to prevent such an attempt or to secure the line of defenses across the Peninsula. We have not, however, guns sufficient to place at every vulnerable point on the Peninsula, and they must be posted only on the most important, and, if carried, the guns must be removed to other points of defense. Upon the completion of the defenses a more advantageous disposition of the guns may be made; but until that time I do not wish the guns for the defense of the channel to be removed from their present positions.

Sir : I have the honor to report that I yesterday completed a personal examination of the country embraced within the limits of this brigade, the neighborhood of Suffolk excepted. Commencing eastward, I find the battery at Cedar Point unfinished. The guns, implements, and ammunition were hourly expected, but, in consequence of changes made in the plan for carriages, several of the platforms now finished must be taken up, and others more complex laid. This seems to me an unnecessary delay, when the guns may at any hour be needed. The battery at Barrel Point still needs at least one 9-inch shell gun, which will render it much more effective. The neck on which these batteries are located is very thickly wooded, and susceptible of defense by a comparatively small force.
I have placed one company of infantry (and a cavalry picket advanced) near the causeway connecting Ragged Island with the mainland. Another cavalry vedette patrols from Soddin’s Point eastward. The headquarters of this company (Captain Gillett’s) is near the post marked u Store.” Seven companies of Colonel Pender’s regiment, with headquarters, are, I think, well located at the cross-roads marked “Isle of Wight Church.” It affords support to Old Town battery, on Jones’ Creek, which was previously entirely isolated. All the roads towards

the shore from the church are good, and no distance exceeding six miles. A road opened by Colonel Pryor brings it within seven or seven and a half miles of his headquarters. The battery at Old Town (four short 32s) is in good condition, and served by two companies of Colonel Pender’s regiment, under the lieutenant-colonel. One long 32 or a shell gun would be valuable at this point. I have directed one of these companies to be relieved every fortnight, that all may be instructed in battalion drill. Colonel Pryor’s headquarters, with seven companies, is on Day’s Neck, one-half a mile or less from the Back Wharf battery. Of six 32s, weighing 6,000 pounds, live only were mounted on the occasion of my visit. The sixth carriage was, however, at hand. Lieutenant Poindexter, in charge of this battery, has gone to Norfolk for the complete equipment of this battery. It is served by companies of Colonel Pryor’s regiment near by. This battery commands the inner channel only. Burwell’s Bay may be reached by the outer channel. I have stationed a company of Colonel Pryor’s regiment at the Stone-house Wharf Landing, and have directed a breastwork to be thrown up, which will command the shore, accessible on either side of the wharf. I think it very desirable that one or two field pieces (two of the old iron ones in the old custom-house at Norfolk or the iron gun on navy carriage in the same yard, would answer) be sent to this point. Another company of Colonel Pryor’s regiment guards two landings near by, both of which are only available by narrow causeways. Two companies of cavalry guard and patrol the coast to Day’s Point. The roads in this neighborhood are very numerous, and all have strong, defensible posts. I consider it absolutely necessary that a stronger force be posted in this vicinity, and urgently request either that Daniel’s regiment be advanced or that another regiment be sent forward. I understand that Colonel Daniel’s regiment is to be held in reserve at Suffolk. It is of little or no use to me there, unless to fall back on, which I hope not to be compelled to do.
I request authority to establish a quartermaster and commissary depot at this point or near by. The troops here have not been supplied with fresh meat for six weeks. On the representation of the surgeon of Colonel Pryor’s regiment, I have to-day ordered mutton or other meat to be supplied.

Col. George Deas,
Assistant Adjutant-General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : Our present position in this village, the only one in the vicinage fit for a depot of supplies, is exposed and wholly untenable, unless the routes approaching it from the west be guarded at considerable distances 5 and I have been restless in the consciousness that, were the enemy apprised of our real condition, a comparatively small body of cavalry might make sad havoc among us and at least destroy what they might not be able to hold. The trains bringing supplies from Staunton are daily coming up, and as the wagons are needed below, must be unloaded. The debris of General Garnett’s command are constantly pouring in, and what of it is left in anything like organized form will be here on to-morrow or the day following in a most forlorn condition. I fear that, while they must be cared for, they will be almost useless for any military purpose; yet, even under these circumstances, I have not felt authorized to beat a further retreat, thus substituting distances for regiments against the enemy’s advance.
With a view mainly to guarding this point, hoping at the same time to relieve somewhat the panic-stricken people of the country and to revive the spirit of troops depressed by retreat, I am to-day making a forward movement, looking of course to the protection of our rear. The Twelfth Georgia Begiment, under the direction of Major Williams, of the Engineer Corps, who has joined this command, with an artillery company three pieces strong, which I have organized from the elements at hand, will take position to day somewhere upon, or immediately beyond, the Alleghany Bidge. I have also formed a composite command of the Churchville Cavalry, the remnants of the Bockbridge Cavalry, and a company of riflemen, made up from the militia, to which I have assigned Major Jones, of the Forty-fourth Yirginia Begiment of Volunteers, an officer who has inspired me with great confidence. They will constitute an advance guard and will be thrown along the turnpike

road as near to tlie enemy as may be safe, to watch his movements, to intercept marauding parties, and the riflemen, who are familiar with the country, to annoy the enemy from the hills and bushes. This rifle corps, some eighty strong, are the picked men of one hundred and eighty militia who reported for duty; but who, on account of the state of their crops, were exceedingly reluctant to leave home. I offered, upon condition that they would make up this company well armed and provided for, to allow the others to go home for the purpose of reaping the crops of all. This proposition was cheerfully acceded to, and I am really in hopes that an efficient corps has been thus put in the field.
Should this force be deemed sufficient to hold for the present the turnpike pass in the Alleghany Mountains, our entire attention may be directed to the Huttonsville and Huntersville road.
Unless some point can be held upon it with a view to resisting the advance of the enemy, the entire country in that direction will be thrown open and our rear protected alone by the distance over which his column must pass. The people in that region, who are supposed generally to be loyal, are naturally alarmed and calling for protection. I inclose herewith the copy of a note received late last night from a gentleman of high character and great influence, as I understand, relating to that subject.
It is hardly necessary to add that, with but two regiments which have not been seriously demoralized by the disasters of the late conflicts with the enemy, the force here is altogether too weak for the necessities of the time.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. E. JACKSON, Brigadier- General, Commanding.

General: You are assigned to the command of the Northwestern Army, and it is important that you join it without delay. Brig. Gen. H. R. Jackson, now in command of the forces, was at Monterey when last heard from, and he will give you all the information relative to previous operations, the state of the troops, country, &c. You will perceive the necessity of preventing the advance of the enemy, and the importance of restraining him the other side of the Alleghany Ridge. For this purpose you will occupy such passes as in your judgment will effect the object, and your attention is particularly called to the defense of the road leading from Huttonsville (where the enemy is said to be now stationed), through Mailing’s Bottom to Huntersville, and the Warm Springs to Millborough, on the Virginia Central Railroad. In addition to the force you will find at Monterey and on the march from Staunton, Brigadier-General Floyd has been directed to move with his brigade upon Covington.

A union of all the forces in the West can thus be effected for a decisive blow, and, when in your judgment proper, it will be made. Such supplies as you cannot procure in your vicinity will be forwarded from Staunton and this place.

Manassas, July 21,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General, Richmond:
Night has closed upon a hard-fought field. Our forces have won a glorious victory. The enemy was routed and fled precipitately, abandoning a very large amount of arms, munitions, knapsacks, and baggage. The ground was strewn for miles with those killed, and the farm-houses and the ground around were filled with his wounded. The pursuit was continued along several routes towards Leesburg and Centreville, until darkness covered the fugitives. We have captured several field batteries and regimental standards, and one U. S. flag. Many prisoners have been taken. Too high praise cannot be bestowed, whether for the skill of the principal officers or for the gallantry of all the troops. The battle was mainly fought on our left, several miles from our field works. Our force engaged them not exceeding fifteen thousand 5 that of the enemy estimated at thirty-five thousand.

General W. W. Loring, Commanding Army of the Northwest : General : In my letter of yesterday I directed your attention to the importance of occupying the strong passes on the roads leading to Staunton and Millborough, to prevent the enemy reaching the Virginia Central Railroad. The selection of those passes is, of course, left to your judgment; but, should General McClellan not have advanced beyond the Tygart’s River Valley, the occupation of the Cheat Mountain, on the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike, and the Middle Mountain, on the Huttonsville and Huntersville Turnpike, will hold those roads, from such information as I am able to get, against a large force. The route to Middle Mountain, I am told, is best by Millborough Depot, Pocahontas Court-House, &c., and you are authorized to call upon Pocahontas and Greenbrier Counties for volunteers to hold Middle Mountain, or other passes, and to aid you in driving back the invaders.

You are desired, in the event of their not reaching Staunton before you leave, to give orders to Maj. M. G. Harman as to their disposition. If you find it necessary to move troops on the Warm Springs road, to get them in position on the Huntersville and Huttonsville Turnpike, for the defense of Elk Mountain or the Middle Mountain, to prevent the enemy seizing that road, and thus reaching the Virginia Central Railroad, you may find it advantageous to send the Tennessee regiments to Millborough. Maj. M. G. Harman, at Staunton, will make arrangements on your order. Very respectfully, &c.,

His Excellency the Governor,
Through Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir: I have the honor to state that I have called into service, by proclamation (nearly a month previous to the governor’s proclamation), the militia of James City, York, Warwick, and Elizabeth City Counties, these four counties embracing the One-hundred-and-fifteenth and Sixty-eighth Regiments. This proclamation was prompted by the exigencies of the service, and in consequence of the fact that I thought it but just that the people of these counties should assist in the defense of their property and houses, and not leave such defense entirely to the few who had volunteered and those who had come forward from a great distance. This was the only means in my power to reach those who evidently intended neither to suffer in person or property during the war, unless forced to do their part. I have in every case stationed these men in the immediate vicinity of their homes, and only required them to meet three times a week, to organize, drill, and be ready in case of an emergency, and in order, also, to ascertain what arms they had, and to know how far they could be relied on in an emergency. In view of these facts, I would request his excellency the governor to officially approve of my act. I shall retain these men in service until otherwise directed, as they are of great use.
I am, sir, very resnectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Unless a considerable force be at once put upon the road from Millborough, through Huntersville, towards Huttonsville, the enemy will overrun Pocahontas and get possession of the Central Railroad. There is good reason for believing that he is now upon Middle Mountain, twenty-five miles only beyond Huntersville, and we have but one regiment (Colonel Lee’s) on the road to meet him. I shall do what I possibly can to support Colonel Lee from this point; but Monterey is equidistant with Millborough from Huntersville. It is unfortunate that one of the regiments, with the artillery, now in motion from Staunton, had not been sent, in accordance with my suggestion, up to Millborough. I have dispatched Captain Cole, C. S. Army, to Huntersville, for the purpose of collecting and reporting reliable information, and of providing for transporting and provisioning the forces which may be sent in that direction, although the prospect of obtaining provisions or transportation there is very limited.

maintaining our position in Northwestern Virginia, by learning this afternoon that attention has been effectively directed to the line from Huttonsville to the Central Railroad at Millborough. In justice to myself I inclose herewith copies of correspondence,* to show that from the first my eye has been fixed upon this necessity, and to refer to the fact that, when I was here with but two regiments, upon which any reliance whatsoever could be placed, and before I was joined even by the shattered wrecks of General Garnett’s command, I dispatched one of those regiments to operate alone upon that line.
The copy of my order to Capt. Robert G. Cole will show that I have already dispatched him, with as plenary power as I could give, to make arrangements at Huntersville for the transportation and provisioning of the troops which may be put in motion from Millborough.
While the information contained in the letter of Mr. Skeen, as to the occupancy of Middle Mountain by the enemy, may be premature, it cannot be questioned, I think, that such is now the destination of the main body of his forces; whether with an eye to the Central Railroad, or to taking General Wise in the rear, remains still to be seen.
A very intelligent officer, Captain Hall, one of our recently released prisoners, while in the enemy’s camp, had intimate intercourse with General Rosecrans, who told him that by means of telegraphic and railroad facilities General McClellan could at any time concentrate troops, even to the amount of fifty thousand, in Northwestern Virginia. Rosecrans also said that they were on the lookout for Wise.
The Fourteenth Indiana Regiment, with one thousand and ten men, occupy the top of Cheat Mountain, with two regiments at its western base. The enemy have in all five hundred cavalry, armed with sabers, carbines, and navy revolvers, and twenty-six pieces of artillery, comprising a battery from the old Regular Army. All of his troops are admirably armed and equipped. The time of service of the Eighth and Tenth Indiana Regiments expires this month, and they are all going home, saying that they have had enough of it, and apparently shocked by the carnage on Rich Mountain.
I regret to say that the condition of the command of the late General Garnett is improving but slowly, if at all, the weather being far from propitious. I am greatly embarrassed by the sick and discontented. In fact, I must say that I scarcely know what disposition to make of them. From this remark, however, the regiments of Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson and Fulkerson (Thirty-seventh Virginia Volunteers) are to be excepted, and, while they are undoubtedly suffering to a very great extent, those able officers keep them up to their duty, maintaining their organization intact, and I am troubled with but few complaints from the men.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I have sent Colonel Lee upon that line. He will be in Huntersville to-day, and must be supported, or all in that direction is lost. It is unfortunate that my idea of sending in that direction at least one of the regiments now on the road to this point had not been adopted. But it may not be too late, if any reliance whatever can be placed upon the people of the country and we can act with sufficient promptness.
I send Captain Cole to-day to Huntersville to look to the transportation and provisioning of the column which should move on that line ; but the prospect of obtaining an adequate supply is slight indeed.
Send a courier back to me at once, with a statement of what can be done and upon what I can rely in the premises; and you had best direct energetic attention to Millborough as a grand base of operations.
Yery respectfully,

Monterey, Fa., July 22, 1861. Maj. M. Gr. Harman, Quartermaster, Staunton, Va.:
Sir : In response to your favor of this day, I would simply refer you to my previous correspondence in reference to the propriety of starting a column upon the Huntersville and Huttonsville turnpike from Millborough, Central Railroad as its base of supplies, and I had inferred from your favor of July 20 that you concurred with me in that opinion, and had already urged it by telegraph upon the President. Grieved to find that my suggestion had not been adopted, and that no regiment had been sent by the way of Millborough to support Colonel Lee, and confirmed in the correctness of my judgment by the recent reported movements of the enemy, I forwarded to you a telegraphic dispatch to-day, looking to the same end, addressed to headquarters, and desired that you should send all available forces at Staunton at once to Millborough. This would seem to make my response to your letter of this date unnecessary. But I am apprehensive that not to respond at once may possibly occasion some delay in a movement which appears to me to be all-important. I must beg, therefore, to insist that any troops designed for military operations in Northwestern Virginia shall be sent, until further notice, by the way of Millborough to their destination. In answer to your inquiry as to what disposition is to be made of the stragglers from the regiments which have suffered so greatly in the retreat from Laurel Hill, I must refer you for instruction to the Commander-in-Chief.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HENRY R. JACKSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

lery. With this force I desire you to repress marauding parties of the* enemy $ to sweep the country of negroes from Back Biver and near Newport News to Harrod’s and Young’s Mills, below which line no negroes, unless attached to the Army, shall be allowed to go. I wish also to destroy or capture all parties of the enemy which may venture far from their posts and works. If the negroes in the Back Biver region and on the James Biver can be surprised and captured at night or by day by small parties of troops who know the country, and they are willing to undertake it, let them do it, supported by cavalry, infantry, or both, stationed at proper distances.
The instructions as to the disposition, in Order No. 179, herewith,* you need not regard as rigorous, but only intimations of my views.
Should you divide your column, I desire that Colonel Gumming should command that on James Biver, accompanied by some of the best of the Old Dominion Dragoons and Curtis’ company of Warwick Beauregards, retaining for yourself Sinclair’s Company of York infantry. It is desirable that your movements should be as prompt and secret as possible, as in consequence of the two great victories we have achieved at Manassas and the information I have received from the naval officer stationed at Dene [Green] Point, I am under the impression that the number of troops has been considerably diminished at Fort Monroe, Hampton, and Newport News. Indeed, Captain Fitzgerald, of our Navy, who has just come over, informs me that no tents are to be seen at the latter post, and it is stated that it is abandoned. I can scarcely think this, but wish you to send skillful scouts to ascertain it, and other soldiers who know the country, or reliable negroes, to ascertain the state of things at Hampton, and be guided by the results, informing me if these reports be true by swift express. I do not give you detailed instructions, but request you to confer with Major Hood, Captain Phillips, and others who know the country perfectly.
Should you at any time occupy a position at Young’s Mills, remember, at all times, to keep a strong force at the head of the mill-dam, on your left flank, near M. Wall’s house, and concealed in the wood which skirts his farm. Also to keep vedettes on Young’s farm, on your right flank, or James Biver, to inform you of any attempt of the enemy to land there, which is not at all improbable. Kit Curtis’ lane is considered a safe position for troops on the York road, and I was informed by a negro of M. Wall’s that the road from Curtis’ to his master’s house was a straight one, and only about two miles from thence.
Should, upon this expedition (which I do not anticipate), or at any other time during your service in the lower part of the Peninsula, your troops stationed at Young’s Mills be attacked, and you have troops stationed in Curtis’ lane, a march by the latter through the road leading to M. Wall’s would enable you to fall upon his right flank and rear, and thus secure an easy and complete victory; or should you ever be attacked at Harrod’s Mills, and have troops stationed at Young’s Mills, a march from the latter to the former, by Mr. John Patrick’s, would enable you to accomplish the same results.
I state also, for your information, that Colonel Mallory has completed the works at Ship Point, on the Poquosin Biver; that Captain Smith, of the artillery, has probably already planted two guns in them. Mallory’s force consists of Smith’s company of artillery, and he informs me of two hundred and thirty militia.
I desire, whenever you can, that you will give to the late Colonel Dreux’s battalion of Louisiana volunteers (now Lieutenant-Colonel

Rightor’s) tlie post of honor, in order that they may have every opportunity to avenge the death of their late gallant commander.
Inform me constantly of your proceedings, and should you desire re-enforcements, General Hill has orders to send them. Should you find yourself at any time at Bethel, strengthen the fortifications by a free use of the spade and ax, clearing out the woods to the left and rear of that position, and particularly strengthening the work to the extreme right and point of the ravine, making traverses also near and parallel to the intrenched lines, to prevent the men from being taken in reverse. Also strengthen the works at Young’s and Harrod’s Mills, and at Young’s farm, if you have leisure. At Young’s Mills be careful of the road leading down to the ravine, nearly opposite the saw-mill, and station a gun on our side to command it. Before every fight, if you have time, pack your wagons and get them out of the way of the infantry and artillery.
I have heard that the enemy is in force in the woods and ravine just above Captain Smith’s house, on the James River. I heard since that it was not so. Direct the commanding officer who may have charge of the column on the Warwick road to examine it well before approaching it, and have every piece of woods carefully examined before passing over the roads leading through it.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Sixth [N. C.] Regiment,
At Huntersville, Va., July 22, 1861—1 p. m. General Jackson, Commanding at Monterey, Va. ;
Dear General : We have reached this place, but can make no calculation to proceed farther to-day, as the rain has been incessant from the time we struck our tents this morning. Our horses failed so much that it may be night before all our wagons arrive. In the mean time, such companies as have not their wagons up take shelter in the public houses of the town. Our forward movement must depend in a great measure on the ability of our horses to transport baggage. The men, too, suffer greatly from coughs and colds. Our sick embarrass us much, in the absence of ambulances, that might have been used for their help, until applied to their legitimate use.
Mr. Skeen, the intelligent and patriotic citizen to whom you referred me, has aided me very much; and, moreover, has promised to make me a correct map of our route and the adjoining country. He, with others, urge the policy of occupying what is called Middle Mountain, fifteen miles in advance of Elk Mountain. Without doing this, a large number of men, loyal to our cause, as well as much property, will be at the mercy of the enemy. Middle Mountain is a branch of the Cheat, and, as far as my information extends, is to be approached by only one road, the one that we may defend. The Bath Cavalry will scout, before tomorrow, as far as the farther base of Elk Mountain.
We shall probably soon feel the want of artillery, and respectfully urge you to send it on as soon as practicable ; also an engineer, as you proposed. Our depot is not yet determined on 5 as soon as it is, I shall have the honor of again communicating with you.
With great respect, your obedient servant,

P. S.—I had written the above before the arrival of Major Byrd, who handed me your letter. Mr. Skeen expressed decidedly the opinion

that the enemy will advance by our route, other movements being mere artifices to conceal, if possible, their real course. I fear that I shall lose the services of the Bath Cavalry, as it seems to be almost in a mutinous state, on account of their dislike to their captain. Captain Gammon, however, of the Pocahontas Bescues, will fill his place, as far as infantry can. Our principal danger seems to be from Huttonsville, by a rough and circuitous route, impracticable to wagons, unless the enemy have recently worked upon it, along the Elk Biver, to our rear. Such, however, is the terror of the enemy at meeting our sharpshooters, that I think we can keep them from this approach. The militia of Bath and Pocahontas will need five hundred guns, and I wish they could be sent immediately. I shall employ such as have rifles immediately. Major Byrd, who rode forward last night, is satisfied that we may anticipate the enemy in the occupation of Middle Mountain. I respectfully suggest that the army be brought from McDowell, and be ready at Monterey when the wagons arrive, which will be preceded by Lieutenant Williams, of the Bath militia. You must determine as to ammunition.

Our brave troops must bear up against misfortune. Beverses must happen, but they ought only to stimulate us to greater efforts. I regret my inability to repair to your assistance, but events occurring in our front prevented. I am sure the glorious victory there achieved will cheer the hearts of your troops.
At the first report of the retreat from Beverly, anticipating your wants, I ordered ammunition, tents, blankets, cooking utensils, and shoes to be sent to you. But, unfortunately, they were sent, by mistake, to General T. J. Jackson, at Winchester. A duplicate supply of the articles have been forwarded to Staunton. General Loring, an officer of experience, has been assigned to the command of the Army of the Northwest, and he is accompanied by officers who have served years on the frontier.
Four Virginia regiments, one Arkansas, three Tennessee, and two Georgia regiments, and two field batteries are ordered to join the Northwestern Army. This force, with what ought to be organized from the hardy mountaineers, will be sufficient to drive back the invaders. There is a necessity for repelling them, and it must be done. Every assistance will be afforded in this quarter.

Dear Sir : Yours of yesterday has just been placed in my hands (about 7 a. m.), and it will consequently be impossible for me to get the courier back to you by 10 o’clock this morning.
I must still continue to press upon you the importance of sending troops, with supplies and ammunition, as rapidly as possible, by the way of Millborough, to the Huttonsville turnpike. As I have already written and telegraphed to yourself and to headquarters, this point is equidistant from Huntersville and the Millborough Station, and the road thither is a common country road and very rough. Until further notice do not send any more troops to this point.
I do not think that Captain Marye’s artillery will be in any danger whatsoever bet ween Millborough and Huntersville. Colonel Lee’s command will be on the road in advance of him, and between himself and the enemy. At Huntersville he will see Captain Cole, with whom he can confer as to any danger beyond that point. I cannot weaken Colonel Lee’s command, already quite too small for the end to be accomplished, in order to guard against the possibility of danger, and I have no cavalry with me fit to be sent to the Warm Springs who are not upon necessary and arduous duty.
Very respectfully, yours,

General : Your letter of the 17th has just been received and communicated to the President.* He is much gratified at your success, and particularly at the handsome repulse given to the enemy at Scarey Creek and his subsequent ejection to the Pocotaligo. You will have learned of the disastrous retreat of General Garnett’s command, and the death of that gallant officer. It is reported that General McClellan occupies Cheat Mountain Pass, on the road to Monterey, and the Middle Mountain, on the road to Huntersville. Should he reach the latter point, the road is open to him to Lewisburg, to turn upon you or to seize at Mill-borough the Virginia Central Eailroad. An effort is making to prevent his advance, and troops are being forwarded to occupy Elk Mountain, north of Huntersville, and the Alleghany Ridge, on the routes from Hutton sville to Staunton. General W. W. Loring has been ordered to the command of the Army of the Northwest, and it is hoped he will be able to check the advance of the enemy. A concentration of all the forces in that region may be necessary for that purpose, and it becomes necessary that you should look to the security of your rear. Keep your command concentrated, and be prepared to unite with General Loring or operate as circumstances on your line of communication may dictate. You have been already written on this subject by the Adjutant and Inspector General of the Army. There is no objection to your increasing the strength of the Legion, but you will perceive that at this time re-enforcements cannot be sent to you from here, from the necessity of restricting the operations of the enemy, if possible, north of Pocahontas, and of strengthening the armies of the Potomac, which have won a glorious victory in front of Manassas. It was hoped that the good citizens of Kanawha Valley would by this time have rallied under your standard and given you the force you desired. The late proclamation of the governor, authorizing the mobilization of the militia of the State, a copy of which is inclosed, will, I trust, yet give you the troops you desire. Ammunition has been sent you. More will be forwarded. Arms cannot be forwarded except under an escort of troops and on requisitions. The inventory you refer to in your letter was not inclosed. The difficulties that surround you are fully appreciated, but great reliance is placed on your wisdom, energy, and valor. At this time there are no 12-pounder howitzers for issue.

Four other field batteries, of four pieces each, are now nearly equipped. These have been got up by great exertions by General Pemberton, and the caissons and harness will soon be done. One battery is on the coast, west of Craney Island, and the other three still at a camp of instruction, on Tanner’s Creek; and, being fitted up, I can now use them, if necessary. 1 am moving the regiments down, to guard the beach on Eastern Peninsula and the passes on the roads beyond the intrenched camp; and what I want to say to you is, that now I will soon be ready, if we have been able to make any rifled cannon of large caliber, to place a battery, properly guarded, on the point nearest to Old Point—distance to wharf at Old Point just three miles. Their fire will be dangerous to shipping, and will make the landing of steamboats at the wharves there a troublesome operation. Guns might have been established there before, but other than rifled cannon would have had little or no effect, and only provoked an attack, for which we were not then prepared. Hereafter I shall be glad to receive one. Will you please let me know if a battery of, say, four rifled guns, heavy caliber, can be had ? I have heard Mr. Anderson was making some. I make this private, as I do not wish it spoken of. I impress on every one that I have a great contempt for firing at long range, and order no battery to fire until they are sure to hit; but, when I am all ready, I know good rifled guns can damage shipping (not batteries) at three miles, elevation from 16° to 20°) a columbiad would require 35°. Let me have your views.
Yours, truly,
BENJ. HUGER, Brigadier- General.
Hdqrs. Army of Northwestern Virginia,
Monterey, Va., July 24, 1861. Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : The Arkansas regiment, Colonel Rust commanding, reached this point the day before yesterday, and was sent forward yesterday, upon this road, to the support of Colonel Johnson’s command, seven miles in the rear of which they are now stationed. The absolute want of water rendered it impossible that these commands could be brought nearer together, and we are destined to encounter the same difficulty along the entire road from Monterey to the Alleghany. While this may seem to be a cause of serious weakness, giving the enemy an opportunity of taking our forces in detail, yet, on the other hand, the character of the road is such as to render it utterly impossible for any body of men larger than a regiment to operate effectively at the same time. I have no doubt, therefore, that the intervening mountains can be defended by our force, small as it is, against any regular approach of the enemy. My great cause of uneasiness is, that a part of them may possibly be turned and cut off. This is to be guarded against, of course, by vigilance and by scouting; and I am sorry to say that the troops upon which we must rely for the discharge of that duty are sadly inefficient. They are all, both cavalry and infantry, volunteers and militia from this region of Virginia, and, from the perpetual applications made to me for the furlough, not simply of officers and privates, but of compa-

nies and entire commands, I feel assured that nearly the whole would retire from the field if they were permitted to do so.
At Monterey we now have left the commands of Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson, Colonel Fulkerson, Colonel Scott, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hansborough, Captain Jackson’s three companies of cavalry, and Captain Shumaker’s and Captain Eice’s artillery, with three guns between them, the aggregate strength being some eighteen hundred men. It is to be hoped that this will be daily increased by the restoration to health of the sick and the return to duty of the absent. Without tents or camp equipage, and with but the clothing upon their backs, the horses of the artillery and cavalry jaded and galled, this force is far from efficient.
Twelve miles in the rear of us are stationed what is left of the First Georgia Regiment, Twenty-third Virginia (Colonel Taliaferro’s), and Colonel Pegram’s regiment. As they become fit for duty, or, in case of urgent necessity, they will be ordered again to advance. I am sorry to say th°jt the Georgia regiment seems to have been almost wholly disorganized, and that what I said in praise of their conduct upon the retreat of General Garnett was not warranted by the facts.
Despite the weakness of our column upon this line, as compared with the strength of the enemy, I have not hesitated to order Colonel Gil-ham, with two regiments and a battalion of four companies (who arrived on yesterday), to proceed at once to Huntersville, to the support of Colonel Lee, upon the Huttonsville turnpike. You will perceive, from the letter of that most efficient officer of the 22d instant, that he had arrived at Huntersville, took up his line of march yesterday, and, it is to be hoped, may be to day in the vicinity of Middle Mountain. I must confess that I feel no little anxiety about him, and would have been happy, indeed, if Colonel Gilham’s command had joined him at Huntersville, which might have been accomplished had they started, in accordance with my suggestion, from the Millborough Station, on the Central Railroad. Being assured that Colonel Gilham’s commission was older than that of Colonel Lee, I have assigned him to the command of all the forces upon that line.
Constant applications are made to me to furnish horses to such of the cavalry as have lost theirs in the field. I will be grateful to know what course I am to pursue in reference to them.
I trust that I shall be excused for writing so frequently and so much ; but I have felt it to be due to all concerned that a full picture of our actual situation and condition should be regularly presented to the commanding general.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HENRY R. JACKSON, Brigadier General, Commanding.

Monterey, Va., July 25,1861.
Col. George Deas,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that, upon reaching here, I found the command very much scattered, and I am now endeavoring to concentrate it at points of strength near the Alleghany and on the turnpike from Millborough to Huntersville. Before my arrival General Jackson had forwarded two regiments of infantry in the direction of Elk Mountain. We have no positive information of their reaching it, but we have heard indirectly that Colonel Lee had succeeded in getting to Middle Mountain, and was in position. I shaii push forward re-enforcements to him, and thus secure the turnpike and Central Bailroad in that direction. I shall also re-enforce Colonel Johnson, who is in position on the Alleghany Mountains, which is not thought to be a very strong one.
No information has been received from Generals Wise or Eloyd, except a rumor that the former had been victorious in a fight with the enemy, and that McClellan had sent Colonel McCook, with one regiment of infantry and a battery of artillery, to meet General Wise. Should Generals Wise and Floyd be delayed, it will be very necessary to send additional forces to this point and Huntersville, in order to secure beyond doubt the pass of the Alleghany and the turnpike leading to the Central Boad. This is rendered more necessary in consequence of the utter demoralization of Colonel Bamsey’s regiment of Georgia volunteers. Two other regiments are somewhat in the same condition. Upon my arrival at Staunton, day before yesterday, I there found a large number of officers and several hundred men belonging to Colonel Bamsey’s and to other regiments, with leaves of absence to visit Georgia and other places. I immediately countermanded all of the furloughs, and ordered a competent officer stationed there to take charge of them, and to permit neither officer nor man to leave without authority from me. En route from Staunton I passed large numbers on the road, and was told that the farm houses on the road were filled with them. This is in consequence of Colonel Bamsey—stationed by General Jackson some ten miles below this point—having given his entire regiment leaves of absence. I have directed that every effort be made to concentrate them, but it may now be impossible to do so. I have ordered the arrest of Colonel Bamsey. At the latest dates neither the Tennessee nor Georgia regiments of infantry, nor the Georgia battery of artillery, which were assigned to this army, had reached Staunton.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Your course has been very judicious in not planting a battery opposite Fort Monroe before prepared to maintain it and make it effective. If you are in that condition now, the time has arrived for its establishment, and you are authorized to do it at once. I will next week send you two 8-inch columbiads, rifled, the guns being of the weight and size of the 9-inch, and they will be followed in a few days, I hope, by two of 9-inch caliber, rifled, but of the 10-inch size. The carriages for the first two named, with traverse plates, are ready, though the guns are not, the machinery ior that caliber not being perfected. Make your arrangements and inform me of your facilities for constructing carriages and what else you require that I can supply. Take every precaution for the security of the men at the battery. Select your officers and men, and be prepared for strenuous resistance by the enemy. The co-operation of the Navy will be requested, at your demand. Keep your arrangements secret, until you choose to disclose them.

Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes,
Commanding at Fredericksburg, Brooked Station, Va.:
General : I regret to learn that the proposed construction of the batteries at the mouth of the Rappahannock at this time will interfere with your arrangements. I had hoped it would occupy time that could be thus advantageously used. I have, however, submitted the questions to the President, who, concurring in the general advantages of occupying the Potomac, thinks it more prudent first to shut up the Rappahannock. I shall not enter into the arguments bearing on the questions at this time, as they will no doubt present themselves to you, but will merely state that the latter object is one of defense, not merely of the banks of the river, but of the country to your rear; whereas the former is one of defense, to be entered on as soon as you are ready to oppose the resistance that will be offered by the enemy. I do not think the Rappahannock will occupy you long, if the work is commenced with promptness and prosecuted with vigor. And in this view I recommend that you undertake it with sufficient force to prevent its interruption. After the batteries are placed in a defensive position, your covering force can be withdrawn and left to the garrisons you assign them. Two companies might be taken for the battery on Gray’s Point from Lowry, two from the point near by, and two others, probably of those mentioned in a former letter, reported to have been organized. A battery of light artillery will be necessary until some of the heavy guns are in position, and one or more good regiments, as you may determine. The garrison of the battery on Cherry Point can be organized from volunteers from the counties north of the Rappahannock. All the arrangements are left to your judgment. As soon as you get these points secure your movable force will be available for the Potomac or other location, where you must be prepared for their resistance, and I shall be prepared to send you every assistance in my power. I hope you will endeavor to close the Rappahannock as soon as possible. A request has been made to the governor of North Carolina to send you a light battery from that State.
Respectfully,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.

Major : I have the honor to report that I exceeded, in part, the instructions of the general for carrying off the negroes from below Young’s and Harrod’s Mills yesterday. In order to proceed with the greatest security, I moved my whole command, leaving one hundred men in charge of a sick field officer, with my caissons and transportation at this point. I sent picked men in advance to take such positions that the enemy could not leave Hampton or Newport News without my being duly apprised of it. These men were followed by my cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Hood, who whs directed to take the Back River road. Lieutenant-Colonel Gumming was stationed at the New Market Bridge, with two howitzers, his own and Major Irby’s battalions, and a

[Chap. IX.
portion of the North Carolina battalion. With the remaining force I took my position at the junction of Maney’s road, to prevent the march of the enemy from Newport News on to the Sawyer Swamp road, to the rear of Lieutenant-Colonel Gumming.
About 5 o’clock I received an express from Colonel Hood, informing me that he had executed his orders, when I directed Colonel Cumming to fall back. I returned to this point with my*whole command, and reoccupied the same position I had left in the morning.
After dark I sent Captain Phillips, with a detachment of thirty dragoons, to bring off the negroes on the James Eiver side of the Peninsula from the vicinity of Newport News.
Captain Phillips returned this morning, having executed his orders with the skill and promptness for which he has been commended. One negro escaped from him by jumping out of a window. He was shot at by the guard, but escaped unhurt.
I have the honor to inclose herewith a list of negroes furnished me by Colonel Hood. I would especially call the attention of the commanding general to the necessity of closely guarding the negroes taken from the James River side. They have been constantly in communication with the enemy, and evinced the strongest dislike to being taken.
Whilst in position yesterday the enemy moved out of Hampton in considerable force, leading me to believe that perhaps they contemplated an attack on my command. They passed on to Newport News, although they were well aware that Colonel Hood’s command was scattered through the Back River country; some of them had fired upon the vedettes. Reports have reached me that troops have embarked at Newport News yesterday. I do not accredit this. I am rather of the opinion that Newport News has been re-enforced from Hampton. I would also report that I have duly consulted with Colonel Hood and Captain Phillips, as directed, and with other intelligent officers, as to the propriety of destroying the telegraph between Hampton and Newport News, and have decided that the risk attending the execution with a large force would be too great for the benefit that would be derived from its destruction. It is considered that the position of the force would be extremely hazardous, as it would be between Hampton, Newport News, and Fortress [Monroe]; have but one road to retreat by if forced to retire; and that it would be particularly hazardous, as it would be scattered over a considerable distance at all times whilst executing the order.
A small party can destroy the communication by telegraph at any time that it may be deemed proper to make a demonstration against either end of it. If destroyed now, it would be reconstructed, and so guarded as to render a nocturnal communication with Hampton more difficult than it is now.
I have not been able to gain any information as to the number and the whereabouts of the surf-boats. I am under the impression that these boats cannot be destroyed without passing through the whole of the enemy’s lines ; an impossibility. This opinion is formed from conversations with officers of my command intimately acquainted with all the localities in the far end of the Peninsula.
I have the honor to inclose a report furnished me by Surg. G. W. Semple this morning. I would earnestly request that it be considered at once by the general commanding. Commanding officers of battalions are constantly reporting additional cases of sickness in their commands.
I sent all the spades and axes to Yorktown this morning that could

be gathered together. I also sent the flag of truce to Fortress Monroe this morning, as directed by the general, and with it a cart for the baggage of the officers, prisoners at Yorktown. I took occasion, having learned through the NTew York Herald that Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram was a prisoner at the fort, to request that he might be allowed to send to me such letters as he might desire to send his family in Richmond, and stated the condition of the wounded officers recently captured. Since the burning of the vessels on York River the enemy have kept close in their lines. I think this is due to the strong force under my command.
As soon as I am furnished with sufficient transportation, I will complete my instructions in regard to the rest of the negroes. The forwarding of those sent to Williamsburg has exhausted all the means at my disposal. Having executed these instructions at the most exposed points, it will not be necessary for me to remain here. They can be completed from Young’s and Harrod’s Mills. I will await the order to fall back to that position, unless the necessity for doing so becomes greater than at present.
I forgot to report, in mentioning yesterday’s proceedings, that the enemy made two attempts to inspect us in balloons.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
RO. JOHNSTCXN*, Colonel of Cavalry, Commanding.

Hon. L. P. Walker :
There have been ordered by your instructions to Lynchburg five regiments, three of whom have been forwarded to and are now at Staunton, commanded by Colonel Hatton, Colonel Forbes, and Colonel Maney. These are the three first advanced. The other two are commanded by Colonel Fulton and Colonel Savage. Part of Fulton’s command has already reached Lynchburg, and the remainder, with Savage’s regiment, will probably reach here to-day or to-night. At Haynesville and Bristol, East Tennessee, there are three regiments, commanded by Colonel Battle, Colonel Newman, and Colonel Rains, ordered there from Middle Tennessee. Your order yesterday evening was to forward the two additional regiments expected here to Staunton. Under your telegram to-day I have to ask whether I shall order these regiments (Fulton’s and Savage’s) to remain here, go to Staunton, or to return to Bristol. I proceed to Bristol this evening.

Col. George Deas,

Colonel: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the troops on this line since my arrival:
We occupy (with one regiment of infantry and two pieces of artillery, with two regiments of infantry at the base of the mountain) the pass in the Alleghany Mountains in front of this place. The enemy, with about the same force, hold the strong pass in the Cheat Mountain, distant from our position about eighteen miles. From the best information which we can obtain, they are at several points between the Cheat Pass and Beverly, distant about twenty-three miles. Before my arrival General Jackson had marched a force to occupy the passes on the Huntersville and Huttonsville turnpike.
On yesterday Colonel Lee’s regiment of North Carolina volunteers was at the base of Elk Mountain, eleven miles in advance of Huntersville, and will soon be in position at the Elk Mountain Pass. The Bath Cavalry were still farther advanced, at the Big Spring, twenty-eight miles from Huntersville.
Colonel Gilham, with two regiments, on yesterday at Huntersville, will join Colonel Lee as soon as he can get necessary supplies, which were en route for him from the depot recently established at Millborough.
About two hundred and fifty of the Pocahontas militia have been mustered into service. Eighty of them are now organized as spies and guides^ and are watching closely all of the mountain roads, passes, and paths m the direction of the enemy. Captain Marye’s battery probably arrived at Huntersville to-day, and will join Colonel Lee without delay.
The re-enforcements arrive very slowly. Two of the Tennessee regiments arrived at Staunton on yesterday, and the third was expected to reach there to-day. Nothing has been heard of Generals Floyd’s and Wise’s brigades, or of the two Georgia regiments of infantry, or the Georgia battery.
The very strong pass in the Cheat Mountain cannot be turned near by 5 but, as soon as I can concentrate the forces, will advance upon the enemy from the other quarter.
There is said to be a strong position in advance of the Alleghany Pass, at Yeager’s, near the crossing of the Greenbrier River. A reconnaissance is being made to-day, with a view of advancing upon it.
I have reason to believe that the forces of the enemy have been reduced recently, and I will move against him as soon as it will be proper to do so.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir: General Magruder directs that you will make a call upon the citizens of Gloucester, Middlesex, and Matthews Counties for one-half of their male force of slaves, to finish the works around Gloucester Point. They will he allowed fifty cents a day and a ration for each negro man during the time he is at work. You will send out agents to collect and bring in these negroes, and detail some one to take down the names of the slaves, of their owners, and the date of their arrival, and to give a certificate of the number of days they have worked. The free negroes will be impressed, if they refuse to come, and a force will be sent to bring them in.
The general directs that the work be made, if possible, impregnable, which he thinks can be done by deepening the ditches and thickening the parapets and putting up traverses. Six hundred negroes could effect this in ten days, or perhaps in five. Nearly eight hundred hands have been procured here in a very short time.
You will consult with Captain Page and Captain Meade in regard to the best method of strengthening the lines and batteries at Gloucester.
You will enforce, if it should be necessary, the above call, though it is hoped it will not be. I inclose the call.

He was informed by Captain Butler that the fire was caused by drunken and disorderly soldiers. From all he could learn he was satisfied that there was still a force, though small, in Hampton. Captain Bryan was received with courtesy both at Hampton and Newport News.
I have also to report that, in addition to those previously sent off, I had five wagons (company wagons) loaded with sick. A report was received to-day, by an outer picket, from a Mr. House, in Hampton, through Mr. Kelley, overseer of Mr. Dennis, that there were no troops in Hampton, no encampment between Old Point and Hampton, and only one regiment at Newport News. I have also the honor to report that Col. C. K. Mallory, One hundred and fifteenth Begiment of Militia, informs me that the steamer which burnt the vessels in Back Biver was certainly piloted, and one person is strongly suspected. I have instructed the colonel to have the party arrested, as also all other persons in Fox Hill who have been passing about under the protection of the Federal Government. I would also report that a volunteer scout, headed by Private W. Causey, comprising six Old Dominion Dragoons, reported having fired upon a party of the enemy on the Slater’s Creek road, near Newport News, and under the telegraph, killing and wounding several. Captain Bryan reports that from reliable parties near Hampton he learned that the man killed was an officer.

General S. B. Anderson, Bristol, Tenn.:
The movement contemplated has been defeated by confusion of orders. You may follow the regiments with which you are intended to operate by way of Lynchburg and Staunton, and take your proper command.

Captain Henderson, C. S. A.:
Sir : I have just learned, for the first time, that the carriages of the guns mounted at Yorktown are made of pine, and that recently, when the first were fired (with a greatly reduced charge), these carriages plainly gave indications that they would give way entirely after a few rounds. You will report to me forthwith what is the true state of the case, and what these carriages are in shape, Navy or Army; and, if Army, casemate or barbette; You will also call on Captain Meade, of the Engineers, to assist you in the examination of them. Beport also the quantity, kind, and quality of the ammunition on hand for each

piece. I desire this report at the very earliest moment, as I shall use it as a basis of a letter to the Navy Department. Have you fuses and powder yet for all the ammunition ?

State also what progress has been made in the erection of the furnace for heating shot. The materials, I learn, were sent down a few days since.
Headquarters Northwest Army,
jHuntersville, Fa., July 30, 1861. Col. George Deas, Adjutant-General, &c.:
Colonel : Upon reaching here I find the country is very scarce of supplies, and that it will be necessary for us to rely mostly upon Staunton and Bichmond. Since I reached the command I have put the quartermaster’s department and commissariat in such order as it was possible to do. General Jackson informs me that he has made frequent and urgent requisitions for supplies, and that his requisitions are scarcely filled from day to day. In order to place the thing beyond doubt and insure a sufficiency, I have renewed the requisitions, and have written to the different agents, sending one of my aides to see in person that the supplies are forwarded from Bichmond and Staunton. I respectfully request that orders may be issued at the earliest possible moment for them to be forwarded. I am satisfied, if we can be furnished in a few days, that a successful movement can be made.
Bespectfully, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
W. W. LOBING, Brigadier-General, Commanding, ffic.
Headquarters Northwest Army,
Huntersville, Fa., July 30, 1861. Col. George Deas, Adjutant- General:
Colonel : I have just vseen a reliable man who tells me that he was in General Wise’s camp last Friday, 26th July; that Wise was at Gau-ley Bridge, on his retreat to Lewisburg, about sixty miles distant. He thinks that Wise intended to fight the enemy at Tonrpkins’ [farm], eight miles from the bridge.
Upon learning this, I sent word to Staunton for the two Georgia regiments and the battery expected at Staunton to be moved by the train to Millborough, there to remain until further orders.
Bespectfully, your obedient servant,
W. W. LOBING, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
General S. Cooper :
Manassas, July 31,1861.
News has reached here that General Banks has assembled eight thousand men for operations in the valley. If true, can troops be sent by the Department to oppose him, or shall it be done from here ?

Headquarters Cavalry,
Cocldetown, July 31, 1861.
Gen. G. B. Cosby, Headquarters Army of YorJctown:
Major: I have the honor of sending by Privates H. II. and R. F. Elliott, Old Dominion Dragoons, four negroes, belonging to Mr. B. P. Lee. It has been reported that these negroes were left upon his plantation by their owner, and have been exceedingly troublesome to the residents in that vicinity. It is said that one of them abused a lady and threatened the life of her husband. These facts are mentioned that the general may place them under strict guard and not turn them over to their master, from whom they might escape and return to give further trouble.
I have also the honor to report that Privates Joseph and Benjamin Phillips, sr., returned to this place this morning, having visited the town of Hampton. They found it deserted by the enemy, and the bridge connecting it with Fortress Monroe torn down, a picket being stationed at the foot of the bridge, on the other side of the river, which, they were informed by the citizens, threatened to fire upon any one who showed himself on that side of the town. They have authent ic information, also, that the force at Newport News is comparatively small. I am under the impression that it does not exceed 1,500 men, independent of the ships supporting them. The impression of the people of Hampton is that the place was evacuated very hurriedly last Friday, when my command was in that vicinity.
If desirable, this place can be burned now before it is reoccupied by the enemy, without trouble, by a small party. I should state, however, that the Messrs. Phillips found very few negroes in that place. They were informed that they were carried over the bridge previous to its evacuation, and it is supposed they were placed on the works at the Rip Raps.
I have the honor to report that, in the event of my having to remove my command hurriedly, I should have to abandon a good deal of public property here. The means of transportation provided is not sufficient to move the comforts absolutely required by a force of this size, subject to the exposure and labor which the general is well aware has been endured by the cavalry in the Peninsula. On my arrival here I found no means provided for the transportation of the effects of myself and staff, and have taken the liberty of retaining one wagon here for that especial purpose, which I trust will meet the approbation of the general commanding. All the transportation of the post is confined to the wagons assigned to the companies under my command. Every train not occupied in sending negroes to Williamsburg and transporting necessaries from Yorktown is constantly employed in hauling forage from the Back River country. It is considered that this is too much labor for these teams, the average distance that the forage is now hauled exceeding twenty five miles. This will be increased by the necessity of going farther down the country. I should especially request that a regular quartermaster, with as large a train as can be spared, be sent here immediately, to haul off all the forage from the Back River country before the force of the enemy is so increased as to render it extremely dangerous to do so. A small force of cavalry would have prevented our drawing supplies thence to this time.
When I first assumed command at this post I had occasion to make a requisition for horseshoes and horseshoe nails$ these stores have never been furnished. I have the honor to request the interference of the general commanding to this matter, that a large supply of horse-

## p. 1011 (#1027) ##########################################

﻿Chap. IX.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-----CONFEDERATE.	1011
shoes and horseshoe nails be furnished at once, and that an additional force of farriers be sent to me to shoe the horses of my command, many being* unfit for service at this time for want of shoes and the number rapidly increasing. Nearly every horse in the command requires the attention of a farrier at this time.
I forgot to state in relation to the negroes that unless specially directed by the general I will not deem it necessary to remove more negroes to Williamsburg.
I am, major, very respectfully,
EO. JOHNSTON,
Colonel, Commanding.
Bungee’s Mill, Va.,
Four miles west of Lewisburg, August 1, 1861. General R. E. Lee, Commanding, &e.:
Sir: I am here, falling back to Covington, under orders left to my discretion by General Cooper. My situation in the Kanawha Valley was critical in the extreme. After the Scarey affair the enemy fell back and were re-enforced strongly. They increased to five thousand. At Gauley I had one thousand; at Coal, one thousand; and at Elk, and within two miles thereof, about two thousand. Thus divided, necessarily the enemy could attack, when he chose, double or quadruple my numbers, with far better arms and supplies. I found they were collecting some fifteen thousand troops at Weston and moving to Summersville, at the same time moving up the Kanawha Valley and jamming me at any point I might select to occupy. I determined upon a prompt retreat, where my forces could co-operate with Generals Loring or Floyd. In thirty minutes after we fell back from Tyler’s Mountain the enemy took possession, and nearly succeeded in cuttingoff* seven hundred of Colonel Tompkins’ command at Coal. They escaped, and burned the steamer on which they were moving up the river. Save an accident from the defiant disobedience of orders by the lieutenant of the McCullough Rangers, losing some baggage and causing the death of one of my sick and the wounding of several of my men, the retreat has been, upon the whole, creditably in order.
We left Charleston last Wednesday week [July 24] and Gauley last Saturday, destroying the bridges there behind us. This I was obliged to do by the great deficiency of transportation, owing to gross inefficiency of the quartermaster’s department of my brigade. I have come on slowly. The men had been marched and countermarched very much, and were sore and sadly worn-out in shoes and clothing u,nd suffered for want of tents. We arrived here yesterday, leaving a strong rear guard of four infantry companies, attached to two hundred and fifty cavalry. They are scouting the enemy to their teeth. Last night iny scouts reported that they are moving on in three divisions, converging from Fayetteville, Gauley, and Summersville to a point on this turnpike a few miles back.
At Weston they have a force of fifteen thousand, and from Huttons-ville movements are made to join those from Weston at Summersville, to concentrate some ten thousand troops on this road, directly moving on Lewisburg. We will check them all we can, but a force far larger and better organized than mine is as yet must be sent to do it effectually. From Charleston to this place the State volunteers under my command lost from three to five hundred men by desertion. But one man deserted

from the Legion. I respectfully submit that I had better be allowed to reorganize the whole mass and incorporate the State volunteers with my Legion in the Confederate service. I think the enemy will now threaten the Southwestern Railroad at New Berne, and they will make a base line from Gauley to Lewisburg.
The Kanawha Valley is wholly disaffected and traitorous. It was gone from Charleston down to Point Pleasant before I got there. Boone and Cabell are nearly as bad, and the state of things in Braxton, Nicholas, and part of Greenbrier is awful. The militia are nothing for warlike uses here. They are worthless who are true, and there is no telling who is true. You cannot persuade these people that Virginia can or will ever reconquer the northwest, and they are submitting, subdued, and debased. 1 have fallen back not a minute too soon. And here let me say, we have worked and scouted far and wide and fought well, and marched all the shoes and clothes off our bodies, and find our old arms do not stand service. I implore for some (one thousand) stand of good arms, percussion muskets, sabers, pistols, tents, blankets, shoes, rifles, and powder.
Respectfully,
HENRY A. WISE.
