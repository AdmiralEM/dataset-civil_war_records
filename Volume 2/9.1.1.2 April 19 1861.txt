Reports of First Lieut. R. Jones, Mounted Rifles, U.S. Army.

Chambersburg, April 19,1861.
Finding my position untenable, shortly after 10 oâ€™clock last night I destroyed the arsenal, containing 15,000 stand of arms, and burned up the armory building proper, and under cover of the night withdrew my command almost in the presence of twenty five hundred or three thousand troops. This was accomplished with but four casualties. I believe the destruction must have been complete. I will await orders at Carlisle.
R. JONES.
General Winfield Scott.
