﻿PREFACE.
By an act approved June 23,1874, Congress made an appropriation “ to enable the Secretary of War to begin the publication of the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, both of the Union and Confederate Armies,?^and directed him “ to have copied for the Public Printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order.”
Appropriations for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16,1880, has provided “ for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10,000 copies of a compilation of the Official Records (Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year”) and that “of said number, 7,000 copies shall be for the use of the. House of Representatives, 2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, and 1,000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments.”
This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.
The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:
The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Soufhern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence, orders, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed, is to be accompanied by an Atlas.
In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &e., not embraced in the “reports” proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate) in chronological order.
The 2d Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners.

PREFACE.
The 3d Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specially to the subjects of the first and second series. It will set forth the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in-Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities.
The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and Confederate authorities given in that series.

Colonel: I have the honor to report that I have just- completed, by the blessing of God, the removal to this fort of all of my garrison, except the surgeon, four non-commissioned officers, and seven men. We have one year’s supply of hospital stores and about four months’ supply of provisions for my command. I left orders to have all the guns at Fort Moultrie spiked, and the carriages of the 32-pounders, which are old, destroyed. I have sent orders to Captain Foster, who remains at Fort Moultrie, to destroy all the ammunition which he cannot send over. The step which I have taken was, in my opinion, necessary to prevent the effusion of blood.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[Telegram.]
War Department,
Adjutant-GeneraVs Office, December 27,1860. Major Anderson, Fort Moultrie:
Intelligence has reached here this morning that you have abandoned Fort Moultrie, spiked your guns, burned the carriages, and gone to Fort Sumter. It is not believed, because there is no order for any such movement. Explain the meaning of this report.
J. B. FLOYD, Secretary of War.
[Telegram.]
Charleston, December 27,1860. Hon. J. B. Floyd, Secretary of War:
The telegram is correct. I abandoned Fort Moultrie because I was certain that if attacked my men must have been sacrificed, and the command of the harbor lost. I spiked the guns and destroyed the carriages to keep the guns from being used against us.
If attacked, the garrison would never have surrendered without a fight.
BOBEBT ANDEBSON,
Major j First Artillery.
No. 12.]	Fort Sumter, S. C., December 27,1860.
(Beceived A. G. O., December 31.)
Colonel : I had the honor to reply this afternoon to the telegram of the h onorable Secretary of War in reference to the abandonment of Fort Moultrie. In addition to the reasons given in my* telegram and in my letter of last night, I will add as my opinion that many things convinced me that the authorities of the State designed to proceed to a hostile act. Under this impression I could hot hesitate that it was my solemn duty to move my command from a fort which we could not probably have held longer than forty-eight or sixty hours, to this one, where my power of resistance is increased to a very great degree. The governor of this State sent down one of his aides to-day and demanded, u courteously, but peremptorily,” that I should return my command to Fort Moultrie. I replied that I could not and would not do so. He stated that when the governor came into office he found that there was an understanding between his predecessor and the President that no re-enforcements were to be sent to any of these forts, and particularly to this one, and that I had violated this agreement by having re-enforced this fort. I remarked that I had not re-enforced this command, but that I had merely transferred my garrison from one fort to another, and that, as the commander of this harbor, I had a right to move my men into any fort I deemed proper. I told him that the removal was made on my own responsibility, and that I did it because we were in a position that we could not defend, and also under the firm belief that it was the best means of preventing bloodshed. This afternoon an armed steamer, one of two which have been watching these two forts, between which they have been passing to and fro or anchored for the last ten nights, took possession by escalade of Castle Pinckney. Lieutenant Meade made no resistance. He is with us to-night. They also

took possession to-night of Fort Moultrie, from which I withdrew the remainder of my men this afternoon, leaving the fort in charge of the overseer of the men employed by the Engineer Department. We have left about one month’s and a half of provisions in that fort ; also some wood and coal and a small quantity of ammunition. We are engaged here to-day in mounting guns and in closing up some of the openings for the embrasures—temporarily closed by light boards, but which would offer but slight resistance to persons seeking entrance. If the workmen return to their work, which I doubt, we shall be enabled in three or four days to have a sufficient number of our guns mounted, and be ready for anything that may occur.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Extracts from annual report (October 1, 1861) of Capt. John G. Foster, U. 8. Corps of Engineers.
# # # # # * #
Castle Pinckney, Charleston Harbor, South Carolina.—Some necessary repairs were commenced upon this work in December, 1860, but before these were completed the fort was seized by the troops of the State of South Carolina, on the 27th of December.
Lieut. E. K. Meade; Corps of Engineers, who was in the immediate charge, was suffered to leave with the workmen ,* but all the public property in the fort was taken possession of, including the mess property and one month’s.pro visions for the Engineer force. The armament of the fort was all mounted, except two or three guns on the barbette tier and one 42-pounder in the casemate tier. The carriages were in good order, and pretty good. The magazine was well furnished with implements, and also contained some powder. The fort was repaired three years ago, and was generally in excellent condition, one of the cisterns only wanting repairs.
Fort Johnson, Charleston, South Carolina.—The barracks and quarters were in such bad order as to be almost uninhabitable, and a large sum would be needed to repair them. The position was taken possession of by the State troops on the 2d of January, 1861. A small battery of three guns was soon after built, adjoining the barracks.
Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. —Vigorous operations were commenced on this fort in the month of August, I860, with the view of placing it in a good defensive position as soon as possible. The casemate arches supporting the second tier of guns were all turned; the granite flagging for the second tier was laid on the right face of the work; the floors laid, and the iron stairways put up, in the east barracks; the traverse circles of the first tier of guns reset; the bluestone flagging laid in all the guns’ rooms of the right and left faces of the first tier; and the construction of the embrasures of the second tier commenced at the time the fort was occupied by Major Anderson’s command, on the 26th of December, 1860. The fears of an immediate attack, and disloyal feelings, induced the greater portion of the Engineer employes to leave at this time. But those that remained, fifty-five in number,

## p. 5 (#21) ###############################################

﻿Chap. I.] OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.	5
reduced towards the end of the investment to thirty-five, were made very effective in preparing for a vigorous defense.
The armament of the fort was mounted and supplied with maneuvering implements; machicoulis galleries, splinter-proof shelters, and traverses were constructed; the openings left for the embrasures of the second tier were filled with brick and stone and earth, and those in the gorge with stone and iron and lead concrete; mines were established in the wharf and along the gorge; the parade was cleared, and communications opened to all parts of the fort and through the quarters.
The fort was bombarded on the 12th and 13th of April by the rebels, and evacuated by Major Anderson’s command on the 14th of April. During the bombardment, the officers’ quarters were set on fire by hot shot from the rebel batteries, and they, with the roofs of the barracks, were entirely consumed. The magazines were uninjured by the fire. The bombardment dismounted one gun, disabled two others, and ruined the stair towers and the masonry walls projecting above the parapet. No breach was effected in the walls, and the greatest penetration made by successive shots was twenty-two inches. Nearly all the material that had been obtained to construct the embrasures of the second tier, to flag this tier and the remainder of the first tier, and to finish the barracks, was used up in the preparations for defense.
Fort Moultrie, Charleston Harbor, South Carolina.—The work of preparing this fort for a vigorous defense commenced in August, 1860, and was diligently prosecuted up to the day of its evacuation, December 26, 1860. In this time the large accumulation of sand, which overtopped the scarp wall on the sea front, was removed to the front and formed into a glacis; a wet ditch, fifteen feet wide, dug around the fort; two flanking caponieres of brick built, to flank with their fire the three water fronts; a bastionet for musketry constructed at the northwest angle; a picket fence built around the fort, bordering the ditch, and protected by a small glacis; merlons constructed on the whole of the east front; communication opened through the quarters, a bridge built, connecting them with the guard-house, and the latter loopholed for musketry, so as to serve for a citadel.
Means were also furnished to transport Major Anderson’s command, and such public property as could be removed before the occupation of Fort Moultrie by the rebels, to Fort Sumter. Before evacuating the fort, the guns were spiked, the gun carriages on the front looking towards Fort Sumter burned, and the flagstaff cut down. A considerable quantity of Engineer implements and materials were unavoidably left in the fort.
Respectfully submitted.

Sir : I reported by telegraph on the 28th instant that this arsenal was surrounded by a body of South Carolina militia, apd that myself and the command are not allowed to pass in or out without a countersign. Those in authority disclaim any intention of occupying the post, nor do they molest the flag. I asked for instructions, but have received none.
I protest (the disclaimer notwithstanding) that this post is to all intents and purposes in the possession of the South Carolina troops, and also against the indignity offered me as an officer of the United States Army, to say nothing of the annoyance the entire command is subjected to by this measure.
I shall, therefore, unless otherwise instructed from the War Department, make a formal protest against the posting of sentinels around this arsenal, and request that they be removed* which, if denied, I shall consider an occupancy of it by the State, and shall haul down my flag and surrender.
I respectfully submit that such a course is proper, and due to myself and the position I occupy as commanding officer.

I am already,proceeding to occupy it with a strong armed detachment of troops.
I make the demand in the name of the State of South Carolina, and by virtue of an order from its governor, a copy of which is inclosed.

Headquarters, Charleston, S. C.,
December 29, 1860.
Sir: In the morning, after reporting yourself to Major-General Schneirle, and informing him of this order, you are directed to get from him a detachment of select men, and in the most discreet and forbearing manner you will proceed to the U. S. Arsenal in Charleston, and there demand, in my name, its entire possession, and state distinctly that you do this with a view to prevent any destruction of public property that may occur in the present excited state of the public mind, and also as due to the public safety. You will then proceed to take, in the most systematic manner, a correct inventory of everything in said arsenal, and the exact state of all arms, &c.
You will read this order to Captain Humphreys, who is the United States officer at the arsenal.
I do not apprehend any difficulty in giving up the same, but if refused, then you are to take it, using no more force than may be absolutely necessary, and with the greatest discretion and liberality to Captain Humphreys, who is at perfect liberty to remain in his present quarters as long as it may be agreeable for himself, and he is requested to do so. Report as soon as possible to me.

I want a report in detail of what has occurred; of the present position and condition of your command and property; as regards quarters and other accommodations, freedom of movement, and any statements or views in the matter that you may deem proper for a full understanding.
W. MAYNADIER, Captain of Ordnance.
Charleston Arsenal, S. C.,
January 3,1861.
Sir : I received your dispatch last night and sent a reply by telegraph. I will now proceed to make a detailed report of the facts relative to the surrender of this arsenal, which I should have done before but that my time has been fully occupied in getting proper vouchers for the property recently in my charge.
On Sunday morning last Colonel Cunningham marched a strong detachment of armed men into this arsenal (having several days before entirely surrounded it outside of the inclosure) and demanded the surrender in the name of. South Carolina and by order of Governor Pickens. Having no force to make a defense, I surrendered under a protest, and demanded the privilege of saluting my flag before lowering it and of taking it with me, and that the command should occupy the quarters until instructions could be received from the War Department, which was granted.
Soon after, the arsenal and magazine were both opened, and the property has been constantly issued since—arms, ammunition, accouterments, &c.
Myself and men and our families are very unpleasantly situated. There

are some 200 men here constantly, and we are in actual danger from accident when so many inexperienced persons are at every turn with loaded arms. Our movements are watched and restricted, and I would earnestly request that we may be moved elsewhere. The times are so unsettled that I have not issued to my command this month either subsistence or fuel—in fact, we have no conveniences for anything, and all is confusion and turmoil.
I understand that all communication with Fort Sumter is cut off, and that a barge with its men from that post has been captured at the city wharf and are held in durance.

Reports of Lieut Charles R. Woods, Ninth U. S. Infantry, of first expedition for relief of Fort Sumter.
New York Harbor,
January 12, 1861.
Colonel: I have the honor to report that I reached this post at 8| o’clock this morning with my command, having been unable to reach Fort Sumter. I will make a detailed report without delay.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
CHARLES R. WOODS,
First Lieutenant, Ninth Infantry.
Col. H. L. Scott, A. D. C.
Fort Columbus, N. Y. H.,
January 13, 1861.
Colonel : Pursuant to instructions, dated Headquarters of the Army, January 5,1861,1 embarked on the evening of Saturday, 5th instant, from Governor’s Island, at 6 o’clock p. m., on a steam-tug, which transferred us to the steamer Star of the West.
My command consisted of two hundred men, recruits from the depot, fifty of whom were of the permanent party. My officers were First Lieut. W. A. Webb, Fifth Infantry; Second Lieut. C. W. Thomas, First Infantry, and Assist. Surg. P. G. S. Ten Broeck, Medical Department.
On Tuesday afternoon, 8th instant, arms and ammunition were issued to all the men. About midnight same evening we arrived off Charleston Harbor, and remained groping in the dark until nearly day, when we discovered the light on Fort Sumter, which told us where we were. The other coast light marking the approaches to the harbor had been extinguished, and the outer buoy marking the channel across the bar gone.
During the night we saw what we supposed to be the light of a steamer cruising off the harbor, but she did not discover us, as our lights were all out. Just before day we discovered a steamer lying off the main ship channel. As soon as they made us out they burned one blue light and two red lights, and, receiving no response from us, immediately

﻿10	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
steamed up the channel. As soon as we had light enough we crossed the bar, and steamed up the main ship channel. This was on the first of the ebb tide, the steamer ahead of us firing rockets and burning lights as she went up. We proceeded without interruption until we arrived within one and three-quarter miles of Forts Sumter and Moultrie—they being apparently equidistant—when we were opened on by a masked battery near the north end of Morris Island. This battery was about five-eighths of a mile distant from us, and we were keeping as near into it as we could, to avoid the fire of Fort Moultrie. Before we were fired upon we had discovered a red palmetto flag flying, but could see nothing to indicate that there was a battery there.
We went into the harbor with the American ensign hoisted on the flagstaff, and as soon as the first shot was fired a full-sized garrison flag was displayed at our fore, but the one was no more respected than the other. We kept on, still under the fire of the battery, most of the balls passing over us, one just missing the machinery, another striking but a few feet from the rudder, while a ricochet shot struck us in the fore-chains, about two feet above the water line, and just below where the man was throwing the lead. The American flag was flying at Fort Sumter, but we saw no flag at Fort Moultrie, and there were no guns fired from either of these fortifications.
Finding it impossible to take my command to Fort Sumter, I was obliged most reluctantly to turn about, and try to make my way out of the harbor before my retreat should be cut off by vessels then in sight, supposed to be the cutter Aiken, coming down the channel in tow of a steamer, with the evident purpose of cutting Us off. A brisk fire was kept up on us by the battery as long as we remained within range, but, fortunately, without damage to us, and we succeeded in recrossing the bar in safety, the steamer touching two or three times. Our course was now laid for New York Harbor, and we were followed for some hours by a steamer from Charleston for the purpose of watching us.
During the whole trip downward the troops were kept out of sight whenever a vessel came near enough to us to distinguish them, and the morning we entered the harbor of Charleston they were sent down before daylight, and kept there until after we got out of the harbor again. From the preparations that had been made for us I have every reason to belie ve the Charlestonians were perfectly aware of our coming.	'
We arrived in New York Harbor on the morning of the 12th instant, and disembarked at 8 o’clock this morning, the 13th, by orders from Headquarters of the Army.
The conduct of the officers and men under my command during the whole trip, and particularly while under fire, was unexceptionable.
Capt. John McGowan, commanding the steamer Sfar of the West, deserves the highest praise for the energy, perseverance, and ability displayed in trying to carry out his orders to put the troops in Fort Sumter. He was ably assisted by Mr. Walter Brewer, the New York pilot taken from this place.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Capt. G. V. Fox, TJ. 8. agent, of second expedition for the relief
of Fort Sumter.
Steamer Baltic,
New YorTc, April 19, 1861.
Sir : I sailed from New York in this vessel Tuesday morning, the 10th instant, having dispatched one steam-tug, the IJncle Ben, the evening previous to rendezvous off Charleston. The Yankee, another chartered tug, followed us to the Hook, and I left instructions to send on the Freeborn.
We arrived off Charleston the 12th instant, at 3 a. m., and found only the Harriet Lane. Weather during the whole time a gale. At 7. a. m. the Pawnee arrived, and, according to his orders, Captain Bowan anchored twelve miles east of the light, to await the arrival of the Powhatan. I stood in with the Baltic to execute my orders by offering, in the first place, to carry provisions to Fort Sumter. Nearing the bar it was observed that war had commenced, and, therefore, the peaceful offer of provisions was void.
The Pawnee and Lane immediately anchored close to the bar, notwithstanding the heavy sea, and though neither tugs or Powhatan or Pocahontas had arrived, it was believed a couple of boats of provisions might be got in. The attempt was to be made in the morning, because the heavy sea and absence of the Powhatan’s gunboats crippled the night movement. All night and the morning of the 13th instant it blew strong, with a heavy sea. The Baltic stood off and on, looking for the Powhatan, and in running in during the thick weather struck on Battle-snake Shoal, but soon got off. The heavy sea, and not having the sailors (three hundred) asked for, rendered any attempt from the Baltic aosurdc I only felt anxious to get in a few days’ provisions to last the fort until the Powhatan’s arrival. The Pawnee and Lane were both short of men, and were only intended to afford a base of operations whilst the tugs and three hundred sailors fought their way in.
However, the Powhatan and tugs not coming, Captain Bowan seized an ice schooner and offered her to me, which I accepted, and Lieutenant Hudson, of the Army, several Navy officers, and plenty of volunteers agreed to man the vessel, and go in with me the night of the 13th. The events of that day, so glorious to Major Anderson and his command, are known to yon. As I anticipated, the guns from Sumter dispersed their naval preparations excepting small guard-boats, so that with the Powhatan a re-enforcement would have been easy. The Government did not anticipate that the fort was so badly constructed as the event has shown.
I learned on the 13th instant that the Powhatan was withdrawn from duty off Charleston on the 7th instant, yet I was permitted to sail on the 9th, the Pawnee on the 9th, and the Pocahontas on the 10th, without intimation that the main portion—the fighting portion—of our expedition was taken away. Injustice to itself as well as an acknowledgment of my earnest efforts, I trust the Government has sufficient reasons for putting me in the position they have placed me.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
G. Y. FOX

Steamship Baltic, off Sandy Hook,
April 18, [1861]—10.30 a. m.—via New York.
Having defended Fort Sumter for thirty-four hours, until the quarters were entirely burned, the main gates destroyed by lire, the gorge walls seriously injured, the magazine surrounded by flames, and its door closed from the effects of heat, four barrels and three cartridges of powder only being available, and no provisions remaining but pork, I accepted terms of evacuation offered by General Beauregard, being the same offered by him on the 11th instant, prior to the commencement of hostilities, and marched out of the fort Sunday afternoon, the 14th instant, with colors flying and drums beating, bringing away company and private property, and saluting my flag with fifty guns.

Colonel : I have the honor to send herewith dispatches Nos. 99 and 100,# written at but not mailed in Fort Sumter, and to state that I shall, at as early a date as possible, forward a detailed report of the operations in the harbor of Charleston, S. C,, in which my command bore a part on the 12th and 13th instants, ending with the evacuation of Fort Sumter, and the withdrawal, with the honors of war, of my garrison on the 14th instant from that harbor, after having sustained for thirty-four hours the fire from seventeen 10-inch mortars and from batteries of heavy guns, well placed and well served, by the forces under the command of Brigadier-General Beauregard. Fort Sumter is left in ruins from the effect of the shell and shot from his batteries, and officers of his army reported that our firing had destroyed most of the buildings inside Fort Moultrie. God was pleased to guard my little force from the shell and shot which were thrown into and against my work, and to Him are our thanks due that I am enabled to report that no one was seriously injured by their fire. I regret that I have to add that, in consequence of some unaccountable misfortune, one man was killed, two seriously and three slightly wounded whilst saluting our flag as it was lowered.
The officers and men of my command acquitted themselves in a manner which entitles them to the thanks and gratitude of their country, and I feel that I ought not to close this preliminary report without saying that I think it would be injustice to order them on duty of any kind for some months, as both officers and men need rest and the recreation of a garrison life to give them an opportunity to recover from the effects of the hardships of their three months’ confinement within the walls of Fort Sumter.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L]	Headquarters Provisional Army, C. S. A.,
Charleston, S. 0., April 11, 1861.
Sir : The Government of the Confederate States has hitherto forborne from any hostile demonstration against Fort Sumter, in the hope that the Government of the United States, with a view to the amicable adjustment of all questions between the two Governments, and to avert the calamities of war, would voluntarily evacuate it.
There was reason at one time to believe that such would be the course pursued by the Government of the United States, and under that impression my Government has refrained from making any demand for the surrender of the fort. But the Confederate States can no longer delay assuming actual possession of a fortification commanding the entrance of one of their harbors, and necessary to its defense and security.
I am ordered by the Government of the Confederate States to demand the evacuation of Fort Sumter. My aides, Colonel Chesnut and Captain Lee, are authorized to make such demand of you. All proper facilities will be afforded for the removal of yourself and command, together with company arms and property, and all private property, to any post in the United States which you may select. The flag which you have upheld so long and with so much fortitude, under the most trying circumstances, may be saluted by you on taking it down.
Colonel Chesnut and Captain Lee will, for a reasonable time, await your answer.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

If you will state the time at which you will evacuate Fort Sumter, and agree that in the mean time you will not use your guns against us unless ours shall be employed against Fort Sumter, we will abstain from opening fire upon you.

No. 7.
Engineer journal of the bombardment of Fort Sumter. By Capt. J. G.
Foster, Corps of Engineers, TJ. S. Army.
New York, October 1,1861.
April 9,1861.—The four-gun battery on the upper end of Sullivan’s Island that was unmasked yesterday morning by blowing up the wooden house standing in front of it was situated very nearly upon the prolongation of the capital of this fort, and, therefore, could enfilade the terre-pleins of both flanks of the work, as well as sweep, to a certain extent, the outside of the scarp wall of the left flank, where alone a vessel of any considerable draught of water could lie near to the fort and discharge her cargo. It therefore became a matter of importance to provide traverses to intercept the fire along the barbette tier of the right flank, as this contains the heaviest battery, intended to operate both upon Fort Moultrie and Cummings Point, and also to prepare means for quickly unloading any vessel that may run in alongside the left flank with supplies for the garrison.
For the first purpose I commenced to prepare (for want of sand bags) a large double curb of boards and scantling, to be elevated upon the top of the parapet at the right shoulder angle, and being filled with earth hoisted from the parade, to serve for a traverse to protect this flank.

## p. 17 (#33) ##############################################

﻿Chap. I.] OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.	17
For the second I prepared ladders and runways to take in re-enforcements and provisions at the embrasures rapidly, one embrasure being enlarged so as to admit barrels, and also cleared the passage around to the main gate. A large stone traverse was also commenced to cover the main gates from the fire from Cummings Point. The masons were put at work cutting openings through the walls of the officers’ quarters so as to admit a free communication through them, on the first and second floors, from one flank to the other. The battery in the right shoulder angle, first tier, was also being improved by substituting a 42-pounder for a 32-pounder, cutting into the magazine wall, so as to allow the gun on the gorge to be used against the batteries, and cutting away one side of the embrasure, so as to allow the first gun on the right flank to be used in the same way.
The quantity of bread became very small, and only half-rations of it were allowed to the men. The enemy’s steamers were very active carrying supplies to their batteries.
April 10.—Every one, by order of the commanding officer, Major Anderson, changed his quarters into the gun casemates to-day. The work on the traverse progressed well. Lieut. It. K. Meade, Engineers, being placed on ordnance duty, found the supply of cartridges on hand to be too small, and took immediate measures to increase the supply by cutting up all the surplus blankets and extra company clothing to make cartridge bags. The curb for the traverse at the right shoulder angle was completed and put together on the terre-plein at nightfall, and after dark raised up on the parapet and filled with earth, which had. been hoisted from the parade. The working party, under Lieutenant Snyder, increased by a large detail from the command, completed this work about midnight.
The supply of bread failed to-day, and its absence was supplied by rice obtained by picking over some damaged rice, which, while spread out to dry in one of the quarters, had been filled with pieces of glass from the window-panes shattered by the concussion of guns fired in practice..
A second battery was unmasked to-day on Sullivan’s Island, nearer the western point of the island than the one last discovered. It is of one gun, and very heavy—evidently a 9-inch Dahlgren gun, or a 10-inch columbiad.
The enemy’s steamers were very active at night, but no alarm occurred.
April 11.—At early dawn I detected the presence of the floating battery on the upper end of Sullivan’s Island. It is situated between the end of the jetty and the steamboat wharf, where, evidently distrusting her qualities as a floating battery intended to breach the gorge wall at short range, she has been run on shore at high water, and, being left by the receding tide, has become a fixed battery. Her position gives her the advantage of sweeping with her guns the whole of the left flank of the fort, and thus rendering it impossible for any vessel with supplies; to lie anywhere along this flank, while the breakwater in front protects, her from our ricochet shots.
The stone traverse at the gorge has been raised to-day high enough to protect the main gate, and the traverse on the top of the parapet has been strengthened by the addition of sand bags on the top. and sides, and braced in the rear by extra gun carriages. The communications cut through the walls of the quarters are finished, and all the water pipes and faucets prepared for use in case of fire. The third splinter-proof shelter on the right flank, barbette tier, is finished. These shelters are formed of the timbers of extra gun carriages inclined against the interior 2 R R

slope, and covered with 2 inch embrasure irons, securely spiked down. Shot and shells have been distributed to the guns, and about 700 cartridges reported ready. The work of making cartridge bags is slow, owing to there being only six needles in the fort.
The enemy’s steamers are very active carrying supplies and hospital stores to the batteries on Cummings Point.
At 4 p. m. three aides of General Beauregard (Colonel Chesnut, Colonel Chisolm, and Captain Lee) came as bearers of a demand for the surrender of the fort. The unanimous decision of the officers in council was in the negative, and a written answer, in accordance, was returned by Major Anderson.
April 12.—At 1 a. m. four aides of General Beauregard (Colonel Chesnut, Colonel Chisolm, Captain Lee, and Mr. Pryor, of Virginia) came with a second letter, stating that as Major Anderson had been understood to make the remark to the bearers of the first letter, in taking leave, that he would u await the first shot, and if not battered to pieces, would be starved out in a few days,” it was desired to know what importance might be attached to it. The reply of Major Anderson did not satisfy the aides, who were authorized in that case to give notice that the fire would open. Accordingly, on leaving at 3J a. m., they gave notice that their batteries would open in one hour.
At 4J a. m. a signal shell was thrown from the mortar battery on James Island; after which the fire soon became general from all the hostile batteries. These batteries were, as nearly as could be ascertained, armed as follows, viz:
On Morris Island: Breaching battery Vo. 1, two 42-pounders; one 12-pounder Blakely rifled gun. Mortar battery (next to Vo. 7), four 10-inch mortars. Breaching battery Vo. 2 (iron-clad battery), three 8-inch columbiads. Mortar battery (next to Vo. 2), three 10-inch mortars.
On James Island; Battery at Port Johnson, three 24-pounders (only one of them bearing on Fort Sumter). Mortar battery south of Fort Johnson, four 10-inch mortars.
On Sullivan1 s Island: Iron-clad (floating) battery, four 42-pounders. Columbiad battery Vo. 1, one 9-inch Dahlgren gun. Columbiad battery Vo. 2, four 8-inch columbiads. Mortar battery west of Fort Moultrie, three 10-inch mortars. Mortar battery on parade, in rear of Fort Moultrie, two 10-inch mortars. Fort Moultrie, three 8-inch columbiads ) two 8-inch sea-coast howitzers; five 32-pounders $ four 24-pounders. At Mount Pleasant, one 10-inch mortar.
Total, firing on Fort Sumter, 30 guns, 17 mortars.
At 7 a. m. the guns of Fort Sumter replied, the first shot being fired from the battery at the right gorge angle, in charge of Captain Double-day. All the officers and soldiers of Major Anderson’s command were divided into three reliefs, of two hours each, for the service of the guns, Lieutenants Snyder and Meade, of the Engineers, taking their turns with the other officers in the charge of batteries.
Of the forty-three workmen constituting the Engineer force in the fort .nearly all volunteered to serve as cannoneers, or to carry shot and cartridge to the guns.
The armament of the fort was as follows, viz :
Barbette tier: Bight flank, one 10-inch columbiad, four 8-inch columbiads, four 42-pounders. Bight face, none. Left face, three 8-inch sea-^coast howitzers, one 32-pounder. Left flank, one 10-inch columbiad, two 8-inch columbiads, two 42-pounders. Gorge, one 8-inch sea-coast Ihowitzer, two 32-pounders, six 24-pounders. Total in barbette, 27 guns.

## p. 19 (#35) ##############################################

﻿Chap. I.] OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.	19
Casemate tier: Right flank, one 42-pounder, four 32-pounders. Right face, three 42-pounders. Left face, ten 32-pounders. Left flank, five 32-pounders. Gorge, two 32-pounders. Total in casemate, 21 guns.
Total available in both tiers, 48 guns.
Besides the above, there were arranged on the parade, to serve as mortars, one 10-inch columbiad to throw shells into Charleston and four 8-inch columbiads to throw shells into the batteries on Cummings Point. The casemate guns were the only ones used. Of these, those that bore on Cummings Point were the 42-pounder in the pan-coupe of the right gorge angle, the 32-pounder next to it on the gorge, which, by cutting into the brick wall, had been made to traverse sufficiently, and the 32-pounder next the angle on the right flank, which, by cutting away the side of the embrasure, had been made to bear on a portion of the Point, although not on the breaching batteries.
The guns of the first tier, that bore on Fort Johnson, were four 32-pounders on the left flank. (Of these, one embrasure had been, by order, bricked up.)
The guns that bore on the three batteries on the west end of Sullivan’s Island were ten 32-pounders, situated on the left face, and one at the pan-coupe of the salient angle (four embrasures being bricked up).
The guns bearing on Fort Moultrie were two 42-pounders, situated on the right face, and one at the pan-coupe of the right shoulder angle.
The supply of cartridges, 700 in number, with which the engagement commenced, became so much reduced by the middle of the day, although the six needles in the fort were kept steadily employed, that the firing was forced to slacken, and to be confined tQ six guns—two firing towards Morris Island, two towards Fort Moultrie, and two towards the batteries on the west end of Sullivan’s Island.
At 1 o’clock two United States men-of-war were seen off the bar, and soon after a third appeared.
The fire of our batteries continued steadily until dark. The effect of the fire was not very good, owing to the insufficient caliber of the guns for the long range, and not much damage appeared to be done to any of the batteries, except those of Fort Moultrie, where our two 42-pounders appeared to have silenced one gun for a time, to have injured the embrasures considerably, riddled the barracks and quarters, and torn three holes through their flag. The so-called floating battery was struck very frequently by our shot, one of them penetrating at the angle between the front and roof, entirely through the iron covering and woodwork beneath, and wounding one man. The rest of the 32-pounder balls failed to penetrate the front or the roof, but were deflected from their surfaces, which were arranged at a suitable angle for this purpose. We could not strike below the water line on account of the sea wall behind which the battery had been grounded, and which was just high enough to allow their guns to fire over it, and to intercept all of our ricochet shots.
The columbiad battery and Dahlgren battery near the floating battery did not appear to be much injured by the few shot that were fired at them. Only one or two shots were fired at Fort Johnson, and none at Castle Pinckney or the city.
Our fire towards Morris Island was mainly directed at the iron-clad battery, but the small caliber of our shot failed to penetrate the covering, when struck fairly. The aim was, therefore, taken at the embrasures, which were struck at least twice, disabling the guns for a time. One or two shots were thrown at the reverse of batteries 3 and 4, scattering some groups of officers and men on the lookout, and cutting down

﻿20	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap.I.
a small flagstaff on one of the batteries. At one time during the day a revenue schooner which had been seized by the insurgents was observed lying at anchor between Sullivan’s Island and Mount Pleasant. Lieutenant Snyder, Corps of Engineers, who had charge at this time of the battery firing in this direction, directed two or three shots at her with such effect as to put one of them through the vessel and cause her to haul down her colors, the flag of the so-called Confederate States, to hoist her anchor and sails, and get out of range as soon as possible.
One or two shots were thrown at the hulks which had been anchored in the channel, on a line between Cummings Point and Fort Moultrie, to be fired at night if our fleet should attempt to come in. As no person appeared on board, the fire was not continued in this direction.
The barracks caught fire three times during the day, from shells, apparently, but each time the flames, being in the first or second stories, were extinguished by a pump and application of the means at hand. Peter Hart, who was formerly a sergeant in Major Anderson’s company, and employed by me at the time as a carpenter, was very active and efficient in extinguishing the flames.
The effect of the enemy’s fire upon Fort Sumter during the day was very marked in respect to the vertical fire. This was so well directed and so well sustained, that from the seventeen mortars engaged in firing 10-inch shells, one-half of the shells came within or exploded abo ve the parapet of the fort, and only about ten buried themselves in the soft earth of the parade without exploding. In consequence of this precision of vertical fire, Major Anderson decided not to man the upper tier of guns, as by doing so the loss of men, notwithstanding the traverses and bomb-proof shelters that I had constructed, must have been great. These guns were therefore only fired once or twice by some men who ventured upon the parapet for this purpose. In doing this they managed without much care, producing little or no effect upon the enemy, besides doing injury to the guns. At the third fire of the 10-inch columbiad at the right gorge angle, it was omitted to throw the friction wheels out of bearing, and consequently in the recoil the gun ran entirely off its chassis, overturning itself, arid in its fall dismounting the 8-inch sea-coast howitzer next to it.
The direction of the enemy’s shells being from the northeast, north, southwest, and southeast, sought every part of the work, and the fuses being well graduated, exploded in most instances just within the line of parapet. To this kind of fire no return was made. The four 8-inch columbiads that I had planted in the parade to be used as mortars on Cummings Point were not used, neither was the 10-inch columbiad, arranged to fire shot and shells towards the city. The hot-shot furnaces were not used nor opened. The effect of the direct fire from the enemy’s guns was not so marked as the vertical. For several hours firing from the commencement a large proportion of their shot missed the fort. Subsequently it improved, and did considerable damage to the roof and upper story of the barracks and quarters, and to the tops of the chimneys on the gorge. The aim of the guns during the day, with the exception of batteries Nos. 1 and 2, on Cummings Point, appeared to be directed to dismount the guns of our barbette tier. Those from Fort Moultrie succeeded in dismounting an 8-inch columbiad, and in striking on its side and cracking a second 8-inch columbiad, both situated on the right flank. The roof of the barracks on this flank and the stair towers were much damaged by this fire.
The shots from the guns in the batteries on the west end of Sullivan’s Island did not produce any considerable direct effect, but many of them

took the gorge in reverse in their fall, completely riddling the officers’ quarters, even down to the first story, so great was the angle of fall of many of the balls.
Three of the iron cisterns over the hallways were destroyed by shots during the day, and the quarters below deluged by their contents of water, aiding in preventing the extension of the fire. The shots from these batteries and from Fort Moultrie, aimed at the embrasures, failed to produce any effect. None of the shot came through, although one shell exploded in the mouth of one embrasure.
A part of the guns from Cummings Point essayed to dismount the barbette tier on the gorge, and the remainder to breach the gorge, or rather the pan-coupe at the right gorge angle. At this latter point, two columbiads and a Blakely rifled gun fired almost constantly. The effect of this fire on this day was to breach around the embrasure of the first tier at the pan-coup6 to a depth of twenty inches, and to put one shot through the filling, consisting of brick and bluestone combined, with which the embrasure opening of the second tier had been filled. One shot was also put through the top of a loophole window .on the second tier, another through the top of the main gate, and a third through the magazine ventilator at the right of the gorge, falling between the pier and the inner wooden ceiling.
Three of the embrasure cheek-irons that I had placed in the second tier loopholes, were knocked out of place. Several of the stones that had been placed in the first tier loopholes were struck, but owing to the lead run in around them to hold them in place none were broken.
The penetration of the 8-inch columbiad balls from Cummings Point was eleven inches at the first shot—and that of the twelve-pound bolt from the Blakely gun was the same, as ascertained by measurement. The latter, however, threw its shot with greater accuracy, and with less time of flight, than the former. The distance was about 1,250 yards.
The shot from Cummings Point that passed a little over the gorge took the left face in reverse, damaging the masonry of the parade wall, coping, &c., and splintering the chassis of one gun in barbette. As an instance of strength of masonry, I may mention that one 10-inch shell from Cummings Point fell upon the second tier casemate arch, which was not covered by concrete or flagging, and so good was the masonry of this 15-inch arch that the shell did not go through, although it bedded itself, and broke off from the soffit below a large fragment of brickwork.
The night was very stormy, with high wind and tide. I found out, however, by personal inspection, that the exterior of the wTork was not damaged to any considerable extent, and that all the facilities for taking in supplies, in case they arrived, were as complete as circumstances would admit. The enemy threw shells every ten or fifteen minutes during the night. The making of cartridge bags was continued by the men, under Lieutenant Meade’s directions, until 12 o’clock, when they were ordered to stop by Major Anderson. To obtain materials for the bags all the extra clothing of the companies was cut up, and all coarse paper and extra hospital sheets used.
April 13.—At daybreak no material alteration was observed in the enemy’s batteries. The three U. S. men-of-war were still off the bar. The iast of the rice was cooked this morning, and served with the pork—the only other article of food left in the engineer mess-room, where the whole command has messed since the opening of the fire. After this the fire wras reopened, and continued very briskly as long as the increased supply of cartridges lasted. The enemy reopened fire at

﻿22	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap.I.
daylight, and continued it with rapidity. The aim of the enemy’s gunners was better than yesterday. One shot from the rifled gun in the battery on Cummings Point struck the cheek of an embrasure in the right gorge angle, and sent a large number of fragments inside, wounding a sergeant and three men. The spent ball also came in with the fragments. An engineer employ^, Mr. John Swearer, from Baltimore, Md., was severely wounded by pieces of a shell which burst inside the fort close to the casemates. One or two balls also penetrated the filling of the embrasure openings of the second tier, but fell entirely spent inside—one of them setting a man’s bed on fire.
It soon became evident that they were firing hot shot from a large number of their guns, especially from those in Fort Moultrie, and at nine o’clock I saw volumes of smoke issuing from the roof of the officers’ quarters, where a shot had just penetrated. From the exposed position it was utterly impossible to extinguish the flames, and I therefore immediately notified the commanding officer of the fact, and obtained his permission to remove as much powder from the magazine as was possible before the flames, which were only one set of quarters distant, should encircle the magazine and make it necessary to close it. All the men and officers not engaged at the guns worked rapidly and zealously at this, but so rapid was the spread of the flames that only fifty barrels of powder could be taken out and distributed around in the casemates before the fire and heat made it necessary to close the magazine doors and pack earth against them. The men then withdrew to the casemates on the faces of the fort. As soon as the flames and smoke burst from the roof of the quarters the enemy’s batteries redoubled the rapidity of them fire, firing red-hot shot from most of their guns. The whole range of officers’ quarters was soon in flames. The wind being from the southward, communicated fire to the roof of the barracks, and this being aided by the hot shot constantly lodging there, spread to the entire roofs of both barracks, so that by twelve o’clock all the woodwork of quarters and of upper story of barracks was in flames. Although the floors of the barracks were fire-proof, the utmost exertions of the officers and men were often required to prevent the fire communicating down the stairways, and from the exterior, to the doors, window frames, and other woodwork of the east barrack, in which the officers and men had taken their quarters. All the woodwork in the west barrack was burned. The clouds of smoke and cinders which were sent into the casemates by the wind set on fire many boxes, beds, and other articles belonging to the men, and made it dangerous to retain the powder which had been saved from the magazine. The commanding officer accordingly gave orders to have all but five barrels thrown out of the embrasures into the water, which was done.
The small stock of cartridges now only allowed a gun to be fired at intervals of ten minutes. The flagstaff was struck by shot seven times during the day, and a fragment of shell cut the lanyard of the flag The part thus cut was so connected that the flag must have come down by the run had not the flag been, as it was, twisted around both parts of the lanyard. During the night I endeavored to remedy this by lowering the topmast so as to reeve a new halyard, but failed in consequence of the sticking of the mast, which was swollen by the rain. The most that could be done was to reeve the uncut part of the lanyard through a block attached to the topmast, as high up as a man could climb, so that if the flag untwisted and came down it could be immediately rehoisted as high as this block.
As the fire reached the magazines of grenades that were arranged in

﻿Chap. L] OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.	23
the stair towers and implement rooms on the gorge, they exploded, completely destroying the stair towers at the west gorge angle, and nearly destroying the other.
At 1 o’clock the flagstaff, having been struck twice before this morning, fell. The flag w^s immediately secured by Lieutenant Hall, and as soon as it could be attached to a temporary staff, hoisted again upon the parapet at the middle of the right face by Lieutenant Snyder, Corps of Engineers, assisted by Hart, and Da-vey, a laborer.
About this time information was brought to the commanding officer that Mr. Wigfall, bearing a white flag, was on the outside, and wished to see him. He accordingly went out to meet Mr. Wigfall, passing through the blazing gateway, accompanied by Lieutenant Snyder. In the mean time, however, Mr. Wigfall had passed to an embrasure on the left flank, where, upon showing the white flag upon his sword, he was permitted to enter, and Lieutenant Snyder entering immediately after, accompanied him down the batteries to where some other officers were posted, to whom Mr. Wigfall commenced to address himself, to the effect that he came from General Beauregard to desire that, inasmuch as the flag of the fort was shot down, a fire raging in the quarters, and the garrison in a great strait, hostilities be suspended, and the white flag raised for this object. He was replied to that our flag was again hoisted on the parapet, that the white flag would not be hoisted except by order of the commanding officer, and that his own batteries should set the example of suspending fire. He then referred to the fact of the batteries on Cummings Point, from which he came, having stopped firing, and asked that his own white flag might be waved to indicate to the batteries on Sullivan’s Island to cease also. This was refused) but he was permitted to wave the white flag himself, getting into an embrasure for this purpose. Having done this for a few moments, Lieutenant Davis, Pirst Artillery, permitted a corporal to relieve him. Yery soon, however, a shot striking very near to the embrasure, the corporal jumped inside, and declared to Mr. Wigfall that “lie would not hold his flag, for it was not respected.”
At this moment the commanding officer, having re-entered through an embrasure, came up. To him Mr. Wigfall addressed nearly the same remarks that he had used on entering, adding some complimentary things about the manner in which the defense had been made, and ending by renewing the request to suspend hostilities in order to arrange terms of evacuation. The commanding officer desiring to know what terms he came to offer, Mr. Wigfall replied, “Any terms that you may desire—your own terms—the precise nature of which General Beauregard will arrange with you.”
The commanding officer then accepted the conditions, saying that the terms he accepted were those proposed by General Beauregard on the 11th, namely: To evacuate the fort with his command, taking arms and all private and company property, saluting the United States flag as it was lowered, and being conveyed, if he desired it, to any northern port. With this understanding Mr. Wigfall left, and the white flag was raised and the United States flag lowered by order of the commanding officer.
Yery soon after a boat arrived from the city, containing three aides of General Beauregard, with a message to the effect that, observing the white flag hoisted, General B^ sent to inquire what aid he could lend in extinguishing the flames, &c. Being made acquainted with the condition of affairs and Mr. Wigfall’s visit, they stated that the latter, although an aid of General Beauregard, had not seen him for two days.
The commanding officer then stated that the United States flag

would be raised again, but yielded to the request of the aides for time to report to their chief and obtain his instructions. They soon returned, with the approval of all the conditions desired except the saluting of the flag as it was lowered, and this exception was subsequently removed after correspondence. In the morning communication was had with the fleet, and Captain Gillis paid a visit to the fort.
The evacuation was completed after saluting the flag, in doing which one man was instantly killed, one mortally and four severely wounded, by the premature discharge of a gun and explosion of a pile of cartridges. The whole command went on board a steamer which placed them on board the Isabel, where they remained all night.
April 14.—The Isabel went over the bar and placed the whole command on board the steamer Baltic, which started for New York.
April 17.—Arrived in NTew York.
The following observations may be made upon the bombardment:
The enemy’s fire on the secofld day, the 13th, was more rapid and more accurate than on the previous day. It seemed to be directed at the embrasures, and to set the quarters on fire. The latter object was fully attained, but not the former, for only two embrasures were struck— one at the right gorge angle by the rifled shot mentioned above, and the other at the left shoulder angle by a shot from the so-called floating battery, which struck the shutter, but without destroying it or entering the throat of the embrasure. The attempt to form a breach at the right gorge angle ordy succeeded in breaching around one embrasure to the depth of twenty-two inches, and in knocking off a large piece of one cheek, but without disabling the gun or rendering the embrasure inefficient. The barbette tier was not much injured by the second day’s firing, none of the guns being dismounted by it, and few of them struck. The fire, however, destroyed all the gun carriages and splinter-proof shelters on the gorge.
After the cessation of fire, about six hundred shot-marks on the face of the scarp wall were counted, but they were so scattered that no breached effect could have been expected from such fire, and probably none was attempted except at the right gorge angle. The only effect of the direct fire during the two days was to disable three barbette guns, knock off large portions of the chimneys and brick walls projecting above the parapet, and to set the quarters on fire with hot shot. The vertical fire produced more effect, as it prevented the working of the upper tier of guns, which were the only really effective guns in the fort, being columbiads, 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, and 42-pounders principally, and also prevented the use of the columbiads arranged in the parade to be used as mortars against Cummings Point. The shells that struck the stair towers nearly destroyed them, and filled the stairways with so much rubbish as to render them almost impassable. This, with the destruction of the stairs at the gorge by the explosion of the magazine of shells by the fire, made it almost impossible to get to the terre-plein.
The burning of the quarters and barracks produced a great effect on the defense while the fire lasted, inasmuch as the heat and smoke were almost stifling, and as the fire burned all around the magazines, obliging them to be closed, and thus preventing our getting powder to continue the firing. It also destroyed the main gates, and the gun carriages on the parapet of the gorge. But we could have resumed the firing as soon as the walls cooled sufficiently to open the magazines, and then, having blown down the wall left projecting above the parapet, so as to get rid

of flying bricks, and built up the main gates with stones and rubbish, the fort would actually have been in a more defensible condition than when the action commenced. In fact, it would have been better if the chimneys, roofs, and upper walls of the quarters and barracks had been removed before the firing begun, but the short notice and the small force did not permit anything of this kind to be done after the notice of the attack was received.
The weakness of the defense principally lay in the lack of cartridge bags, and of the materials to make them, by which the fire of our batteries was, all the time, rendered slow, and towards the last was nearly suspended. The lack of a sufficient number of men to man the barbette tier of guns at the risk of losing several by the heavy vertical fire of the enemy also prevented us making use of the only guns that had the power to smash his iron-clad batteries, or of throwing shells into his open batteries, so as to destroy his cannoneers.
The want of provisions would soon have caused the surrender of the fort, but with plenty of cartridges the men would have cheerfully fought five or six days, and if necessary much longer, on pork alone, of which we had a sufficient supply.
I do not think that a breach could have been effected in the gorge at the distance of the battery on Cummings Point, within a week or ten days $ and even then, with the small garrison to defend it, and means for obstructing it, at our disposal, the operation of assaulting it, with even vastly superior numbers, would have been very doubtful in its results.
Bespectfully submitted.

Reports of Brig. Gen. G. T. Beauregard, C. 8. Army, of operations against-
Fort Sumter.
Headquarters C. S. Army, Charleston, 8. 6Y., March 6,1861.
Sir : In obedience to War Department orders of the 1st instant I arrived at this place on the 3d instant, and immediately reported to Governor Pickens for military duty. That day we inspected the floating battery now being constructed here. On the 4th instant we inspected the works on the southern portion of the harbor (Morris Island and Fort Johnson), and yesterday those on the north (Fort Moultrie, &c., including Castle Pinckney).
I have now the honor to state that I coincide fully in the opinion and views contained in Maj. W. H. C. Whiting’s letter preceding his full report, and that, as I have not time to write more fully on the subject, I desire that portion of his letter referring to the above works should be annexed to this report, and a copy thereof sent to me for my files.
On Morris Island the flanking defects are being remedied, and will probably soon be completed, as well as the position, &c., of said works will permit. I have ordered that only six mortars, instead of twelve, intended for that point, should be put in position there. I have ordered the construction of a series of small batteries of heavy guns, two in each, and twenty in all, well protected by traverses along the channel shore of that island, said batteries to be about fifty or one hundred yards

﻿26	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.	[Chap. I.
apart (according to the nature of the ground), to prevent the broadsides of a vessel, from silencing them in a few minutes. When those batteries shall be ready, I will remove into them all the heavy guns 1 can dispose of. I have ordered to that island the whole of Colonel Gregg’s regiment, with two short 12-pounders and one light battery, for the protection of said works, selecting a strong natural position to protect their right flank from a land attack.
I have ordered an additional battery (for two mortars) to be constructed near Fort Johnson, to receive half of those intended for a defectively-placed mortar battery, to the south of said work, the latter not being in itself of much importance, containing only an open battery of four 24-pounders bearing on the inner harbor. At Fort Moultrie, towards the north of Fort Sumter, I have ordered additional traverses to be thrown up, of a better construction than those already there, for the protection of the channel guns against enfilade from Fort Sumter. Between Moultrie and the western extremity of Sullivan’s Island I have ordered the construction of a four-gun concealed battery, to enfilade the channel face of Sumter, having nine or ten guns (en barbette) bearing on the Morris Island works. I have ordered two more 32-pounders to be added to the extreme five-gun battery, commanding the Maffitt or northern shore channel into the harbor, and I have selected the site of two more mortar batteries, of two each, to take in reverse the casemate and barbette guns of Fort Sumter bearing on Morris Island.
I have fortunately found that we would soon have mortars enough for all our present wants; but, generally, the carriages and chassis of nearly all the guns, especially those on the Morris Island works, are either defective or not of the proper kind. I am going to remedy this defect as soon as practicable.	'
I find that the gorge of Fort Sumter is too much inclined to the guns on Morris Island to be breached by them at this distance (thirteen huu-dred yards); and, moreover, they have double the number of guns bearing on them, reversing thereby the advantages of the attack over the defense. If we succeed in constructing my enfilading battery on Sullivan’s Island we will then have a preponderating fire against said gorge wall (four feet six inches thick); but, as already stated, at about thirteen hundred yards, and at an angle of about fifty degrees.
I find that the battery of heavy guns (10-inch columbiads), which I proposed putting up in the vicinity of Fort Johnson, would be impracticable (if we had said guns), the grounds being too low and marshy.
I have now given you a general view of the condition of the offensive works of this harbor, and I am of the opinion that, if Sumter was properly garrisoned and armed, it would be a perfect Gibraltar to anything but constant shelling, night and day, from the four points of the compass. As it is, the weakness of the garrison constitutes our greatest advantage, and we must, for the present, turn our attention to preventing it from being re-enforced. This idea I am gradually and cautiously infusing into the minds of all here; but, should we have to open our batteries upon it, I hope to be able to do so with all the advantages the condition of things here will permit. All that I ask is time for completing my batteries and preparing and organizing properly my command, which is still in a more or less confused state, not having yet my general staff officers around me. So soon as I shall have here a competent engineer officer (Major Whiting arrived here on the 4th, and will probably leave again for Savannah to day, where his presence is required), I will send to the department a plan of this harbor, with the position, &e.,

of all the works marked thereon. Those Drummond lights, ordered from New York, will be here in about ten days.

Charleston, S. C., March 6,1861.
General : I have the honor to report that I proceeded to Morris Island this morning, and commenced establishing battery positions.
I.	Directed the Dahlgren battery to be modified. Retired the interior crest of the right gun, so as to obtain a raking fire on the whole approach, and on the beach, and placed a traverse between the two, and directed the rear of the battery to be excavated, to give a relief of at least eight to interior crest. It is absolutely necessary that these guns be placed en barbette; otherwise, unless the epaulement is cut down to two, they cannot be depressed sufficiently for the short ranges on the ship’s carriages.
II.	Battery A, for two 8-inch columbiads (new position). The relative positions of the different batteries will be indicated on the chart by the engineer and submitted to you to-morrow.
III.	Arranged and modified the Star of the West battery, giving greater relief, reducing the platform, locating necessary traverses, and adding one 24-pounder. Directed the two field pieces lor line and land defense.
IY. Battery B, for two guns, one 8-inch columbiad, and one 8-inch sea-coast.
Y. Battery C, for one 8-inch sea-coast and one 42-pounder.
YI. Battery I), for two 24-pounders.
Y1I. Battery E, two 24-pounders, at nearly right angles to the brush. To protect the two last from Hunter, the left traverse must cross the epaulement.
YJII. Battery F, partially finished, for two 8-inch sea-coast howitzers and two 24-pounders. The howitzers are on casemate carriages, and must be changed.
The arrangement of these batteries will, in general, be identical, except when the siege carriage is used in the Star of the West battery, and in E, and G, the latter of three 24-pounders, partly done. Therefore the guns can be placed in different order, if thought best. I placed the guns of longest range farthest from Hunter, as having greater effect upon the distant approach. Examination of the maps, when complete, will show the field of fire. Of these guns there are now on the island three 8-inch columbiads, now mounted on casemate carriages in battery ; No. 2 as a siege battery on Sumter; two 42-pounders, mounted on casemate carriages, siege battery on Sumter. The two Dahlgrens and the two 8-inch sea-coast, on the casement trenches. All the above require barbette carriages. Of these, the barbette carriages for the columbiads are nearly ready; also, for the sea coast. There are also eight 24-pounders on siege carriages already mounted on the channel; in all, fifteen. * There are required for the proposed addition two sea-coast, howitzers, now at Pinckney, and five 24-pounders also at Pinckney; making, in all, twenty-two guns to be provided. The arrangement is that indicated in the plan this morning. I am doubtful which battery to commeuce first. Perhaps in order from the Dahlgren, although it would be best to have them done simultaneously. There is want ol labor, and

﻿28	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
great want of proper quartermaster and commissary arrangements for the labor. All the work on the siege batteries should be suspended, and turned to proper account on the channel.
Please to direct the enlarged chart, made by Lieutenant Gregorie, South Carolina Engineers, for the governor, to be sent down to have the positions of the batteries located upon it, for your information.

Sir : I have the honor to transmit by Col. R. A. Pryor, one of my aides (who like the others was quite indefatigable and fearless in conveying my orders, in an open boat, from these headquarters to the batteries during the bombardment), a general report of the attack of the 12th instant on Fort Sumter. This report would have been sent sooner if my other pressing duties had permitted me to devote my time to it, while the presence of the enemy’s fleet still led us to expect an attack along the coast at any moment. A more detailed account will be sent forward as soon as the returns of the commanders of batteries shall have reached this office. The great difficulty I will labor under will be to do full justice to all when so much zeal, energy, and gallantry were displayed by officers and soldiers in the execution of my orders. I wish, however, to record two incidents, which will illustrate the feelings that animated all here.
Whilst the barracks in Fort Sumter were in a blaze, and the interior of the work appeared untenable from the heat and from the fire of our batteries (at about which period I sent three of my aides to offer assistance in the name of the Confederate States), whenever the guns of Fort Sumter would fire upon Fort Moultrie the men occupying Cummings Point batteries (Palmetto Guard, Captain Cuthbert) at each shot would cheer Anderson for his gallantry, although themselves still firing upon him, and when on the 15th instant he left the harbor on the steamer Isabel the soldiers of the batteries on Cummings Point lined the beach, silent, and with heads uncovered, while Anderson and his command passed before them, and expressions of scorn at the apparent cowardice of the fleet in not even attempting to rescue so gallant an officer and his command were upon the lips of all. With such material for an army, if properly disciplined, I would consider myself almost invincible against any forces not too greatly sujjerior.
The fire of those barracks was only put out on the 15th instant, p. m., after great exertions by the gallant fire companies of this city, who were at their pumps night and day, although aware that close by them was a magazine filled with thirty thousand pounds of powder, with a shot-hole through the wall of its anteroom.
I am now removing the tottering walls of the buildings within, and clearing away all the rubbish, &c., from the interior of the work, so as to render it still more formidable than it was before it was attacked.
In one or two days I will send forward to you photographs taken at different points of sight, from which you can clearly understand the condition of the fort within when first occupied by us.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. T. BEAUREGARD, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Chap. I.] OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.
Headquarters Provisional Army, G. S. A.,
Charleston, 8. 0., April 16, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following summary statement of the circumstances of the surrender of Fort Sumter:
On the refusal of Major Anderson to engage, in compliance with my demand, to designate the time when he would evacuate Fort Sumter, and to agree meanwhile not to use his guns against us, at 3.20 o’clock in the morning of the 12th instant I gave him formal notice that within one hour my batteries would open on him. In consequence of some circumstance of delay the bombardment was not begun precisely at the appointed moment, but at 4.30 o’clock the signal gun was fired, and within twenty minutes all our batteries were in full play. There was no response from Fort Sumter until about 7 o’clock, when the first shot from the enemy was discharged against our batteries on Cummings Point.
By 8 o’clock the action became general, and throughout the day was maintained with spirit on both sides. Our guns were served with skill and energy. The effect wras visible in the impressions made on the walls of Fort Sumter. From our mortar batteries shells were thrown with such precision and rapidity that it soon became impossible for the enemy to employ his guns en barbette, of which several were dismounted. The engagement was continued without any circumstance of special note until nightfall, before which time the fire from Sumter had evidently slackened. Operations on our side were sustained throughout the night, provoking, however, only a feeble response.
On the morning of the 13th the action was prosecuted with renewed vigor, and about 7J o’clock it was discovered our shells had set fire to the barracks in the fort. Speedily volumes of smoke indicated an extensive conflagration, and apprehending some terrible calamity to the garrison I immediately dispatched an offer of assistance to Major Anderson, which, however, with grateful acknowledgments, he declined. Meanwhile, being informed about 2 o’clock that a white flag was displayed from Sumter, I dispatched two of my aides to Major Anderson with terms of evacuation. In recognition of the gallantry exhibited by the garrison I cheerfully agreed that on surrendering the fort the commanding officer might salute his flag.
By 8 o’clock the terms of evacuation were definitely accepted. Major Anderson having expressed a desire to communicate with the United States vessels lying off the harbor, with a view to arrange for the transportation of his command to some port in the United States, one of his officers, accompanied by Captain Hartstene and three of my aides, was permitted to visit the officer in command of the squadron to make provision for that object. Because of an unavoidable delay the formal transfer of the fort to our possession did not take place until 4 o’clock in the afternoon of the 14th instant. At that hour, the place having been evacuated by the United States garrison, our troops occupied it, and the Confederate flag was hoisted on the ramparts of Sumter with a salute from the various batteries.
The steamer Isabel having been placed at the service of Major Anderson, he and his command were transferred to the United States vessels off the harbor.
The urgency of immediate engagements prevents me from giving at present a more circumstantial narrative of the incidents connected with the capture of Fort Sumter. When the reports from the various commanders of batteries are received I will hasten to forward you a more detailed account.

In conclusion, I am happy to state that the troops, both officers and soldiers, of the Regulars, Volunteers, Militia, and Navy, by their energy, zeal, perseverance, labor, and endurance before the attack, and by their courage and gallantry during its continuance, exhibited all the characteristics of the best troops; and to my staff, Regular and Volunteer, I am much indebted for the prompt and complete execution of my orders, which had to be communicated in open boats during the bombardment to the different batteries then engaged.

Having completed my channel defenses and batteries in the harbor necessary for the reduction of Fort Sumter, I dispatched two of my aides at 2.20 p. m., on Thursday, the 11th of April, with a communication to Major Anderson, in command of the fortification, demanding its evacuation. I offered to transport himself and command to any port in the United States he might elect, to allow him to move out of the fort with company arms and property and all private property, and to salute his flag in lowering it. He refused to accede to the demand. As my aides were about leaving Major Anderson remarked that if we did not batter him to pieces he would be starved out in a few days, or words to that effect. This being reported to me by my aides on their return with his refusal, at 5.10 p. m., I deemed it proper to telegraph the purport of his remark to the Secretary of War. In reply I received by telegraph the following instructions at 9.10 p. m.: uDo not desire needlessly to bombard Fort Sumter. If Major Anderson will state the time at which, as indicated by him, he will evacuate, and agree that in the mean time he will not use his guns against us unless ours should be employed against Fort Sumter, you are authorized thus to avoid effusion of blood. If this, or its equivalent, be refused, reduce the fort as your judgment decides to be most practicable.”

At 11 p. in. I sent my aides with a communication to Mdjor Anderson based on the foregoing instructions. * It was placed in his hands at 12.45 a. m. 12th instant. He expressed his willingness to evacuate the fort on Monday at noon if provided with the necessary means of transportation, and if he should not receive contradictory instructions from his Government or additional supplies, but he declined to agree not to open his guns upon us in the event of any hostile demonstrations on our part against his flag. This reply, which was opened and shown to my aides, plainly indicated that if instructions should be received contrary to his purpose to evacuate, or if he should receive his supplies, or if the Confederate troops should fire on hostile troops of the United States, or upon transports bearing the United States flag, containing men, munitions, and supplies designed for hostile operations against us, he would still feel himself bound to fire upon us, and to hold possession of the fort.
As, in consequence of a communication from the President of the United States to the governor of South Carolina, we were in momentary expectation of an attempt to re-enforce Fort Sumter, or of a descent upon our coast to that end from the United States fleet then lying at the entrance of the harbor, it was manifestly an imperative necessity to reduce the fort as speedily as possible, and not to wait until the ships and the fort should unite in a combined attack upon us. Accordingly my aides, carrying out my instructions, promptly refused to accede to the terms proposed by Major Anderson, and notified him in writing that our batteries would open upon Fort Sumter in one hour. This notification was given at 3.20 a. m. of Friday, the 12th instant. The signal shell was fired from Fort Johnson at 4.30 a. m. At about 5 o’clock the fire from our batteries became general. Fort Sumter did not open fire until 7 o’clock, when it commenced with a vigorous fire upon the Cummings Point iron battery. The enemy next directed his fire upon the enfilade battery on Sullivan’s Island, constructed to sweep the parapet of Fort Sumter, to prevent the working of the barbette guns and to dismount them. This was also the aim of the floating battery, the Dahlgren battery, and the gun batteries at Cummings Point.
The enemy next opened on Fort Moultrie, between which and Fort Sumter a steady and almost constant fire was kept up throughout the day. These three points—Fort Moultrie, Cummings Point, and the end of Sullivan’s Island, where the floating battery, Dahlgren battery, and the enfilade battery were placed—were the points to which the enemy seemed almost to confine his attention, although he fired a number of shots at Captain Butler’s mortar battery, situated to the east of Fort Moultrie, and a few at Captain James’ mortar batteries at Fort Johnson.
During the day (12th instant) the fire of my batteries was kept up most spiritedly, the guns and mortars being worked in the coolest manner, preserving the prescribed intervals of firing. Towards evening it became evident that our fire was very effective, as the enemy was driven from his barbette gun which he attempted to work in the morning, and his fire was confined to his casemated guns, but in a less active manner than in the morning, and it was observed that several of his guns en barbette were disabled. During the whole of Friday night our mortar batteries continued to throw shells, but, in obedience to orders, at longer intervals. The night was rainy and dark, and as it was almost confidently expected that the United States fleet would attempt to land troops upon the islands or to throw men into Fort Sumter by

means of boats, the greatest vigilance was observed at all our channel batteries, and by our troops on both Morris and Sullivan’s Islands.
Early on Saturday morning all of our batteries reopened upon Fort Sumter, which responded vigorously for a time, directing its fire specially against Fort Moultrie. About 8 o’clock a. m. smoke was seen issuing from the quarters of Fort Sumter. Upon this the fire of our batteries was increased, as a matter of course, for the purpose of bringing the enemy to terms as speedily as possibly, inasmuch as his flag was still floating defiantly above him. Fort Sumter continued to fire from time to time, but at long and irregular intervals, amid the dense smoke, flying shot, and bursting shells. Our brave troops, carried away by their natural generous impulses, mounted the different batteries, and at every discharge from the fort cheered the garrison for its pluck and gallantry, and hooted the fleet lying inactive just outside the bar.
About 1.30 p. m., it being reported to me that the flag was down (it afterwards appeared that the flag-staff had been shot away), and the conflagation from the large volume of smoke being apparently on the increase, I sent three of my aides with a message to Major Anderson to the effect that seeing his flag no longer flying, his quarters in flames, and supposing him to be in distress, I desired to offer him any assistance he. might stand in need of. Before my aides reached the fort the United States flag was displayed on the parapet, but remained there only a short time, when it was hauled down and a white flag substituted in its place. When the United States flag first disappeared the firing from our batteries almost entirely ceased, but reopened with increased vigor when it reappeared on the parapet, and was continued until the white flag was raised, when it ceased entirely. Upon the arrival of my aides at Fort Sumter they delivered their message to Major Anderson, who replied that he thanked me for my offer, but desired no assistance.
Just previous to their arrival Colonel Wigfall, one of my aides, who had been detached for special duty on Morris Island, had, by order of Brigadier-General Simons, crossed over to Fort Sumter from Cummings Point in an open boat, with private Gourdin Young, amidst a heavy fire of shot and shell, for the purpose of ascertaining from Major Anderson whether his intention was to surrender, his flag being down and his quarters in flames. On reaching the fort the colonel had an interview with Major Anderson, the result of which was that Major Anderson understood him as offering the same conditions on the part of General Beauregard as had been tendered him on the 11th instant, while Colonel Wigfall’s impression was that Major Anderson unconditionally surrendered, trusting to the generosity of General Beauregard to offer such terms as would be honorable and acceptable to both parties. Meanwhile, before these circumstances were reported to me, and in fact soon after the aides whom I had dispatched with the offer of assistance had set out on their mission, hearing that a white flag was flying over the fort, I sent Major Jones, the chief of my staff, and some other aides, with substantially the same propositions I had submitted to Major Anderson on the 11th instant, with the exception of the privilege of saluting his flag. The Major (Anderson) replied, u it would be exceedingly gratifying to him, as well as to his command, to be permitted to salute their flag, having so gallantly defended the fort under such trying circumstances, and hoped that General Beauregard would not refuse it, as such a privilege was not unusual.” He further said he u would not urge the point, but would prefer to refer the matter again to me.” The point was, therefore, left open until the matter was submitted to me.
Previous to the return of Major Jones I sent a fire engine, under Mr.

M. H. Nathan, chief of the fire department, and Surgeon-General Gibbes, of South Carolina, with several of my aides, to offer further assistance to the garrison at Fort Sumter, which was declined. I very cheerfully agreed to allow the salute, as an honorable testimony to the gallantry and fortitude with which Major Anderson and his command had defended their post, and I informed Major Anderson of my decision about o’clock, through Major Jones, my chief of staff.
The arrangements being completed Major Anderson embarked with his command on the transport prepared to convey him to the United States fleet lying outside the bar, and our troops immediately garrisoned the fort, and before sunset the flag of the Confederate States floated over the ramparts of Fort Sumter.
I commend in the highest terms the gallantry of every one under my command, and it is with diffidence that I will mention any corps or names for fear of doing injustice to those not mentioned, for where all have done their duty well it is difficult to discriminate. Although the troops out of the batteries bearing on Fort Sumter were not so fortunate as their comrades working the guns and mortars, still their services were equally as valuable and as commendable, for they were on their arms at the channel batteries, and at their posts and bivouacs, and exposed to severe weather, and constant watchfulness, expecting every moment and^ready to repel re-enforcements from the powerful fleet off the bar, and to all the troops under my command I award much praise for their gallantry, and the cheerfulness with which they met the duties required of them. I feel much indebted to Generals E. G. M. Dunovant and James Simons and their staffs, especially Majors Evans and I)e Saussure, South Carolina Army, commanding on Sullivan’s and Morris’ Islands, for their valuable and gallant services, and the discretion they displayed in executing the duties devolving on their responsible positions. Of Lieut. Col. E. S. Eipley, First Artillery Battalion, commandant of batteries on Sullivan’s Island, I cannot speak too highly, and join with General Dunovant, his immediate commander since January last, in commending in the highest terms his sagacity, experience, and unflagging zeal. I would also mention in the highest terms of praise Captains Calhoun and Hallonquist, assistant commandants of batteries to Colonel Eipley; and the following commanders of batteries on Sullivan’s Island: Capt. J. E. Hamilton, commanding the floating battery and Dahlgren gun; Captains Butler, South Carolina Army, and Bruns, aide-de-camp to General Dunovant, and Lieutenants Wagner, Ehett, Yates, Valentine, and Parker.
To Lieut. Col. W. G. De Saussure, Second Artillery Battalion, commandant of batteries on Morris i sland, too much praise cannot be given. He displayed the most untiring energy, and his judicious arrangements and the good management of his batteries contributed much to the reduction of Fort Sumter. To Major Stevens, of the Citadel Academy, in charge of the Cummings Point batteries, I feel much indebted for his valuable and scientific assistance, and the efficient working of the batteries under his immediate charge. The Cummings Point batteries (iron—42 pounder and mortar) were manned by the Palmetto Guards, Captain Cuthbert, and I take pleasure in expressing my admiration of the service of the gallant captain and his distinguished company during the action.
I would also mention in terms of praise the following commanders of batteries at the point, viz: Lieutenants Armstrong, of the Citadel Academy and Brownfield, of the Palmetto Guards; also Captain Thomas, of the Citadel Academy, who had charge of the rifled cannon, and had the 3 R R

honor of using this valuable weapon—a gift of one of South Carolina’s distant sons to his native State—with peculiar effect. Capt. J. G. King, with his company, the Marion Artillery, commanded the mortar battery in rear of the Cummings Point batteries, and the accuracy of his shell-practice was the theme of general admiration. Capt. George S. James, commanding at Fort Johnson, had the honor of firing the first shell at Fort Sumter, and his conduct and that of those under him was commendable during the action. Captain Martin, South Carolina Army, commanded the Mo^nt Pleasant mortar battery, and with his assistants did good service. For a more detailed account of the gallantry of officers and men, and of the various incidents of the attack on Fort Sumter, I would respectfully invite your attention to the copies of the reports of the different officers under my command, herewith inclosed.
I cannot close my report without reference to the following gentlemen : To his excellency Governor Pickens and staff, especially Colonels Lamar and Bearing, who were so active and efficient in the construction of the channel batteries; Colonels Lucas and Moore for assistance on various occasions, and Colonel Duryea and Mr. NTathan [chief of the fire department) for their gallant assistance in putting out the fire at Fort Sumter when the magazine of the latter was in imminent danger of explosion 5 General Jamison, Secretary of War, and General S. R. Gist, adjutant-general, for their valuable assistance in obtaining and dispatching the troops for the attack on Fort Sumter and defense of the batteries; Quartermaster’s and Commissary Departments, Colonel Hatch and Colonel Walker, and the ordnance board, especially Colonel Manigault, Chief of Ordnance, whose zeal and activity were untiring: The Medical Department, whose preparations had been judiciously and amply made, but which a kind Providence rendered unnecessary; the Engineers, Majors Whiting and Gwynn, Captains Trapier and Lee, and Lieutenants McCrady, Earle, and Gregorie, on whom too much praise cannot be bestowed for their untiring zeal, energy, and gallantry, and to whose labors is greatly due the unprecedented example of taking such an important work after thirty-three hours’ firing without having to report the loss of a single life, and but four slightly wounded. From Major W. H. C. Whiting I derived also much assistance, not only as an engineer, in selecting the sites and laying out the channel batteries on Morris Island, but as acting assistant adjutant and inspector general in arranging and stationing the troops on said island. To the naval department, especially Captain Hartstene, one of my volunteer aides, who was perfectly indefatigable in guarding the entrance into the harbor, and in transmitting my orders; Lieut. T. B. Huger, who was also of much service, first as inspecting ordnance officer of batteries, then in charge of the batteries on the south end of Morris Island; Lieutenant Warley, who commanded the Dahlgren channel battery; also the school-ship, which was kindly offered by the board of directors, and was of much service; Lieutenant Rutledge, who was acting inspector-general of ordnance of all the batteries, in which capacity, assisted by Lieutenant Williams, C. S. A., on Morris Island, he was of much service in organizing and distributing the ammunition; Captains Childs and Jones, assistant commandant of batteries; to Lieutenant-Colonel De Saussure, Captains Winder and Allston, acting assistant adjutant and inspector general to General Simons’ brigade; Captain Manigault, of my staff, attached on General Simons’ staff, who did efficient and gallant services on Morris Island during the fight; Prof. Lewis R. Gibbes, of Charleston College, and his aides, for their valuable services in operating the Drummond lights established at the extensions of Sullivan’s and

Morris Islands. The venerable and gallant Edmnnd Ruffin, of Virginia, waS at the Iron battery, and fired many guns, undergoing every fatigue and sharing the hardships at the battery with the youngest of the Pal-mettoes. To my regular staff, Major Jones, G. S. A. ; Captains Lee and Ferguson, South Carolina Army, and Lieutenant Legare, South Carolina Army, and volunteer staff, Messrs. Chisolm, Wigfall,Chesnut, Manning, Miles, Gonzales, and Pryor, I am much indebted for their indefatigable and valuable assistance night and day during the attack on Fort Sumter, transmitting in open boats my orders when called upon with alacrity and cheerfulness to the different batteries amidst falling balls and bursting shells, Captain Wigfall being the first in Sumter to receive the surrender.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : I have the honor to send you by the bearer, Capt. S. W. Ferguson, South Carolina Regulars, my regular aide, and Lieut. Col. A. R. Chisolm (aide to Governor Pickens), one of my volunteer aides, the flag which waved on Fort Moultrie during the bombardment of Fort Sumter, and was thrice cut by the enemy’s balls. Being the first Confederate flag thus baptized, I have thought it worth sending to the War Department for preservation. I should have brought it on myself, but my present indisposition will prevent me from leaving here for a day or two.

Report of Brig. Gen. R. G. M. Dunovant, South Carolina Army, of operations against Fort Sumter.
Headquarters, South Carolina Army,
Sullivaris Island, April 21,1861.
Major: I have the honor to report that on Tuesday morning, April 9, in obedience to orders from your headquarters, I came down to Sullivan's Island attended by the following members of my staff: Maj.K. G. Evans, S. C. A., adjutant-general; First Lieut. Warren Adams, S. C. A., and Second Lieut. Robert Pringle, S. C. A., aides-de-camp; Maj. W. D. De Saussure and Capt. J. D. Bruns, special aides-de-camp.
Information having been received which led us to expect a determined effort on the part of £he United States Government to re-enforce Fort Sumter, I at once made all the necessary preparations to prevent, if possible, the success of this attempt. The batteries in process of erection at the eastern extremity of the island were rapidly pushed to completion. Colonel Pettigrew had already taken precautions against

﻿36	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
a surprise by establishing a picket guard on Long Island and by doubling the sentries on Sullivan’s Island.
On the morning of the 11th I reviewed the entire forces under my command, Colonel Pettigrew’s regiment of rifles occupying and defending the eastern third of the island with the assistance of the Charleston Light Dragoons, and the German Flying Artillery in charge of a field battery attached to his command, and Colonel Anderson’s regiment of the First Infantry being held in readiness to act as a reserve or to be thrown on any point where their services were required.
It affords me sincere gratification to record that, although happily Colonel Pettigrew’s regiment was not called into action, and had little share in the perils and honors of the recent engagement, their patient endurance of every privation, and their prompt and cheerful response to every call of duty during a long-continued service, entitle them to unqualified commendation. I may add that as soon as they heard the sound of our guns, twenty-four members of the regiment of rifles went down under fire to the floating battery, their boat narrowly escaping being sunk.
Colonel Anderson’s regiment of regulars also deserve special notice for the good order, spirit, and energy which have universally characterized the command. Three companies of his regiment, Captain Martin’s, Captain Butler’s, and Lieutenant Valentine’s, were detached for duty as artillerists under Lieutenant-Colonel Ripley, and for their share in the bombardment I would respectfully refer you to the report of the lieutenant-colonel commanding the batteries.
The defenses of Fort Moultrie and the preparation of the gun and mortar batteries above and below this post seemed to me to be complete and satisfactory. For this no small measure of praise is due to the sagacity, experience, and unflagging zeal of Lieut. Col. R. S. Ripley, commanding First Battalion Artillery, who was assigned to duty under my command on the 2d day of January last, when Fort Moultrie was generally considered untenable. The suggestions made by this officer in his reports respecting the defenses of the fort have in almost every instance been carried out, and their value has been triumphantly illustrated by the severe test to which they were subjected in the recent engagement. The guns which were used against Fort Sumter were the same which Major Anderson spiked and burned when he abandoned Fort Moultrie.
On the night of the 11th, as hostilities were shortly expected to commence, I made the following disposition of my staff: Major Pagan, Lieutenant Adams, and Lieutenant Pringle to be stationed between Fort Moultrie and Captain Butler’s battery, to carry orders to and from these posts and to the brigade of infantry $ Major De Saussure to attend me personally, and Captain Bruns to be on detached service at Captain Hallonquist’s mortar battery, where he rendered efficient aid during the whole bombardment. Major Evans, who had been confined to his bed by sickness for some days, joined me soon after the battle commenced, and then, as always, exhibited the highest qualifications for the duties of his arduous and responsible post. I am gratified to record that my entire staff acquitted themselves well, and their services to me during the campaign have been invaluable. Although most of them had but little military experience, they have spared no pains to acquaint themselves with the duties of their office, and have, without exception, performed them intelligently, cheerfully, and with dispatch.
During the bombardment, I observed specially the behavior of the troops at Fort Moultrie, and at Captains Butler’s and Hallonquist’s

mortar batteries. At all these posts the energy and spirit displayed alike by officers and men could not be surpassed, I believe, by any troops in the world. The enfilade, Dahlgren, and floating batteries had also a prominent place in the picture, but I must again refer to the reports of the officers commanding these batteries.
I am pleased to mention that Ex-Governor J. L. Manning, Hon. W. P. Miles, and Capt. Samuel Ferguson, S. 0. A., aides-de-camp to Brigadier-General Beauregard, brought orders to me from the brigadier-general commanding during the hottest of the fire. Major De Saussure, of my staff, carried information for the Ordnance Department in regard to the short supply of Dahlgren shells under a brisk fire.
As soon as the white flag was displayed from Fort Sumter on the 13th I sent Captain Hartstene, C. S. N., Captain Calhoun, S. C. A., and Surgeon Lynch, C. S. N., to ascertain whether Major Anderson had surrendered. These officers reported on their return that they had been preceded by some members of your staff.
For the details of this action, which has terminated so happily for the glory of our arms and for the honor and safety of South Carolina, I would respectfully refer you to the report of Lieutenant-Colonel Ripley, and to the reports of the officers under his immediate command.

No. 10.
Report of Brig. Gen. James Simons of operations against Fort Sumter.
Headquarters, Morris Island, April 23,1861.
General: I have the honor respectfully to inform you that the report of Lieutenant-Colonel De Saussure, commanding the battalion of artillery, with the reports of commanders of batteries at this post of the late action of the 12th and ,13th instants with Fort Sumter, have this moment been handed to me, and as you are already apprised of my communication of yesterday to Assist. Adjt. Gen. D. R. Jones, this will furnish the reason for my delaying the present address. I have little to add to the minute and circumstantial detail which has been so carefully and minutely furnished by these officers. I add my confirmation to the commendation of the coolness, perseverance, and steady zeal of all those who were actively engaged in the action, to whom particular as well as general reference has been made in those reports.
The firing commenced on the signal designated in your General Orders No. 14, section 4, of date the 11th instant, and conformed substantially to the requisitions of General Orders No. 9, of date the 6th instant, both as regards the objects, and the times and the intervals of firing, and the only departure from the rigid compliance with those orders was done by my orders at 11.10 a. m. on the 13th instant, by which, through Colonel Wigfall, whom you had sent to me as a special aid the night before the engagement, I authorized battery commanders to increase the frequency of their fire, but with express directions that the fire should not be so frequent as to waste ammunition. This was continued until 1.30 p. m., when the flag of Fort Sumter fell, but whether by fire or by a ball from our batteries did not then appear. It was certain the colors were not

hauled down. I became certain afterwards, on a visit to Fort Sumter, that the flagstaff was shot away, for it bore the marks of many balls. Only two shots were fired from our batteries on this island after the flag fell. I suspended the firing, however, and on a consultation with Ex-Governor Manning, Colonel Chesnut,.and Colonel Wigfall, members of your staff, I sent Colonel Wigfall, accompanied by Private Gourdin Young,' of Palmetto Guard, with a white flag to Fort Sumter to inform Major Anderson that I observed his flag was down, and to inquire whether he would surrender to you. Colonel Wigfall, with great gallantry and his accustomed indifference to danger, accompanied as I have mentioned, proceeded in a boat in the midst of the continued fire from our batteries other than at this island. Before he reached Fort Sumter I distinctly saw the flag of Fort Sumter flying on the northeast corner of the fortress, but very much masked by the gable of the quarters and the smoke and flame. It was too late to recall Colonel Wigfall, and he accomplished his mission. Soon after he reached the fortress a white flag was substituted for that lately put up, and the firing ceased on both sides. The firing of Fort Sumter had continued after the flag had fallen.
At 2.15 p. m. Colonel Wigfall returned and announced that Major Anderson surrendered unconditionally to Brigadier-General Beauregard, of the C. S. Army. The announcement was received with the greatest enthusiasm, and Colonel Wigfall and Private Young were borne from the boat in triumph by the troops. Colonel Wigfall, accompanied by Ex-Governor Manning, Colonel Chesnut, and Captain Chisolm of your staff, then proceeded to report to you.
In the afternoon, before sundown, a boat from the fleet was brought to by a shot from Lieutenant-Colonel Lamar’s battery, and landed Lieutenant Marcy, U. S. Navy. He asked me if I would give him permission to go to Fort Moultrie to inquire whether Major Anderson had surrendered, and whether he and his command could be taken out of the harbor by a vessel of the fleet, or a merchant vessel with them, or by their boats. I replied that so far as it was necessary to go to Fort Moultrie to learn whether Major Anderson had surrendered, I could, and did, give him the information, and so far as the removal of Major Anderson’s command out of the harbor was concerned, we could furnish the requisite transportation, but that the commanding general of our army was at hand, and that he would be communicated with, and that Lieutenant Marcy could have the answer at 9 a. m. the next day, at the same place. I sent Capt. Ben. Allston to you before dark with a dispatch to this effect, under the signature of Major Whiting. Subsequent events were managed by yourself or under your direction and control.
Besides the batteries actively engaged in the action, I cannot too highly commend the other batteries on the channel. The untiring zeal, watchfulness, and eagerness of the officers and men of the commands to participate in the defense of their country must fill the hearts of their follow-citizens with the liveliest emotions of gratitude and pride.
I felt constraiped to refuse permission to Capt. A. J. Green, of Columbia Artillery, and his gallant corps to open fire on Fort Sumter, although he solicited permission to participate in the contest. Whilst the credit of the battle will necessarily be more permanently associated with those who managed the instruments of warfare, I cannot conclude this report without inviting your attention to the infantry. In the midst of the greatest exposure to the. most inclement weather, many hundreds bivouacking in the open air without any covering, many more sheltered by wide burrows in the sand hills, not a murmur of complaint escaped

during tlie thirty-three hours of the conflict; but with steady gaze on the fleet, which was ranged outside the harbor, plainly visible to the naked eye, they were ready to resist any hostile demonstration and repulse the invader, whilst their brave comrades of the batteries were engaged in driving the enemy from his strong fortress in our harbor. Commendation from one like myself, entitled from my education and training to no military consideration, is only valuable because it is honest and sincere.
In this sense you will permit me, general, to thank you for the assistants which your wisdom and kindness assigned to aid me in my difficult and trying position. I am almost unwilling to distinguish between them, but the genius and the highest order of intellectual culture of Major Whiting, joined to his indefatigable and untiring energy, sleep-lessly exercised both night and day, have entitled him at my hands to the most grateful eulogium.
Claiming no credit for myself, but only the desire to serve my country, I will urgently pray you, general, to pardon in myself all deficiencies which the newness of my situation and the suddenness of my assuming this post may have caused me to develop.
I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

Artillery.
Headquarters Artillery, Sullivans Island, Fort Moultrie, April 16,1861.
Major: Ihdvethe honor to report that on the evening of the 11th instant, at 9J o’clock, the batteries under my command were supplied and manned, the furnace heated, and all was ready for action either against a fleet or Fort Sumter. They were the following:
The five-gun battery, east of Curlew ground, under Captain Tupper, of the Vigilant Rifles.
The Maffitt channel battery, two guns, and mortar-battery No. 2, two 10-inch mortars, under Captain Butler, of the Infantry.
Fort Moultrie, which was my headquarters, thirty guns, under Capt. W. R. Calhoun, of the Artillery, assistant commandant of batteries; First Lieuts. Thomas Wagner and Alfred Rhett, Artillery, commanding Channel and Sumter batteries.
Mortar-battery No. 1, two 10-inch mortars.
The enfilade battery, four guns, under Capt. J. H. Hallonquist, Artillery, assistant commandant of batteries, and Lieutenants Flemming, Artillery, and Valentine, Infantry.
The Point battery, one 9-inch Bahlgren gun, and the floating battery, four guns, under Capt. J. R. Hamilton and First Lieutenant Yates, oi the Artillery, and the Mount Pleasant battery, two 10-inch mortars, under Capt. Robert Martin, of the Infantry.
Of these three 8-inch columbiads, two 32-pounders, and six 24-pounders in Fort Moultrie $ two 24.-pounders and two 32-pounders in the enfilade

battery 5 one 9-ineli Dahlgren gun, two 32-pounders, two 42-pounders at the Point and on board the floating battery, and the six 10-inch mortars bore upon Fort Sumter.
A strict watch was kept all night, but no attempt to send re-enforcements into Fort Sumter was observed. At 4J o’clock on the morning of the 12th a shell was seen from the batteries of Fort Johnson, and in accordance with orders the signal for general action was made at once. The commands went quickly and quietly to their posts, and very soon every battery bearing upon the fort had commenced. As it was still dark the firing was very slow, but after dawn the direct fire was quickened, until every gun which bore upon Sumter was in quick operation, and this was continued at the regular intervals presented throughout the day. The enemy at first only replied to the Cummings Point batteries, but in a short time opened a brisk fire on the Point and floating batteries of this command with great precision. Shortly afterward he commenced firing on the enfilade batteries, but did not open upon Fort Moultrie.
At about 8 o’clock I visited the batteries to the west of this fort, and noticed the admirable conduct of the officers and men. Lieutenants Blanding and Flemming, of the Artillery, at mortar battery NA 1, and Lieutenants Valentine and Burnet, of the Infantry, at the enfilade battery, were promptly and energetically performing their duties. Captain Hallonquist was directing his fire to enfilade and drive the enemy from his parapet. At the Point battery Capt. J. B. Hamilton was firing with great precision and skill, and from his battery I noticed First Lieutenants Yates and Harleston on board the floating battery working their guns with all the rapidity which the order of firing permitted. I next visited Captain Butler’s mortar battery, which he was working energetically.
Fort Sumter opened upon Fort Moultrie about 8.30 o’clock in the morning, and from that time a steady and continuous fire was kept up on us from his casemate 32-pounders and 42-pounders throughout the day. This was replied to by the nine guns of the Sumter battery of this fort, under Lieutenants Rhett and Mitchell, and two guns of the oblique battery, under Lieutenant Parker, until 9 a. in., when Lieutenant Rhett’s command was relieved by the detachment of Company A, under Lieutenants Wagner, Preston, and Sitgreaves.
Captain Calhoun arranged the reliefs, and the officers and men of Companies A, B, and D worked the Sumter battery of this fort alternately until evening. During this time Captain Calhoun kept his channel guns manned and ready for action against the fleet, which was confidently expected to attempt an entrance. At different times during the afternoon five hot shot were fired upon the quarters at Fort Sumter. I have learned that they were thrice set on fire. Meantime the enemy’s shot had told with great effect upon the quarters of Fort Moultrie, continually perforating and breaking them up$ but our defenses were strong, the merlons and traverses heavy and well secured, and no material damage was done to our defenses, although the principal fire of the enemy was directed on this fort during the whole of the afternoon. The direct fire ceased with the light, but the mortars kept up the bombardment at the prescribed intervals.
The night set in dark and rainy, and it was feared that the enemy would certainly attempt to re-enforce. All the batteries on the island were visited, and especial vigilance enjoined. The channel batteries were kept manned, the various enfilading guns were all in readiness to sweep the faces and landings at Fort Sumter, and the mortar batteries

to redouble their fire upon an alarm. The night passed away with one alertej during which the mortar practice was increased in rapidity for a short time, and a few shots were fired from the different batteries; but it becoming apparent that the alarm was groundless the vertical fire was resumed, according to orders, and kept up until the day dawned.
Believing that it was impossible that the fleet outside would permit the cannonade to proceed without an attempt to re-enforce during the day, and the men of my command having been exposed to a pelting rain during the night, and feeling confident that we had perfect command of the enemy’s parapet, it had been determined to fire but two or three guns from the Sumter battery of Fort Moultrie, and, while keeping up a brisk mortar practice and fire from the enfilade battery, to save the ammunition of the Point and floating batteries to repel an attempt to re-enforce. Orders were given to such effect, and the two guns were opened from the Sumter battery of this fort, the other batteries firing in order. Fort Sumter opened early and spitefully, and paid especial attention to Fort Moultrie—almost every shot grazing the crest of the parapet, and crashing through the quarters. Our defenses were still uninjured and our losses trifling.
Finding that I could spare men and still keep the channel battery manned, the fire was "somewhat increased, until about 9 o’clock on the morning of the 13th smoke was seen to issue from the roof of the quarters of Fort Sumter, and it was evident that a conflagration had commenced. The entire Sumter battery of Fort Moultrie was manned at once, and worked with the utmost rapidity, officers and men vieing in their energy. Captain Calhoun, First Lieutenants Wagner, Rhett, and Preston, Second Lieutenants Sitgreaves, Mitchell, and Parker, of the Artillery, and Mr. F. D. Blake, acting engineer, all superintended the working of the guns, which were manned by detachments from Company B, relieved at times by detachments from Company A, with a skill, and precision rarely excelled. Indeed, I doubt whether an artillery fire at such a distance with ordinary guns has ever equaled it in precision. The shot, both hot and cold, crashed into the quarters of Fort Sumter and along the parapet, rendering the extinction of the flames difficult, and lighting up new places to windward. It became evident soon that the enemy was worsted, but to insure the result orders were passed to each of the batteries to redouble their fire.
Captain Hamilton, Captain Hallonquist, and Lieutenants Yates and Valentine had anticipated the order, and Captain Butler soon increased the rapidity of his mortar practice ; nevertheless from his casemates the enemy still poured shot thick and fast upon Fort Moultrie until about 12.45 p. m., when his flagstaff was cut away, and it slackened. The thick and stifling smoke arising from the ruins of his buildings told plainly that the time for surrender had nearly come. Nevertheless he hoisted a new flag over the crest of his parapet, and our fire, which had been ordered to cease when his flagstaff fell, was reopened with all the vigor we could command. The smoke still poured out of the ruins, and the fire from Fort Sumter having slackened again the order was again given to cease, but upon his recommencing we reopened.
While the enemy’s flag was still flying and he was still firing upon us, a boat was observed to leave Cummings Point and pull towards Fort Sumter. By my order a shot was sent ahead of it, but it continued on and landed.
At 1.15 p. m., a white flag having been hoisted alongside the United States ensign, the firing ceased. Brigadier-General Dunovant, who was present in Fort Moultrie, immediately sent Captain Hartstene, C. S. N.,

﻿42	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON 4 HARBOR, S. C.	[Chap.,I.
Captain Calhoun, and Surgeon Lynch, C. S. H., to ascertain whether the surrender was made, and to tender assistance. Upon their arrival they found that the staff of the commanding general had just preceded them.
It is hard to say whether any distinction can be made in the conduct of the officers and men under my command. From the senior captain to the prisoner turned out of the guard-house just before the action all did their duty. The conduct of several came under my special notice, and I mention them accordingly. Captains Calhoun and Hallonquist, assistants to commandant of batteries; Capt. J. R. Hamilton, First Lieutenants Wagner, Rhett, and Yates, and Second Lieutenant Flemming, of the Artillery, and Captain Butler and Lieutenant Valentine, of the Infantry, were all in command of batteries, and deserve especial mention. In addition to the officers whose names appear in the report above I take pleasure in mentioning the conduct of the engineer and assistants, First Lieutenant Earle, and Messrs. F. D. Blake and J. E. Hash, volunteers, acting.
Ho repairs being needed for the defenses, these gentlemen acted as staff and lookout officers, and were very efficient. Lieut. T. S. Fayssoux, of the Cavalry, assistant commissary of subsistence, acted well in the same capacity. Capt. C. F. Middleton, an old resident of Sullivan’s Island, remained with his family during the cannonade, and was especially useful. All of these gentlemen were active and prompt in communicating orders and doing whatever duty devolved upon them.
Surg. Arthur Lynch, C. S. H., and Assist. Surg. Walter Taylor, South Carolina Volunteers, the permanent surgeons of the post, had made every preparation for the discharge of their duties, and would have been assisted by Drs. Raoul, Barnwell, and Porcher, who volunteered, but fortunately our casualties were so few that their services as surgeons were needless. They acted as staff officers. The Rev. Mr. Aldrich was present during the cannonade. Dr. Maddox acted as surgeon at mortar battery Ho. 1, and Drs. Daviga and Logan at the Point and on board the floating battery. Mr. John Wells, of South Carolina, acted as an ordnance officer at the Point battery under Captain Hamilton.
Our escape with only four slight casualties I conceive to be in a great measure due to the strength of our defenses, the material of which had been furnished under the direction of Maj. Walter Gwynn, chief engineer, in large quantities since the 1st of January last. Major Gwynn had also given his personal supervision to the construction of several of the works. The batteries exterior to the fort and many of the works adjacent were built under the superintendence of Captain Trapier, whose accomplishments as an engineer are well known, and certainly are appreciated by those who garrison works constructed by him.
Several times during the action I had the pleasure of meeting the brigadier-general commanding, and of receiving valuable assistance from Captain Bruns and other officers of the staff. I wish to draw particular and special attention to the valuable services of Messrs. John Henery and Charles Scanlan, acting military storekeepers, who have been on duty with my command since January last. These gentlemen have given every attention to their duty, and to them is due, in a great measure, the high state of efficiency of our guns and ordnance. They were indispensable during the action.
The Ordnance Department deserves and has my thanks for the mate-terial furnished under so many adverse circumstances since the 1st of January last.
Among other volunteers, Maj. John Dunovant, of the Infantry, came

to Fort Moultrie early on the morning of the 13th, and was present during the action, doing all that lay in his power.
I was deprived of the services of the commissioned battalion staff during the cannonade. First Lieut. James Hamilton, adjutant, was absent sick on the 11th instant, but hearing of the probability of an engagement, left his bed and came to report for duty. He remained until some time after the action, when it was evident that his strength was gone. Lieutenant- Yates, battalion quartermaster, preferred the command of the floating battery, and I excused him from staff duty.
Lieut. Col. Hatch, quartermaster-general, had made preparations for the extinguishment of fires. Mr. Prioleau Eavenel was present with the engines and a body of men to put them out should they occur. We were fortunate, and he did what duty he was called on to perform.
I have the honor to inclose a return of the few wounded, a statement of shot fired, and such reports from commanding officers as I have received. To them I beg to refer for the names of meritorious individuals not mentioned above.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Lieut Col. Wilmot G. JDe Saussure, South Carolina Army,
commanding Artillery.
Headquarters Battalion of Artillery,
Morris Island, April 22, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to transmit herewith the reports of Maj. P. F. Stevens, of the Citadel Academy, assigned under Special Orders No. 8, from Headquarters Provisional Forces, to the Iron and Point batteries at this post, of Capt. George B. Cuthbert, commanding Palmetto Guard, by which corps the above batteries were manned, and of Capt. J. G. King, commanding Marion Artillery, by which corps the Trapier battery was manned. These several reports contain the events connected with the bombardment and fall of Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, on Friday,

﻿44	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
12th, and Saturday, 13th instants, so far as the above-named batteries and corps were engaged.
An unavoidable delay in obtaining these reports has prevented me from earlier reporting to you. From the day on which supplies were cut off from Fort Sumter, on Sunday, 7th April, instant, the vigilance which had watched over the channel unceasingly was, if possible, increased, in order to prevent re-enforcement of men or supplies to the beleaguered fortress. On the afternoon of Thursday, 11th April, instant, I was notified that at a given signal the bombardment would commence, and that the signal might be looked for about 8 p. m. Shortly before that time the Trapier, Iron, and Point batteries were manned, the magazines opened, and the signal awaited.
After keeping the men at the batteries until nearly 10 p. m. they were dismissed to their respective quarters, but warned to turn out immediately upon the signal being given. At 4.30 a. m. of Friday, 12th April, instant, the signal being given, the batteries were promptly manned, and agreeably to the instructions furnished me for the firing of the mortars, the fire was opened on Fort Sumter from the Trapier battery and succeeded by the Point battery. The fire from this post was commenced at 4.48 a. m. and continued from the mortar batteries at the prescribed intervals until past 2 p. m., when, under orders from Headquarters Provisional Forces, the intervals were doubled. Shortly after 5 a. m., and when the early dawn enabled the guns to be properly worked, the fire was commenced from the three 8-inch columbiads in the Iron battery and the two 42-pounders in the Point battery. From the embrasures of the latter the masks had been removed during the night of Thursday, and also from the rifled cannon in position in the Point battery.
Under my instructions the fire from the columbiads and 42-pounders was at the rate of four shot from each gun per hour. This interval was taken with the purpose of not overheating the guns, of not overfatiguing the men, and that the firing, being conducted with great deliberation, should be accurate. The desired purpose was, I believe, attained. The guns were chiefly directed to driving the men from the barbette guns of Fort Sumter and to dismount as many guns as possible, and also to drive the men from the casemate guns bearing upon this post. Shortly after 7 a. m. of Friday, the 12th instant, the fire from Fort Sumter was opened on this post, and for a considerable time was more directed here than to any other point around the harbor. One hundred and twenty-four shot were fired at the Iron battery, thirteen of which struck it. I am unable to report the number fired at the Point and Trapier batteries, or at the island and cantonments generally, but for a space of over two hours on Friday a duel was kept up between the Point battery and Fort Sumter, gun answering gun during that time. The fire from the guns was continued until dark. The mortar fire was continued both day and night.
On Saturday morning, 13th April instant, a little before 7 a. in., the tour of the mortars at this post having come round, the mortars were discharged at the appointed intervals, and shortly afterwards smoke was seen issuing from the officers7 quarters at Fort Sumter. The smoke increased until about 8 a. in., when the flames burst forth. I believe the fire was communicated from a shell thrown either by the right mortar in the Trapier battery, or the left mortar in the Point battery 5 the shells from these two mortars fell at or about the same place on the roof of the officers7 quarters, and at that time the smoke was first observed from this post. Upon the flames bursting out the rapidity of the fire was increased, in order to spread the flames. Shortly before 10 a. m. Captain

King was instructed to drop a shell on the southern end of the eastern barracks, in order to communicate the fire also to it, and his fifth shell passing through the roof at the designated point the fire was spread. The fire from this post was then reduced to the regular intervals, and so continued until 1.30 p. m., at which time, the flagstaff at Fort Sumter being shot away, the fire from*this point was ordered to cease until opportunity was given to Major Anderson either to replace his flag, or by not replacing it signify a readiness to treat. The replacement of his flag was not seen from this post, and the fire consequently not resumed. The subsequent events are matters falling under your own orders.
The several reports herewith transmitted speak more fully of individual acts of gallantry than my own position would enable me to do. Of the gallantry of the troops engaged in the action, and of their perfect subordination, I cannot speak in terms too high. Few, if any, had ever before been under fire, and yet the entire coolness with which the guns were worked, and the accuracy of fire, would have reflected credit upon veterans. The Trapier battery of three mortars was manned by a portion of the Marion Artillery, under the command of Capt. J. Gadsden King, and the immediate direction of the battery assigned by him to Lieuts. W. H. H. Kirkwood and Edward L. Parker. The fire from these mortars appeared to me to be particularly good, a large proportion of the shells bursting over Fort Sumter or within the parade. The pointing of the mortars from this battery was chiefly done by Corporal McMillan King, jr., Privates J. S. Murdock and Robert Murdock, and reflects upon them very great credit. The Sumter Guard, Capt. John Russell, acted as a reserve to the Marion Artillery, and were engaged during a part of the bombardment at the battery and also during the night in working in the embrasures at the Point battery and in covering the iron battery in part with sand bags. TVhile thus engaged during the night this company was under fire from Fort Sumter. The remaining portion of the Marion Artillery were on duty at Battery G, a Channel battery, to which were assigned Lieuts. J. P. Strohecker and A. M. Huger. The presence of a fleet of war vessels outside the bar required that this, in common with all the channel batteries, should be kept constantly manned, and upon an alarm excited during the night of Friday by a small boat being seen rowing near the shore, the preparation of this detachment was shown by a fire being immediately opened on the boat. The Iron battery, of three 8-inch columbiads, and the Point battery, of three mortars, two 42-pounders, and one 12-pounder rifled cannon, were manned by the Palmetto Guard, Capt. George B. Cuthbert. These two batteries were assigned to the supervision of Maj. P. F. Stevens. The fire from the Iron battery was under the immediate direction of Capt. George B. Cuthbert and Lieutenants Lamb and Buist, and does great credit to their skillful management. • The battering from this battery is very marked upon the exterior wall of Fort Sumter, while the accurate practice dismounted, as I believe, two of the barbette guns on the eastern face, and to a considerable degree crippled one gun on the northern and one on the southwestern face.
At about 11 a. m. of Friday the mantlet to the embrasure of gun Ko. 2 was crippled by the lever-arm used in working it breaking from a flaw in the iron, and for some time this gun was unable to be used. The mantlet was subsequently pried open and the gun renewed its fire. The fire from the mortar at the Point battery was conducted under the supervision of Lieut. N. Armstrong, of the Citadel Academy ? assisted by Lieut. C. R. Holmes, of the Palmetto Guard; and much praise is due to them for the accuracy of their fire. As well as I can judge, this

﻿46	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
battery competes with the Trapier battery for tbe honor of throwing into Fort Sumter the largest number of shells thrown from any post in the harbor. The rifled cannon in this battery was under the supervision of Capt. J. P. Thomas, of the Citadel Academy, and its accuracy of aim reflected well upon the skill of Captain Thomas, and was a valuable auxiliary in driving the men from their guns. The two 42-pounders were managed by Lieut. T. Sumter Brownfield, and I cannot speak too highly of their services. Twice on Saturday, 13th instant, I saw the casemate bearing on this post manned, and instructed Lieutenant Brownfield to drive the men away, and in each case the shot striking on the cheeks of the embrasures drove the men away. The venerable Edmund Buffin, of Virginia, was at this battery during the greater part of the bombardment, and by his enthusiasm and example greatly incited the men.
To Maj. P. F. Stevens, of the Citadel Academy, I but do justice in saying that by example, by forethought, by energy, by his skill much of the success from this post was achieved. He is entitled to most honorable mention and to the highest praise.
To the companies manning the channel batteries much praise is due for a vigilance which never slept, and through which everything looking towards a re-enforcement was guarded against. It was confidently believed by me that the channel batteries were far more likely to be engaged than the batteries bearing on Fort Sumter, and until the bombardment commenced I rested upon the troops at these batteries with the firm assurance that they would permit no entrance whatever to the beleaguered fortress, and the patient vigilance and endurance, the more commendable because not being by the fortune of war at the posts of combat on the 12th and 13th instants, when a hostile fleet lay off the harbor and an hourly conflict was expected, cannot be too highly commended. To the Wee Kee Bifiemen, Capt. J. G. Pressley, Lieut. A. F. Warley, and the detachment of the Wee IS'ee Bifiemen, Lieutenant Keils under him; the Columbia Artillery, Capt. A. J. Green; the German Artillery, Capt. C. Nohrden, and Lieut. Col. Thomas G. Lamar, with the volunteer detachment under him, I desire to pay the highest commendation for a vigilance unsleeping and untiring. The gallant bearing of these troops while standing as silent spectators of the bombardment evinces that if it had been their good fortune to have been actively engaged they would have rendered for themselves a faithful account.
Without invidious distinction I desire particularly to call to your attention the services of the Columbia Artillery, Capt. A. J. Green, which has been on duty unrelieved since 1st January last, and of the German Artillery, Capt. C. Nohrden, which, with but short relief, has been on duty since 27th December last. To Captain Green, as the company longest in service, was given the choice of the batteries, and with characteristic gallantry he chose the post which he believed certain of action.
The course of circumstances deprived himself and his brother commanders of the channel batteries from joining in the engagement, while it afforded to their equally gallant but more fortunate brother commanders of the Point batteries the opportunity of being engaged. All were ready and all were gallant, and I desire to speak thus in justice to all. To the valuable services of Sergeant Hamilton and Privates Bugard, McCaa, Brooks, and Biley, of the Columbia Artillery, rendered at the Iron battery in endeavoring to repair the injured mantelet and lever-arm, I ask leave to call attention. I also desire to mention with great commendation the valuable services rendered me by Capt. F. D. Lee, Corps of Engineers, assigned by you as a part of my staff,

and to whose admirable field works too much praise cannot be awarded; also to Lieut. J. Eavenel Macbeth, my adjutant, and to Capts. J. Jones and F. L. Childs, assistant commandants of batteries, I desire to call attention for gallantry and cool determination in the extension of orders and for valuable suggestions during the engagement. To Capt. P. Ger-vais Eobinson, M. D., Lieut. E. F. Michel, M.. D., my medical staff, and to Drs. F. T. Miles and F. L. Parker, who kindly volunteered their services as surgeons, I am greatly indebted for the thought and. care with which they had prepared for the casualties of battle. They were respectively assigned to the several batteries, and during the entire engagement remained at the posts to which so assigned. Ko casualties, I am glad to say, required their presence; but I am not the less indebted to them, and ask that they may be mentioned with the honor to Which they are so justly entitled. To Lieut. John Eut-ledge, inspector of ordnance, and to Lieut. L. C. Williams, of the Ordnance Department, with his valuable sergeants, M. E. Eoqney and E. W. Fuller (the latter of whom was specially detached from the Columbia Artillery), I ask to call your particular attention. To the batteries under my command their services were invaluable, and to them I owe, in a very high degree, the efficiency of their fire.
Desiring through you, sir, to express to the commanding general of the Provisional Forces my entire satisfaction with, the soldierly deportment and bearing and with the efficient services rendered, as I believe, by the troops under my command,
I have the honor to be, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Reports of Maj. P. F. Stevens, commanding Point and Iron batteries.
Cummings Point, Morris Island,
April 13,1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to report that yesterday morning, about 4 o’clock, a shell having been fired from Fort Johnson, according to instructions I manned my batteries, and, following Captain King’s battery, opened fire on Fort Sumter from the mortar battery, which was continued unabatedly night and day until the order was to-day given to cease firing. The Iron battery and the 42-pounder batteries opened their fire during all yesterday, and once during last night, when an alarm was given that re-enforcements were endeavoring to enter the fort. At 5 o’clock this morning the fire was resumed from the Iron and 42-pounder batteries, in conjunction with the fire of the mortar battery.
At about 7.30 a. m. Lieutenant Armstrong, in charge of the mortar battery, reported to me that he had thrown a shell which broke into the roof of Fort Sumter about the southwest angle and exploded therein. He immediately pointed out the spot, from which the smoke of the explosion had not yet ceased to issue. The smoke from this point continued to arise and increase in volume, until about 8 o’clock the flame broke out, and soon enveloped the south roof. I immediately ordered my batteries to quicken their fire, and a rapid volley was poured from all my batteries (mortars and heavy guns) for nearly three-quarters of an hour. I think the fire from every battery under my

OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.
[Chap. I.
command was most ably directed, and contributed greatly to increase and spread the flames, which soon spread from roof to roof, causing the explosion of shells and hand grenades on the different parapets and greatly injuring the works. The fire having partly expended its fury, my fire was slackened by your order, and continued very much at the rates prescribed in orders until about 1 o’clock, when the flagstaff of Fort Sumter fell, seemingly shot away. The fire was then stopped by order of the commanding general, and not resumed from my batteries, Major Anderson subsequently having surrendered, about 2 p. m.
It is impossible for me to particularize the individual officers or men who behaved well during this action; but I think great credit due to the effective fire of guns directed by officers and men, who, with the exception of the officers of the Military Academy, had never until two or three weeks since undertaken to manage artillery. Captain Cuth-bert, of the Palmetto Guard, assisted by Lieutenant Buist, had especial charge of the Iron battery with its three 8-inch columbiads; Lieutenant Armstrong, of the South Carolina Military Academy, assisted by Lieut. R. Holmes, of the Palmetto Guards, had charge of the three 10-inch mortars of the Point battery; Lieut. T. Sumter Brownfield, of the u Guard,” had charge of the 42-pounders, and Capt. J. P. Thomas, of the Citadel Academy, had command of the Blakely rifled cannon. For some two hours yesterday a heavy fire was directed against my batteries, but with very little effect, and absolutely no loss of life. The Iron battery was struck several times with little damage, the balls glancing and making little impression. Several shot were split, upon striking the same. Early in the day one heavy shot struck the upper end of the shutter of embrasure No. 2. The plates of boiler-iron composing the same were considerably bent, or rather indented, by the blow, even splitting the plate through. The shot, however, was completely turned, and no real damage would have been experienced had it not been for a flaw in the lever-arm which maneuvered the shutter. This lever, to sustain a heavy weight as a counterpoise to the shutter, and having a large flaw (not before seen) just in the bend of the arm, was broken by the jar of the blow. The shutter was afterwards propped up, and the fire of the gun continued with great effect this morning. The sand battery was a most effectual screen for the guns it covered, and is absolutely uninjured by the fire of Fort Sumter. The rifled cannon being but limitedly supplied with ammunition could do little, but its few shots were skillfully directed by Captain Thomas.
I have the honor, sir, to congratulate you upon the share in this great success and victory to which the troops under your command are entitled.
Very respectfully,
P. F. STEVENS,
Major, Commanding Point and Iron Batteries.
Lieutenant-Colonel De Saussure,
Commanding Battalion Artillery.
Superintendent’s Office, Citadel Academy,
April 18,1861.
Major : Upon my return to this post I found the accompanying letter, which had been written to me by Capt. G. B. Cuthbert during my temporary absence from Morris Island.*
Sergeant Bissell did not exactly u cripple the gun of the left casemate,”
Not found.

as a subsequent examination has proven, but Lieutenant Colonel Be Saussure stated to me that Captain Seymour had informed him that our fire was so severe against the casemates bearing on my batteries that the men were driven out; and this fact is confirmed by my own observation—that the fire from said casemates ceased about 2 o’clock on Friday, and was never renewed, although on Saturday my glass showed me some men in one of the casemates about to fire, as I thought. Immediately I ordered the two 42-pounders and Bissell’s 64-pounder to fire at the casemate, and the men within disappeared from sight.
Added to the names of Phillips and Campbell as working in the magazine, I must mention McLane and Macbeth, working in the shell magazine. To my knowledge McLane never left his magazine from the firing of the first shell to the surrender of the fort. The captain is a little in error in attributing the accident to the shutter of the middle gun in the Iron battery to the recoil of the gun. In my report to Lieutenant-Colonel DeSaussure you will find it correctly attributed to a shot from Fort Sumter. I most cheerfully agree with the captain in his praise of the gallant conduct of the men who came for the tools and materials to repair the broken lever, but I would not detract from their praise in mentioning that the heavy weights of the shutter and its counterbalance again deranged the lever-bar, so that during Saturday’s engagements it was necessary to prop up the shutter, and fire with it thus open the whole day.
The incident alluded to in reference to Mr. Lining, the judge-advocate of the Seventeenth Begiment, was as follows: Mr. Lining was erecting the flag of the Palmetto Guard on the traverse in rear of the Iron battery when the first shot from Fort Sumter passed within a few feet of him. The captain, thinking the position too exposed for the flag, directed it to be transferred to the traverse on the right (at least that is my impression). Certainly Mr. Lining removed the flag, amid the rush and liiss of several balls flying near him, planted it securely on the traverse to the right, and descended amid the plaudits of his comrades. In all respects, save what I have here menti ned, I fully indorse Captain Cuthbert’s communication, and am obliged to him for the facts recalled to my memory.
There is one somewhat remarkable incident which I beg leave here to record. On Thursday evening our camp was thrown into considerable excitement by the report that the demand was to be made for the surrender of the fort, and when it was reported that a white flag had been sent to Sumter our batteries were all manned, and the men in eager expectation were watching the fort. I was standing on the traverse closing the left flank of the Iron battery. A number of men were around me. Suddenly the United States flag on Fort Sumter was seen to split in two distinct parts, dividing from the front edge to the back just along the lower extremity of the u Union.” I remarked to the men around me, UI wonder if that is emblematical ?” Several remarked that it appeared ominous. For several moments the flag flew in this condition, when it was hauled down and another flag raised in its stead.
Very respectfully,
P. F. STEVENS,
Major and Superintendent, Citadel Academy.

Report of Capt. R. Martin, commanding Mount Pleasant mortar battery.
Mount Pleasant Mortar Battery,
April 17, 1861.
General : I have the honor to submit the inclosed report of practice at battery under my command.* Probably you will see I fired faster than ordered. Captain Ferguson can inform you that Colonel Eipley allowed me to fire faster. The officers and men are in good condition, though much mortified at not being noticed by Major Anderson. After the forty-eighth shot the fort was seen to be on fire, and the excitement was so great no account was kept of the shots. I think we fired about ten shells more.
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

Captain, Commanding Battery.

P. S.—Lieut. F. H. Eobertson, of the Confederate Army, was of great use to me. He was prompt and energetic in the discharge of his duties, and was fully competent to the part assigned him by your order. I cannot close without mentioning the services of Lieut. George N. Eey-nolds, of the Confederate States Army, who acted as ordnance officer. He showed an intimate acquaintance with his duties, and discharged them well. In fact, all the officers behaved coolly, although under no trial but that of excitement.

Mortar Battery No, 2, Sullivan’s Island,
April 16, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit my report upon the service of the mortars under my charge during the bombardment of Fort Sumter on the 12th and 13th instants.
On the night of the 11th the gunners were detailed and at their posts, the mortar pointed, and the battery prepared for immediate action. The following morning the signal for hostilities to commence being announced both from Forts Johnson and Moultrie, we opened fire from this battery upon Fort Sumter. The prescribed intervals for firing were observed, until varied by verbal orders from the lieutenant-colonel commanding, directing me to shorten them, when an increased rate of firing was commenced and continued until dark.
During the night the rate of firing was reduced to one shell in two to three hours, but was again renewed the next morning at the increased rate of the day before, and continued until about noon, when the signal for surrender was observed and the firing ceased.
Omitted as unimportant.

The channel battery, though not called into use, was kept manned and ready for action. The fire of the enemy, which was not at any time concentrated in this direction, was apparently pointed for the •hannel battery, and did no damage except to some of the adjacent houses, the shot generally passing over us.
The officers under my command, Lieutenants Huguenin, Mowry, Blocker, Billings, and Bice, rendered efficient assistance, performing the duties assigned them with zeal and coolness. The men manned the batteries both night and day with alacrity and cheerfulness. I inclose a summary of the firing.

Fort Moultrie, S. 0., April 17,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report concerning the bombardment of Fort Sumter on the 12th and 13th instants by the Sumter battery at Fort Moultrie.
The fire was opened at 4.30 by Lieutenants Bhett and Mitchell, from the second detachment of Company B, Battalion of Artillery. Lieutenants Wagner, Preston, and Sitgreaves, with the whole of Company A, manned the channel battery, to be ready to open fire in the event of the United States fleet attempting to relieve Fort Sumter, and Lieut. C. W. Parker, with three detachments of Company D, manned the oblique battery.
The fire on Fort Sumter was kept up until 6 p. m., with satisfactory results, by detachments from Companies A, B, and D, arranged in reliefs, as was considered necessary or advisable. At 6 p. m. the fire from the Sumter battery ceased, and was resumed at 7 a. m. on the 13th. The fire continued until the surrender of Fort Sumter, under the direction of Lieutenants Wagner, Bhett, Preston, Sitgreaves, Parker, and Mitchell, and Mr. F. D. Blake, aiding and volunteering as lieutenant. All officers and men discharged their duties gallantly and efficiently, and in a manner never surpassed under Similar circumstances.

Colonel : I have the honor to submit the following report of the mortar and enfilading batteries which I commanded during the recent bombardment of Fort Sumter:
Owing to the fact that during the day I considered my personal atten-

tion due more to the enfilading battery than to the mortars, I was chiefly at the guns of the latter [former], but during the night I saw that your orders relative to rate of firing were carried out. For a detailed account, therefore, of the mortar battery I would refer to the report of Captain Bruns to myself. I would call attention to the zeal and energy displayed by Captain Bruns, Lieutenants Flemming and Blanding, who worked at the guns during the whole time exposed to the heavy rains which fell on the morning and night of the 12th. I can say no more than that they performed their duties as became South Carolinians. Lieutenant Flemming commanded. Sergeants O’Crady and Wheat and Private Harlan, of Company B, were also untiring in the performance of their duty.
On the morning of the 12th the enfilading battery opened fire immediately after mortar battery No 1. Their rate of firing was at first much more rapid than that established, but the fire was slackened first to four, then to six and eight, minutes’ interval between each gun. My principal object of the fire from this battery was to dismount the guns on the right and left faces of Fort Sumter exposed to an enfilading fire. The battery during the 12th and the morning of the 13th was the recipient of quite a heavy fire from Sumter, chiefly from his 32-pounders in casemate. One shell from his barbette battery burst over the parapet, but injuring no one. There was more danger from the splinters of the wooden houses near by, which at every discharge were scattered over the men at the guns. At 10 J o’clock on the 12th I opened a ricochetting fire on the western front of Fort Sumter, as it was supposed that re-enforcements were passing in. From this battery six hundred shots were fired—one hundred and twenty-five to each gun.
I would respectfully call your attention to the excellent conduct of all the officers and men of Company K, Infantry Battalion. Lieutenants Valentine and Burnet were always in the right place at the right moment, and assisted me greatly in the management of the battery. For a report by name of the non-commissioned officers and men I would respectfully refer to Lieutenant Valentine, commanding the camp.
Charles Farelly, a citizen of Charleston, was untiring and active in the performance of his volunteer duty. I neglected above to refer to the good conduct of Corporal Smith at the mortar battery. He is reported by Lieutenant Flemming, commanding, as deserving the greatest praise for his general behavior during the bombardment.
Respectfully submitted.

pany B from Sumter battery from 9 o’clock to 11 and from 1 to 3 on Friday, and from 12 to the end of the firing on Saturday. Detachments from Company A were engaged during both days in supplying the hot shot for the guns. The officers were at Sumter battery during the whole engagement.
The conduct of both men and officers under me deserves the highest commendation. All behaved so well that it would be invidious to mention names. I beg to ask that the thanks of vne officers of this command may be tendered to Mr. F. Blake, who volunteered to assist the officers in the arduous duties devolving upon them on account of the smallness of their numbers. The zeal, ability, and gallantry displayed by him deserve the highest commendation.
The men who were at the battery during the night of the 12th were exposed to a violent storm, but submitted with cheerfulness to all their hardships. During the whole engagement the channel battery was manned, ready for the fleet.

Number of shots fired from battery, 611. The object of our firing was to sweep the crest of the parapet, the roofs of the quarters within Fort Sumter, to dismount the barbette guns, if practicable, and to drive the enemy from the parapet. The latter object was accomplished. At this distance it is impossible to discern accurately the result of the firing. The firing from Fort

Sumter against our battery was heavy, but, I am happy to say, ineffectual, and resulted in neither injury to the battery or to the men.
I take great pleasure in bringing to your notice Lieut. B. S.

Reports of Capt. G. B. Guthbert, Palmetto Guard, South Carolina Infantry.
Palmetto Guard Encampment,
Morris Island, April 17,1861.
Dear Sir: In the report which I now make I propose to give an account of the most prominent incidents connected with the batteries manned by the Palmetto Guard, and which transpired during the engagement which took place on the 12th and 13th instant. I will also take occasion to mention the names of those who particularly distinguished themselves by their courage and efficiency. In conclusion I shall render you a statement of the number of shells and solid shot fired from the above-mentioned batteries.
The mortar battery at Cummings Point opened fire on Fort Sumter in its turn, after the signal shell from Fort Johnson, having been preceded by the mortar batteries on Sullivan’s Island and the mortar battery of the Marion Artillery.
At the dawn of day the Iron battery commenced its work of demolition. The first shell from columbiad No. 1, fired by the venerable Edmund Buffin, of Virginia, burst directly upon the parapet of the southwest angle of the fort. After the first round the Iron battery continued firing at regular intervals of fifteen minutes, in accordance with the orders of General Beauregard. The mortar battery continued during the day in the order prescribed.
At 7 o’clock a. m. Major Anderson fired his first shot. This was directed at the Iron battery. The ball passed a few feet above the upper bolts of the shed. The enemy continued firing at too great an elevation until the sixth shot, which fell harmlessly upon the upper portion of the shed, between the embrasures No. 2 and No. 3. At 9 o’clock a. m. columbiad No 1 became disabled by the recoil of the piece, which broke the bolts connecting the chains with the epaulement. This damage was repaired, however, after the expiration of an hour. At 10 o’clock a. m. columbiad No. 2, being aimed at the 10-inch columbiad bearing upon the Iron battery from the parapet of the southwest angle, was fired with such precision as to dismount the grim monster. A few minutes afterwards the window of columbiad No. 2 was struck near the center by a

42-pounder shot, which shattered the bolts and scattered the fragments bet ween the cannoneers. The proper working of this window, however, was not interfered with by this occurrence, but in a half hour after this columbiad recoiled with such violence as to break the lever-bar by which the window was lifted. This casualty prevented the use of this gun until the following morning, several engineers being engaged for the purpose of repairing it. After the second shot from the same piece on the following morning the bar became fractured again in the same place, and, until the surrender, columbiad NTo. 2 was fought with its shutter opened permanently. The tire of the Iron battery was directed during the first day at the guns in barbette and those in the casemates. Major Anderson directed his fire for four consecutive hours, from 7 to 11 o’clock a. m., at the Iron battery, striking it seven times. He then pointed his guns at the mortar battery of Cummings Point, and making no impression upon the unbroken wall of sand he turned his attention to the 42-pounders, thrusting at successive intervals their muzzles along the sides of their palmetto embrasures. At 4 o’clock p. m. the gunners at Fort Sumter ceased firing towards Morris Island, the batteries pointing in that direction being completely silenced. The rifled cannon did great execution, two of its balls passing entirely through the walls of Fort Sumter.
On the morning of the 13th we attempted to breach with our colum-biads by concentrating our fire upon a point to the right of the sallyport, intending thus to effect another object at the same time, viz, by the ricochet of the ball to beat away the traverse of granite, which had been built up for the purpose of protecting the doorway from an enfilading fire. We had fired but a few shots when a shell from the mortar batt ery at Cummings Point fell upon the northwestern portion of the roof of the fort. After the lapse of some minutes we perceived the smoke issuing from that quarter. Soon flames burst upward. From that moment until the flagstaff was shot ‘down seven-second shells were fired rapidly from the Iron battery, aimed in such a manner as to scatter the flame and to increase the fury of the conflagration. I refer you, dear sir, to the marks of shot and shell upon the outer and interior walls of the fort to enable you to form an adequate idea of the accuracy with which the columbiads, the mortars, the rifled cannon, and the 42-pounders of the Cummings Point batteries were aimed and fired.
The posts of the officers of the Palmetto Guard were as follows: Captain Cuthbert commanded and directed the fire of the Iron battery; First Lieutenant Holmes, assisted by Lieutenant Armstrong, of the Citadel Academy, commanded the mortar battery ; Second Lieutenant Brownfield commanded and directed the fire of the 42-pounders ; Captain Thomas, of the Citadel Academy, with a squad of the Palmetto Guard, had charge of the rifled cannon; to Major Stevens was assigned the post of superintending the working of all these batteries, and he was so recognized; Lieutenant Buist acted as gunner to NTo. 3 columbiad during the greater part of the engagement, aiming many of his shots very accurately.
Lieutenants Holmes, Brownfield, and Buist behaved throughout the conflict with distinguished courage and gallantry. Major Stevens, Captain Thomas, and Lieutenant Armstrong, by their coolness, bravery, and skill, gave the highest evidence of their long military training. Lieutenant Brownfield’s 42-pounders were fired with great precision, and to his industry and pride in his battery is attributable the fine working condition of his guns. To Mr. Phillips and Mr. Campbell much praise is due for their untiring devotion to their particular department of the

magazine stores. In the Iron battery, Orderly Sergeant Bissell aimed many a capital shot at the casemates, and the two Sergeants Webb at the parapet. Bissell crippled the gun of the left casemate, bearing directly upon the Iron battery, and Serg. L. S. Webb dismounted the 10-inch columbiad upon the parapet. Second Sergeant Bissell and Mr. Farelly also made some good shots. At the 42-pounders Sergeant Brownfield, Corporals Bhett, Wright, and Dwyer distinguished themselves as gunners. At the mortar battery Sergeant Gaillard, Corporals Bobiuson, Zalam, Brailijon, and Bhett did good service as gunners. Capt. Stephen Elliott, of the Beaufort Artillery, was present during the action on the 12th instant, and aimed several good shots.
On the same day when columbiad No. 2 was silenced in consequence of the serious accident referred to above, to repair the damage it became necessary to send forthwith to Charleston to procure the proper materials and implements. Privates Trouche, Craskeys, and Alrains volunteered to go in an open boat, under heavy fire from Fort Sumter and Fort Johnson. They went, and succeeded in accomplishing their errand. A sand bag on the first day of the engagement seriously interfered with the working of the window of columbiad No. 1. Private Allison volunteered to extricate the troublesome impediment. While engaged in the performance of this important service a ball from one of the casemates of Fort Sumter passed directly over him, striking the iron shed. He removed the bag and returned to his post.
The sang-froid of Mr. Lining, the judge-advocate of the Seventeenth Begiment, who served as a private during the engagement, has already received ample commendation in the public prints. I can vouch for the truth of the incident, having been an eye witness. (Please incorporate the report of the Courier in relation to the circumstance.)
The appointment of the Palmetto Guard to the occupation of Fort Sumter for one night was the highest compliment ever bestowed upon any volunteer corps in the history of our State, and that event will always be held by them in grateful remembrance. Upon reaching the stronghold, however, their labors were not yet finished. I wish to take no laurels from the brows of the members of the fire-engine companies of Charleston, but truth requires that I should state that, from the moment of their being disbanded within the walls of the fort, the Palmetto Guard worked incessantly at the engines until after midnight.
A proper respect for the memory of the dead, as well as the desire to put on record a noble act, induces me recount the following fact: Immediately before the departure of the Palmetto Guard for Fort Sumter, Sergeant Webb, Corporal Bobinson, and Private Mackay placed a neat and appropriate head-piece over the grave of the unfortunate Howe, the first victim of the sad explosion which took place while Major Anderson was engaged in saluting his flag. The performance of this sacred duty did credit to their generous hearts, and proved that Carolina chivalry exists only in combination with a spirit of reverence and magnanimity. 1 am proud of the opportunity of stating that all of the members of the company conducted themselves nobly and bravely in the fight. Nor will those whose names have not been mentioned in this report object to the particular honorable notice of their gallant comrades.
Statement of ammunition expended upon Fort Sumter from the Iron battery: Shell, 60; solid shot, 183.
Ammunition expended from the other batteries of Cummings Point: Mortars, 197 shell; 42-pounders, 333 solid-shot, 3 grape-shot; rifled cannon, 11 shot, 19 shell.

Dear ^ir : I write to make an addition to the report which you received yesterday. Please incorporate the following:
Private Gourdin Young volunteered to accompany Colonel Wigfall in a small boat when the latter gentleman was instructed to proceed to Port Sumter on the fall of the United States flag, for the purpose of inquiring into the cause of that circumstance and to propose a surrender of the fortification. During the passage from Morris Island, amid an incessant fire of shell and grape, he displayed that coolness and determination characteristic of a true South Carolinian. Upon his return he was borne upon the shoulders of his fellow-comrades to the Iron battery.

Report of Capt. J. Gadsden King, commanding Marion Artillery.
Sir : In accordance with your order I beg to report that the Trapier battery on Morris Island, which was manned by the Marion Artillery, under my command, opened fire on Port Sumter at 4 a. m. of Friday, the 12th instant, and continued firing in its turn, at the rate of one shell from each mortar, or three from the battery, every thirty-two minutes, until about 2 o’clock p. in., when the order was given to slack the fire and to fire at double the intervals, or at an interval of four minutes between each mortar in the harbor, which was obeyed until dark, or 7 o’clock, when the firing was reduced to a shell every twenty minutes until 4£ a. m. of Saturday, the 13th instant, when the fire was resumed at the rate of a shell every four minutes until the fort was set on fire by a shell fired from the mortar No. 3 of the battery worked by my command, upon which the fire was quickened by order of Colonel Wig-fall, an aid of General Beauregard, until the fort was in flames, at which time I was ordered to slacken the fire and to fire at the rate of one shell every four minutes as Before, until it was seen that the west and south buildings of the fort alone were going to burn, upon which you ordered me to increase my fire and to drop my shell upon the eastern buildings of the fort, in order to set them on fire. This I tried to do, and at the fifth discharge from my mortars the mortar No. 2 of my battery dropped a shell through the roof of the eastern quarters, as I had ordered, and so set them on fire, thus burning the quarters.
On Friday I twice thought that shells from my battery set the fort on fire, but I am not sure. During the burning of the fort I had the fuse of my shells cut to its full length, so as to allow the shells to fall

and explode in the interior of the fort. The fire was kept up until the flag of Fort Sumter was either burned or shot down, when it was stopped by your order.
The total number of shell fired by the Marion Artillery was one hundred and seventy, of which I feel sure that at least three-fourths either burst on the ramparts or in the fort itself.
Where all behaved so well it is impossible to discriminate between any of them, but I deem it my duty to mention the names of my officers, Lieuts. W. I). H. Kirkwood, J. P. Strohecker, A. M. Huger, and E. L. Parker; Lieutenants Kirkwood and Parker having had immediate charge of the mortars.

Sir : In obedience to the orders of Brigadier-General Beauregard, we left headquarters at 2.20 p. m., charged with a communication from him to Major Anderson, at Fort Sumter, in which we were authorized to demand the evacuation of the fort. We arrived there at 3.45 p. m., under a white flag. Lieutenant Davis, the officer of the day, received us very politely, and on being informed that we had a message in writing for Major Anderson which we desired to deliver in person to the officer in command of the fort, conducted us into the presence of Major Anderson. We were welcomed by the major with great courtesy, who, after receiving and reading our communication, left us to consult with his officers. About 4.30 he again joined us, bringing his reply, the contents of which he stated to us, after which, and but a short time before departing, we held a short conversation with him, in the course of which he made the following remarks: uGentlemen, if you do not batter the fort to pieces about us, we shall be starved out in a few days.57 These words, under the circumstances, seemed to have much significance, and to be of sufficient importance to induce us to report them particularly. We took leave of Major Anderson and the fort at 4.40 p. in., and reached the city at 5.10 p. m. We verbally reported immediately at headquarters the substance of what is written above.

fCHAP. I.
Headquarters Provisional Forces,
Charleston, 8. C., April 12,1861.
Sir : We have the honor to submit the following report of our movements and action:
After leaving the brigadier-general commanding last night, at 11 o’clock p. m., in obedience to orders we repaired with the second communication to Major Anderson, at Fort Sumter. This communication was based on the telegram from Hon. L. P. Walker, expressing a desire not to injure the fort unnecessarily, and wishing to make another effort to avoid any useless effusion of blood. We reached Fort Sumter at 12.45 a. m., delivered the communication, and received Major Anderson’s reply at 3.15 a. m. He expressed his willingness to evacuate the fort on the 15th instant at noon, if provided with the necessary means of transportation, if he should not receive prior to that time contradictory instructions from his Government or additional supplies, and that he would not in the mean time open his fire upon our forces unless compelled to do so by some hostile act against his fort or the flag of his Government by the forces under General Beauregard’s command, or by any portion of them, or by the i)erpetraticn of some act showing a hostile intention on our part against his fort or the flag it bears. His reply, which was shown to us, plainly indicated that if instructions should be received contrary to his purpose to evacuate, or if he should receive supplies, or if the Confederate troops should fire on hostile troops of the United States, or upon transports covered by his flag, although containing men, munitions, and supplies intended for him, and designing hostile operations against us, he would still feel himself bound-to fire upon us, and at liberty not to evacuate Fort Sumter.
These terms being manifestly futile so far as we were concerned, placing us rather at a great disadvantage, and not within the scope of the instructions verbally given us, we promptly refused them and declined to enter into any such arrangements. Under these circumstances, pursuing our instructions, we notified him at once in writing that our batteries would open fire upon him within an hour from that time, which would be at 4.20. We then proceeded at once to Fort Johnson, which we reached at 4 a. in., and to Capt. George S. James, commanding at that post, gave the order to open fire at the time indicated. His first shell was fired at 4.30 a. in., the other batteries generally opening at 4.45 a. m. We were delayed at Fort Sumter longer than we expected, and we think longer than was necessary to decide upon the communication we received, and so indicated to Major Anderson; but this delay we could not avoid.

deliver communications to Brigadier-General Simons, commanding on Morris Island, and passing under the batteries of Fort Johnson landed in the rear of Major Stevens’ battery. Our orders were specifically to ask information as to the condition of the batteries on the island, and any other facts necessary to be communicated from Brigadier-General Simons to the commanding general, and also to establish military communications by land from Morris Island to the city of Charleston. We were moreover instructed to learn the condition of Fort Sumter as far as practicable without unnecessary exposure, and if the bombardment and conflagration within had forced an evacuation by Major Anderson and his command.
At the period of x>assing Fort Sumter about 12 m. the firing from it had ceased, except occasional shots opposite Fort Moultrie, but was kept up with great precision and regularity by the batteries from Fort Johnson, Sullivan’s Island, and Morris Island. The conflagration of the officers’ quarters in the fortress appeared to be on the increase, and although the United States flag was still flying when we landed, there appeared no other evidence of the continuation of the contest.
After communicating with General Simons and establishing a land communication with the city, it was deemed advisable to send a flag to Fort Sumter and demand its evacuation, as at 1.10 p. m. precisely the United States flag had suddenly disappeared from its walls. While a white flag and the boat which bore us over was being made ready to take us, Colonel Wigfall, who had been detailed for special duties on Morris Island, thinking that no time was to be lost lest the garrison be destroyed, and accompanied by Private Young, of the Palmetto Guard, and two oarsmen, hastily entered a sm all skiff and pulled towards the fort with a white flag in his hand. Its size was too small to be distinctly seen by our batteries, and in consequence the discharge of neither shot or shell was discontinued by them, except those on Morris Island. His approach, therefore, to Sumter was one of imminent danger. We saw him after landing disappear into the fort through an embrasure. After the lapse of a short period of time he reappeared upon the pavement at the base of the fortification and re-embarked, directing his course to where we stood, at Major Stevens’s battery. Meantime the flag that had been erected after the flag-staff was cut away was taken down and a white flag run up in its stead. Before reaching the shore on his return Colonel Wigfall gave evidence that Major Anderson had consented to evacuate, which was soon after confirmed. He was received upon the beach by the troops, who for a moment rushed out to meet him, with strong evidences of admiration. We then took Colonel Wig-fall with us in our boat, and returned to the city to report to the general commanding.
Brigadier-General Simons had no specific intelligence to communicate to the general commanding beyond the events narrated; but we take pride and pleasure in reporting the spirit, promptness, and energy which characterized the portion of his command inspected by us.
All of which is respectfully submitted for the information of the general commanding.

Sir: We have the honor, to submit the following report of our visit to Fort Sumter on the 13th instant for the information of the brigadier-general commanding:
After reporting to the general the execution of the orders with which we were charged for Morris Island, and in company with Colonel Wigfall reporting the surrender of Fort Sumter, and also its dangerous condition from the fire occasioned by the hot shot from Fort Moultrie, we proceeded, by order of the brigadier-general commanding, immediately to Southern warf, where we embarked on board the steamer Osiris for Fort Sumter, accompanied by the chief of the city fire department, Mr. Nathan, with a fire engine and its company. On our arrival at Fort Sumter we were met by Dr. Crawford, surgeon of the fort, who directed us to avoid the wharf, as it was in danger of blowing up at any moment from its mines. The doctor conducted us into the presence of Major Anderson, on the opposite side of the fort from the wharf, we entering the fort through an embrasure. We found the barracks totally destroyed by fire, occasioned by our shells and hot shot. We stated to Major Anderson that we had been sent to Fort Sumter by General Beauregard with a fire engine, to offer assistance to extinguish his fire and to render any other assistance he might require, and also Surgeon-General Gibbes, of South Carolina, and assistants were present to administer to any wounded he might have. The major replied that he thanked the general for his kindness, but that his fire was almost burned out, and that he had but one man wounded, and he not seriously. We asked him if the magazine was safe. He replied he thought the lower magazine safe, though it was amid the burnin g ruins, and that he had thrown about one hundred barrels of powder into the water from the upper magazine during the action, for the safety of his command. We again asked him if he did not think it best to use the engine which accompanied us on the steamer, which lay out in the stream. He replied no—that he thought everything had been consumed that would burn.
Major Anderson expressed great satisfaction when we told him that we had no casualties on our side, and again asked us to thank General Beauregard for his kindness; and, on leaving, the major accompanied us himself as far as our small boat. We returned to the city and reported the result of our visit to General Beauregard about 7 p. m.
All of which is submitted for the information of the brigadier-general commanding.

Major: On Friday, April 12, we received orders from General Beauregard to carry dispatches to General Dunovant, commanding on Sullivan’s Island. We were directed to communicate the purport of the dispatches, which were open, to Captain Martin, in command of the floating battery and the Dahlgren-gun battery; to Captain Hallonquist,

in command of the enfilade battery and a masked mortar battery near the same spot; and to Colonel Ripley, in command of Fort Moultrie—all of them posts on Sullivan’s Island. We set out on our mission at 9 o’clock a. m. and proceeded in a boat to Mount Pleasant. After communicating with Captain Martin we rowed over to and landed on the floating Iron battery. We found Lieutenant Yates actively engaged in returning the fire from Fort Sumter, which was then specially directed against his battery. The latter had been repeatedly hit, but had successfully resisted all the shot (32-pounders) which had struck it, with the exception of one, which had passed through the narrow, angular slope just below the roof.
After spending some time in this battery we proceeded to the Dahl-gren-gun battery, where Captain Hamilton was commanding in person. Both the floating battery and the Dahlgren gun were directing their special attention to the dismounting of such of the guns en barbette upon Fort Sumter as the batteries could be brought to bear upon. The fire from both batteries was effective and well sustained. We next visited Captain Hallonquist’s enfilading battery, which was doing some admirable shooting. After remaining here a short time we proceeded to Captain Hallonquist’s mortar battery, and from thence to Fort Moultrie. Here we found <an active, regular, well-sustained, and well-directed firing going on, which was being most vigorously returned by Fort Sumter. The quarters were pretty well riddled, and the furnace for hot shot twice struck, but not materially injured.
After carefully watching the firing for some time we visited Captain Butler’s mortar battery, where we found General Dunovant and delivered our dispatches. We then returned to Fort Moultrie, and after spending about an hour there proceeded back to the cove, where our boat was awaiting us, and touching at the floating battery for a communication for headquarters we rowed over once more to Mount Pleasant, for the purpose of delivering a message from Lieutenant-Colonel Ripley (by request) to Captain Martin. We then returned to the city, which we reached about half-past 4 p. m., and immediately reported verbally at headquarters to the brigadier-general commanding.
We cannot conclude our report without expressing the extreme pleasure and gratification which we felt at the coolness, spirit, skill, and alacrity which we witnessed at all points among the officers and men.

Sir: We have the honor to submit the following report of our visit to Fort Sumter on the 13th instant:
Informed about 1 o’clock that no flag was waving over Fort Sumter, General Beauregard detached us immediately to proceed to the fort and say to Major Anderson that his flag being down and his quarters in flames we were sent to inquire if he needed any assistance. When about half-way from the city to Fort Sumter we observed that the United States flag had been raised again. At once we determined to go bade to the city, but had not proceeded far in return when, discovering a white flag floating from the ramparts of Sumter, we again direct-

ed our course to the fort. On landing we were conducted to the presence of Major Anderson, whom we informed that in consequence of the conflagration in the fort we had been sent by General Beauregard to inquire if he needed any assistance. Major Anderson replied: “ Present my compliments to General Beauregard, and say to him I thank him for his kindness, but need no assistance.” Continuing, the major said: “ Gentlemen, do I understand you have come direct from General Beauregard!” We replied in the affirmative. “Why,” returned Major Anderson, “Colonel Wigfall has just been here as an aide to and by authority of General Beauregard, and proposed the same terms of evacuation offered on the 11th instant.” We informed him we had just left General Beauregard in the city, and had come in obedience to his orders, charged with the message just delivered. The major expressed regret for the misunderstanding, and repeated that he had understood Colonel Wigfall to say he was direct from General Beauregard, and as one of his aides was authorized to propose terms of evacuation. We then inquired if he would reduce to writing the terms proposed by Colonel Wigfall. To which the major replied, certainly he would. Major Anderson then declared that he would immediately run up his flag; that he regretted it had ever been taken down, and that it would not have been lowered if he had not understood Colonel Wigfall to cdbie directly from General Beauregard to treat. We requested that, under the peculiar circumstances, he would not raise his flag until we could communicate to General Beauregard the terms of evacuation with which he had furnished us; he assented to the proposition, and we left the fort.

Charleston, April 15,1861.
Sir: We, the undersigned, beg leave to submit the following report of our visit to Fort Sumter, and of our interview with Major Anderson, on Saturday, the 13th instant, in obedience to your orders.
We arrived at the fort about a quarter to 3 o’clock p. m.; were met at the wharf by Captain Seymour, and were at once conducted to the presence of Major Anderson. We informed him that we came from you to say that, on learning the fort was in flames, and his flag down, you had sent Colonels Miles and Pryor and Captain Lee, members of your staff, to offer any assistance in your power, and that as soon as his flag of truce was hoisted you sent us to receive any propositions he might wish to make. Major Anderson said an exceedingly disagreeable and embarrassing mistake had occurred; that his flagstaff had been shot down, but that as soon as it could be done his flag was again hoisted. Just at this time it was reported to him that General Wigfall was

outside the fort demanding to see the commanding officer. Major Anderson said that he went out and met General Wigfall, who told him that he came from General Beauregard to demand the surrender of the fort, and urged Major Anderson to haul down his flag and run up a flag of truce; that General Beauregard would give him the same terms offered before the conflict began. Major Anderson then stated that he was much surprised to learn from Colonels Miles and Pryor and Captain Lee, who had arrived at the fort soon after he had lowered his flag, that although General Wigfall was on the staff of General Beauregard, he had been two days away from him, and was acting on the staff of some general on Morris Island; that as soon as he (Major Anderson) learned this, he told Captain Lee that he would immediately run up his flag and recommence his firing.
Major Anderson then read to us a note which he had sent to you by the hands of Captain Lee, in which he said that he would surrender the fort on the same terms offered by you in your letter to him on the lltli instant. On learning this we told him that we were authorized to offer him those terms, excepting only the clause relating to the salute to the flag, to which Major Anderson replied it would be exceedingly gratifying to him, as well as to his command, to be permitted to salute their flag, having so gallantly defended the fort under such trying circumstances, and hoped that General Beauregard would not refuse it, as such a privilege was not unusual. We told him we were not authorized to grant that privilege, and asked him what his answer would be if not permitted to salute his flag. He said he would not urge the point, but would prefer to refer the matter again to you, and requested us to see you again and get your reply.
Major Anderson requested us to say to Governor Pickens and yourself that, as an evidence of his desire to save the public property as much as possible, he had three times on Friday and twice on Saturday sent his men up to extinguish the fire under the heavy fire of our batteries, and when the magazines were in imminent danger of being blown up.
We then returned to the city and reported to you substantially as above.
We have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servants,

General : In accordance with your order we have the honor to make the following report:
On Saturday, April 13, at about 7 o’clock p. m., we proceeded to Fort Sumter by your order to arrange finally the conditions of the evacuation. We presented your communication to Major Anderson, who, after perusing it, read it aloud to his officers, all of whom, we believe, were present. The major expressed himself much gratified with the tenor of the communication and the generous terms agreed to by you. We inquired of Major Anderson when he desired to leave. He said as soon as possible, and suggested 9 o’clock the next morning. It was arranged that the Catawba or some other steamer should convey the major and his command either directly to New York or put them on board the United States fleet then lying outside the bar, according as one or the other plan might be agreed upon after a conference with the commander of 5 R R

Charleston, April 16, 1861.
Sir : From the returns received from the various posts I have the unexampled and happy privilege of stating that no serious casualty has occurred during the vigorous action of thirty-three hours in reducing Fort Sumter. Four trifling contusions are reported at Fort Moultrie, but none at other posts, and it is a subject of equal gratification that even in the management of heavy ordnance by new recruits and unpracticed volunteers no accident to life or limb has occurred.
Immediately upon the flag of Fort Sumter being struck I proceeded to that fortress to tender my assistance and hospital at Mount Pleasant to Major Anderson, and received from him the pleasing intelligence that only four cases of slight injuries had resulted to his men. On Sunday a sad casualty occurred in saluting his flag, when the explosion of some loose cartridges beneath a gun struck down seven men. One was instantly killed, and another so seriously wounded that he died soon after reaching my hospital in Charleston; one remaining in the hospital, doing well under the care of Prof. G. G. Chisolm, of the medical college of the State, and four were removed with the garrison. The precipitation suddenly of several regiments upon me during the past few days, totally without any preparation of their surgeons, has required a large supply of medicines, instruments, hospital stores, &c., but I am happy to say they have received promptly all their requisitions.

Anderson the means most acceptable to him for his evacuation the following day.
The major, agreeably to our offer, sent on board of us Lieutenant Snyder to confer with the commander of the fleet off the bar in regard to transportation. I accompanied him out on the morning of the 14th instant, and after a short conference he returned to the fort, where it was arranged that the steamers and all necessary facilities for the removal of the command should be ready at 11 o’clock, and that they should be conveyed to the fleet, and have the option either of taking passage in one of their vessels or of going on the one furnished by the Confederacy.
At 11 o’clock all facilities were at the disposal of Major Anderson, but the work of removal was delayed in consequence of the accidental explosion which killed and wounded five of his command. They were not all embarked until sundown, when it was too late to cross the bar. This, however, was effected early the following morning, and the command shortly afterwards was transferred to the steamer Baltic, one of the transports of the United States.
All of which is respectfully submitted for the information of the brigadier-general commanding.

ammunition, &c., and it has been suggested by the Engineer officer in charge of the work that a few small-arms placed in the hands of his workmen for the protection of the Government property there might be a useful precaution. If the measure should, on being communicated, meet with the concurrence of the commanding officer of the troops in the harbor, I recommend that I may be authorized to issue forty muskets to the Engineer officer.

Col. H. K. Craig,
Chief of Ordnance, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel: Your communication of 1st instant, with its inclosure, in reference to placing forty muskets in the hands of the Engineer officer in charge of Fort Sumter as a precautionary measure proper to this time of excitement, is received. My views are asked on two, or rather three points:
1st. On that which forms the condition of the Secretary’s approval of the issue, namely, that I concur in its expediency;
2d. On the upropriety” of placing the arms in the hands of hired men for the purpose indicated; and,
3d. On the u expediency ” of doing so.
To the first I reply that I have already said in effect, on my post return for last month, that while I do not apprehend that any attempt upon the United States works here will receive the countenance of the State or city authority, it is by some thought that a tumultuary force may be incited by the feeling of the time, and invited by the present disordered condition of the works to make such an attempt without it, and that this possibility makes it incumbent on me to provide as far as I may against it, and forty additional musketeers would then be desirable.
As to the u propriety ” of the issue I see no objection. The arms need not be delivered to the men selected by the Engineer officer till the occasion should actually obtain. The workmen in charge of the property are bound on principles of common law to defend it against purloiners, to say nothing of the 96th Article of War, applicable to all u persons whatsoever receiving pay from the United States.”
The uexpediency” of the measure is quite another question of less obvious features.
There are one hundred and nine men at Fort Sumter, most of them laborers of foreign nativity, of whom it is prudent to be somewhat suspicious, for I am just informed that on some of them being questioned (as is the wont of the times) on the point of their proclivity in the event of secession, replied to the effect that they were indifferent, and intimated that the largest bribe would determine their action, and they

can, you know, discharge themselves of their public obligations at any moment, and thus be free to choose sides.
]STow, forty muskets in the hands of the faithful among them might control the rest, but certainly not on a clbse push from outside. The Engineer officer can, he says, keep the arms beyond the physical possibility of being taken from him by the untrustworthy, and he can cut off all communication peremptorily with citizens. Now, unless some such precaution be taken, this large body of laborers may, in the possible event in question, unrestrainedly deliver up the post and its contents on a bribe or demand. Meanwhile they cannot be removed outside of that isolated island post, which has not a foot of ground beyond the walls of the fort. In this connection I may add that at this post too (Fort Moultrie) we have about fifty laborers of like description with known secession propensities, as they are residents permanently of this quarter.
On the point of expediency, then, I am constrained to say that the only proper precaution—that which has no objection—is to fill these two companies with drilled recruits (say fifty men) at once, and send two companies from Old Point Comfort to occupy respectively Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney.
I am, colonel, vours respectfully,
JNO. L. GARDNER, Brevet Colonel, TJ. S. Army.
[Indorsement.]
Ordnance Office, November 8,1860.
Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War, with the remark that as the issue of forty muskets, approved by him 31st ultimo, was contingent on the approval of Colonel Gardner, it is probable that the issue has not and will not be made without further orders.

Col. H. K. Craio,
Chief of Ordnance, TJ. S. A., Washington, D. C.:
Sir : On the 7th instant I received an order from Colonel Gardner, commanding troops in the harbor, to issue to him all of the fixed ammunition for small-arms (percussion caps, primers, &c.) at this arsenal, such a step being advisable, in his estimation, for the better protection of the property in view of the excitement now existing in this city and State. Being allowed no discretion in the matter, his order being peremptory, I proceeded to obey it on the afternoon of the 8th. Captain Seymour having come up from Fort Moultrie, with a detachment of men and a schooner, for the purpose of removing the stores, the shipment of them was interfered with by the owner of the wharf until the city authorities could be notified, and there were but three or four cart-loads on board. I considered it best that they should be reconveyed to the magazine until something definite should be determined upon, which was done. Not having heard anything further from Colonel Gardner relative to this matter, I conceive it my duty to report the facts in the case, which I respectfully submit.
Very respectfully, I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

Col. S. Cooper,
Adjutant-General, Washington City:
Sir : In compliance with instructions from the Secretary of War of the 6th instant, I inspected the fortifications and troops in Charleston Harbor, and have now the honor to report as follows :
FORT MOULTRIE.
This post is garrisoned by Companies E and H, First Artillery, and the regimental band is quartered there.
State of the command.
Field and staff.—Bvt. Col. John L. Gardner, lieutenant-colonel First Artillery, commanding; Asst. Surg. Samuel W. Crawford, medical department.
Company officers.—Capt. Miner Knowlton, Company H, absent sick since August 12, 1850; Capt. Abner Doubleday, commanding Company E ; Bvt. Capt. Truman Seymour, first lieutenant, commanding Company H; First Lieut. Otis H. Tillinghast, regimental quartermaster, and acting adjutant at regimental headquarters, absent since May 29, 1860; First Lieut. Theodore Talbot, Company H; First Lieut. Jefferson C. Davis, Company E; Second Lieut. Samuel Breck, Company E, on duty at the'Military Academy since September 13, 1860; Second Lieut. Norman J. Hall, Company H, acting assistant quartermaster and acting assistant commissary of subsistence since September 1,1880, and post adjutant.
Enlisted men.—Band and staff, 9 musicians, 1 hospital steward, 1 ordnance sergeant absent.
Companies E and H, for duty, 36; on extra or daily duty, 13; sick, 4; in arrest or confinement, 11; absent in confinement, 2. Total, 64. Present at inspection, 30; artillery drill, 21; infantry drill, 23; comprising all who, in the opinion of the commanding officer, could with propriety and safety be taken from other duties.
The officers—Lieutenant Talbot in delicate health excepted—are in good health, and capable of enduring the fatigues incident to any duty that may be demanded of them. They are sober, intelligent, and active, and apjiear acquainted with their general duties, perform them with some exceptions punctually and promptly, and all are anxious to give the commanding officer the aid to which he is entitled.
The non-commissioned officers and privates appear intelligent and obedient, but do not move with an alacrity and spirit indicating the existence of a strict discipline.

ing for the defense of the fort. In other respects the police of the post is good.

The hospital and storehouses are outside the forts. All are old frame buildings, highly inflammable, and not secured by the presence or watchful eye of a sentinel from the acts of evil-disposed persons. An incendiary could in a few minutes destroy all the supplies and workshops of the command.
Lieutenant Hall states that he has some difficulty in procuring suitable flour and pork in Charleston, sometimes having to return the former, while the latter cannot at times be purchased. He has about two months’ supply of provisions for the present command.
** * # # # # #
The ungarded state of the fort invites attack, if such design exists, and much discretion and prudence are required on the part of the commander to restore the proper security without exciting a community prompt to misconstrue actions of authority. I think this can be effected by a proper commander, without checking in the slightest the progress of the engineers in completing the works of defense. Any interference with that labor would probably rouse suspicions and create excitement. All could have been easily arranged several weeks since, when the danger was foreseen by the present commander. Now much delicacy must be practiced. The garrison is weak, and I recommend that a favorable opportunity be taken to fill up the companies with the best-drilled recruits available.
# # # * # # • #
The following events, which transpired the day I arrived at Fort Moultrie, I deem proper to report here, as I have orally heretofore, as they relate to an act of unusual importance, tending to indicate the inflammable and impulsive state of the public mind in Charleston—to a great extent characteristic of the feeling manifested throughout the State— and necessity for prudence and judgment on the part of the commanding officer in all transactions which may bear upon the relations of the Federal Government to the State of South Carolina, and of the Army to our citizens. I regard it especially important to refer to them, as Colonel Gardner informed me he should make no report.
The military storekeeper has at the arsenal in the city a large number of arms and quantity of ammunition, Avhicli, fearing it might tall into improper hands, he desired to secure to the United States, and under counsel from Colonel Gardner he packed them up and held in readiness to be shipped to Fort Moultrie whenever Colonel Gardner should send for them. Availing himself of an approved requisition for paints, lacquers, &c., needed at the post, he sent Captain Seymour to the city for the supply and other articles that the military storekeeper might wish to have stored at the post, and thus secured in case of negro insurrections. The owner of the wharf refused permission to ship them. A crowd collected, and suspecting an attempt on the part of the Government to smuggle (it being late in the evening, or after dark) arms, ammunition, &c., from the city, to be used against it, or to prevent their use by citizens in case of disturbances, would not permit the property to be carried away.
FORT SUMTER.
Fort Sumter is not completed, and is now occupied by the Engineers, under the direction of Lieutenant Snyder (Captain Foster being absent),

who has employed upon it some hundred and ten men. A portion of the armament is mounted, but for its defense a few regular soldiers, to overawe the workmen and to control them, only would be necessary at present. The lower embrasures are closed, and if the main gate be secured a storming-party would require ladders twenty feet in length to gain admission. No arms are here, and I doubt if they would be serviceable in the hands of workmen, who would take the side of the stronger force present. Unless it should become necessary I think it advisable not to occupy this work so long as the mass of engineer workmen are engaged in it. The completion of those parts essential for the accommodation of a company might be hastened. The magazine contains thirty-nine thousand four hundred pounds of powder. The number of guns on hand is seventy*eight, consisting of 8 and 10 inch colum-biads, 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, 42 pounder guns, and 32 and 24-pounders, with carriages, shot, shell, implements, &c.
CASTLE PINCKNEY.
Castle Pinckney commands Charleston, and its armament is complete. Here the powder belonging to the arsenal in the city is stored. A company can be accommodated here, while a small force under an officer would secure it against surprise or even a bold attack of such enemies likely to undertake it. It is under the charge of an ordnance sergeant, who keeps everything in as good order as possible. The quarters and magazine require repairs. Under present circumstances I would not recommend its occupation.

Fort Moultrie, S. C., November 14, 1860.
Col. R. E. De Eussy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers, IT. 8. A., Washington, Z). 0.: Colonel: I have the honor to inform you that I arrived hereon the morning of the 11th instant. I found that the pintle blocks for the howitzer embrasures at Fort Moultrie had not arrived, and that the work was waiting for them. The communications being finished connecting the interior of the caponieres with the interior of the fort, and no cover for them being prepared as yet, I judged it prudent to construct temporary flanking arrangements at once, in consideration of the peculiar state of the public feeling here and the wishes of several officers of the garrison, including the commanding officer. These I commenced yesterday morning and completed last night, including the construction of temporary platforms and placing four field pieces in position. These temporary flanking arrangements occupy the positions that the caponieres are to occupy, one of them having its lines four feet within the walls of the caponiere, so as to give room for the masons to work. This temporary construction can therefore stand until I finish the outside caponiere, which I shall do as soon as possible without waiting longer for the pintle stones.
I have made these temporary defenses as inexpensive as possible, and they consist simply of a stout board fence, ten feet high, surmounted by strips filled with nail-points, with a dry-brick wall two bricks thick on the inside, raised to the height of a man’s head, and pierced with embrasures and a sufficient number of loopholes. Their immediate construction has satisfied and gratified the commanding officer, Colonel Gardner, and they are, I think, adequate to the present wants of the garrison.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir: In obedience to the instructions of the War Departmeut I came to this place and have assumed command of the arsenal. The excitement concerning this arsenal which existed here a short time since is very much allayed, and this result is in a great measure due to the prudence and discretion of the military storekeeper, Mr. Humphreys, whose conduct on the occasion meets my commendation.

Col. S. Cooper,
Adjutant- General, TJ. 8. Army:
Colonel : In compliance with verbal instructions from the honorable Secretary of War, I have the honor to report that I have inspected the forts of this harbor. As Major Porter has recently made a report in relation to them, I shall confine my remarks mainly to other matters, of great importance, if the Government intends holding them. At Fort Moultrie the Engineer, Captain Foster, is working very energetically on the outer defenses, which will, should nothing unforseen occur to prevent, be finished and the guns mounted in two weeks. There are several sand hillocks within four hundred yards of our eastern wall, which offer admirable cover to approaching parties, and would be formidable points for sharpshooters. Two of them command our work. These I shall be compelled to level, at least sufficiently to render our position less insecure than it now is. When the outworks are completed, this fort, with its appropriate war garrison, will be capable of making a very handsome defense. It is so small that we shall have little space for storing our provisions, wood, &c. The garrison now in it is so weak as to invite an attack, which is openly and publicly threatened. We are about sixty, and have a line of rampart of 1,500 feet in length to defend. If beleaguered, as every man of the command must be either engaged or held on the alert, they will be exhausted and worn down in a tew days and nights of such service as they would then have to undergo.
At Fort Sumter the guns of the lower tier of casemates will be mounted, the Engineer estimates, in about seventeen days. That fort is now ready for the comfortable accommodation of one company, and, indeed, for the temporary reception of its proper garrison.
Captain Foster states that the magazines (4) are done, and in excellent condition ; that they now contain 40,000 pounds of cannon powder and a full supply of ammunition for one tier of guns. This work is the key to the entrance of this harbor ; its guns command this work, and could soon drive out its occupants. It should be garrisoned at once. Castle Pinckney, a small casemated work, perfectly commanding the city of Charleston, is in excellent condition, with the exception of a few

repairs, which will require the expenditure of about $500. They are— 1 st, replacing three water casks and the old banquette on the gorge; 2d, repairing one of the cisterns and the old palisading, which, though much rotten, may at a trifling expense be made to answer for the present; 3d, making six shutters for the embrasures and doing some slight work to the main gates. Two mortars and a few other articles belonging to this work were taken to the United States Arsenal in Charleston some months since for repair. They are still there. I shall ask the officer in charge to return them as soon as he can. The magazine is not a very good one; it contains some rifle and musket powder, said to be good, and also some cannon powder reported damaged. The powder belongs to the arsenal. It is, in my opinion, essentially important that this castle should be immediately occupied by a garrison, say, of two officers and thirty men. The safety of our little garrison would be rendered more certain, and our fort would be more secure from an attack by such a holding of Castle Pinckney than it would be from quadrupling our force. The Charlestonians would not venture to attack this place when they knew that their city was at the mercy of the commander of Castle Pinckney. So important do I consider the holding of Castle Pinckney by the Government that I recommend, if the troops asked for cannot be sent at once, that I be authorized to place an Engineer detachment, consisting, say, of one officer, two masons, two carpenters, and twenty-six laborers, to make the repairs needed there. They might be sent without any opposition or suspicion, and would in a short time be sufficiently instructed in the use of the guns in the castle to enable their commander to hold the castle against any force that could be sent against it. If my force was not so very small I would not hesitate to send a detachment at once to garrison that work. Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney must be garrisoned immediately if the Government determines to keep command of this harbor.
I need not say how anxious I am—indeed, determined, so far as honor will permit—to avoid collision with the citizens of South Carolina. Nothing, however, will be better calculated to prevent bloodshed than our being found in such an attitude that it would be madness and folly to attack us. There is not so much of feverish excitement as there was last week, but that there is a settled determination to leave the Union, and to obtain possession of this work, is apparent to all. Castle Pinckney, being so near the city, and having no one in it but an ordnance sergeant, they regard as already in their possession. The clouds are threatening, and the storm may break upon us at any moment. I do, then, most earnestly entreat that a re-enforcement be immediately sent to this garrison, and that at least two companies be sent at the same time to Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney—half a company, under a judicious commander, sufficing, I think, for the latter work. I feel the full responsibility of making the above suggestions, because I firmly believe that as soon as the people of South Carolina learn that I have demanded re-enforcements, and that they have been ordered, they will occupy Castle Pinckney and attack this fort. It is therefore of vital importance that the troops embarked (say in war steamers) shall be designated for other duty. As we have no men who know anything about preparing ammunition, and our officers will be too much occupied to instruct them, I respectfully request that about half a dozen ordnance men, accustomed to the work of preparing fixed ammunition, be sent here, to be distributed at these forts.
Two of my best officers, Captain Seymour and Lieutenant Talbot, are delicate, and will, I fear, not be able to undergo much fatigue.

With these three works garrisoned as requested, and with a supply of ordnance stores, for which I shall send requisitions in a few days, I shall feel that, by the blessing of God, there may be a hope that no blood will be shed, and that South Carolina will not attempt to take these forts by force, but will resort to diplomacy to secure them. If we neglect, however, to strengthen ourselves, she will, unless these works are surrendered on their first demand, most assuredly immediately attack us. I will thank the Department to give me special instructions, as my position here is rather a politico-military than a military one.
I presume, also, that the President ought to take some action in reference to my being a member of the Military Academy Commission, which is to reconvene in the city of Washington in a few days.

Major: The Secretary of War desires that you will communicate, with the least delay practicable, the present state of your command, and everything which may relate to the condition of the work under your charge and its capabilities of defense, together with such views as you may have to suggest in respect to the same. He desires to be informed whether, in view of maintaining the troops ready for efficient action and defense, it might not be advisable to employ reliable persons, not connected with the military service, for purposes of fatigue and police.

Col. R. E. De Russy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers, U. S. A., Washington, D. C.: Colonel : I have the honor to inform you that, yesterday, at the request of Major Anderson, now in command of Fort Moultrie, I accompanied him on a visit to the other forts in the harbor, viz, Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney, for the purpose of examining their condition and capacities for defense. Fort Sumter, having all the arches of the second tier turned, and a commencement made in laying the flagging; the traverse circle of the first tier reset; the flagging inside of the circles, on one face, laid ready for the guns to be mounted; preparations completed for mounting all the guns of this tier as fast as the flagging is laid; the floors in one barrack laid; officers’ quarters completed; the whole of the barbette tier ready for the armament, presented an excellent appearance of preparation and strength equal to seventy per cent, of its efficiency when finished.
In the opinion of Major Anderson it is ready for, and ought to receive,

at least one company, and I understand him to be about to ask for that garrison immediately.
We next visited Castle Pinckney, which was found in excellent order, with the exception of some repairs required on the wooden banquette on the gorge, first tier, some new casemate embrasure shutters, and the second cistern to be rebuilt. All other parts of the work were in good order, as it had but recently been thoroughly repaired with the above exceptions.
Major Anderson is about to urge upon the Department the sending of one company, also, to this fort, which commands the city of Charleston. In that case I think the second cistern should be repaired at once, and also the necessary renewal given to the decayed wooden banquette, over the cisterns on the gorge, and to the casemate shutters. J would, therefore, respectfully ask for the sum of six hundred dollars from the “Contingencies of fortifications” for this purpose. Regarding the shutters as necessary to be repaired at once, I am, in anticipation of your approval, having it done at this time.
There is another matter in connection with this work which Major Anderson suggested, and which may become important in view of the unsettled state of the public mind here, the temper of which seems not to be improving, and that is, to garrison Castle Pinckney with Engineer employes in case the Department does not consider it expedient to send troops for the purpose. At his request I have made an estimate of the
cost, as follows :
# # # # # # #
Total for the first month........................................... $1,600
The second month will be............................................ 1,050
I consider it proper to give you the above information, in order that you may be fully aware of what is transpiring.

Col. S. Cooper,
Adjutant-General U. S. A.:
Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 24th instant. I presume that my letter of the 23d has been received, and that the Department is now in possession of my views in reference to the measures I deem advisable and necessary for keeping this work and this harbor. Your letter confines my answer to what refers to the work under my charge. I cannot but remark that I think its security from attack would be more greatly increased by throwing garrisons into Castle Pinckney and Fort Sumter than by anything that can be done in strengthening the defenses of this work. There are several intelligent and efficient men in this community, who, by intimate intercourse with our Army officers, have become perfectly well acquainted with this fort, its weak points, and the best means of attack. There appears to be a romantic desire urging the South Carolinians to have possession of this work, which was so nobly defended by their ancestors in 1776^ and the State, if she determines to act on the aggressive, will exert herself to take this work. The accompanying report exhibits the present state of my command. I think I can rely upon their doing their duty, but you will see how sadly deficient we are in numbers, whether to repel a coup de main or to maintain a siege. We finished mounting our guns this morning, and I shall soon commence drilling and exercising my men in firing with muskets and cannon. I find that in consequence of sickness, &e., very little military duty has been attended to here for a long time 5 we shail try, and I hope to succeed in regaining the lost ground. This work, when Captain Foster finishes the ditch, counterscarp, and bastionettes on which he is now at work, and executes the addition of a half battery at the northwest angle of the fort, which I have urged him to commence immediately, will be in good condition. I would have preferred having a ditch (wet), but the captain informs me that he could not make it, in consequence of the quicksand. I will send a requisition in a few days (I am very constantly occupied now) for certain ordnance stores. Among them I shall embrace a couple of Coehorns, say four mountain howitzers and twenty of the heaviest revolvers, with a supply of ammunition. I believe that we have no muskets for firing several charges. I would have been pleased

79
to get four of them for the half bastion, but if there are none I will re* place them by something else. I would like to get these articles as soon as possible, as I wish to practice our men with the different arms I may have to use. God forbid, though, that I should do so. Colonel Huger has just left me 5 he came down stating that there was the greatest excitement in the city on account of a rumor that the Adger was bringing out four companies. Some of the gentlemen were in favor of taking steamers and going out to intercept the Adger. He has just returned. I told him that I had no intelligence of anything of the kind.
In reply to the suggestion of the honorable Secretary about the expediency of employing reliable persons not connected with the military service, for purposes of fatigue and police, I must say that I doubt whether such could be obtained here. They would certainly be of great assistance to us. The excitement here is too great. Captain Foster informs me that an adjutant of a South Carolina regiment applied to him for his rolls, stating that he wished to enroll the men for military duty. The captain told him that they had no right to do it, as the men were in the pay of the United States Government. I presume that every able-bodied man in this part of the State, not in the service of the General Government, is now being or has been enrolled.
I will thank the Government to give me special instructions in reference to a question which may arise in these cases:
What shall I do if the State authorities demand from Captain Foster men who they may aver have been enrolled into the State service ? Cap rain Foster will probably send such cases to me; what shall I do with them ?
I hope that my command will very soon be strengthened, so far at the least as filling up these companies to the legal standard. This would enable me, at all events, to have our proper garrison military duties properly attended to.
I am inclined to think that if I had been here before the commencement of expenditures on this work, and supposed that this garrison would not be increased, I should have advised its withdrawal, with the exception of a small guard, and its removal to Fort Sumter, which so perfectly commands the harbor and this fort.

Col. E. E. De Eussy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers, TI. 8. A., Washington, D. C.: Colonel : I wrote you a few days since in relation to certain contingencies of defense which might occur before long in this harbor. I only wish to add now that if the War Department decides not to send more soldiers here, but to avail itself of the Engineer force to guard Forts Sumter and Pinckney, I shall require the assistance of another Engineer officer. For several reasons my personal attention is required at Fort Moultrie just now. I require Mr. Snyder to give his personal attention to Fort Sumter, and such other matters as arise from time to time. In all probability it will soon become necessary to confine his duties more closely to Fort Sumter, and if I have to supply men to Castle Pinckney I shall want another Engineer officer to direct their labors and duties.
It is not certain that the emergency requiring the above division of the Engineer duties under my charge will arise, but it is better to be prepared, and I would respectfully urge you to grant my request, and, if so, that I may have the services of the officer detailed as soon as possible.

C.
I have entered upon the preliminary arrangements for commencing work, and on Monday, the 3d of December, shall place in Castle Pinckney the number of men authorized by the Department, with all the necessary arrangements for subsistence, lodging, &c., so that they may not leave the work until they are withdrawn.
Major Anderson, at my request, has kindly consented to detail an officer to assist me until an Engineer officer can be sent me for this purpose, for I regard it as necessary that an officer shall be constantly present at this work after the repairs are commenced. Lieut. J. C. Davis is to be detailed, and is to report to me. I trust, however, that this temporary detail will not induce any delay in sending me another officer, as Major Anderson needs the services of all in his command. 1 shall endeavor to have the repairs promptly made, and to secure a proper protection to the property of the United States. In doing this it will be indispensable that I have the men instructed, to a certain extent, in the service of the guns, and also in the manual of arms, if I can arrange with Colonel Huger to have the requisite number of muskets sent from the arsenal. I shall also have Lieut. G. W. Snyder take up his quarters in Fort Sumter, and give like instructions to about fifty picked men, in. whom I can place reliance in case of an emergency.
I beg you to understand, however, that I do not regard all these arrangements as absolutely demanded by anything that now appears, but rather as a safe precaution in view of what may appear any day, if anything

more exciting than usual occurs to stimulate the extremely rash persons among a community already sufficiently excited upon the subject of their State relations.
I think that more troops should have been sent here to guard the forts, and I believe that no serious demonstration on the part of the populace would have met such a course. But, as it is decided not to do this, and to rely instead upon the Engineer employes for protection of the public property, I shall do everything in my power to carry out this purpose.

Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, and regret that I have to report that things look more gloomy than the day at the date of my last communication. Captain Seymour, just returned from the city, reports that the excitement there is very great. Col. E. B. White and other gentlemen, with whom he conversed, stated that the people of Charleston would not allow another man or any kind of stores to be landed at or for these forts. They say that anything which indicates a determination on the part of the General Government to act with an unusual degree of vigor in putting these works in a better state of defense will be regarded as an act of aggression, and will, as well as either of the other acts mentioned above, cause an attack to be made on this fort.
Two Charlestonians who were down here to-day remarked to me that as soon as the State seceded she would demand the surrender of the forts, and that if not given up, they would be taken; but that this would not be done sooner unless some action on the part of the Government proved that it was preparing to hold possession of them.
The agent of the boat which brought the 24-pounder howitzer and ammunition is severely censured for having brought them, and the agent of the steamer James Adger was told that any vessel bringing troops here would not be safe in this harbor. Since writing the above I have seen Assistant Surgeon Crawford, who has also been in the city. He says that never until to-day did he believe that our position was critical. One of his friends told him that we would have trouble in less than fifteen days. He thinks that they will first attempt to take Fort Sumter, which they (justly) say will control* this work. Castle Pinckney they regard as theirs already. Mr. King, the intendant of this island, told the doctor that as soon as the act of secession was passed a demand would be made on me to surrender this fort. All these remarks lead to the same conclusion—a fixed purpose to have these works. The question for the Government to decide—and the sooner it is done the better—is, 6 R R

whether, when South Carolina secedes, these forts are to be surrendered or not. If the former, I must be informed of it, and instructed what course I am to pursue. If the latter be the determination, no time is to be lost in either sending troops, as already suggested, or vessels of war to this harbor. Either of these courses may cause some of the doubting States to join South Carolina.
I shall go steadily on, preparing for the worst, trusting hopefully in the God of Battles to guard and guide me in my course. I think it probable that in the present highly excited state of these people, the sending of the detachment of Engineer laborers to Castle Pinckney may bring on that collision which we are so anxious to avoid. I shall consult with Captain Foster on his return to the island, and if convinced that it will lead to that result, will assume the responsibility of suspending the execution of that plan for the present. This fort, in consequence of the unfinished state of our repairs, &c., is not in a condition for inviting an attack. Captain Seymour says that he is satisfied they intend erecting a battery on the upper end of this island, to command the inner channel. I do not know what course to advise. They are making every preparation (drilling nightly, &c.) for the fight which they say must take place, and insist on our not doing anything. We are now certainly too weak to fight. Were we to guard against a surprise, our men, if surrounded by only an undisciplined mob, would soon be worn out by fatigue.
I learn from Captain Ord that attempts have been made, by offers of heavy sums, to induce men at Old Point to join a Southern army. I have not heard that any attempts have been made to tamper with our men, who thus far cheerfully perform the arduous and ceaseless duties imposed upon them in consequence of the smallness of the command.
I ought, perhaps, to mention, as an indication of the expectation of the citizens of Charleston, that three friends of the ladies of our officers have within a day or two been pressed most urgently to go to the city to stay with them there.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Maj. R. Anderson:
Sir : Your letter of November 28 has been received. The Secretary of War has directed Brevet Colonel Huger to repair to this city, as soon as he can safely leave his post, to return there in a short time. He desires you to see Colonel Huger, and confer with him prior to his departure on the matters which have been confided to each of you.
It is believed, from information thought to be reliable, that an attack will not be made on your command, and the Secretary has only to refer to his conversation with you, and to caution you that, should his convictions unhappily prove untrue, your actions must be such as to be free from the charge of initiating a collision. If attacked, you are, of course, expected to defend the trust committed to you to the best of your ability.

Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that I have seen Captain Foster, and that he says that he told several gentlemen in Charleston yesterday that he intended commencing at once certain repairs at Castle Pinckney. He is satisfied, from the manner in which his remark was received, that no offense will be taken at his putting his workmen in the Castle. 1 shall, consequently, not interpose any objection to his doing so. He has applied to me for an officer to take charge temporarily of his workmen until an Engineer officer can be sent on, and although I cannot very well spare one, I shall, in consideration of my regarding that detachment as really acting the part of an advance guard for my command, take the responsibility7 of assigning Lieutenant Davis to that duty.
Captain Foster thinks that he will finish the small projection at the northwest salient of this work to morrow, and he will then repoint the walls of this fort (a work very essential) and commence digging a shallow wet ditch at or near the foot of the wall. The presence of quicksand prevents his digging a regular ditch, but he can dig one that will afford such an obstruction as will, with ordinary7 precaution, prevent our works being carried by a rush.
When he has finished these works I shall feel that, by the blessing of God, even my little command will be enabled to make such a resistance that the authorities of South Carolina will, though they may surround, hardly venture to attack us. We expect a full supply of provisions about the 10th of this month. I trust that such arrangements will be made as will secure their delivery, as well as that of the supply of ordnance and ordnance stores recently required.
Then, with men merely enough to enable us to keep up a respectable guard without wearing our men out, I would, in humble reliance on Providence, feel ready for any emergency that could reasonably occur.
I am, colonel, very respectfully your obedient servant,

said he could not issue them without authority from Washington, not even for the short time that I want them, and I declined at the time to request him to write for this authority 5 but after consulting with Major Anderson to-day we are both agreed that it is best to write for the requisite authority at once, and I therefore make the above request.

Colonel : Captains Doubleday and Seymour said to-day that when they gave me their opinions a few days ago on the feasibility of securing reliable men here to perform police and fatigue duty they did not think of some discharged soldiers, who they now say could be hired for that purpose. My opinion, as expressed, that I doubted whether any reliable men could be hired here, was based upon their opinions and upon my knowledge of the deep interest and excitement of the populace here.
I shall be pleased, then, to receive authority and instructions to employ eight or ten men for the purposes suggested. This will give one relief for my guard, garrison, and battery, or interior.
Captain Foster has just reported that he left Lieutenant Davis and twenty of the detachment of laborers, designed to make repairs in Castle Pinckney, in that work, with one month’s supply of provision.
Fourteen men will be added to that party to-morrow. The captain spoke of his having placed Lieutenant Davis and the party in the Castle whilst in the city, and he said that there was not the least appearance of excitement about it.
Lieutenant Davis has been cautioned to act with the greatest discretion and caution.
Hoping that everything may go on smoothly here for some time longer at least, and assuring you that I shall do everything in my power to add to the strength of my defenses,

Col. R. E. De Russy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers:
Colonel : I have been obliged to vary the plan which I indicated in my last letters as the one I intended to follow in order to carry out the wishes of the Department concerning the security of the works under my charge. In consequence of recent developments of the state of feeling

## p. 85 (#101) #############################################

﻿Chap. I.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------UNION.	85
among my men, I do not now judge it proper to give them any military instruction, or to place arms in their hands; at least this is the case with reference to the men at Fort Sumter. I do not think that any of them will go so far in the defense of public property as to fight an armed body of the citizens of this State. I ascertained this for the first time, to-day, of the men in Fort Sumter, where I had been confident that I could rely in any emergency, at least upon the Baltimore mechanics, about fifty in number.
But the overseer ascertained last night that they were disinclined to use force to resist an attempt to seize the fort on the part of the citizen soldiers of the State, although willing to resist a mob. The men in Castle Pinckney, placed there as I intended, on the 3d instant, being picked men, may prove more reliable. But the feeling here in regard to secession is become so strong that almost all are entirely influenced by it. I therefore judge it best to suspend all idea of arming them at present. I may mention that I exercised as much care as possible in placing this working party in Castle Pinckney, so as not to give cause for apprehension of arming to the citizens. The greatest prudence was exercised, and the best men placed there, under charge of a prudent and reliable officer, Lieutenant Davis. Every precaution is also taken at Fort Sumter, where Lieutenant Snyder has taken up his quarters. Having done thus much, which is all I can do in this respect, I feel that I have done my duty, and that if any overt act takes place, no blame can properly attach to me. I regret, however, that sufficient soldiers are not in this harbor to garrison these two works. The Government will soon have to decide the question whether to maintain them or to give them up to South Carolina. If it be decided to maintain them, troops must instantly be sent, and in large numbers. If it be decided to give them up, the present arrangement will answer very well, only I should be informed, in order that I may know how to act.
At present I have given orders to Lieutenants Snyder and Davis to resist to the utmost any attempt or any demand on the forts in which they are stationed.
The plan of the leaders in this State appears to be, from all that I can see and hear, first, to demand the forts of the General Government, after secession, and then, if refused, to take them by force of arms. A quite large party is in favor of not waiting to ask the General Government, but to summon the immediate commanders, and, if refused, to attack at once. All of this is not, of course, strictly in the line of my profession; still, I judge it proper to write you fully and plainly, so that you may know exactly how we are placed. Here in Fort Moultrie the two companies of the garrison having dwindled to half their proper size, are so weak that Major Anderson demands all the auxiliary defense that I can give him. I am now digging a wet ditch around the work, which, although necessarily shallow from the quicksand, will more than double the difficulty of scaling the walls. The major also requires a fraise to be placed around the coping, but I cannot commence it until I finish the work in hand.
I shall to-morrow complete the “cut” at the northwest angle, which I have enlarged somewhat in the form of a bastionette, by building straight up from the foundation a wall at the angle, extending ten feet from the angle on each face, and then uniting by oblique returns with the very sloping face of the scarp wall. This gives a very excellent position for four or more muskets, to flank the west face of the work. The marginal sketch gives an imperfect idea of it. It is singular that a small cut, as indicated on the map in the Engineer Office,

[Chap. I.
was originally built at this angle, but subsequently, and apparently not many years since, destroyed by breaking off the upper part of the side walls, throwing the debris into the cut, and covering the parapet over it. I completed to-day the bastionette at the southwest angle, except the embrasures, the stones and some of the irons for which have not
yet been received. Before taking down the temporary bastionette at the southeast angle and commencing the permanent one, I shall, for the greater security of the small garrison, run out a wooden machicoulis gallery over the angle of the wall, and also complete the pointing of all large crevices in the scarp.
The posterns on the east and west curtains have been bricked up at Major Anderson’s request, as he felt too weak to use them for sorties, and as the doors might be burst in, both the iron and wood work being old and defective.
I have been liberal of assistance in increasing the defensive capacities of the fort, for I felt that the necessity required it. I have about 125 men at work here now, and shall continue the same number for two or three days, until I complete the ditch. On Fort Sumter I have about 115, and at Castle Pinckney 30, making a total of 260 men employed. The first of the embrasure stones for Fort Sumter having been received, the embrasures of the second tier will be immediately commenced.

The only cannon or ammunition, excepting a few primers, which have been ordered to Fort Moultrie since September, 1859, were four small flank howitzers with their carriages and implements, and one hundred canisters and twenty-five shells for each. These supplies were furnished on requisition from the Engineer Department of 16th October, 1860, as part of the regular armament of the fort, for the flanking caponieres, which were just finished and ready to receive them.

Col. S. Cooper,
Adjutant-General TJ. 8. Army:
Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt, on the 4th, of your communication of the 1st instant. In compliance therewith I went yesterday to the city of Charleston to confer with Colonel Huger, and I called with him upon the mayor of the city, and upon several other prominent citizens.
All seemed determined, as far as their influence or power extends, to prevent an attack by a mob on our fort ; but all are equally decided in the opinion that the forts must be theirs after secession.
I shall, nevertheless, knowing how excitable this community is, continue to keep on the qui vive, and, as far as in my power, steadily prepare my command to the uttermost to resist any attack that may be made. As the State will probably declare itself out of the Union in less than two weeks, it seems to me that it would be well to discontinue all engineering work on this fort except such as is necessary to increase its strength. I have not pretended to exercise any control over that department, and have found Captain Foster generally disposed to accede to the suggestions I have ventured to make; and the suggestions I now make are not made in any unkind spirit towards him, as he is compelled to carry out the instructions of his department, but such as I feel it my duty to make, as being held responsible for the defense of this work. One of the bastionettes is nearly completed, now awaiting the arri val of the pintle blocks, without which the embrasure cannot be

made. The foundation has only been laid for the other. I certainly think that it is now too late to begin the construction of the second one, and that it would be better to substitute some other flanking arrangement* which can be finished in a few days.
Captain Foster is now sodding the exterior slope of the ditch, and putting n uck on the glacis. It seems to me that that work had better be discontinued, and the planking, &c., removed, as it might be used by an investing or attacking force.
In other words, I would now apply our science to devising and placing in front of and on our walls every available means of embarrassing and preventing an enemy scaling our low walls. Anything that will obstruct his advance will be of great advantage to our weak garrison.
Our time is short enough for what we have to do. Should the ordnance stores I have called for or re-enforcements not arrive, in the event of our being attacked I fear that we shall not distinguish ourselves by holding out many days.
I have not yet commenced leveling off the sand hills which, within onj hundred and sixty yards to the east, command this fort. Would my doing this be construed into initiating a collision? I would thank you also to inform me under what circumstances I would be justified in setting fire to or destroying the houses which afford dangerous shelter to an enemy, and whether I would be justified in firing upon an armed body which may be seen approaching our works.
Captain Foster told me yesterday that he found that the men of his Fort Sumter force, who he thought were perfectly reliable, will not fight if an armed force approaches that work; and I fear that the same may be anticipated from the Castle Pinckney force.
I learn that in consequence of the decayed condition of the carriages at Fort Sumter, the guns have not been mounted there as I reported they were to have been. If that work is not to be garrisoned, the guns certainly ought not to be mounted, as they may be turned upon us.
The remark has, I hear, been repeatedly made in the city that if they need heavy guns, they can get them in forty-eight hours. This, I suppose, refers to their being able to bring them from Fort Pulaski, mouth of the Savannah Biver.
Colonel Huger designs, I think, leaving Charleston for Washington to-morrow night. He is more hopeful of a settlement of impending difficulties without bloodshed than I am. Hoping in God that he may be right in his opinion,

Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General;
[Sir:] I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and to state that I have directed the A. A. Q. M. to hire men to perform police and fatigue duty at this post, and to send on a special estimate for funds to pay them.
I hear that the attention of the South Carolinian s appears to be turned more toward Fort Sumter than it was, and it is deemed probable that their first act will be to take possession of that work.
The idea of attempting to take this place by a coup <le main appears not to be so favorably regarded as it was, and they will perhaps determine to besiege us. To enable them to do this they must procure heavy guns, which they can get (if not from Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney) from Pulaski or some other southern fort. Anything that can be done which will cause delay in their attack will give time for deliberation and negotiation, and may, by God’s blessing, save the shedding of blood. I would therefore respectfully suggest whether it might not be advisable and prudent to cause the ammunition, except what may be needed for the defense of this fort and the armament of Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney, to be destroyed or rendered unserviceable before they are permitted to fall into their hands. The same may be advisable at those forts from whence supplies might be brought to Charleston. Fort Sumter is a tempting prize, the valueof which is well known to the Charlestonians, and once in their possession, with its ammunition and armament and walls uninjured and garrisoned properly, it would set our Navy at defiance, compel me to abandon this work, and give them the perfect command of this harbor.
Captain Foster having received the pintle stones for his bastionette guns, will now finish the one he has been at work on. Our supply of provisions has not arrived. I hope that it will soon be in. If we do not hear of it in a few days, I shall have to direct the A. A. commissary to make some purchases in ( harleston.

You are aware of the great anxiety of the Secretary of War that a collision of the troops with the people of this State shall be avoided, and of his studied determination to pursue a course with reference to the military force and forts in this harbor which shall guard against such a collision. He has therefore carefully abstained from increasing the force at this point, or taking any measures which might add to the present excited state of the public mind, or which would throw any doubt on the confidence he feels that South Carolina will not attempt, by violence, to obtain possession of the public works or interfere with their occupancy. But as the counsel and acts of rash and impulsive persons may possibly disappoint those expectations of the Government, he deems it proper that you should be prepared with instructions to

meet so unhappy a contingency. He has therefore directed me verbally to give you such instructions.*
You are carefully to avoid every act which would needlessly tend to provoke aggression $ and for that reason you are not, without evident and imminent necessity, to take up any position which could be construed into the assumption of a hostile attitude. But you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if attacked you are to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to take possession of any one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to take similar steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.

Sir: In compliance with request communicated by your letter of the 8th instant, application has been made for $5,000, to be remitted to the assistant treasurer at Charleston, to be held subject to your check, and that amount will be charged to you on account of Fort Sumter.
The Secretary of the Treasury is, of course, fully informed as to the amount of funds in each of the Government depositories, and the Department cannot, therefore, with proper courtesy to him, urge a remittance to you on the ground that there are funds at Charleston while he, with the fullest knowledge of all the facts, and of other public wants, declines to draw on them.
A special application in your behalf for $1,800 from u Contingencies of fortifications” has already been made at the Treasury, without other result than an assurance that that amount would be sent to you “if practicable,” and nothing more can now be done than issue the usual request for the $5,000 last asked for.

placed him in charge of Castle Pinckney the next day, and relieved Lieut. J. C. Davis from his temporary duty at that post. The work at the Castle is progressing satisfactorily at present, although I have up to this time been delayed on account of one firm in town refusing to sell me, as the agent of the United States, some lumber, which I was expecting, and very much needed. I have made arrangements to obtain the requisite quantity of lumber elsewhere, and have transferred the bricks and cement from Fort Sumter. The work on the cistern is already commenced, and that on the wooden banquettes will commence to-morrow. In the mean time, while waiting for materials, the force has been employed in perfecting the messing arrangements, putting the fort in thorough police order, and oiling and working the gun carriages, so that they now move with perfect facility.
The men for this working party were picked, and the majority of them are reliable against the disorderly attack of any mob to possess itself of the work. My confidence in them has increased within a few days.
A strict night watch is maintained, and during the daytime a man stands at the gate to prevent interested persons entering and inspecting the fort and its arrangements for defense. This latter precaution I have found to be necessary on account of numbers of men connected with the military, who came for the purpose of obtaining knowledge to use against the defenders of the fort in case of a collision with the Government. I have given the same instructions to Lieutenant Snyder, at Fort Sumter, with reference to which the above precaution became necessary first.
At Fort Sumter everything is going on smoothly, although I have purposely delayed the mounting of the guns, for the reason that I did not consider it safe to proceed with that work until some definite idea was obtained as to whether the work was to be maintained or not. Consequently, only the guns of the left face, which do not bear towards Fort Moultrie directly, are mounted in the first tier, although every preparation is made to mount all the guns in the shortest possible time when it is necessary and safe so to do.
I think the temper and disposition of the men at Fort Sumter are very good—better than a few days ago. They will defend the fort, as far as possible, without arms, against a mob, but not against the organized forces of South Carolina.
I have endeavored to strengthen the conservative feeling among the men through the overseer, and have succeeded to a certain extent, and I now consider this fort and Castle Pinckney safe until it comes to the solution of the question whether the Government is to surrender them to the State or to refuse her demands. At that time only United States troops, and in good numbers, will be sufficient to overawe an attempt to take them by force.	I
I hope the Department will not think me too explicit in my terms, for I wish to avoid any unnecessary alarm, but I feel it my duty to state my convictions, in order that it may have full information for its action. I would respectfully, but strongly, urge that more definite instructions be given me for my guidance. If Fort Sumter is to be risked against the chances of an attack, it will be important to vary my programme, and to change the deposit of a large portion of its stores, and to provide for the exigency of its loss. If not, I will cheerfully prepare to defend it to extremity until troops arrive for its garrison. If the garrison in Fort Moultrie is to be transferred, I should know it, in order to stop the heavy expense at Fort Moultrie, which, in that case, will become un-

[CnAr. I.
necessary, and which is now fast consuming my available funds. I can also, in that case, proceed in the armament of Fort Sumter.
At Fort Moultrie I have continued my heavy operations, and have employed one hundred and twenty men. The accessory defenses that I have created and am now perfecting are very important to the defense, and I trust the Department will approve my action. They comprise, besides the works ordered by the Department, the formation of a wet ditch, fifteen feet wide, all around the fort, the depth of which is very small in consequence of the quicksand which is reached, but which is very yielding to pressure, like a quagmire, and, therefore, a good obstacle"; the construction of a picket fence all around the fort bordering the ditch, and protected from fire by a small glacis in front of it; the cutting off the projecting brick cordon, which might serve to aid in scaling the oblique face of the wall; the formation of a bastionette at the northwest angle, so as to obtain a more effective flanking fire than could be obtained by a small cut in the parapet, and the formation of a temporary machicoulis gallery at the southeast angle.
All of these auxiliary defenses, except the picket fence, will be completed in four days, and will vastly improve the chances for the defense. With a sufficient war garrison I would consider this fort as secure against any attack that this State can bring against it; but the garrison is a mere handful of sixty men, and can hardly spare five men to two flanking caponieres—a fact that has influenced me in forming the machicoulis gallery at the southeast angle, as this can be defended and the wall flanked by two or three men, who can also be ready to rally to any point with the rest of the garrison.
In fine, I have spared no pains to give every assistance to the defense. I declined to make a fraise around the coping, for the reason that its effect would be to diminish the width of the wet ditch, since the same length of ladder that would catch on the points and enable the assailants to mount would not otherwise strike the wall more than half the way up. If time spares I shall widen the ditch one or two feet and plant small pickets within it.
I have saved all my cement barrels to be used in forming merlons, if necessary, and some of them are now being used by the garrison on the east front, facing the sand hills, to form covers for a few sharpshooters upon the parapet.
I hope funds will soon be sent me for the present month. I should think the United States Treasurer could issue his warrant against the deposit in Charleston for what money I require, for the assistant treasurer, Mr. Pressley, informed me that he had ample funds in hand.
I exchanged a draft on New York for gold to-day, in order to pay the men on Fort Sumter. The bank made the exchange at par.

on the ground of their being enrolled into the service of the State, and the subject is referred to you, you will, after fully satisfying yourself that the men are subject to enrollment, and have been properly enrolled under the laws of the United States, and of the State of South Carolina, cause them to be delivered up or suffer them to depart.
If deemed essential to the more perfect defense of the work, the leveling of the sand hills which command the fort would not, under ordinary circumstances, be considered as initiating a collision. But the delicate question of its bearing on the popular mind, in its present excited state, demands the coolest and wisest judgment. The fact of the sand hills being private profierty, and, as is understood, having private residences built upon them, decides the question in the negative. The houses which might afford dangerous shelter to an enemy, being chiefly frame, could be destroyed by the heavy guns of the fort at any moment, while the fact of their being leveled in anticipation of an attack might betray distrust, and prematurely bring on a collision. Their destruction at the moment of being used as a cover for an enemy would be more fatal to the attacking force than if swept away before their approach.
An armed body, approaching for hostile purposes, would, in all probability, either attempt a surprise or send a summons to surrender. In the former case, there can be no doubt as to the course to be pursued.
In the latter case, after refusal to surrender and a warning to keep off, a further advance by the armed body would be initiating a collision on their part.
If no summons be made by them, their purpose should be demanded at the same time that they are warned to keep off, and their failure to answer and further advance would throw the responsibility upon them.

Dear Colonel: I inclose herewith a slip from the Charleston Mercury of 13th instant, mentioning from Washington correspondent Major Bell’s [Buell’s] mission to this place.
I told the major that it was likely they would get an inkling of it. I merely send this to show you the almost impossibility of keeping anything secret. Nothing here worthy of an u official”—a calm before the storm. Many think no attack will be made on me until after they are in position in Fort Sumter, and that they will drive me out with her guns. It is all conjecture. I shall, of course, prepare here for the worst.
All well and in fine spirits.

Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, giving answers to questions contained in my letters.
In reference to the instruction given me in reply to my question about Captain Foster’s men, it would appear that I had not stated the matter with sufficient distinctness.
As I understood it, the South Carolina authorities sought to enroll as a part of their army intended to act against the forces of the United States, men who are employed by and in the pay of that Government, and could not, as I conceived, be enrolled by South Carolina u under the laws of the United States and of the State of South Carolina.”
The sand hills referred to are private property, but no houses are built upon them; they are in front of or between houses. I, of course, shall not remove them until convinced that an attack will be made, nor

shall I resort to the extreme measure of burning or destroying houses except on the same assurance, and then only such as mask positions where batteries may be erected, or such as, in my opinion, cannot be permitted to remain without endangering my command, which is so small that I cannot afford to spare a man.
The sand hills and the houses surrounding the fort will afford safe shelter for sharpshooters, who may, with ordinary good luck, pick off the major part of my little band, if we stand to our guns, in a few hours.
We are busily at work erecting traverses, defilading our work, increasing the height of our walls, and securing protection for our men and guns by means of barrels filled with sand.
As Captain Foster tells me that he reports all his operations to the Engineer Department, I presume that the War Department is fully informed on these matters.
As the subject may be referred to by the letter writers and by the Charleston press, it may be proper that I should state that Captain Foster mentioned to me this morning that he had obtained yesterday from the Charleston Arsenal forty muskets for Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney, and that they had been brought down without causing any excitement. He said that they were delivered in compliance with an order issued, I think, before my arrival. This evening he showed me a letter from the military storekeeper, which stated that the fact of his having sent off those muskets had produced great excitement in the city, and that he had felt obliged to pledge his word that they should be returned by to-morrow night. He states that Colonel Huger had directed him not to let any arms be removed from the arsenal.
I told Captain Foster that my instructions were that I was not to do anything calculated to produce excitement, and that as he had asked my advice I would certainly advise him to return them. He left me stating that he would do so.
I have not heard whether the ordnance stores asked for are to be sent. I can only say that they are absolutely necessary to enable me to make a respectable attempt at a defense.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The first accompanied an invoice of forty muskets and accouterments, upon a requisition made by me, and in accordance with an order received some time since. The second was made subsequent to intimations of violent demonstrations, made by General Schnierle (and others, perhaps), if the muskets were not returned. General Schnierle assured Mr. Humphreys that Colonel Huger, Ordnance Corps, U. S. Army, had assured the governor of the State that no arms should be removed from the arsenal, and upon this Mr. Humphreys assured General Schnierle that the muskets should be returned to-morrow.

removed from the arsenal, nor that, if he did so, he spoke by authority of the Government $ but, on the other hand, I do know that an order was given to issue to me forty muskets; that I actually needed them to protect Government property and the lives of my assistants and the ordnance sergeants under them at Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney, and that I have them in my possession. To give them up on a demand of this kind seems to me as an act not expected of me by the Government, and as almost suicidal under the circumstances. It would place the two forts under my charge at the mercy of a mob. Neither of the ordnance sergeants at Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney had muskets until I got these, and Lieutenants Snyder and Meade were likewise totally destitute of arms.
I propose to refer the matter to Washington, and am to see several gentlemen who are prominent in this matter to-morrow. I am not disposed to surrender these arms under a threat of this kind, especially when I know that I am only doing my duty to the Government. If the violent persons in the city seize upon this opportunity to excite the mob to acts of violence to the property of the United States, or those having it in charge, it will only be as that which must soon occur, and which they have actually been looking for.
I must say plainly that I have for some days arrived at the conclusion that unless some arrangement is shortly made by Congress, affairs in this State will arrive at a crisis, and a conflict between the Federal forces and the troops of this State be a not improbable event.
I have endeavored to keep you fully informed of my efforts to prepare for it, and of this I will write more fully to-morrow.

Capt. J. G. Foster,

Dear Captain : The shipment of the forty muskets, &c., has caused intense excitement. General Sehnierle called upon me this morning, and assures me that some violent demonstration is certain unless the excitement can be allayed, and says that Colonel Huger assured the governor that no arms should be removed from this arsenal. As the order under which I made the issue to you was dated prior to Colonel HugePs visit here, I am placed in rather a delicate position. I have pledged my word that they (the forty muskets and accouterments) shall be returned by to-morrow night, and I beg that you will return them to me. I informed General Sehnierle that you only desired two muskets, but that I could not issue them without the proper order, but that I had an old order covering the issue of the forty. In view of my pledge that the muskets shall be returned, and the position which Colonel Huger is placed by the issue, I feel satisfied that you will comply with my request. In haste.

Fort Moultrie, December 18,1860.
F. C. Humphreys, Esq.,
Military Storekeeper, Charleston Arsenal:
Dear Sir : I have received your note of this date, begging me to return to the arsenal the forty muskets which I obtained yesterday (in accordance with an order from the Ordnance Department, issued some time since), because of a threatened violent demonstration on the part of some persons of Charleston. You state that Colonel Huger, of the Ordnance (as General Schnierle asserts to you), assured the governor that no arms should be removed from the arsenal, and that as the above assurance of Colonel Huger was made subsequent to the receipt of the order for the issue of these muskets to me, you have pledged your word that they shall be returned to the arsenal to-morrow. If Colonel Huger made this pledge to the governor of this State, I presume he must have acted by the authority of the Government; but of this I have no direct knowledge. All I know is that an order was given to issue forty muskets to me, that I actually required them to protect the property of the Government against a mob, and that I have them in my possession. To give them back now, without proper authority, would subject me to blame if any loss should occur which might be prevented by keeping them. I am willing to refer the matter to Washington. I am sorry to be obliged to disappoint you, and will call to assure you so to-morrow at 12 o’clock, at which time I shall be happy to meet General Schnierle, if he is disposed to see me.
Yery truly, yours,

Col. E. E. De Eussy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel : I have the honor to inform you that I had an interview to-day with General Schnierle (general of division in this .vicinity) and several other prominent citizens of Charleston, in relation to the little excitement attending the issue of forty muskets to me at the arsenal on the 17th instant.
The main facts connected with this were communicated in my letter of yesterday.
The interview to-day was satisfactory to me, as I saw that the action of General Schnierle had arisen from his great desire to allay the temporary excitement among some of the citizens. Although I declined to return the muskets until I was directed by the Government so to do, yet I proposed at once to refer the matter to Washington, and accordingly telegraphed to Captain Maynadier, Ordnance Corps, to inquire whether the muskets should be returned to the arsenal or not. Up to this time I have received no answer. The reasons for my doing so are these: General Schnierle asserted that Colonel Huger had assured the governor of this State that no arms should be removed from the arsenal, and Captain Humphreys, military storekeeper, felt himself placed in a peculiar position from having acted contrary to the colonel’s assurance, while on the other hand neither Captain Humphreys or myself had been informed by Colonel Huger that he had. made such assurance ; neither had we any positive written testimony of the fact. To solve the ques-7 R R

tion, the Ordnance Bureau must be appealed to for a decision, and I did this immediately, in order to allay, as soon as possible, any irritations that might have arisen. I was actuated in all I did by a sincere desire to remove all cause of irritation, so that if the extremists are disposed for violent measures they must force the issue themselves.
I am abating nothing of the activity of preparation in Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter, and in f^ct am increasing it.
If the Department becomes aware of any change of policy in regard to this preparation in these forts, or in either of them, I beg that instructions may be given me at once, so that I may vary my operations accordingly, for my present expenses are very heavy. In Fort Sumter the mounting of the guns, laying a flagging of first and second tiers of casemates, forming embrasures of second tier, and finishing the barracks is progressing regularly, and as fast as separately-organized parties can work. The force will be to-morrow 150 men.
On Fort Moultrie 137 men are at work. The wet ditch is nearly completed. The foot-bridge connecting the second stories of the barracks and the guard house, which is arranged for a citadel, is constructed. Doors are being cut through the partition walls of the barracks of the second floor, and trap doors in the floors, and ladders made. A machicoulis gallery over the southeast angle is being made of palmetto logs for infantry. All the guns on the east front (facing the sand hills) are being placed in embrasure, by raising high and solid merlons, formed of cement barrels filled with sand, sods, and green hides.
Three high cavalier-like positions are also formed on this front for sharpshooters. The picket fence bordering the ditch is carried more than half around the fort, and is well protected from a destructive fire of cannon by a small glacis in front of it. The flanking howitzers are being mounted in the finished caponiere, and will be tried by firing tomorrow. Nearly all the projecting brick cordon is cut off smooth.
All of this work I have done and am doing myself, because it is necessary to be done, and the garrison is too weak to undertake any work beside the regular drills.
There is another thing which I propose to do, and of which I write to you in season, so that if you disapprove it you can have time to forbid it. I propose to connect a powerful Daniels battery with the magazine at Fort Sumter, by means of wires stretched across under water from Fort Sumter to Fort Moultrie, and to blow up Fort Sumter if it is taken by an armed force, and after Lieutenant Snyder and my men have time to escape from it.
I propose, also, to use the same battery to fire small mines around Fort Moultrie, and to explode a large mine placed in the sand hills. All of these last preparations may seem to be unnecessary, and I hope they may prove to be so in the end, but there are very strong probabilities that they may be required, amj, at any rate, I regard a complete state of preparations as the surest safeguard against attack.

Colonel : I had the honor to receive and to answer, at half past 1 o’clock this morning, a telegram from the honorable Secretary of War, dated the 19th instant. Captain Foster has, I presume, reported to the Department his compliance with his order.
The ordinance of secession passed the South Carolina Convention to-day.
We are making good progress in our defensive works on the ramparts. Captain Foster finished to-day mounting the guns in the caponiere (or bastionettes), and [will] commence the other caponiere to-morrow. In my letter (No. 6) of December 6, I had the honor of stating my objections to commencmg that work, and suggested that I thought it ought to be replaced by some work which could be built in a shorter time. No reply has been made to that suggestion, and Captain Foster says that as the project was approved by the Engineer Department and by the Secretary of War he does not feel authorized to make a change of the plan.
I regret this very much, for if an attack is made whilst that work is going on, our fort can be very easily carried. As I have stated before, I do not feel authorized to interfere with the operations of the Engineer Department.
Captain Foster informs me that Lieutenant Snyder is mounting guns at Fort Sumter as rapidly as possible. I have already given my reasons why I thought that ought not to be done, and have seen no reason for changing that opinion.
Hoping that events may take such a turn as soon to relieve me from the dangerous position my little command is now in,

In regard to the condition of the defenses at Fort Moultrie^ I have to state that, according to the latest report of the Engineer officer having charge of the construction of the defenses of the harbor of Charleston, everything practicable has been done to place the work in an efficient condition, and that with a proper garrison it is susceptible of an energetic defense. There were then employed at that work one officer and one hundred and twenty workmen, independent of the regular garrison.
Castle Pinckney was in good condition as regards preparation, and, with a proper garrison, as defensible as it can be made. One officer and thirty workmen were engaged in the repair of the cisterns, replacing decayed banquettes, and attending to other matters of detail.

Fort Sumter, which is entirely surrounded by water, is prepared for the guns of the first and third tiers, many of which are mounted, and the rest may be on short notice. The working force is now engaged in putting in the embrasures of the second tier, which have been left out till recently on account of an apprehended settlement of the work. One officer and one hundred and fifteen workmen were employed at this work at the date of the last report. Of all the fortifications in the harbor of Charleston, Fort Sumter must be looked upon as by far the most important, and it is now in condition, as regards its state of preparation, to resist any attack that will be made upon it, provided it be furnished with a proper garrison.

I have just received a telegraphic dispatch informing me that you have removed forty muskets from Charleston Arsenal to Fort Moultrie. If you have removed any arms, return them instantly.
Answer by telegraph.

To this I immediately replied as follows:
I received forty muskets from the arsenal on the 17th. I shall return them in obedience to your order.
J. G. FOSTER, Captain, Engineers.
Hon. J. B. Floyd,
Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.
It may be well hereto explain more fully than I have heretofore done the circumstances connected with this issue of muskets to me. The Ordnance Department on the 1st of November directed that forty muskets should be issued to me. I did not receive them at that time, because Colonel Gardner, commanding at Fort Moultrie, objected to the issue on the ground that it appeared like arming my employes. On the 17th instant I went to the arsenal to obtain two guns which were required at Fort Sumter, and which Colonel Huger had directed to be delivered to me. While there I recollected that the ordnance sergeants at Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney had applied to me for the arms to which they were entitled, and I asked the military storekeeper in charge of the arsenal for two muskets and accouterments for those two sergeants. He replied that he had no authority for the issue of two muskets for this purpose, but that the old order for forty muskets was on file, and the muskets and accouterments ready packed for delivery to me. So I received them, and after issuing the two muskets to the two ordnance sergeants at Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney placed the remainder in the magazines of those two forts. They were actually needed to protect the public property. I knew nothing of Colonel Unger’s assurances

to the governor of the State that no arms should be removed from the arsenal; neither did Captain Humphreys, military storekeeper. Consequently, I was surprised to receive his letter of the 18th, which I inclosed to you yesterday, desiring to have the muskets returned. My reply was also inclosed to you. What followed was as is described in the commencement of this letter.
To-day at 3 o’clock I received another letter from Captain Humphreys, a copy of which is inclosed, as is also my reply.
I should have mentioned above that on the 19th, when in town to see General Schnierle and allay any excitement relative to the muskets, I found to my surprise that there was no excitement except with a very few who had been active in the matter, and the majority of the gentlemen whom I met had not even heard of it.
The order of the Secretary of War of last night I must consider as decisive upon the question of any efforts on my part to defend Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney. The defense now can only extend to keeping the gates closed and shutters fastened, and must cease when these are forced.
I do not think that I am authorized to make the preparations for extreme measures described in my letter of yesterday, but shall wait until I receive your reply.
1 would earnestly, but respectfully, urge that definite instructions be given me how to act in the emergency which, from the eagerness with which rumors and other causes are seized upon to maintain and increase the political excitement, will probably arise sooner or later. Until I am directed to the contrary, I shall continue the work as at present on Fort Sumter and the preparations for the defense of Fort Moultrie.

Dear Sir : During an interview with Governor Pickens this morning, he asked me whether or not I could state authoritatively that there had not been twenty enlisted men sent from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter. I told him that my conviction was that such was not the case, and that I heard you make the statement yesterday to General Schnierle that you had but one enlisted man at Fort Sumter.
The governor requested as a favor that such assurance should be given him over the signature of an officer of the Army, and knowing that you requested General Schnierle to write you should any rumor obtain concerning you, I make known Governor Pickens’ desire to you, and respectfully suggest that you send him immediately (as he said it was important that he had a [denial] of the rumor by night) such communication as you may deem best in the premises.
I regret exceedingly that you deemed it necessary to refer the matter of the issue of the forty muskets, &c., to Washington, for I know that such representations have gone on to the Department as will cause unnecessary excitement, and insure a censure of my course in the matter from the Ordnance Department.

Dear Sir : I have received your letter of this date. I regret that I cannot accede to your request to write to the governor-elect of South Carolina and assure him that twenty enlisted men had not, as he had heard, been sent from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter. As the governor of a State that has by an ordinance to-day decided to secede from the Union, I cannot, I conceive, properly communicate with him in matters of this kind, except through the Government at Washington.
I regret exceedingly that an unfounded rumor of this kind should have obtained the serious attention of the governor of South Carolina. I, as the officer in charge of Fort Sumter, can assure you that no enlisted men have been transferred from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter.
With respect to the issue of the muskets, I consider that you only performed your duty in obedience to existing orders. I certainly think that I did mine. As to my after action in referring the matter to Washington, I am, of course, the only one responsible. You cannot, therefore, be censured without cause.

Sir: The inclosed telegram, purporting to be from Capt. J. G. Foster, the Engineer officer in charge of Fort Sumter, reached me last night, and gives the first information to this office that the forty old muskets had been issued to the captain. On the contrary, the previous correspondence on the subject indicates that the issue of these muskets has not been and will not be made. On the 31st October last Colonel Craig informed you that the Engineer in charge of Fort Sumter had suggested the placing of a few small-arms in the hands of his workmen for the protection of the Government property there, and recommended that it should be done, provided that it met the concurrence of the commanding officer of the troops in Charleston Harbor. The recommendation was approved, and Col. J. L. Gardner, then commanding at Charleston Harbor, was duly notified thereof and authorized to direct the issue if it met his approval, and to report the fact to this office. He answered under date of 5th November, 1860, and did not concur in the expediency of the issue. His letter was submitted to you on the 8th November,

with the remark by the Colonel of Ordnance that “it is probable the issue has not and will not be made without further orders.” No further orders have been given, and no report or other information on the subject has reached this office except the inclosed telegram. That is so indefinite (except as to the fact that Captain Foster has received the forty old muskets) as to be difficult to understand, and, consequently, to answer.* It does not state by whom the “ little talk ” about the issue was had, nor who asks Captain Foster to return the muskets. From all the indications I am doubtful about the genuineness of the dispatch. If answered at all I think the best reply will be: “If you don’t want the muskets, return them.”

Under these instructions, you might infer that you are required to make a vain and useless sacrifice of your own life and the lives of the men under your command, upon a mere point of honor. This is far from the President’s intentions. You are to exercise a sound military discretion on this subject.
It is neither expected nor desired that you should expose your own life or that of your men in a hopeless conflict in defense of these forts. If they are invested or attacked by a for ce so superior that resistance would, in your judgment, be a useless waste of life, it will be your duty to yield to necessity, and make the best terms in your power.

Ordnance Office, Washington, December 21, 1860.
Hon. John B. Floyd,
Secretary of War:
Sir : All the information called for by the letter of the Hon. B. Stanton, chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives, and the accompanying resolution of that committee, dated the 18th instant, so far as it is within the purview of the Ordnance Department, will be found in the inclosed statements, viz :
Eo. 1. Quantity and description of ordnance and arms at each of the forts in Charleston Harbor, viz, at Fort Moultrie, at Castle Pinckney, at Fort Sumter, and at the Charleston Arsenal, with the name and grade of the officer in charge of the arsenal, and the force under his control.* Eo. 2. Eumber and description of arms distributed since the 1st of January, 1860, to the States and Territories, and at what price.*
Eo. 3. Arms distributed by sale since 1st January, 1860, to whom sold, and at what price.*
It is deemed proper to state, in further explanation of Eo. 2, that where no distribution appears to have been made to a State or Territory, or the amount of distribution is small, it is because such State or Territory has not called for all the arms due on its quotas, and remains a creditor for dues not distributed, which can be obtained at any time on requisition therefor.
The letter of the Hon. B. Stanton, with the accompanying resolution, is returned herewith.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. MAYEADIEB,
Captain of Ordnance.

Tour letter of the 18th instant, inclosing correspondence with Military Storekeeper Humphreys, in regard to the return of the muskets drawn from the Charleston Arsenal, is also received.
It having been ascertained on inquiry at the War Department that instructions have already been sent you to return the muskets referred to, no further action on your letter seems to be necessary.

No. 10.]	Fort Moultrie, S. C., December 22,1860.
(Received A. G. O., December 26.)
Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel : Captain Foster is apprehensive that the remarks in my letter of the 20th instant may be considered as reflecting upon him, and I told him that I would cheerfully state distinctly that I do not intend to pass any criticism upon his proceedings.
I stated in my last letter fully all the reasons I intended to give against commencing the second caponiere. The captain has put a very large force of masons on it, and they are running up the walls very rapidly. He says, as he has all the material on hand, the men, having just completed the first one, will be enabled to construct the second caponiere as soon as they could finish any temporary work in its stead. He says that he will have the u work defensible in five more working days, and have it finished in nine more working days.” God knows whether the South Carolinians will defer their attempt to take this work so long as that. I must confess that I think where an officer is placed in as delicate a position as the one I occupy that he should have the entire control
0	ver ail persons connected in any way with the work intrusted to him. Responsibility and power to control ought to go together.
I have heard from several sources that last night and the night before a steamer was stationed between this island and Fort Sumter. That the authorities of South Carolina are determined to prevent, if possible, any troops from being placed in that fort, and that they will seize upon that most important work as soon as they think there is reasonable ground for a doubt whether it will be turned over to the State, I do not doubt.
1	think that I could, however, were I to receive instructions so to do, throw my garrison into that work, but I should have to sacrifice the greater part of my stores, as it is now too late to attempt their removal. Once in that work with my garrison I could keep the entrance of their harbor open until they construct works outside of me, which might, I presume, prevent vessels from coming into the outer harbor.
We have used nearly all the empty barrels which Captain Foster had wisely saved for embrasures, traverses, &c., and Captain Foster is now making use of our gun-pent houses for the same purpose, filling them with sand.
x No one can tell what will be done. They may defer action until their commissioners return from Washington; or, if apprised by the nature of the debates in Congress that their demands will not probably be ac-^ ceded to, they may act without waiting for them.
I do not think that we can rely upon any assurances, and wish to God I only had men enough here to man fully my guns. Our men are per-

fectly conscious of the dangerous position they are placed in, but are in as fine spirits as if they were certain of victory.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
ROBERT ANDERSON,
Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
P. S.—I have just heard that several of the men at work in Fort Sumter wear the blue cockade. If they are bold enough to do that the sooner that force is disbanded the better. The public property would be safer there under Lieutenant Snyder and a few men than it now is.
R. A.
Sullivan’s Island, S. 0., December 22,1860. Col. R. E. De Russy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers, V. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel : I feel it my duty to inform you that on the last two nights steamers from town have remained in the close vicinity of Fort Sumter, apparently with the object of maintaining guard over the fort. On the first night, that of the 20th, only one came. She approached from the direction of town, as though running for the wharf, and her movements attracting the attention of the watchman, he awoke Lieutenant Snyder, who, when he went upon the ramparts, found her close under the west flank, apparently sounding. She afterwards moved off to a second position about six hundred yards from the fort, and remained during the night. She showed no lights. On the same night this or another steamer reconnoitered and remained around Castle Pinckney for some time, and when hailed by the night watch on the Castle as to what she wanted, some one replied, u You will know in a week.” Last night two steamers kept watch around Fort Sumter.
These steamers are the small harbor or coast steamers, and one of them was named the Nina. Judging it best not to incur any risk of an unpleasant occurrence, I have not taken any steps to ascertain the object of this surveillance, nor of those in command of the steamers. The recent orders emanating from the War Department have given me the assurance that every cause that might irritate these people must be avoided. However mortifying it may be to know that there are no means for defense in Fort Sumter, and that the military men of the city have their eyes fixed upon it as the prize to obtain, I feel bound to carry out this idea in my every act.
I do not even feel authorized to vary my present plan of operations, either by a reduction or an increase of force, although my expenses are very heavy, and my present liabilities barely covered by my requisitions just made. Whenever the Department desires that I may make a change of operations, I beg that it may soon be con imunicated to me.
At Fort Moultrie I am still exerting myself to the utmost to make it so defensible as to discourage any attempts to take it. The wet ditch is now completed. The whole of the east front is now raised by solid merlons, two barrels high, and in three positions to a greater height to serve fo*r cavaliers. The guns are provided with good siege-battery embrasures, faced with green hides, and two of them 18-inch howitzers, one in addition furnished with musket-proof shutters working on an axis, elevated over the throat of the embrasure by supports on each side, and maneuvered by double bars extending back over the gun.
A field howitzer has been put in position on the parapet at the northeast salient by means of a palmetto stockade, so as to sweep the vicinity

of that angle better than it was before. Traverses to intercept shot from the sand hills have been placed on the parapet and upon the terrepleins.
The bridge connecting the barracks and guard-house is completed, the doors arranged with fastenings, doors cut through the partition walls of the barracks, trap doors cut in the floors, and ladders made. The howitzers in the finished caponiere are put in good working order. The second caponiere was commenced yesterday morning, with a full force of masons, and by to-night was over six feet in height, with both embrasures completed. Major Anderson wanted me to adopt some more temporary construction, but I showed him that this would be far more valuable in the defense, and having the materials and masons ready, I could construct it just as quickly and cheaply. On Monday I shall erect a lookout tower or sharpshooter stand on top of the guard-house, at Major Anderson’s request. I have stopped for the present the work upon the glacis in front of the sea front, and put all my force upon the above works. The glacis has, however, assumed fine proportions, and is in fact nearly completed. One-half of the interior slope is well sodded, and half of the glacis slope covered with muck six inches thick.
It will take very little work to complete the whole of it as soon as the present pressing work is finished.
Y ery truly, yours,
J. G. FOSTER, Captain, Engineers.

Capt. J. G. Foster,
Corps of Engineers, Charleston, 8. C.:
Captain : I have to acknowledge the receipt of the following letters from you, viz:
1.	Letter of December 20, reporting in regard to the receipt of forty muskets, &c., for Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney, and their return to the arsenal by direction of the Secretary of War.
2.	Letter of December 22, reporting that steamers from Charleston had been engaged for the last two nights in reconnoitering and watching Fort Sumter and Castle Pinckney, and also detailing the progress of your operations at Fort Moultrie toward putting that work in a defensible condition.
3.	Your letter of the 19th December, not before acknowledged, presenting for the consideration of the Government a proposition for preventing the occupation of Fort Sumter by any force not acting under the authority of the United States.
These several letters have been laid before the Secretary of War, and his instructious in relation to the important matters presented therein earnestly requested. Thus far no such instructions have been received, though the Secretary expressed himself fully satisfied with the efforts you have made and the zeal you have exhibited in the trying position in which you are placed.
This Department is highly gratified with the course you have pursued, and fully approves all the steps you have taken for the security of the public interests at the fortifications in Charleston Harbor. At the same time it cannot fail to express the hope that some definite instructions may be soon given for your guidance.

Col. R. E. De Russy,
Commanding Corps of Engineers, U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.: Colonel : I have the honor to report that yesterday evening Major Anderson removed his command from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, leaving a guard with me, with orders to spike the guns, cut down the flagstaff, and burn the carriages of those guns that point towards Fort Sumter. This was done. To-day I went to town to negotiate a draft on New York to pay off the men employed on Fort Moultrie. I saw

that an attack was to be made somewhere to-night, and also that it would not be safe for me to go to town again for some time.
Returning, I brought my family to Fort Sumter, as all guard was withdrawn. At about 4 o’clock a steamer landed an armed force at Castle Pinckney, and effecting an entrance by scaling the walls with ladders, took forcible possession of the work. Lieutenant Meade was suffered to withdraw to this fort.
Soon after dark two steamers landed an armed force at Fort Moultrie, and took forcible possession of that work. While in town the Palmetto flag was hoisted on the custom-house and saluted. Two companies were ordered to surround the arsenal. The movement of Major Anderson was made upon a firm conviction that an attack would be made, and that Fort Sumter would be seized first. In haste.

Sir : We have the honor to transmit to you a copy of the full powers from the Convention of the People of South Carolina, under which we are u authorized and empowered to treat with the Government of the United States for the delivery of the forts, magazines, light houses, and other real estate, with their appurtenances, within the limits of South Carolina; and also for an apportionment of the public debt and a division of all other property held by the Government of the United States as agent of the confederated States, of which South Carolina was recently a member) and, generally, to negotiate as to all other measures and arrangements proper to be made and adopted in the existing relations of the parties, and for the continuance of peace and amity between this Commonwealth and the Government at Washington.”
In the execution of this trust it is our duty to furnish you, as we now do, with an official copy of the ordinance of secession, by which the State of South Carolina has resumed the powers she delegated to the Government of the United States, and has declared her perfect sovereignty and independence.
It would also have been our duty to have informed you that we were ready to negotiate with you upon all such questions as are necessarily raised by the adoption of this ordinance, and that we were prepared to enter upon this negotiation with the earnest desire to avoid all unnecessary and hostile collision, and so to inaugurate our new relations as to secure mutual respect, general advantage, and a future of good will and harmony, beneficial to all the parties concerned. But the events of the last twenty-four hours render such an assurance impossible. We came here, the representatives of an authority which could at any time within the past sixty days have taken possession of the forts in Charleston Harbor, but which, upon pledges given in a manner that we cannot doubt, determined to trust to your honor rather than to its own power. Since our arrival an officer of the United States acting, as we are as-

sured, not only without but against your orders, has dismantled one fort and occupied another, thus altering to a most important extent the condition of affairs under which we came.
Until those circumstances are explained in a manner which relieves us of all doubt as to the spirit in which these negotiations shall be conducted, we are forced to suspend all discussion as to any arrangements by which our mutual interests might be amicably adjusted.
And, in conclusion, we would urge upon you the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of Charleston. Under present circumstances they are a standing menace which renders negotiation impossible, and, as our recent experience shows, threatens speedily to bring to a bloody issue questions which ought to be settled with temperance and judgment.

[Memorandum.]
Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, December 28,1860.
Lieutenant-General Scott, who has had a bad night, and can scarcely hold up his head this morning, begs to express the hope to the Secretary of War—
1.	That orders may not be given for the evacuation of Fort Sumter;
2.	That one hundred and fifty recruits may instantly be sent from Governor’s Island to re-enforce that garrison, with ample supplies of ammunition, subsistence, including fresh vegetables, as potatoes, onions, turnips; and
3.	That one or two armed vessels be sent to support the said fort.
Lieutenant-General Scott avails himself of this opportunity also to express the hope that the recommendations heretofore made by him to the Secretary of War respecting Forts Jackson, Saint Philip, Morgan, and Pulaski, and particularly in respect to Forts Pickens and McRee and the Pensacola navy-yard in connection with the last two named works, may be reconsidered by the Secretary.
Lieutenant-General Scott will further ask the attention of the Secretary to Forts Jefferson and Taylor, which are wholly national, being of far greater value even to the most distant points oT the Atlantic coast and to the people on the upper waters of the Missouri, Mississippi, and Ohio Fivers than to the State of Florida. There is only a feeble company at Key West for the defense of Fort Taylor, and not a soldier in Fort Jefferson to resist a handful of filibusters or a rowboat of pirates; and the Gulf, soon after the beginning of secession or revolutionary troubles in the adjacent States, will swarm with such nuisances.
Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

(Received A. G. O., January 1, 1861.) Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel : I have the honor to send herewith a copy of a memorandum received to-day from the governor of South Carolina, in reply to a message from me, which shows that for the present we are treated as enemies. I sent my post-adjutant this morning with a message to the commanding officer of Fort Moultrie asking by what authority he held possession of that work, and desiring to know whether he would make any opposition to my sending for some property, public and private, left there. He replied to my first question that he held that post by authority of the sovereign State of South Carolina, and in obedience to the orders of the governor. To the second, that his orders were not to permit public property of any kind to be removed on any pretext whatever; that he was directed to take an inventory of the same, and to send it to the governor; that he would with pleasure assist in recovering and restoring all private property that was left. This decision about the public property shows that South Carolina is acting in this matter also toward us as if we were her enemy. The amount of public property thus left is not great, as I merely retained enough to prevent my movement from being suspected. He requested Lieutenant Hall to say that at a general meeting of the officers, the military move I made was unanimously pronounced to have been one of consummate wisdom; that it was the best one that could have been made, and that if I had

not effected it things would have been very different. Speaking of his own position, he remarked that the guns of Fort Sumter looked into his guns, and said that he ought not to have been ordered to fire upon me, because if I returned his fire he would be compelled to retire to the sand hills. There were yesterday two regiments to guard the island. The remark about his orders looks like an intention to attack me here. I must confess that I feel highly complimented by the expression of such an opinion (from those most deeply affected by it) of the change of position I felt bound to take to save my command and to prevent the shedding of blood. In a few days I hope, God willing, that I shall be so strong here that they will hardly be foolish enough to attack me. I must confess that we have yet something to do before, with my small force, I shall feel quite independent, as this work is not impregnable, as I have heard it spoken of.
Trusting that something may occur which will lead to a peaceful solution of the questions between the General Government and South Carolina,
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BOBEBT ANDEBSON,
Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
P. S.—I do not feel authorized to reply to the memorandum of the governor, but shall regret very deeply his persistence in the course he has taken. He knows not how entirely the city of Charleston is in my power. I can cut his communication off from the sea, and thereby prevent the reception of supplies, and close the harbor, even at night, by destroying the light-houses. These things, of course, I would never do, unless compelled to do so in self-defense.

Headquarters, December 28,1860.
In reply to Major Anderson’s request, made this morning verbally through First Lieutenant Snyder, from Fort Sumter, I hereby order and direct that free permission shall be given to him to send the ladies and camp women from Fort Sumter, with their private effects, to any portion of Sullivan’s Island, and that entire protection shall be extended to them. It is also agreed that the mails may be sent over to the officers at Fort Sumter by their boats, and that all the ladies of Captain Foster’s family shall be allowed to pass, with their effects and the effects of any kind belonging to Captain Foster, from the Mills House to Fort Sumter, and the kindest regard shall be paid to them. Of course, Lieutenant Meade’s private effects can be taken possession of 5 but for the present there shall be no communications of any other kind allowed from the city to the fort, or any transportation of arms or ammunition, or any supplies, to the fort ; and this is done with a view to prevent irregular collisions, and to spare the unnecessary effusion of blood.

brother in his command, repeating, with what effect remains to be seen, within the last twenty-four hours, an urgent recommendation, long since made, to the President to re-enforce the major.
The War Department has kept secret from the General the instructions sent to the major, but the General, in common with the whole Army, has admired and vindicated as a defensive measure the masterly transfer of the garrison from Fort Moultrie to the position of Fort Sumter.

Washington, December 30,1860. The President of the United States :
Lieutenant-General Scott begs the President of the United States to pardon the irregularity of this communication.
It is Sunday; the weather is bad, and General Scott is not well enough to go to church. But matters of the highest national importance seem to forbid a moment’s delay, and if misled by zeal, he hopes for the President’s forgiveness.
Will the President permit General Scott, without reference to the War Department and otherwise, as secretly as possible, to send two hundred and fifty recruits from New York Harbor to re-enforce Fort Sumter, together with some extra muskets or rifles, ammunition, and subsistence stores ?
It is hoped that a sloop of war and cutter may be ordered for the same purpose as early as to-morrow.
General Scott will wait upon the President at any moment he may be called for.

Colonel : I have the honor to report that the South Carolinians have established a post at Fort Johnson. It is said that one company and a half was sent to that place yesterday. I saw that there was a small party yesterday on Morris Island. They probably intend establishing batteries at Fort Johnson and on the island, and throwing shot and shells at us from those places and from Fort Moultrie, where they are very busily engaged repairing their battery. The governor was called upon by a friend of mine in reference to his decision, by which all communication between us and the city (except the sending for our mails) was cut off, and he refuses to modify or recall his order. We are pushing forward our work here very vigorously, and if we have a week longer, shall, by the blessing of God, be fully prepared for any attack they may make.

Washington City, December 31,1860. Hons. Eobert W. Barnwell, James H. Adams, James L. Orr:
Gentlemen : I have had the honor to receive your communication of the 28th instant, together with a copy of your “full powers from the Convention of the People of South Carolina ” authorizing you to treat with the Government of the United States on various important subjects therein mentioned, and also copy of the ordinance, bearing date on the 20th instant, declaring that “the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other States under the name of ‘ the United States of America? is thereby dissolved.”
In answer to this communication I have to say that my position as President of the United States was clearly defined in the message to Congress on the 3d instant. In that I stated that “ apart from the execution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable, the Executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the Federal Government and South Carolina. He has been invested with no such discretion. He possesses no power to change the relations heretofore existing between them, much less to acknowledge the independence of that State. This would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power of recognizing the dissolution of the confederacy among our thirty-three sovereign States. It bears no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign de facto government, involving no such responsibility. Any attempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation. It is therefore my duty to submit to Congress the whole question in all its bearings.”
Such is still my opinion, and I could therefore meet you only as private gentlemen of the highest character, and I was quite willing to communicate to Congress any proposition you might have to make to that body upon the subject. Of this you were well aware.
It was my earnest desire that such a disposition might be made of the whole subject by Congress, who alone possess the power, as to prevent the inauguration of a civil war between the parties in regard to the possession of the Federal forts in the harbor of Charleston 5 and I therefore deeply regret that, in your opinion, “ the events of the last twenty-four hours render this impossible.” In conclusion you urge upon me “ the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of

Charleston,” stating that, “under present circumstances, they are a standing menace which renders negotiation impossible, and, as our recent experience shows, threatens speedily to bring to a bloody issue questions which ought to be settled with temperance and judgment.” The reason for this change in your position is that, since your arrival in Washington, “an officer of the United States,acting,as we (you)are assured, not only without but against your (my) orders, has dismantled one fort and occupied another, thus altering to a most important extent the condition of affairs under which we (you) came.”
You also allege that you came here “ the representatives of an authority which could at any time within the past sixty days have taken possession of the forts in Charleston Harbor, but which, upon pledges given in a manner that we (you) cannot doubt, determined to trust to your (my) honor rather than to its own power.”
This brings me to a consideration of the nature of those alleged pledges, and in what manner they have been observed. In my message of the 3d of December instant I stated, in regard to the property of the United States in South Carolina, that it “ has been purchased for a fair equivalent, * by the consent of the legislature of the State, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals/ &c., and over these the authority < to exercise exclusive legislation’ has been expressly granted by the Constitution to Congress. It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the United States from this property by force; but if in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive. In such a contingency the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants.”
This being the condition of the parties on Saturday, December 8, four of*the Kepresentatives from South Carolina called upon me and requested an interview. We had an earnest conversation on the subject of these forts and the best means of preventing a collision between the parties, for the purpose of sparing the effusion of blood. I suggested, for prudential reasons, that it would be best to put in writing what they said to me verbally. They did so accordingly, and on Monday morning, the 10th instant, three of them presented to me a paper signed by all the Representatives of South Carolina, with a single exception, of which the following is a copy:
Washington, December 9, 1860.
His Excellency James Buchanan,
President of the United States:
In compliance with our statement to you yesterday, we now express to you our strong convictions that neither the constituted authorities, nor any body of the people of the State of South Carolina, will either attack or molest the United States forts in the harbor of Charleston previously to the action of the convention, and we hope and believe not until an offer has been made, through an accredited representative, to negotiate for an amicable arrangement of all matters between the State and Federal Government, provided that no re-enforcements shall be sent into those forts, and their relative military status shall remain as at present.
JOHN McQUEEN.
WM. PORCHER MILES.
M. L. BONHAM.
W. W. BOYCE.
LAWRENCE M. KEITT.
And here I must, in justice to myself, remark that at the time the paper was presented to me I objected to the word “provided,” as it might be construed into an agreement on my part which I never would make. They said nothing was further from their intention; they did not so understand it, and I should not so consider it. It is evident they could enter

117
into no reciprocal agreement with me on the subject. They did not profess to have authority to do this, and were acting in their individual character. I considered it as nothing more in effect than the promise of highly honorable gentlemen to exert their influence for the purpose expressed. The event has proven that they have faithfully kept this promise, although I have never since received a line from any one of them, or from the convention, on the subject. It is well known that it was my determination, and this I freely expressed, not to re-enforce the forts in the harbor, and thus produce a collision, until they had been actually attacked, or until I had certain evidence that they were about to be attacked. This paper I received most cordially, and considered it as a happy omen that peace might be still preserved, and that time might thus be gained for reflection. This is the whole foundation for the alleged pledge.
But I acted in the same manner as I would have done had I entered into a positive and formal agreement with parties capable of contract* ing, although such an agreement would have been on my part, from the nature of my official duties, impossible. The world knows that I have never sent any re-enforcements to the forts in Charleston Harbor, and I have certainly never authorized any change to be made u in their relative military status.77
Bearing upon this subject, I refer you to an order issued by the Secretary of War, on the 11th instant, to Major Anderson, but not brought to my notice until the 21st instant. It is as follows:
Memorandum of verbal instructions to Major Anderson, First Artillery, commanding at Fort
Moultrie, South Carolina.
You are aware of the great anxiety of the Secretary of War that a collision of the troops with the people of this State shall be avoided, and of his studied determination to pursue a course with reference to the military force and forts in this harbor which shall guard against such a collision. He has therefore carefully abstained from increasing the force at this point, or taking any measures which might add to the present excited state of the public mind, or which would throw any doubt on the confidence he feels that South Carolina will not attempt by violence to obtain possession of the public works or interfere with their occupancy. But as the counsel and acts of rash and impulsive persons may possibly disappoint these expectations of the Government, he deems it proper that you shall be prepared with instructions to meet so unhappy a contingency. He has therefore directed me verbaUy to give you such instructions.
You are carefully to avoid every act which would needlessly tend to provoke aggression; and fpr that reason you are not, without evident and imminent necessity, to take up any position which could be construed into the assumption of a hostile attitude. But you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and if attacked you are, to defend yourself to the last extremity. The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to take possession of either one of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance. You are also authorized to take similar defensive steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.
D. C. BUELL, Assistant A djutant- General.
Fort Moultrie, S. C., December 11,1860.
This is in conformity to my instructions to Major Buell.
JOHN B. FLOYD,
Secretary of War.
These were the last instructions transmitted to Major Anderson before his removal to Fort Sumter, with a single exception, in regard to a particular which does not in any degree affect the present question. Under these circumstances it is clear that Major Anderson acted upon his own responsibility, and without authority, unless, indeed, he had u tangible

﻿118	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act” on the part of the authorities of South Carolina, which has not yet been alleged. Still, he is a brave and honorable officer, and justice requires that he should not be condemned without a fair hearing.
Be this as it may, when I learned that Major Anderson had left Fort Moultrie and proceeded to Fort Sumter, my first promptings were to command him to return to his former position, and there await the contingencies presented in his instructions. This could only have been done with any degree of safety to the command by the concurrence of the South Carolina authorities. But before any steps could possibly have been taken in this direction, we received information, dated on the 28th instant, that the u palmetto flag floated out to the breeze at Castle Pinckney, and a large military force went over last night (the 27th) to Fort Moultrie.77 Thus the authorities of South Carolina, without waiting or asking for any explanation, and doubtless believing, as you have expressed it, that the officer had acted not only without but against my orders, on the very next day after the night when the movement was made, seized by a military force two of the three Federal forts in the harbor of Charleston, and have covered them under their own flag instead of that of the United States. At this gloomy period of our history startling events succeed each other rapidly. On the very day, the 27th instant, that possession of these two forts was taken the palmetto flag was raised over the Federal custom-house and post-office in Charleston ; and on the same day every officer of the customs, collector, naval officer, surveyor, and appraisers, resigned their offices. And this, although it was well known from the language of my message that, as an executive officer, I felt myself bound to collect the revenue at the port of Charleston under the existing laws.
In the harbor of Charleston we now find three forts confronting each other, over all of which the Federal flag floated only four days ago; but now over two of them this flag has been supplanted, and the palmetto flag has been substituted in its stead. It is under all these circum stances that I am urged immediately to withdraw the troops from the harbor of Charleston, and am informed that without this, negotiation is impossible. This I cannot do ; this I will not do. Such an idea was never thought of by me in any possible contingency. No allusion had ever been made to it in any communication between myself and any human being. But the inference is that I am bound to withdraw the troops from the only fort remaining in the possession of the United States in the harbor of Charleston, because the officer there in command of all the forts thought proper, without instructions, to change his position from one of them to another. I cannot admit the justice of any such inference. And at this point of writing I have received information by telegraph from Captain Humphreys, in command of the arsenal at Charleston, that it u has to-day (Sunday, the 30th) been taken by force of arms.” Comment is needless. It is estimated that the property of the United States in this arsenal was worth half a million of dollars.
After this information I have only to add that, whilst it is my duty to defend Fort Sumter as a portion of public property of the United States against hostile attacks, from whatever quarter they may come, by such means as I may possess for this purpose, I do not perceive how such a defense can be construed into a menace against the city of Charleston.*
With great personal regard, I remain, yours, very respectfully
JAMES BUCHANAN.

Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, December 31,1860. Colonel Dimice:, or commanding officer, Fort Monroe:
Sir : Prepare and put on board of the sloop-of-war Brooklyn, as soon as the latter can receive them, four companies, making at least two hundred men, destined to re enforce Fort Sumter. Embark with said companies twenty-five spare stands of arms, complete, and subsistence for the entire detachment for ninety days, or as near that amount as your supplies may furnish. Communicate at once with the commander of the war steamer, learn the earliest moment at which he can receive the troops on board, and do not fail to have them there by that time.
W. SCOTT.
Manage everything as secretly and confidentially as possible. Look to this.
Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, December 31, 1860.
To the President :
Lieutenant-General Scott again begs leave to trespass for a moment on the indulgence of the President of the United States, particularly as he learns by rumor that there is no head to the War Department.* Such are the necessities of the service that it is hoped the vacancy in question may be speedily filled, and, incidentally, that the new Secretary, if ad interim, may not be a junior officer of the Army, as it would wound the pride of any senior to serve under such Secretary.
Lieutenant-General Scott deems it to be his duty to lay the accompanying letter before the President.! The writer is a distinguished graduate of the Military Academy, and an eminent lawyer of the New York bar. Major-General Sandford, mentioned by him, is an officer and citizen of great merit and discretion, commanding the City Division of Volunteers.
General Scott does not recommend the acceptance of Mr. Hamilton’s proposition, f as we have disposable regulars enough for that single purpose; but that we already require many and large detachments for the protection of our coast defenses farther south is becoming daily more and more evident.
In reference to General Scott’s note of yesterday to the President, he respectfully adds: Of course, the War Department and General Scott cannot communicate anything to Major Anderson, or receive by mail or telegraphic wires anything from him (who must be regarded as in a state of siege), except by permission of the authorities in Charleston; and it is just possible in his state of isolation a system of forged telegrams from this place may be played oft: so successfully as to betray him into some false movement.
Most respectfully submitted to the President of the United States.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—As a sequence to the foregoing, it is respectfully suggested that there seems to be no other way of freely communicating with Major Anderson than by water, say by a revenue cutter running regularly between Wilmington, N. C., and Fort Sumter.
W. S.
*No record of Mr. Floyd’s letter of resignation can be found in the War Department, tNot of record.

No. 15.]	Fort Sumter, S. C., December 31,1860.
(Received A. G. O., January 5, 1861.) Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel: I have the honor to report that the South Carolinians show great activity in the harbor to-day. Several steamers have been running to and fro, and this afternoon about 80 soldiers, with wheelbarrows, barrels, &c., and some draught horses, were landed on Morris Island. They are evidently constructing a battery or batteries there. The lights in the harbor were put out last night, and ours is the only light-house of this harbor which exhibits a light to-night. I am at a loss what this means, unless it be that some armed vessel is expected here. The more I reflect upon the matter the stronger are my convictions that I was right in coming here. Whilst we were at Fort Moultrie our safety depended on their forbearance. A false telegram might, any night, have been seized upon as an excuse for taking this place, and then we would have been in their power. And even if there had been an understanding between the two Governments that I was not to be interfered with until the termination of the mission to Washington, the fact of the governor’s having ordered armed steamers to keep watch over me would have absolved our Government from the obligation to remain quiescent. It is certain, too, that the moment a telegram was received announcing the failure of the mission, an attack would have been made and my command sacrificed, for there can be no surrender with these men, if attacked, without a serious fight. Thank God, we are now where the Government may send us additional troops at its leisure. To be sure, the uncivil and uncourteous action of the governor in preventing us from purchasing anything in the city will annoy and inconvenience us somewhat; still, we are safe. I find that in consequence of a failure (accidental) to comply with my instructions, there is only a small supply of soap and candles, and also of coal. Still, we can cheerfully put up with the inconvenience of doing without them, for the satisfaction we feel in the knowledge that we can command this harbor as long as our Government wishes to keep it.
I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,
ROBERT ANDERSON,
Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
Reply of Commissioners to the President.
Washington, D. C., January 1,1861. To his Excellency the President of the United States :
Sir : We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th December, in reply to a note addressed by us to you on the 28th of the same month, as Commissioners from South Carolina.
In reference to the declaration with which your reply commences, that “ your position as President of the United States was clearly defined in the message to Congress of the 3d instant,” that you possess “no power to change the relations heretofore existing” between South Carolina and the United States,. “ much less to acknowledge the independence of that State,” and that, consequently, you could meet us only as private gentlemen of the highest character, with an entire willingness to communicate to Congress any proposition we might have to make, we deem it only necessary to say that the State of South Carolina having, in the

exercise of that great right of self-government which underlies all our political organizations, declared herself sovereign and independent, we, as her representatives, felt no special solicitude as to the character in which you might recognize us. Satisfied that the State had simply exercised her unquestionable right, we were prepared, in order to reach substantial good, to waive the formal considerations which your constitutional scruples might have prevented you from extending. We came here, therefore, expecting to be received as you did receive us, and perfectly content with that entire willingness of which you assured us, to submit any proposition to Congress which we might have to make upon the subject of the independence of the State.
That willingness was ample recognition of the condition of public affairs which rendered our presence necessary. In this position, however, it is our duty, both to the State which we represent and to ourselves, to correct several important misconceptions of our letter into which you have fallen.
You say: “ It was my earnest desire that such a disposition might be made of the whole subject by Congress, who alone possess the power, as to prevent the inauguration of a civil war between the parties in regard to the possession of the Federal forts in the harbor of Charleston, and I therefore deeply regret that, in your opinion, i the events of the last twenty-four hours render this impossible.* ** We expressed no such opinion, and the language which you quote as ours is altered in its sense by the omission of a most important part of the sentence. What we did say was, “ But the events of the last twenty-four hours render such an assurance impossible.** Place that “ assurance** as contained in our letter in the sentence, and we are prepared to repeat it.
Again, professing to quote our language, you say: “Thus the authorities of South Carolina, without waiting or asking for any explanation, and doubtless believing, as you have expressed it, that the officer had acted not only without, but against my orders,** &c. We expressed no such opinion in reference to the belief of the people of South Carolina. The language which you have quoted was applied solely and entirely to our assurance, obtained here, and based, as you well know, upon your own declaration—a declaration which, at that time, it was impossible for the authorities of South Carolina to have known. But without following this letter into all its details, we propose only to meet the chief points of the argument.
Some weeks ago, the State of South Carolina declared her intention in the existing condition of public affairs to secede from the United States. She called a convention of her people to put her declaration in force. The convention met, and passed the ordinance of secession. All this you anticipated, and your course of action was thoroughly considered. In your annual message you declared you had no right, and would not attempt, to coerce a seceding State, but that you were bound by your constitutional oath, and would defend the property of the United States within the borders of South Carolina if an attempt was made to take it by force. Seeing very early that this question of property was a difficult and delicate one, you manifested a desire to settle it without collision. You did not re-enforce the garrisons in the harbor of Charleston. You removed a distinguished and veteran officer from the command of Fort Moultrie because he attempted to increase his supply of ammunition. You refused to send additional troops to the same garrison when applied for by the officer appointed to succeed him. You accepted the resignation of the oldest and most efficient member of your Cabinet rather than allow these garrisons to be strengthened. You com-

﻿122	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
pelled an officer stationed at Fort Sumter to return immediately to the arsenal forty muskets which he had taken to arm his men. You expressed not to one, but to many, of the most distinguished of our public characters, whose testimony will be placed upon the record whenever it is necessary, your anxiety for a peaceful termination of this controversy, and your willingness not to disturb the military status of the forts if commissioners should be sent to the Government, whose communications you promised to submit to Congress. You received and acted on assurances from the highest official authorities of South Carolina that no attempt would be made to disturb your possession of the forts and property of the United States if you would not disturb their existing condition until commissioners had been sent and the attempt to negotiate had failed. You took from the members of the House of Representatives a written memorandum that no such attempt should be made, “ provided that no re-enforcements shall be sent into those forts, and their relative military status shall remain as at present.” And, although you attach no force to the acceptance of such.a paper, although you “considered it as nothing more in effect than the promise of highly honor-orable gentlemen,” as an obligation on one side without corresponding obligation on the other, it must be remembered (if we are rightly informed) that you were pledged, if you ever did send re-enforcements, to return it to those from whom you had received it before you executed your resolution. You sent orders to your officers commanding them strictly to follow a line of conduct in conformity with such an understanding.
Beside all this, you had received formal and official notice from the governor of South Carolina that we had been appointed commissioners, and were on our way to Washington. You knew the implied condition under which we came ,• our arrival was notified to you, and an hour appointed for an interview. We arrived in Washington on Wednesday at three o’clock, and you appointed an interview with us at one the next day. Early on that day (Thursday) the news was received here of the movement of Major Anderson. That news was communicated to you immediately, and you postponed our meeting until half past two o’clock on Friday in order that you might consult your Cabinet. On Friday we saw you, and we called upon you then to redeem your pledge. You could not deny it.
With the facts we have stated, and in the face of the crowning and conclusive fact that your Secretary of War had resigned his seat in the Cabinet upon the publicly-avowed ground that the action of Major Anderson had violated the pledged faith of the Government, and that unless the pledge was instantly redeemed he was dishonored, denial was impossible. You did not deny it) you do not deny it now; but you seek to escape from its obligation on two grounds: 1st. That we terminated all negotiation by demanding, as a preliminary, the withdrawal of the United States troops from the harbor of Charleston; and, 2d. That the authorities of South Carolina, instead of asking explanation, and giving you the opportunity to vindicate yourself, took possession of other property of the United States. We will examine both.
in the first place, we deny positively that we have ever, in any way, made any such demand. Our letter is in your possession y it will stand by this on the record. In it we inform you of the objects of our mission. We say that it would have been our duty to have assured you of our readiness to commence negotiations with the most earnest and anxious desire to settle all questions between us amicably and to our mutual advantage, but that events had rendered that assurance impossible. We

123
stated the events, and we said that until some satisfactory explanation of these events was given us, we could not proceed ; and then, having made this request for explanation, we added: “And, in conclusion, we would urge upon you the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of Charleston. Under present circumstances, they are a standing menace, which renders negotiation impossible,” &c. “Under present circumstances”! What circumstances'? Why, clearly, the occupation of Fort Sumter and the dismantling of Fort Moultrie by Major Anderson, in the face of your pledges, and without explanation or practical disavowal. And there is nothing in the letter which would or could have prevented you from declining to withdraw the troops, and offering the restoration of the status to which you were pledged, if such had been your desire. It would have been wiser and better, in our opinion, to have withdrawn the troops, and this opinion we urged upon you; but we demanded nothing but such an explanation of the events of the last twenty-four hours as would restore our confidence in the spirit with which the negotiation should be conducted.
In relation to this withdrawal of the troops from the harbor we are compelled, however, to notice one passage of your letter. Eeferring to it, you say: “This I cannot do; this I will not do. Such an idea was never thought of by me in any possible contingency. Ho allusion to it had ever been made in any communication between myself and any human being.”
In reply to this statement we are compelled to say that your conversation with us left upon our minds the distinct impression that you did seriously contemplate the withdrawal of the troops from Charleston Harbor. And in support of this impression we would add that we have the positive assurance of gentlemen of the highest possible public reputation and the most unsullied integrity—men whose name and fame, secured by long service and patriotic achievement place their testimony beyond cavil—that such suggestions had been made to and urged upon you by them, and had formed the subject of more than one earnest discussion with you. And it was this knowledge that induced us to urge upon you a policy which had to recommend it its own wisdom and the weight of such authority.
As to the second point, that the authorities of South Carolina, instead of asking explanations and giving you the opportunity to vindicate yourself, took possession of other property of the United States, we would observe—
1. That, even if this were so, it does not. avail you for defense, for the opportunity for decision was afforded you before these facts occurred. We arrived in Washington on Wednesday; the news from Major Anderson reached here early on Thursday, and was immediately communicated to you. All that day men of the highest consideration—men who had striven successfully to lift you to your great office, who had been your tried and true friends through the troubles of your administration— sought you and entreated you to act, to act at once. They told you that every hour complicated your position. They only asked you to give the assurance that, if the facts were so—that if the commander had acted without and against your orders, and in violation of your pledges—that you would restore the status you had pledged your honor to maintain.
You refused to decide. Your Secretary of War—your immediate and proper adviser in this whole matter—waited anxiously for your decision, until he felt that delay was becoming dishonor. More than twelve hours passed, and two Cabinet meetings had adjourned before you knew what the authorities of South Carolina had done, and your prompt

﻿124	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
decision at any moment of that time would have avoided the subsequent complications.
But if you had known the acts of the authorities of South Carolina, should that have prevented your keeping your faith ? What was the condition of things? For the last sixty days you have had in Charleston Harbor not force enough to hold the forts against an equal enemy. Two of them were empty, one of those two the most important in the harbor; it could have been taken at any time. You ought to know better than any man that it would have been taken but for the efforts of those who put their trust in your honor. Believing that they were threatened by Fort Sumter especially, the people were with difficulty restrained from securing, without blood, the possession of this important fortress. After many and reiterated assurances given on your behalf, which we cannot believe unauthorized, they determined to forbear, and in good faith sent on their commissioners to negotiate with you. They meant you no harm; wished you no ill. They thought of you kindly, believed you true, and were willing, as far as was consistent with duty, to spare you unnecessary and hostile collision.
Scarcely had their commissioners left, than Major Anderson waged war. No other words will describe his action. It was not a peaceful change from one fort to another; it was a hostile act in the highest sense—one only justified in the presence of a superior enemy, and in imminent peril. He abandoned his position, spiked his guns, burned his gun carriages, made preparations for the destruction of his post, and withdrew, under cover of the night, to a safer position. This was war.
No man could have believed (without your assurance) that any officer could have taken such a step, “not only without orders, but against orders.” What the State did was in simple self-defense; for this act, with all its attending circumstances, was as much war as firing a volley; and war being thus begun, until those commencing it explained their action and disavowed their intention, there was no room for delay; and even at this moment, while we are writing, it is more than probable, from the tenor of your letter, that re-enforcements are hurrying on to the conflict, so that when the first gun shall be fired there will have been, on your part, one continuous, consistent series of actions commencing in a demonstration essentially warlike, supported by regular re-enforcement, and terminating in defeat or victory.
And all this without the slightest provocation; for, among the many things which you have said, there is one thing you cannot say—you have waited anxiously for news from the seat of war, in hopes that delay would furnish some excuse for this precipitation. But this “tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act on the part of the authorities of South Carolina” (which is the only justification of Major Anderson) you are forced to admit “has not yet been alleged.” But you have decided. You have resolved to hold by force what you have obtained through our misplaced confidence, and byrefusing to disavow the action of Major Anderson, have converted his violation of orders into a legitimate act of your executive authority. Be the issue what it may, of this we are assured, that if Fort Moultrie has been recorded in history as a memorial of Carolina gallantry, Fort Sumter will live upon the succeeding page as an imperishable testimony of Carolina faith.
By your course you have probably rendered civil war inevitable. Be it so. If you choose to force this issue upon us, the State of South Carolina will accept it, and relying upon Him who is the God of Justice as well as the God of Hosts, will endeavor to perform the great duty which lies before her, hopefully, bravely, and thoroughly.

Our mission being one for negotiation and peace, and your note leaving us without hope of a withdrawal of the troops from Fort Sumter, or of the restoration of the status quo existing at the time of our arrival, and intimating, as we think, your determination to re-enforce the garrison in the harbor of Charleston, we respectfully inform you that we propose returning to Charleston on to-morrow afternoon.

Executive Mansion,
3J o’clock, Wednesday.
This paper, just presented to the President, is of such a character that he declines to receive it.
Statement of Messrs. Miles and Keitt of whattranspiredbetween the President and the South Carolina delegation.
In compliance with the request of the Convention, we beg leave to make the following statement:
On Saturday, the 8th of December several of the South Carolina delegation, including ourselves, waited upon the President. At this time there was a growing belief that re-enforcements were on the eve of being sent to the forts in Charleston Harbor.
It was known that the subject was frequently and earnestly discussed in the Cabinet. It was rumored that General Cass and Mr. Holt were urgent that re-enforcements should be sent. Upon our being announced the President, who was then in Cabinet council, came out to us in the anteroom. Wo at once entered into a conversation upon the topic which was so closely occupying his thoughts as well as ours. The President seemed much disturbed and moved. He told us that he had had a painful interview with the wife of Major Anderson, who had come on from New York to see him. She had manifested great anxiety and distress at the situation of her husband, whom she seemed to consider in momentary danger of an attack from an excited and lawless mob. The President professed to feel a deep responsibility resting upon him to protect the lives of Major Anderson and his command. We told him that the news that re-enforcements were on their way to Charleston would be the surest means of provoking what Mrs. Anderson apprehended, and what he so much deprecated. We said further that we did not believe that Major Anderson was in any danger of such an attack ; that the general sentiment of the State was against any such proceeding 5 that prior to the action of the State Convention, then only ten days off, we felt satisfied that there would be no attempt to molest the forts in any way; that after the convention met, while we could not possibly undertake to say what that body would see fit to do, we yet hoped and believed that nothing would be done until we had first endeavored, by duly accredited commissioners, to negotiate for a peaceful settlement of all matters, including the delivery of the forts, between South Carolina and the Federal Government. At the same time we again reiterated

﻿126	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
our solemn belief that any change in the then existing condition of things in Charleston Harbor would, in the excited state of feeling at home, inevitably precipitate a collision.
The impression made upon us was that the President was wavering and had not decided what course he would pursue. He said he was glad to have had this conversation with us, but would prefer that we should give him a written memorandum of the substance of what we had said. This we did on Monday, the 10th. It was in these words:
His Excellency Jams Buchanan,
President of the United States:
In compliance with onr statement to you yesterday, we now express to you our strong convictions that neither the constituted authorities, nor anybody of the people of the State of South Carolina, will either attack or molest the United States torts in the harbor of Charleston previously to the action of the convention, and we hope and believe not until an offer has been made, through an accredited representative, to negotiate for an amicable arrangement of all matters between the State and Federal Government, provided that no re-enforcement shall be sent into those forts, and their relative military status shall remain as at present.

Washington, December 9, 1860.
The President did not like the word “ provided” because it looked as if we were binding him while avowing that we had no authority to commit the convention. We told him that we did not so understand it. We were expressing our convictions and belief, predicated upon the maintenance of a certain condition of things, which maintenance was absolutely and entirely in Ms power, If he maintained such condition, then we believed that collision would be avoided until the attempt at a peaceable negotiation had failed. If he did not, then we solemnly assured him that we believed that collision must inevitably and at once be precipitated. He seemed satisfied, and said it was not his intention to send re-enforcements or make any change. We explained to him what we meant by the words “ relative military status,” as applied to the forts; mentioned the difference between Major Anderson’s occupying his then position at Fort Moultrie and throwing himself into Fort Sumter. We stated that the latter step would be equivalent to re-enforcing the garrison, and would just as certainly as the sending of fresh troops lead to the result which we both desired to avoid. When we rose to go the President said in substance, “After all, this is a matter of honor among gentlemen. I do hot know that any paper or writing is necessary. We understand each other.”
One of the delegation, just before leaving the room, remarked: “ Mr. President, you have determined to let things remain as they are, and not to send re-enforcements; but suppose that you were hereafter to change your policy for any reason, what then U That would put us, who are willing to use our personal influence to prevent any attack upon the forts before commissioners are sent on to Washington, in rather an embarrassing position.” “Then,” said the President, “I would first return you this paper.” We do not pretend to give the exact words on either side, but we are sure we give the sense of both.
The above is a full and exact account of what passed between the President and the delegation. The President, in his letter to our commissioners, tries to give the impression that our “understanding” or “agreement” was not a “pledge.” We confess we are not sufficiently versed in the wiles of diplomacy to feel the force of this “distinction

without a difference.” Nor can we understand how, in “a matter of honor among gentlemen,” in which “no paper or writing is necessary,” the very party who was willing to put it on that high footing can honorably descend to mere verbal criticism to purge himself of what all gentlemen and men of honor must consider a breach of faith. The very fact that we (the Representatives from South Carolina) were not authorized to commit or “pledge” the State, were not treating with the President as accredited ministers with full powers, but as gentlemen, assuming, to a certain extent, the delicate task of undertaking to foreshadow the course and policy of the State, should have made the President the more ready to strengthen our hands to bring about and carry out that course and policy which he professed to have as much at heart as we had. While we were not authorized to say that the Convention would not order the occupation of the forts immediately after secession, and prior to the sending on of commissioners, the President, as commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, could positively say that so long as South Carolina abstained from attacking and seizing the forts, he would not send re-enforcements to them, or allow their relative military status to be changed.
We were acting in the capacity of gentlemen holding certain prominent positions, and anxious to exert such influence as we might possess to effect a peaceful solution of pending political difficulties, and prevent, if possible, the horrors of war. The President was acting in a double capacity—not only as a gentleman, whose influence in carrying nut his share of the understanding or agreement was potential, but as the head of the Army, and therefore having the absolute control of the whole matter of re-enforcing or transferring the garrison at Charleston.
But we have dwelt long enough upon this point. Suffice it to say that considering the President as bound in honor, if not by treaty stipulations, not to make any change in the forts or to send re-enforcements to them unless they were attacked, we of the delegation who were elected to the Convention felt equally bound in honor to do everything on our part to prevent any premature collision. This Convention can bear us witness as to whether or not we endeavored honorably to carry out our share of the agreement.
The published debates at the very commencement of the session contain the evidence of our good faith. We trusted the President. We believed his wishes concurred with his policy, and that both were directed to avoiding any inauguration of hostilities. We were confirmed in our confidence, and reassured in our belief by a significant event which took place subsequent to our interview. He allowed his premier Cabinet officer, an old and tried friend, to resign rather than yield to his solicitations for the re-enforcement of the garrison at Charleston. We urged this as a convincing proof of his firmness and sincerity. But how have we been deceived! The news of Major Anderson’s coup produced a sudden and unexpected change in the President’s policy. While declaring that his withdrawal from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter was “without orders, and contrary to orders,” he yet refused for twelve hours to take any action in the matter. For twelve hours, therefore, without any excuse, he refused to redeem his plighted word. No subsequent acts on the part of our State, no after reasons, can wipe away the stain which he suffered to rest upon his “honor as a gentleman,” while those hours, big with portentous events, rolled slowly by. His Secretary of War, impatient of a delay, every moment of which he felt touched his own honor, resigned. He did so solely on the ground that the faith of the Government, solemnly pledged, was broken, if it failed promptly to

﻿128	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
undo what had been done contrary to its wishes, against its settled policy and in violation of its distinct agreement. The President accepted his resignation without comment. He did not attempt to disabuse the mind of his Secretary as to what was the true position of the Government.
What a spectacle does the President’s vacillating and disingenuous course present! He allows one Secretary to resign rather than abandon a policy .which he has agreed upon. Scarcely have a few short weeks elapsed, and he accepts the resignation of another rather than adhere to that very policy. He makes an agreement with gentlemen which, while he admits that they have faithfully kept it on their part, he himself evades and repudiates. And this he does rather than redress a wrong, correct an error—what he himself considers an error—committed by a subordinate, without his orders and contrary to his wishes! It was at least due to Mr. Floyd, who, as one of his Cabinet, had officially and personally stood by his administration from its very commencement— through good report and through evil report—to have explained to him that he was, in the President’s opinion, laboring under a misapprehension; at least to have said to him, u You are mistaken about this matter; do not leave me on a false issue.” But no; he coldly, ungraciously, yet promptly, receives the resignation without a syllable of remonstrance, and thus tacitly but unequivocally accepts without shame the issue presented. He does not deny that the faith of his Government is pledged, but he deliberately refuses to redeem it.

Telegram sent to Mr. A. H. Schultz, 64 Cedar street, P. O. box 3462? New York City, that his propositions are entertained, and that a staff officer will be in the city to-morrow evening to conclude arrangements.
Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas is directed, first, to satisfy himself that Mr. Schultz’s agency is reliable, then to cause the steamer to be prepared for sea as soon as practicable, provided the terms be reasonable; then to cause two hundred well instructed men with, say, three officers, to be embarked from Governor’s Island, with three months’ subsistence, including fresh beef and vegetables, and ample ammunition; also, one hundred extra stand of arms. Instructions to be sent by Colonel Thomas in writing to Major Anderson that should a fire likely to prove injurious be opened upon any vessel bringing re-enforcements or supplies, or upon her boats, from any battery in the harbor, the guns of Fort Sumter may be employed to silence such fire, and the same in case of like firing upon Fort Sumter itself.
The orders to the steamer and the troops on board will strictly enjoin complete concealment of the presence of the latter when approaching the bay; Major Anderson to be warned to stand on his guard against all telegrams, and to be informed that measures will soon be taken to enable him to correspond with the Government by sea and Wilmington, N.

Lieut. Col. Lorenzo Thomas,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.
War Department, Washington, January 3, 1861.
Hon. Benjamin Stanton,
Chairman Committee on Military Affairs, House of Representatives:
Sir : In answer to your letter, asking for information on certain points specified in a resolution adopted by the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Bepresentatives on the 18th ultimo, I have the honor to state as follows:
According to the latest report of the Engineer officer having charge of the construction of the defenses of the harbor of Charleston, everything practicable had been done to place Fort Moultrie in an efficient condition, and, with a proper garrison, it was deemed susceptible of an energetic defense. There were then employed at that work an officer and one hundred and twenty workmen, independent of regular garrison.*
On the evening of the 26th ultimo Maj. Bobert Anderson, First Artillery, in command of the troops in Charleston Harbor, apprehensive of the safety of his command from the insecurity of the fort, and having reason to believe that the South Carolinians contemplated or were preparing to proceed to a hostile act against him, and desiring to prevent a collision and effusion of blood, evacuated Fort Moultrie, after leaving orders for spiking the cannon and disabling some of the carriages, and removed his forces to Fort Sumter, where they now are. Castle Pinckney was at the date of the latest report in good condition as regards preparation, and with a proper garrison as defensible as it can be made. One officer and thirty workmen were engaged in the repair of the cisterns, replacing decayed banquettes,, and attending to other matters of detail.
Since the date of the reports referred to, Fort Moultrie and Castle Pinckney have been taken possession of by troops of the State of South Carolina, acting under the orders of the governor, and are now held by those troops, with all the armament and other public property therein at the time of their seizure. I inclose a statement (No. 1) of the number and description of ordnance and arms at the date of the last returns at Fort Moultrie, Castle Pinckney, and Charleston Arsenal, respectively. That arsenal, with all its contents, was also taken possession of on the 30th ultimo by an armed body of South Carolina troops, acting under orders of the governor of the State, as represented in the following report of Frederick C. Humphreys, military storekeeper of ordnance, in charge, viz:
This arsenal was taken by force of arms by the militia of South Carolina, by order of Governor Pickens. The commanding officer was allowed to salute his flag before lowering it with one gun for each State now in the Union (thirty-two), and to take it with him, and the detachment to occupy the quarters until instruction from Washington can be obtained.
At that time the force under his control consisted of nine enlisted soldiers of ordnance and six hired men.

Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott,
Washington, D. C.:
Dear General : I had an interview with Mr. Schultz at 8 o’clock last evening, and found him to be, as you supposed, the commission, and together we visited Mr. M. O. Roberts. The latter looks exclusively to the dollars, whilst Mr. S. is acting for the good of his country. Mr. R. required $1,500 per day for ten days, besides the cost of 300 tons of coal, which I declined; but, after a long conversation, I became satisfied that the movement could be made with his vessel, the Star of the West, without exciting suspicion. I finally chartered her at $1,250 per day. She is running on the New Orleans route, and will clear for that port; but no notice will be put in the papers, and persons seeing the ship moving from the dock will suppose she is on her regular trip. Major Eaton, commissary of subsistence, fully enters into my views. He will see Mr. Roberts, hand him a list of the supplies with the places where they may be procured, and the purchases will be made on the ship’s account. In this way no public machinery will be used.

To-night I pass over to Governor’s Island to do what is necessary, i. e., have 300 stand of arms and ammunition on the wharf, and 200 men ready to march on board Mr. Schultz’s steam-tugs about nightfall tomorrow, to go to the steamer, passing very slowly down the bay. I shall cut off all communication between the island and the cities until Tuesday morning, when I expect the steamer will be safely moored at Fort Sumter.
I have seen and conversed with Colonel Scott, and also saw your daughter at your house. After leaving you, I obtained the key of the outer door of the office, but could nowhere find the key of your door or of mine, so failed to get the chart.

Accordingly, on approaching the Charleston bar, you will place below decks your entire force, in order that only the ordinary crew may be seen by persons from the shore or on boarding the vessel.

Further re-enforcements will be sent if necessary.
Should a fire, likely to prove injurious, be opened upon any vessel bringing re-enforcements or supplies, or upon tow-boats within the reach of your guns, they may be employed to silence such fire; and you may act in like manner in case a fire is opened upon Fort Sumter itself.

I then expressed a wish to withdraw my funds, and was refused for the x>resent—however, asked to call again on Monday, when the assistant treasurer would be there himself.

Colonel : Through the courtesy of Governor Pickens I am enabled to make this communication, which will be taken to Washington by my brother, Larz Anderson, esq. I have the honor to report my command in excellent health and in fine spirits. We are daily adding to the strength of our position by closing up embrasures which we shall not use, mounting guns, &c. The South Carolinians are also very active in erecting batteries and preparing for a conflict, which I pray God may not occur. Batteries have been constructed bearing upon and, I presume, commanding the entrance to the harbor. They are also to-day busily at work on a battery at Fort Johnson, intended to fire against me. My position will, should there be no treachery among the workmen, whom we are compelled to retain for the present, enable me to hold this fort against any force which can be brought against me, and it would enable me, in the event of a war, to annoy the South Carolinians by preventing them from throwing supplies into their new posts except by the out-of-the-way passage through Stono River. At present, it would be dangerous and difficult for a vessel from without to enter the harbor, in consequence of the batteries which are already erected and being erected. I shall not ask for any increase of my command, because I do not know what the ulterior views of the Government are. We are now, or soon will be, cut off from all communication, unless by means of a powerful fleet, which shall have the ability to carry the batteries at the mouth of this harbor.
Trusting in God that nothing will occur to array a greater number of States than have already taken ground against the General Government,

Under that hope, and that alone, did I refrain from opening fire upon your batteries. I have the honor, therefore, respectfully to ask whether the above mentioned act— one, I believe, without a parallel in the history of our country or of any other civilized government—was committed in obedience to your instructions, and to notify you, if it be not disclaimed, that I must regard it as an act of war, and that I shall not, after a reasonable time for the return of my messenger, permit any vessels to pass within range of the guns of my fort.

State *of South Carolina, Executive Office,
Headquarters, Charleston, January 9, 1861.
Maj. Robert Anderson,
Commanding Fort Sumter:
Sir : Your letter has been received. In it you make certain statements which very plainly show that you have not been fully informed by your Government of the precise relations which now exist between it and the State of South Carolina. Official information has been communicated to the Government of the United States that the political connection heretofore existing between the State of South Carolina and the States which were known as the United States had ceased, and that the State of South Carolina had resumed all the power it had delegated to the United States under the compact known as the Constitution of the United States. The right which the State of South Carolina possessed to change the political relations which it held with other States under the Constitution of the United States has been solemnly asserted by the people of this State in convention, and now does not admit of discussion. In anticipation of the ordinance of secession, of which the President of the United States has received official notification, it was understood by him that sending any re-enforcement of the troops of the United States in the harbor of Charleston would be regarded by the constituted authorities of the State of South Carolina as an act of hostility, and at the same time it was understood by him that any change in the occupation of the forts in the harbor of Charleston would in like manner be regarded as an act of hostility. Either or both of these events, occurriug during the period in which the State of South Carolina constituted a part of the United States, was then distinctly notified to the President of the United States as an act or acts of hostility 5 because either or both would be regarded, and could only be intended, to dispute the right of the State of South Carolina to that political independence which she has always asserted and will always retain. Whatever would have been, during the continuance of this State as a member of the United States, an act of hostility, became much more so when the State of South Carolina had dissolved the connection with the Government of the United States. After the secession of the State of South Carolina, Fort Sumter continued in the possession of the troops of the United States. How that fort is at this time in the possession of the troops of the United States it is not now necessary to discuss. It will suffice to say that the occupancy of that fort has been regarded by the State of South Carolina as the first act of positive hostility committed by the troops of the United States within the limits of this State, and was in this light regarded as so unequivocal that it occasioned the termination of the negotiations then pending at Washington between the Commissioners of the State of South Carolina and the President of the United States. The attempt to re-enforce the troops now at Fort Sumter, or to retake and resume possession of the forts within the waters of this State, which you abandoned, after spiking the guns placed there, and doing otherwise much damage, cannot be regarded by the authorities of the State as indicative of any other purpose than the coercion of the State by the armed force of the Government. To repel such an attempt is too plainly its duty to allow it to be discussed. But while defending its waters, the authorities of the State have been careful so to conduct the affairs of the State that no act, however necessary for its defense, should lead to an useless waste of life. Special agents, therefore, have been off* the bar to warn all approaching vessels, if armed or unarmed, and having troops to re-

enforce the forts on board, not to enter the harbor of Charleston, and special orders have been given to the commanders of all forts and batteries not to fire at such vessels until a shot fired across their bows would warn them of the prohibition of the State. Under these circumstances, the Star of the West, it is understood, this morning attempted to enter this harbor, with troops on board, and having been notified that she could not enter, was fired into. The act is perfectly justified by me. In regard to your threat in regard to vessels in the harbor, it is only necessary to say that you must judge of your own responsibilities. Your position in this harbor has been tolerated by the authorities of the State, and while the act of which you complain is in perfect consistency with the rights and duties of the State, it is not perceived how far the conduct which you propose to adopt can find a parallel in the history of any country, or be reconciled with any other purpose of your Government than that of imposing upon this State the condition of a conquered province.

Fort Sumter, S. C., January 9,1861.
General Totten:
My Dear Sir : I have only a moment to write by Lieutenant Meade [?], who comes with dispatches from Major Anderson. I wish to assure you, however, that the officers of your corps are doing everything in their power to make this work impregnable, even with the present small garrison of seventy men. We even mount all the guns, as we can do it much more rapidly than the garrison. We have twenty-nine guns on the first tier and eleven on the barbette tier. Four 8-inch columbiads are ready to mount to-morrow. I shall place the 10-inch on the parade as mortars.
The firing upon the Star of the West this morning by the batteries on Morris Island opened the war, but Major Anderson hopes that the delay of sending to Washington may possibly prevent civil war. The hope, although a small one, may be the thread that prevents the sundering of the Union. We are none the less determined to defend ourselves to the last extremity. I am in want of funds, and would respectfully urge that as soon as possible $15,000 may be placed to my credit in New York. In haste.
Very respectfully,
J. G. FOSTER,
Captain, Engineers.
P. S.—I beg to refer you to Lieutenant Meade [?] for particulars.

might re-enforce you at its leisure, and that you regarded yourself safe in your present position, some two hundred and fifty instructed recruits had been ordered to proceed from Governor’s Island to Fort Sumter on the Star of the West, for the purpose of strengthening the force under your command. The probability is, from the current rumors of to-day, that this vessel has been fired into by the South Carolinians, and has not been able to reach you. To meet all contingencies, the Brooklyn has been dispatched, with instructions not to cross the bar at the harbor of Charleston, but to afford to the Star of the West and those on board all the assistance they may need, and in the event the recruits have not effected a landing at Fort Sumter they will return to Fort Monroe.
I avail myself of the occasion to express the great satisfaction of the Government at the forbearance, discretion, and firmness with which you have acted, amid the perplexing and difficult circumstances in which you have been placed. You will continue, as heretofore, to act strictly on the defensive; to avoid, by all means compatible with the safety of your command, a collision with the hostile forces by which you are surrounded. But for the movement, so promptly and brilliantly executed, by which you transferred your forces to Fort Sumter, the probability is that ere this the defenselessness of your position would have invited an attack, which, there is reason to believe, was contemplated, if not in active preparation, which must have led to the effusion of blood, that has been thus so happily prevented. The movement, therefore, was in every way admirable, alike for its humanity [and] patriotism, as for its soldiership.

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer TJ. S. Army, Washington, _Z>. <7. :
General : The sudden resolution to send a joint commission to Washington enables me to write only a few lines to tell you that my operations are going steadily on. Seventeen guns are now mounted on the barbette tier, and in good working order. Four of these are columbiads. Owing to the breaking of the truck, we did not accomplish much yesterday beyond hoisting carriages to the terre-plein (upper). My force is gradually growing less and less, owing to the fears of the approaching conflict among the men. By to night I may not have more than a dozen men for work. This is unavoidable, because it will not do to force the fearful or seditious men to remain. I shall, however, get nearly all the guns up before all leave. Yesterday a commission came from Governor Pickens to summon this fort to surrender. It was composed of General Jamison, Secretary of War, and Judge McGrath, Secretary of State of South Carolina. They subsequently (during the conference with u§) moderated the matter somewhat, so as to have it understood that their demand was not to alter the present status. The major proposed to send a joint commission to Washington, which is accepted this morning, and Lieutenant Hall leaves for this purpose.
I received a dispatch from Mrs. Foster, after her arrival in Washington, which I understood to mean that I had to my credit there $15,000. This gives me great satisfaction, for I was becoming embarrassed for want of funds. You can rely upon my doing all that I can to secure

this work, and to strengthen the defense. I am most efficiently supported by Lieutenants Snyder and Meade, who are exerting themselves to the utmost, and I hope the Department will give them full credit for their zeal and efficiency.
The temper of the people of this State is becoming every day more bitter, and I do not see how we can avoid a bloody conflict. I wish, therefore, to say to you that nearly all of my papers and vouchers are in my office in town, whence I have not been permitted to remove them. All of my personal effects are in the house that I occupied on Sullivan’s Island, with the exception of some few things that I have here. The suddenness of the movement over here did not permit me an opportunity to remove anything, and my active operations in the matter did not incline the authorities in my favor so as to permit me to remove anything afterwards. I shall, however, endeavor to leave everything relating to my responsibilities and accounts in as good order as possible. You must excuse my referring to these matters, which are partly personal, because if we are attacked, it may be by overpowering numbers, and I have made up my mind to defend the work, as far as I am concerned, to the last extremity. The main ship channel was closed yesterday morning by sinking four hulks across it, upon the bar. Last night a good deal of work was done on Fort Moultrie to defile it from the fire of this fort. There is a large steamer outside of the bar, apparently a man-of-war.
The health of the command is good, and their spirits excellent. In haste.

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer JJ. IS. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General : I have the honor to inform you that the facilities for mail communication between this fort and the city of Charleston have been restored by order of Governor Pickens. The arrangement is for one of my boats to receive the mail at Fort Johnson, whither it is to be brought every day at 12 o’clock, and to deliver the mail from the fort at the same time, to be taken to the office in the city. The reason assigned for this particular arrangement is, that it will avoid all chances for rencounters and bloodshed between our boats’ crews and riotous persons on the wharves in the city. All letters from the Department will, in all probability, be received.
Since the hasty letter sent by Lieutenant Hall, nothing of marked importance has transpired. The Carolinians are hard at work on Fort Moultrie raising sand-bag and earth merlons between all the guns that look in this direction, in a similar manner to the merlons that I con-

structed on the front facing the sand hills. The force on the island is about 700 men, asl saw them drilling this evening in about that number.
I think that they have transferred several of the guns from Fort Moultrie and Castle Pinckney to the batteries on Morris Island, with the object of strengthening them, since they have found by the firing on the Star of the West that they are well placed. There is another battery on the upper end of Sullivan’s Island, out of the reach of our guns, to guard the Maffitt Channel. The main ship channel is so much obstructed by the four hulks that they sunk in it on the 11th that vessels find the greatest difficulty in getting out or in, even with the harbor pilots, who know their position exactly. The middle channel is the only one that can be used with safety by vessels that wish to run the gauntlet with re-enforcements for us. I do not, however, consider it good policy to send re-enforcements here at this time. We can hold our own as long as it is necessary to do so. If any force is sent here it must have the strength and facilities for landing and carrying the batteries on Morris or Sullivan’s Island. The former will be the easier operation. But if the whole South is to secede from the Union, a conflict here and a civil war can only be avoided by giving up this fort sooner or later. We are, however, all prepared to go all lengths in its defense if the Government requires it. We have now, besides the twenty-nine guns mounted in the first tier (three 8-inch howitzers, five 42-pounders, and twenty-one 32-pounders), nineteen guns mounted on the third or barbette tier (six 8-inch columbiads, five 8 inch sea-coast howitzers, two 42-pounders, and six 24-pounders). These are all well placed for firing on Fort Moultrie, Morris Island, and Fort Johnson. As fast as the remaining guns are mounted they will be distributed with the same object. Every precaution has been taken to secure the shutters for the embrasures and loopholes and the main gates. The latter have been re-enforced by a solid wall three feet thick by five feet high, with a narrow doorway of 20 inch width to serve for passage, and also for embrasure of an 8-inch howitzer in case of attack. A discharge of canister from this gun will sweep the wharf. The lanyard of this gun is carried back through a hole in the second gate. The lanyards of the two guns to sweep the landing to the right and left are also brought inside, to insure those guns being fired, even if the retiring guard forgets to do it while upon the outside. A large number of shells have been arranged with friction tubes to be used with long lanyards, so that the shell, being rolled over or suffered to fall from the edge of the parapet, will explode as it gets to the end of the line. The room over the gateway has also been supplied with hand grenades.
The weather since the command has occupied the fort has been very bad, and the whole force, including the camp followers, have ‘been suffered to quarter in the officers’ quarters. This, together with the firing of the guns at the gateway without raising the windows, by which most of the glass on the gorge and many of the sashes were broken, has caused considerable damage to the quarters. I regard it, however, as of small moment in comparison with the necessity for keeping the command well housed and also as well warmed as the small stock of fuel will allow. The damage to the windows has been repaired temporarily. I have regarded any expense not strictly required for the defense as unnecessary under the present aspect of affairs.
During the continuance of the present arrangements for the mail I will keep you fully informed of everything that transpires.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. G. FOSTER, Captain, Engineers.

﻿140	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
War Department, January 16,1861.
Maj. Bobert Anderson,
First Artillery, Commanding Fort Sumter: .
Sir: Your dispatch No. 17, covering your correspondence with the governor of South Carolina, has been received from the hand of Lieutenant Talbot. You rightly designate the firing into the Star of the West as “an act of war/7 and one which was actually committed without the slightest provocation. Had their act been perpetrated by a foreign nation, it would have been your imperative duty to have resented it with the whole force of your batteries. As, however, it was the work of the government of South Carolina, which is a member of this confederacy, and was prompted by the passions of a highly-inflamed population of citizens of the United States, your forbearance to return the fire is fully approved by the President. Unfortunately, the Government had not been able to make known to you that the Star of the West had sailed from New York for your relief, and hence, when she made her appearance in the harbor of Charleston, you did not feel the force of the obligation to protect her approach as you would naturally have done had this information reached you.
Your late dispatches, as well as the very intelligent statement of Lieutenant Talbot, have relieved the Government of the apprehensions previously entertained for your safety. In consequence, it is not its purpose at present to re-enforce you. The attempt to do so would, no doubt, be attended by a collision of arms and the effusion of blood—a national calamity which the President is most anxious, if possible, to avoid. You will, therefore, report frequently your condition, and the character and activity of the preparations, if any, which may be being made for an attack upon the fort, or for obstructing the Government in any endeavors it may make to strengthen your command.
Should your dispatches be of a nature too important to be intrusted to the mails, you will convey them by special messengers. Whenever, in your judgment, additional supplies or re-enforcements are necessary for your safety, or for a successful defense of the tort, you will at once communicate the fact to this Department, and a prompt and vigorous effort will be made to forward them.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. HOLT.
Department of State, January 16,1861. Lieut. Gen. Winfield Soott :
Dear General : The habitual frankness of your character, the deep interest you take in everything that concerns the public defense, your expressed desire that I should hear and understand your views—these reasons, together with an earnest wish to know my own duty and to do it, induce me to beg you for a little light, which perhaps you alone can shed, upon the present state of our affairs.
1.	Is it the duty of the Government to re-enforce Major Anderson?
2.	If yes, how soon is it necessary that those re-enforcements should be there ?
3.	What obstacles exist to prevent the sending of such re-enforcements at any time when it may be necessary to do so ?
I trust you will not regard it as presumption in me if I give you the crude notions which I myself have already formed out of very imperfect materials.

## p. 141 (#157) ############################################

﻿Chap. I ]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.----UNION.	141
A statement of my errors, if errors they be, will enable you to correct them the more easily.
I.	It seems now to be settled that Major Anderson and his command at Fort Sumter are not to be withdrawn. The United States Government is not to surrender its last hold upon its own property in South Carolina. Major Anderson has a position so nearly impregnable that an attack upon him at present is wholly improbable, and he is supplied with provisions which will last him very well for two months. In the mean time Fort Sumfer is invested on every side by the avowedly hostile forces of South Carolina. It is in a state of siege. They have already prevented communication between its commander and his own Government, both by sea and land. There is no doubt that they intend to continue this state of things, as far as it is in their power to do so. In the course of a few weeks from this time it will become very difficult for him to hold out. The constant labor and anxiety of his men will exhaust their physical power, and this exhaustion, of course, will proceed very much more rapidly as soon as they begin to get short of provision.
If the troops remain in Fort Sumter without any change in their condition, and the hostile attitude of South Carolina remains as it is now, the question of Major Anderson’s surrender is one of time only. If he is not to be relieved, is it not entirely clear that he should be ordered to surrender at once? It having been determined that the latter order shall not be given, it follows that relief must be sent him at some time before it is too late to save him.
II.	This brings me to the second question: When should the re-enforcements and provisions be sent? Can we justify ourselves in delaying the performance of that duty?
The authorities of South Carolina are improving every moment, and increasing their ability to prevent re-enforcement every hour, while every day that rises sees us with a power diminished to send in the requisite relief. I think it certain that Major Anderson could be put in possession of all the defensive powers he needs with very little risk to this Government, if the efforts were made immediately; but it is impossible to predict how much blood or money it may cost if it be postponed for two or three months.
* The fact that other persons are to have charge of the Government before the worst comes to the worst has no influence upon my mind, and I take it for granted will not be regarded as a just element in making up your opinion.
The anxiety which an American citizen must feel about any future event which may affect the existence of the country is not less if he expects it to occur on the 5th of March than it would be if he knew it was going to happen on the 3d.
III.	I am persuaded that the difficulty of relieving Major Anderson has been very much magnified to the minds of some persons. From you I shall be able to ascertain whether I am mistaken or they. I am thoroughly satisfied that the battery on Morris Island can give no serious trouble. A vessel going in where the Star of the West went will not be within the reach of the battery’s guns longer than from six to ten minutes. The number of shots that could be fired upon her in that time may be easily calculated, and I think the chances of her being seriously injured can be demonstrated by simple arithmetic to be very small. A very unlucky shot might cripple her, to be sure, and therefore the risk is something. But then it is a maxim, not less in war than in peace, that where nothing is ventured nothing can be gained. The removal of the buoys has undoubtedly made the navigation of the channel more difficult. But there are pilots outside of Charleston, and

﻿142	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
many of the officers of the Navy, who could steer a ship into the harbor by the natural land marks with perfect safety. This, be it remembered, is not now a subject of speculation; the actual experiment has been tried. The Star of the West did pass the battery, and did overcome the difficulties of the navigation, meeting with no serious trouble from either cause. They have tried it s we can say probatum est; and there is an end to the controversy.
I am convinced that a pirate, or a slaver, or a smuggler, who could be assured of making five hundred dollars by going into the harbor in the face of all the dangers which now threaten a vessel bearing the American flag, would laugh them to scorn, and to one of our naval officers who has the average of daring, “the danger’s self were lure alone.”
There really seems to me nothing in the way that ought to stop us except the guns of Fort Moultrie. If they are suffered to open a fire upon a vessel bearing re-enforcements to Fort Sumter, they might stop any other vessel as they stopped the Star of the West. But is it necessary that this intolerable outrage should be submitted to? Would it not be an act of pure self-defense on the part of Major Anderson to silence Fort Moultrie, if it be necessary to do so, for the purpose of insuring the safety of a vessel whose arrival at Fort Sumter is necessary for his protection, and could he not do it effectually ? Would the South Carolinians dare to fire upon any vessel which Major Anderson would tell them beforehand must be permitted to pass, on pain of his guns being opened upon her assailants ? But suppose it impossible for an unarmed vessel to pass the battery, what is the difficulty of sending the Brooklyn or the Macedonian in? I have never heard it alleged that the latter could not cross the bar, and I think if the fact had been so it would have been mentioned in my hearing before this time. It will turn out upon investigation, after all that has been said and sung about the Brooklyn, that there is water enough there for her. She draws ordinarily only sixteen and one-half feet, and her draught can be reduced eighteen inches by putting her upon an even keel. The shallowest place will give her eighteen feet of water at high tide. In point of fact, she has crossed that bar more than once. But apart even from these resources, the Government has at its command three or four smaller steamers of light draught and great speed, which could be armed and at sea in a few days, and would not be in the least troubled by any opposition that could be made to their entrance.
It is not, however, necessary to go into these details, with which, I presume, you are fully acquainted. I admit that the state of things may be somewhat worse now than they were a week ago, and are probably getting worse every day 5 but is not that the strongest reason that can be given for taking time by the forelock ?
I feel confident that you will excuse me for making this communication. I have some responsibilities of my own to meet, and I can discharge them only when I understand the subject to which they relate. Your opinion, of course, will be conclusive upon me, for on such a matter I cannot do otherwise than defer to your better judgment. If you think it most consistent with your duty to be silent, I shall have no right to complain.
If you would rather answer orally than make a written reply, I will meet you either at your own quarters or here in the State Department, as may best suit your convenience.
I am, most respectfully, yours, &c.,
J. S. BLACK.

(Received A. Gr. O., January 24.)
Hon. J. Holt, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters, dated the 10th and 19th [16th] instants, and to assure you that I am highly gratified at the unqualified approbation they contain of the course I felt it my duty (under Divine guidance, I trust) to pursue in the unexpectedly perplexing circumstances by which we were surrounded. I shall inclose herewith copies of my correspondence with the officials of this State, and also a copy of the Mercury, which contains an article in reference to supplies for my command.* You will understand at once the reasons for my course, which I hope will meet your approval. So many acts of harshness and of incivility have occurred since my removal from Fort Moultrie, which I have not deemed proper to notice or report, that I cannot accept of any civility which may be considered as a favor or an act of charity. I hope that the Department will approve of my sending (if the governor will permit it).our women and children to New York. They will be in the way here if we should, unfortunately, be engaged in hostilities, and they would embarrass me should I deem it proper to make any sudden move. We are trying daily to strengthen our position. We have now fifty-one guns in position, viz: In barbette, four 42-pounders, three 32-pounders, six 24?s, six 8-inch columbiads, and five 8-inch sea-coast howitzers (24) ; in casemate, twenty-two 32-pounders and two 42-pounders, (24) 5 and to guard the gateway, which has been nearly closed by a heavy stone wall, three 8-inch sea-coast howitzers; and we are now preparing platforms in the parade for the three 10-inch columbiads, which we are unable to raise to their proper positions. I shall have some of the lower embrasures, in which guns are mounted, closed. This will make our little command more secure. From the perfect isolation of our position here it is impossible for us to ascertain, with any degree of certainty, the character or extent of the preparations which are being made around us. Everything, however, shows that they are exerting all their energies to prevent the entrance of re-enforcements, and to prepare for attacking this work. Saturday night and yesterday (Sunday) they were very actively engaged at work on a battery (commenced Saturday morning) a few hundred yards south of a battery of three guns constructed within the last three weeks in front of Fort Johnson barracks. On Cummings Point, Morris Island, quite an extensive battery or batteries have been constructed within the last week. We think that there may be both mortars and heavy guns at this point. We see them moving heavy timbers, which may be intended for the construction of a bomb-proof. Judging from the great quantity of material which has been landed in that neighborhood, I think it probable that they may have strengthened the battery which fired on the Star of the West. The channel she came in has been closed, pretty effectually I imagine, by four sunken vessels. Sand hills on Morris Island afford such safe positions for batteries that I fear we shall have to waste a great deal of ammunition before we can succeed in dislodging them from its batteries. Several distant shots have been heard from the direction the mouth of Stono Creek. I presume they have closed that by a heavy battery. It is reported that there is a battery guarding the entrance of the Maffitt Channel, and also that there is a battery of heavy guns on Sullivan’s Island (masked from our view by the houses) about three hundred yards to the west of the fort. Fort Moultrie has been

greatly strengthened during the last two weeks. Traverses have been erected along the the sea front, and merlons, formed of sand bags and earth, constructed between the guns. These merlons, apparently well built, will afford very good protection for the carriages and men, and defilade the parade and greater portion of the quarters from our direct fire. It seems that they have repaired these carriages, and that all the guns are now in position on the sea front. I am, of course, unable to state with any accuracy the character of the armament of their batteries or the number of men they have under arms; we hear that the garrison on Sullivan’s Island, at Fort Johnson, Castle Pinckney (the parapet of which is strengthened by sand bags), and on Morris Island amount to about two thousand men. In reference to my communications with the Department, you must bear it in mind that that matter is entirely under the control of the governor of this State, who may, whenever he deems fit, entirely prohibit my forwarding any letters, or prevent my sending any messenger, to my Government. I shall, however, as long as I can do so, send daily a brief note to the Department, the reception of which will show that the channel is still t)pen, and the failure will indicate that our communication has been cut oft*.

Fort Moultrie.—Until within eight days the work upon this fort, which was executed by several hundred negroes, was confined to the erection of three large traverses on the east half of the sea front, and the enlargement of another that I built upon the same face near the south angle. These traverses were of a size sufficient to contain a temporary bomb-proof shelter, and really served only to screen from our enfilading fire only three guns on the face, and also to cover the south half of the officers’ quarters. The three columbiads at the south angle were not covered. But recently the work of preparation to screen themselves from the fire of Fort Sumter has taken a better turn, and the work done is really important. It consists of high and solid merlons, formed of timber, sand bags, and earth, raised between all the guns that can be brought to bear on this fort, from the west side of their fort, and in placing traverses or merlons so as to screen from enfilading fire all the guns upon the sea front which are arranged to fire upon the channel. The cheeks of the embrasures are of timber, apparently set on end, like palisades, which I think is objectionable; and I also notice that the exterior slope of the merlons is too great to resist the pressure of the earth, and that the sand bags are pressed out in one or two places. These errors are small, however, compared with the great advantage of these merlons, which from their height (about five feet) completely cover the quarters and barracks as high up as the eaves. The following sketch shows pretty nearly the present arrangement of the fronts that I can see:

Of these, four are 8-inch columbiads, five are 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, eight are 42-pounders, and eight are 32-pounders. I have overhauled and fixed each carriage so that it works easily, and made maneuvering implements, of which there were none here at first. Besides the above, a 10-inch columbiad is now being bedded by Lieutenant Snyder as a mortar, to throw shells into Fort Moultrie and upon Sullivan7s Island.
Battery on the upper or east end of the isl'and.-^(Jt this nothing definite is known, as it is out of sight, and also, I fear, shielded from our fire by intervening sand hills. Its object is to secure the east point of the island, and also have a fire upon the Maffitt Channel.
Battery on Sullivan’s Island west of Fort Moultrie.—This is situated about 300 yards to the west of the fort, and is built across a cross-street at a. (See sketch.) It is said to contain five guns, but being masked by old buildings and fences in front of it, I cannot tell whether or not it is so. It is intended to fire on Fort Sumter.
Castle Pinclmey remains apparently as it was when taken, with the exception of sand bags, which are placed around the parapet apparently for the imrpose of protecting the heads of their sharpshooters. It is reported that some of the guns have been taken from the Castle to arm the new earth batteries on Morris Island and other places.
Battery at Fort Johnson.—This is a small earthen battery for three guns in embrasure, intended to fire on the channel. It is situated next to the old barracks, as shown in rough sketch in the margin. I judge of the calibers of the guns by their reports in firing for practice.
Second battery near Fort Johnson.—This is now in the process of construction. It appears to be for mortars, as no embrasures are made. It is of sufficient size for three guns or mortars.
Morris Island Battery.—This is the one that fired on the Star of the West. It is about 2,400 or 2,500 yards from us, and concealed from view by intervening sand hills. It is a gun battery, and did contain two guns at first. Now I am confident that it contains at least four guns.
The troops for the service of the batteries are quartered in the buildings constituting the sm all-pox hospital, over one of which their flag is flying, a red field with white palmetto tree upon it. The flag on Fort Johnson is similar, as is also the one on Castle Pinckney. That on Fort Moultrie is a white field with a green palmetto tree, and a red star in the corner.
Battery on Cummings Point.—This is apparently for mortars, and is of sufficient extent to contain six or eight. A large force of negroes has been at work upon it during the last week. A large quantity of timber has been hauled into it, apparently for shell-proof shelters as well as platforms ,* most of the timber was too large for platforms. This battery seems to be for mortars, as no embrasures are yet made. It is within good range of our heavy guns, of which four 8-inch columbiads, three 42-pounders, one 8-inch sea-coast howitzer, and six 24-pounders on the barbette tier bear upon it; besides, two 32-pounders in the lower tier can fire upon it. This will give a powerful fire. Still, they are apparently providing for it. I have no positive knowledge of the proposed armament of this battery, but I have heard twice from persons who would be apt to know that three mortars are already in it. These are probably the two trophy mortars from the arsenal and the 10-inch mortar from Fort Moultrie.
I have heard heavy firing several times, as though for practice, in the

direction of the Stono River, and I presume a small battery has been erected there to guard that approach to the city.
Of the garrison of Castle PincJcney I cannot judge very well. Of that for Fort Moultrie and the other batteries on Sullivan’s Island I should judge the number to be about 800. On Morris Island about 500. At Fort Johnson about 100, which will probably be increased with the completion of the second battery to 200.
The temper of the authorities seems to have changed for the better since Mr. Hayne and Mr. Gourdin have been in Washington. The proposition to supply fresh meat and vegetables was made by Governor Pick-enson the 19th, but declined by Major Anderson on the following day. A supply of fresh meat and vegetables that had been sent down yesterday by the South Carolina quartermaster-general was returned. In the letter declining the proffered supply Major Anderson requested Governor Pickens to allow the camp women and children to go to New York in the next steamer, and to allow a lighter to come down to take them and their effects to the steamer as she passes. No answer has yet been received to this request. The temper of the common people is not, however, so easily changed from the high pitch of excitement to which it has been wrought to a suddenly conciliatory course, the reasons for which they do not perceive.
Our hopes for a pacific solution of the present difficulties are very much increased since Lieutenant Talbot’s return.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. G. FOSTER,
Captain, Engineers.

War Department, Washington, January 22, 1861.
Hon. Benjamin Fitzpatrick,
Hon. S. B. Mallory, Hon. John Slidell :
Gentlemen : The President lias received your communication of the 19th instant,# with the copy of a correspondence between yourselves and others, u representing States which have already seceded from the United States, or will have done so before 1st of February next,” and Col. Isaac W. Hayne, of South Carolina, in behalf of the government of that State, in relation to Fort Sumter, and you ask the President u to take into consideration the subject of the correspondence.” With this request he has complied, and has directed me to communicate his answer.
In your letter to Colonel Hayne of the 15th instant, * you propose to him to defer the delivery of a message from the governor of South Carolina to the President, with which he has been intrusted, for a few days, until the President and Colonel Hayne shall have considered the suggestions which you submit. It is unnecessary to refer specially to these suggestions, because the letter addressed to you by Colonel Hayne, of the 17th instant, presents a clear and specific answer to them. In this he says: u I am not clothed with power to make the arrangement you suggest, but provided you can get assurances with which you are entirely satisfied that no re-enforcements will be sent to Fort Sumter in the interval, and that the public peace will not be disturbed by any act of hostility toward South Carolina, I will refer your communication to the authorities of South Carolina, and withholding the communication with which I am at present charged, will await further instructions.”
From the beginning of the present unhappy troubles, the President has endeavored to perform his executive duties in such a manner as to preserve the peace of the country and prevent bloodshed. This is still his fixed purpose. You, therefore, do him no more than justice in stating that you have assurances (from his public messages, I presume) that, “ notwithstanding the circumstances under which Major Anderson left Fort Moultrie and entered Fort Sumter with the forces under his command, it was not taken, and is not held, with any hostile or unfriendly purpose towards your State, but merely as property of the United States, which the President deems it his duty to protect and preserve.” You have correctly stated what the President deems to be his duty. His sole object now is, and has been, to act .strictly on the defensive, and to authorize no movement against the people of South Carolina unless clearly justified by a hostile movement on their part. He could not have given a better proof of his desire to prevent the effusion of blood than by forbearing to resort to the use of force under the strong provocation of an attack (happily without a fatal result) on an unarmed vessel bearing the flag of the United States.
I am happy to observe that in your letter to Colonel Hayne you express the opinion that it is u especially due from South Carolina to our States, to say nothing of other slaveholding States, that she should, as far as she can consistently with her honor, avoid initiating hostilities between her and the United States, or any other power.” To initiate such hostilities against Fort Sumter would, beyond question, be an act of war against the United States.
In regard to the proposition of Colonel Hayne, u that no re-enforcements will be sent to Fort Sumter in the interval, and that the public

peace will not be disturbed by any act of hostility towards South Carolina,” it is impossible for me to give you any such assurances. The President has no authority to enter into such an agreement or understanding. As an executive officer he is simply bound to protect the public property so far as this may be practicable, and it would be a manifest violation of his duty to place himself under engagements that he would not perform this duty either for an indefinite or a limited period. At the present moment it is not deemed necessary to re-enforce Major Anderson, because he makes no such request, and feels quite secure in his position. Should his safety, however, require re-enforcements, every effort will be made to supply them.
In regard to an assurance from the President u that the public peace will not be disturbed by any act of hostility toward South Carolina,” the answer will readily occur to yourselves. To Congress, and to Congress alone, belongs the power to make war, and it would be an act of usurpation for the Executive to give any assurance that Congress would not exercise this power, however strongly he may be convinced that no such intention exists.
I am glad to be assured from the letter of Colonel Hayne that “ Major Anderson and his command do now obtain all necessary supplies, including fresh meat and vegetables, and, I believe, fuel and water, from the city of Charleston, and do now enjoy communication by post and special messenger with the President, and will continue to do so, certainly until the door to negotiation has been closed.” I trust that these facilities may still be afforded to Major Anderson. This is as it should be. Major Anderson is not menacing Charleston, and I am convinced that the happiest result which can be attained is that both he and the authorities of South Carolina shall remain on their present amicable footing, neither party being bound by any obligation whatever, except the high Christian and moral duty to keep the peace, and to avoid all causes of mutual irritation.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. HOLT,
Secretary of War.

Colonel: I have the honor to send herewith a copy of the reply of the Hon. D. F. Jamison to my letter to him about supplies for this garrison and the removal of our women and children, and also a copy of my acknowledgment of the same. I am highly gratified at the courtesy and proper tone of this reply.
The storm which was raging yesterday has continued with unabated severity up to the present moment, and has put a stop to all outdoor work, both with the South Carolinians and ourselves. It is now raining and blowing so heavily and the bay is so rough that I shall not venture to send our boat to Fort Johnson for the mail. Should the storm abate so that I can send our letters off in time for the evening mail I shall send them over. I see by the Coast Survey map that Maffitt/s and the Swash Channel are not the same. I was led into that mistake by an old pilot, who told me that Maffitt’s Channel was formerly called the Swash. I will thank you to be pleased, therefore, to erase the words u Swash or* in my letter to the honorable Secretary of War dated the 21st instant, and also to change the word “enfilade” into “ defilade,” where in the same letter I am describing the work which has been recently executed at Fort Moultrie/*

Maj. Robert Anderson:
Sir . In offering to permit you to purchase in this city, through the instrumentality of an officer of the State, such fresh supplies of provisions as you might need, his excellency the governor was influenced solely by considerations of courtesy y and if he had no other motive for refusing to any of your garrison free access to the city to procure such supplies, he would have been moved by prudential reasons for the safety of your people, in preventing a collision between them and our own citizens. As to the manner of procuring your supplies, his excellency is indifferent whether it is done by the officer referred to, or whether your market supplies are delivered to you at Fort Johnson by the butcher whom you say you have before employed. It is only insisted on that the supplies, if sent, shall be carried over in a boat under an officer of the State w ho takes to Fort Johnson your daily mails. His excellency desires me to say that he willingly accedes to your request as to the women and children in Fort Sumter, and that he will afford every facility in his power to enable you to remove them from the fort at any time and in any manner that will be most agreeable to them.
I am, sir, respectfully, yours,

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 21st instant, and to express my gratification at its tenor. I shall direct my staff officer to write to the contractor in reference to his supplying us with beef, and will communicate with you as soon as the necessary preliminaries are arranged, in order that you may then, if you please, give the requisite instructions for carrying them into effect. Be pleased to express to his excellency the governor my thanks for the kind and prompt manner in which he gave his consent to the proposed transfer of the women and children of this garrison. As there are on Sullivan’s Island the families of two of our non-commissioned officers, with their furniture, &c., and also a quantity of private property (including some musical instruments—not public property) belonging to this command, which the first commander of Fort Moultrie, Colonel He Saussure, sent me word he had collected and placed under lock and key, it will be necessary to permit the two non-commissioned officers to go to the island to assist in moving their families, &c. The lighter, it occurs to me, which will be needed to take the families to the steamer, had better go to the island for the property there before coming for the women and children here. As we are all very desirous of guarding against causing any unnecessary excitement, it will afford me great pleasure to have everything done in the most quiet way possible. I shall, consequently, cheerfully govern myself, as far as possible, by the views and wishes of his excellency in reference to this matter, and will be pleased to hear from you what they are. It is my wish, if the weather prove favorable, to ship the families in the Saturday steamer, or the first one after that day.

She is in the Maffitt’s Channel, nearly in front of the Moultrie House; and as she went on when the tide was well up, there is a chance of her remaining where she is for some time. If the authorities here are in earnest about being willing to grant me marketing facilities, it seems to me they will not object to the Government sending us provisions, groceries, and coal from New York. We can get along pretty well with what we have, but some additions to our supplies would add greatly to our comfort. By burning the old buildings, and, if very hard pushed, the spare gun carriages, &c., we can keep up our necessary fires for three months.

Colonel : I have the honor to state, in reply to your letter of the 24th instant, that our letters, &c., are sent by boat, daily, at 12 in., to Fort Johnson in a sealed package, addressed to the postmaster in Charleston, and that the return boat brings our mail in a package bearing the post-office seal.

The governor told Lieutenant Talbot, when he saw him on his return from Washington, that I might, if I chose, send up to the city for my mails, but that he thought it would not be judicious for me to do so. I do not apprehend that there would be the slightest danger of any of my men deserting if thus employed, but think they might be insulted or maltreated. The report to which you refer, about the attempt of the men who were sent to the city to attend a murder trial to desert, is absolutely and entirely false. Lieutenant Davis (who refused to take them, though offered arms by several persons and urged to accept them) says that the

men conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, and that, although handsomely entertained, they returned perfectly sober. I have not deemed it advisable to notice in any way the false reports which have originated in Charleston and elsewhere about us. I send herewith a slip containing two such reports. Lieutenant Meade states, and I have no doubt with entire truthfulness, that he made no statement whilst absent to any person about my preferences or my opinions, either military or political, and that the inferences given in the article in the Petersburg paper were not deducible from any facts stated by him. The other article, in the Baltimore paper, stating that a boat containing three of my men was fired into from Sullivan’s Island, is also entirely untrue. I cannot see the object to be attained by the circulation of such untruths. * The object of one, which has been repeated more than once, that we are getting fresh provisions from the Charleston market, is apparent enough, viz, to show they are treating us courteously. But even that is not a fact. I send herewith a copy of a letter written to our former beef contractor about furnishing us with meat, <&c., to which no reply has yet been received—why, I am unable to ascertain 5 so that, up to this moment, we have not derived the least advantage from the Charleston markets; and I can confidently say that none of my command desire to receive anything from the city for which we are not to pay. Under the daily expectation of the return of Lieutenant Ball, I have deferred sending in a memorandum of the commissary stores on hand. There are now here 38 barrels pork, 37 barrels flour, 13 barrels hard bread, 2 barrels beans, 1 barrel coffee, £ barrel sugar, 3 barrels vinegar, 10 pounds candles, 40 pounds soap, and f barrel salt. You will see from this that for my present command (especially after the departure of our women and children) we shall have an ample supply of pork and bread. It is a pity that my instructions had not been complied with, which would have given us the small stores which are now deficient, and which we shall not object to receiving as soon as the safety of our country will admit of our getting them. Nothing of importance to report. The Columbia is still aground in the Maffitt’s Channel.

THE LATEST FROM THE SOUTH.
FROM SOUTH CAROLINA—A BOAT FROM FORT SUMTER FIRED AT BY THE SOUTH CAROLINIANS—HON. JEFF. DAVIS SPOKEN OF FOR PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.
Charleston, January 23.—The battery on the beach at Sullivan’s Island fired into a boat from Fort Sumter on Monday. There were three men in it, who approached the beach with muffled oars. The sentry at the battery hailed them and warned them off. Failing to obey the summons, the sentry fired musketry into the boat, when it turned round and went away. Soon after those at the battery heard a noise like the hauling up of a boat at Fort Sumter. One of the men in the boat is said to have been wounded badly. Their object is supposed to have been desertion, but some say it was a desperate effort to run^he gauntlet of the sentries and spike the guns of the battery.
[The Daily Express, Petersburg, Va., Tuesday morning, January 22, 1861.]
COMING TO THE POINT—A PRACTICAL MOVEMENT.
The position of Major Anderson.—Lieut. R. K. Meade, of the Engineer Corps, at Fort Sumter, has been in our city, on a visit home, for several days past. Several gentlemen with whom he has conversed inform us that he speaks in the highest terms of Major Anderson, not only as a brave and fearless soldier, but as a strong and true Southern man, his position in the present state of affairs, however, rendering it impossible for him to take any other position before the people of the South and of the Union. He does' not feel in the slightest complimented by the fanatical cannon firing in his honor at the North, and it is with pain, not fear nor even embarrassment, that he realizes the present attitude of the South towards him. That he loves the South, that he prefers it, every social tie gives ample testimony. He is bound by the holy ties of wedlock to one of the fairest of the fair of Georgia, a daughter of General Clinch. He has four devoted brothers, every one of whom, it is said, is a strong secessionist. Add to this that he is a Southerner by birth, and a descendant of Revolutionary sires, we need hardly more to give us assurance that he not only loves his native South, but will at the proper time, and in an honorable manner, draw the sword in her defense. These are simple inferences from facts as known. Not a syllable has fallen from the lips of Lieutenant Meade to lead to the remotest deduction that Major Anderson will not perform his whole duty to the Government of theUuited States. But that he will be hand in hand with the South as soon as he may be, with honor, relieved from his positioD, we have little to doubt.
Major Anderson.—“A Comrade” writes to the Columbus (Ga.) Enquirer concerning the late removal of Major Anderson to Fort Sumter, and in defense of his action and character. The conclusion is: “Major Anderson is a Southern man—born and raised in the noble old ‘ Dark and Bloody Ground.’- He will be found on the side of the South when this government is dismembered, and, when his critical position has been properly understood, his name will be fully exonerated from the grave charges ■which have been made against it by those who have been deplorably misinformed upon all the points of military honor which have governed this truly gallant and meritorious officer.”

General : I have the honor to report that since the date of my last letter very little has been done by the troops of South Carolina around us, in consequence of the continued storm of rain and wind that has prevailed. The little that has been done comprises the completion of the mortar battery, situated to the southeast of Fort Johnson, on James Island, and the enlargement of the battery on Cummings Point by

extending it towards tlie east. It now occupies the position shown in red in the marginal sketch.* The position of the other battery on Morris Island is also shown in red. This is called by the Charlestonians u Fort Morris/7 and I will so designate it in future.
The two or three guard-boats that the authorities have in use are constantly employed in watching the bar, and evidently have signals by which they can communicate intelligence at night as well as in the day. On the morning of the 25th the steamer Columbia, Captain Berry (who was the first to hoist the palmetto flag on board his vessel), in leaving the harbor by the Maffitt Channel, ran on shore between the Moultrie House and Bowman’s Jetty, on Sullivan’s Island. Despite all efforts to get her off* at each high tide (and we have had several very high ones since), she still lies in the same position. The probability is that she will go to pieces if it should happen to blow hard from the south or eastward. The cause of this casualty is undoubtedly found in the fact that the taking up of the outer end of Bowman’s Jetty has caused a deposition below it, which has diminished the depth of water, so that a vessel has now to follow a winding course very much like the red [broken] line in the marginal sketch. The difficulty of navigating
-<
the sharp turn opposite where the Columbia now lies is very much increased by the opposite effects of flood and ebb tide, the latter tending to set the vessel on shore.
Going out in the haze of the morning, the Columbia probably failed to observe the turn of tide, and could not turn quickly enough, with a full head of steam, to clear the beach. Another of the steamers of the same line came in through the main ship channel last evening, being piloted in by one of the guard-boats.
In Fort Sumter everything goes on quite smoothly. I have done little during the past week, on account of the storm, besides policing, removing materials, and strengthening the filling of the openings for the embrasures of the second tier. One 10-inch columbiad has also been put in position on the parade to throw shells into Fort Moultrie, and surrounded by a strong traverse to avoid all danger from a possible bursting of the piece. Although all of the cement and bricks are used up, and the extreme scarcity of fuel does not permit the burning of shells for lime, I can manage with dry stone to strengthen all parts that require

it. I do not propose to discharge my force of forty-three men at present, but to employ them at such work as from time to time becomes necessary. All of them will be of great service in case we have to sustain a cannonade, and the majority of them will also be of material aid in resisting a sudden attack. There is not a particle of truth in the many reports that have crept into the papers about mutinies, &c. The soldiers are in excellent spirits and full of confidence. Those of my men that I have discharged of late have left with great reluctance. In fine, the morale at present is very high.
The trouble that I had with my men soon after the command came over, which resulted in a rapid thinning out of the force, has long since ceased. Every man, however, that is discharged is beset as soon as he reaches town for information, and in some instances they have played upon the credulity of their questioners. In other instances, the information given has been magnified and. distorted. And in one case, that of Lieutenant Davis, who went to town on the 19th in charge of four soldiers summoned as witnesses in a murder trial, an effort was made to convince him that his men, having been tampered with, had uttered threats against him, and that he should arm himself before trusting himself to come down with them alone in a boat. Lieutenant Davis declined their proffer of arms. It appears that there was no circumstance to warrant this attempt to place Lieutenant Davis in a false position towards his men, and to give cause for reports prejudicial to the fidelity of the soldiers. The report in the papers that the men attempted to jump out of the window to escape, is utterly without foundation. So, also, is the report that a boat from Fort Sumter, in attempting to reconnoiter the battery on Morris Island, had been fired into by the sentry, and one man wounded. No boat has ever left Fort Sumter for such a purpose, and I question whether it was a boat that the sentry fired at. In fact, it is not safe to credit any reports coming from this region, except such as are favorable to the Government of the United States. Even the statements that emanated from high authority and were widely circulated, to the effect that this command was supplied with fresh provisions, &c., are not strictly true, for we have not as yet received any.
One lot was sent down on the 20th by the State authorities, which Major Anderson declined to receive. His proposition to get them from the regular contractor, and to pay for them, was accepted; but up to this time (10 a. in. of the 27th) we have not received anything from the contractor in town.
Lieutenant Meade returned on Wednesday, the 23d, but on account of the storm was not able to get to the fort before the following day. Both he and Lieutenant Snyder having volunteered for the duty, I have entered them upon the regular roster for guard duty, two of the officers of the command being sick, and one absent. It does not interfere with our regular duties.

Colonel : The South Carolinians are at work in large force on Cummings Point, apparently framing heavy timbers, for what purpose I am unable yet to state. They succeeded this morning, favored by a very high tide, in getting the Columbia off. I send herewith two slips cut from yesterday’s Mercury, which show unmistakably the animus of these people. They are determined to bring on a collision with the General Government. Everything around us shows this to be their determination and their aim. I had a contract made yesterday for the transportation of the women attached to this command. The number is much greater than the legal allowance, but under the present excited state of feeling toward our command.it would not do to send to the city or to Sullivan’s Island any of the relatives of our soldiers’ wives who have been living with them. The number who will be sent (twenty) embraces those attached to the companies and the wives of the members of the band, and also the wives of the non-commissioned staff. Inclosed you will also receive the muster and pay rolls of this command, which have been signed by the husbands of the women. I will thank you to have them sent by the Pay Department to the paymaster in New York, with instructions to hand the pay to the women. I will thank you also to have the necessary instructions sent to New York for the rations, &c., for these women and children.

Obituary.—Died, on Saturday night, at the Marine Hospital, Thaddeus S. Straw-inski, aged 18 years and 7 days, from an accidental wound from a revolver. This promising young man was on duty in the Columbia Artillery at Fort Moultrie when the sad accident occurred. He was a noble fellow, and, just a week after entering the freshman class of the South Carolina College, with his spirited father joined the ranks at the call of the State. While on the litter being carried to the hospital he said to those who were conveying him : u Friends, O, how sorry I am you are to attack Foil; Sumter without me!” During his sufferings he mourned that he could not he at the

Mr. Yeadon, from the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on that clause of the appropriation bill which appropriates $30,000 lor dredging Maffitt’s Channel, submitted a report recommending the adoption of the following : “ For deepening or otherwise improving Maffitt’s Channel, $30,000, to be drawn by and expended under the direction of a commission, as follows: Messrs. George A. Trenholm, Henry Gourdin, George N. Reynolds, W. G. De Saussure, F. I. Porcher, Hugh E. Vincent, and the mayor of Charleston ex officio: Provided, The work shall not be resumed until Fort Sumter passes into the possession of the authorities of the State, and all the troops of the United States shall be removed from the harbor of Charleston.”
The report was agreed to.
Mr. Buist offered the following resolution:
“ Resolved, That it is the opinion of the general assembly that no sessions of the courts of law or equity in this State should be holden so long as the Government at Washington has control of the fortress known as Fort Sumter.”
Ten members objecting, the resolution was ordered for consideration on Monday.

The lookout ship outside the bar displayed a light, about half past 11, which was answered by rockets by the guard-boats, of which we noticed four on duty, and soon after two guns were tired from the battery on Morris Island, and at half past 1 o’clock this morning two guns were fired from Fort Moultrie. We could not see any vessels in the offing, but they might have been visible to those on the guard-boats (steamers). I do hope that no attempt will be made by our friends to throw supplies in; their doing so would do more harm than good. The steamboat company did not send down for our women and children yesterday as they promised; why, I do not know.

General : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, informing me that $15,000 was placed to my credit with the assistant treasurer of the United States at New York. This relieves me from my present embarrassment. I shall, however, require $5,000 more for Fort Sumter by the end of the month of February.
The operations of the South Carolinians around us continue to be carried on with activity by means of a large force of negroes. The battery on Cummings Point, mentioned in my last letters, is being enlarged into a field work, the parapet of which is not sufficiently formed to distinguish the trace with accuracy. To the west of this field work they have commenced what appears to be a redoubt. This is quite near the western point of Cummings Point.
Steamers are quite active, especially at night, in delivering materials at this point. A very large quantity of timber has been delivered, in rafts, and used for revetments, platforms, and, apparently, bomb-proof shelters.
On Sullivan’s Island I have learned that the battery in the cross street opposite Dr. RaveneFs house, also opposite where the chaplain, Rev. Mr. Harris (now at Fort Washington), lived, is for mortars, apparently, as no embrasures are formed, but that neither guns or mortars are, as yet, placed in it. The batteries on the island above Fort Moultrie are

two in number. The first is only a short distance above the Moultrie House, and about 1,460 yards above Fort Moultrie. It is armed with three guns, either 24-pounders or 32 pounders. It is not in sight of this fort, being in range of and beyond the Moultrie House. Its position is opposite that portion of the Maffitt Channel which comes closest to the island.
* The second battery is at the upper or east end of the island, and is armed with two guns, 24 or 32 pounders.
The last information from the island gave the number of men there as 1,450. But of these a very large number are raw recruits for the regular regiment that they are forming.
In this fort we are hard at work perfecting the arrangements for defense and offense, and creating new ones. Three 10-inch columbiads and four 8-inch columbiads (for which there are no carriages) are arranged as mortars.
The women and children are to leave for New York to-morrow by steamer.
The authorities have promised to send over my private effects from Sullivan’s Island, but have declined to allow me, or anyone sent by me, to go over to collect them and pack them.

From the energy with which their operations are carried on it is evident that they regard them as very necessary, and that they consider that they are also important, and that they shall be pushed as rapidly as possible.

Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel: The character of the work on the end of Cummings Point nearest to us is, I think, now pretty well established. It seems to be a bomb-proof, with embrasures for the guns, the embrasures cut in a sloped wall, formed of heavy timbers, which is now being covered with railroad bars. This battery, though too far off for doing much damage to our walls, unless they have or get heavy rifled guns, will be pretty safe from the effect of our horizontal fires. They appear to be at work to-day connecting this battery with one between it and the battery which fired on the Star of the West, by means of a covered way. Their engineering appears to be well devised and well executed, and their works, even in their present condition, will make it impossible for any hostile force, other than a large and well-appointed one, to enter this harbor, and the chances are that it will then be at a great sacrifice of life. Our 10-inch columbiads are now in position. One points towards the city, one towards Fort Moultrie, and the third can be directed either towards Fort Moultrie or Morris Island. They are at an angle of from 30° to 35°. I tried a shell, a few evenings ago, and we calculated that from a charge of two pounds we got a range of about two thousand yards. I have also four 8-inch sea-coast howitzers planted in the area at an angle of 39°. These bear upon Morris Island. I am now removing the pieces of flagging from the area of our work, as I want it clear, hoping that should any shells fall in it they will probably sink so deep that they will not do much, if any, damage. Captain Foster is engaged in experimenting with one of the iron shutters, trying to see whether we can use them in the lower embrasures. It is very desirable that these embrasures shall be made as secure as possible.
I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer U. S. A., Washington, D. C. :
General : The sketch upon the margin below gives a pretty cor-
rect idea of the position of the works on Cummings Point, thrown up by the South Carolinians. Of course it is subject to errors, arising from the distance at which I am obliged to obtain the information by means of the spy-glass alone.
The lines of the work are not yet complete, the main efforts having been directed to getting ready those guns that are intended to fire upon this work. All the guns that I have indicated by a t are (or appear to be) in position and covered by bomb-proof roofs.
Those at a a are covered by heavy timbers, laid horizontally upon firm timber supports, similar to.the marginal sketch. The revetment of the cheeks of the embrasures appear to be formed of palmetto iogs, as also the revetment of the interior slope near the guns. The horizontal timbers are large 11-inch raft sticks, covered apparently by a lighter timber, or planking, running at right angles to the timbers. The guns at a a were being put upon their carriages (which I suspect, from their using a gin in the operation, are some of the barbette car-

riages from Castle Pinckney or Fort Moultrie) at the time I wrote to you this morning. Subsequently the rough opening of the embrasures was made and the revetment of the cheeks commenced.
The second bomb proof battery is built differently. The timbers on top are sloped at an angle of 45°, about as in the sketch. They rest
upon two horizontal supports parallel to the direction of the battery, one higher than the other, and these are supported by stout posts, about 5 feet from each other. Upon the timbers are placed at right angles a stout planking, and upon this again another covering running up and down. This last consists of railroad iron, apparently the T rail. The work has only progressed thus far, although there is no doubt that the whole is to be covered with sand. The guns are mounted and the openings for embrasures formed.
The work is carried on quite rapidly, considering the heavy nature of the work. The idea of covering the bomb-proof with iron and giving it an inclination is no doubt derived from the Sardinian method for forming the sides of a man-of-war, so as to deflect the shot.
A large force of negroes is employed in extending the embankment of the parapet so as to connect this battery with the field work.
The guard-boats are very active at night, and some are always on the watch by day.
Inside this fort the work of preparation goes steadily on. My force is now employed in clearing the parade of the stone flagging. I am also having all the material on hand made into sand bags.

OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.
[Chap. I.
War Department, Washington, February 6,1861.
Hon. I. W. Hayne,
Attorney-General of the State of South Carolina:
Sir: The President of the United States has received your letter of the 31st ultimo,* and has charged me with the duty of replying thereto. In the communication addressed to the President by Governor Pickens, under date of the 12th of January,* and which accompanies yours, now before me, his excellency says:
I have determined to send to yon Hon. I. W. Hayne, the attorney-general of the State of South Carolina, and have instructed him to demand the surrender of Fort Sumter, in the harbor of Charleston, to the constituted authorities of the State of South Carolina. The demand I have made of Major Anderson, and which I now make of you, is suggested because of my earnest desire to avoid bloodshed, which a persistence in your attempt to retain the possession of that fort will cause, and which will be unavailing to secure to you that possession, but induce a calamity most deeply to be deplored.
The character of the demand thus authorized to be made appears— under the influence, 1 presume, of the correspondence with the Senators to which you refer—to have been modified by subsequent instructions of his excellency, dated the 26th, and received by yourself on the 30th of January, in which he says:
If it be so that Fort Sumter is held as property, then as property, the rights, whatever they may be, of the United States can be ascertained; and for the satisfaction of these rights the pledge of the State of South Carolina you are authorized to give.
The full scope and precise purport of your instructions, as thus modified, you have expressed in the following words:
I do not come as a military man to demand the surrender of a fortress, but as the legal officer of the State—its attorney-general—to claim for the State the exercise of its undoubted right of eminent domain, and to pledge the State to make good all injury to the rights of property which arise from the exercise of the claim.
And lest this explicit language should not sufficiently define your position, you add:
The proposition now is that her (South Carolina’s) law officer should, under authority of the governor and his council, distinctly pledge the faith of South Carolina to make such compensation in regard to Fort Sumter and its appurtenances and contents, to the full extent of the money value of the property of the United States delivered over to the authorities of South Carolina by your command.
You then adopt his excellency’s train of thought upon the subject so far as to suggest that the possession of Fort Sumter by the United States, u if continued long enough, must lead to collision,” and that u an attack upon it would scarcely improve it as property, whatever the result, and if captured it would no longer be the subject of account.”
The proposal, then, now presented to the President is simply an offer on the part of South Carolina to buy Fort Sumter and contents as property of the United States, sustained by a declaration in effect that if she is not permitted to make the purchase she will seize the fort by force of arms. As the initiation of a negotiation for the transfer of property between friendly governments this proposal impresses the President as having assumed a most unusual form. He has, however, investigated the claim on which it professes to be based, apart from the declaration that accompanies it; and it may be here remarked that much stress has been laid upon the employment of the words 66 property” and “public property” by the President in his several messages. These are the most comprehensive terms which can be used in such a
*Not of record in War Department.

﻿Chap. I.J
CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—UNION.
167
connection, and surely, when referring to a fort or any other public establishment, they embraced the entire and undivided interest of the Government therein.
The title of the United States to Fort Sumter is complete and ineon-testible. Were its interest in this property purely proprietary, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, it might, probably, be subjected to the exercise of the right of eminent domain; but it has also political relations to it, of a much higher and more imposing character than those of mere proprietorship. It has absolute jurisdiction over the fort and the soil on which it stands. This jurisdiction consists^ in the authority to “exercise exclusive legislation” over the property referred to, and is therefore clearly incompatible with the claim of eminent domain now insisted upon by South Carolina. This authority was not derived from any questionable revolutionary source, but from the peaceful cession of South Carolina herself, acting through her legislature, under a provision of the Constitution of the United States. South Carolina can no more assert the right of eminent domain over Fort Sumter than Maryland can assert it over the District of Columbia. The political and proprietary rights of the United States in either case rest upon precisely the same grounds.
The President is, however, relieved from the necessity of further pursuing this inquiry by the fact that, whatever may be the claim of South Carolina to this fort, he has no constitutional power to cede or surrender it. The property of the United States has been acquired by force of public law, and can only be disposed of under the same solemn sanctions. The President, as the head of the executive branch of the Government only, can no more sell and transfer Fort Sumter to South Carolina than he can sell and convey the Capitol of the United States to Maryland, or to any other State or individual seeking to possess it. His excellency the governor is too familar with the Constitution of the United States, and with the limitations upon the powers of the Chief Magistrate of the Government it has established, not to appreciate at once the soundness of this legal proposition.
The question of re-enforcing Fort Sumter is so fully disposed of in my letter to Senator Slidell and others, under date of the 22& of January— a copy of which accompanies this—that its discussion will not now be renewed. I then said: “At the present moment it is not deemed necessary to re-enforce Major Anderson, because he makes no such request* Should his safety, however, require re-enforcements, every effort will be made to supply them.” I can add nothing to the explicitness of this language, which still applies to the existing status. The right to send forward re-enforcements when, in the judgment of the President, the safety of the garrison requires them rests on the same unquestionable foundation as the right to occupy the fortress itself.
In the letter of Senator Davis and others to yourself, under date of the 15th ultimo, they say: “We, therefore, think it especially due from South Carolina to our States, to say nothing of other slaveholding States, that she should, as far as she can consistently with her honor, avoid initiating hostilities between her and the United States or any other power”; and you now yourself give to the President the gratifying assurance that “ South Carolina has every disposition to preserve the public peace ”; and, since he is himself sincerely animated by the same desire, it would seem that this common and patriotic object must be of certain attainment.
It is difficult, however, to reconcile with this assurance the declaration on your part that “it is a consideration of her (South Carolina’s)

## p. 168 (#184) ############################################

﻿168	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
own dignity as a sovereign, and the safety of her people, which prompts her to demand that this property should not longer be used as a military post by a Government she no longer acknowledges,” and the thought you so constantly present, that this occupation must lead to a collision of arms, and the prevalence of civil war.
Fort Sumter is in itself a military post, and nothing else; and it would seem that not so much the fact as the purpose of its use should give to it a hostile or friendly character. This fortress is now held by the Government of the United States for the same objects for which it has been held from the completion of its construction. These are national and defensive, and were a public enemy now to attempt the capture of Charleston, or the destruction of the commerce of its harbor, the whole force of the batteries of this fortress would be at once exerted for their protection. How the presence of a small garrison, actuated by such a spirit as this, can compromise the dignity or honor of South Carolina, or become a source of irritation to her people, the President is at a loss to understand. The attitude of that garrison, as has been often declared, is neither menacing, nor defiant, nor unfriendly. It is acting under orders to stand strictly on the defensive, and the government and people of South Carolina must well know that they can never receive aught but shelter from its guns, unless, in the absence of all' provocation, they should assault it, and seek its destruction. The intent with which this fortress is held by the President is truthfully stated by Senator Davis and others in their letter to yourself of the 15th of January, in which they say, u It is not held with any hostile or unfriendly purpose towards your State, but merely as property of the United States, which the President deems it his duty to protect and preserve.”
If the announcement, so repeatedly made, of the President’s pacific purposes in continuing the occupation of Fort Sumter until the question shall have been settled by competent authority has failed to impress the government of South Carolina, the forbearing conduct of his administration for the last few months should be received as conclusive evidence of his sincerity; and if this forbearance, in view of the circumstances which have so severely tried it, be not accepted as a satisfactory pledge of the peaceful policy of this administration, towards South Carolina, then it may be safely affirmed that neither language nor conduct can possibly furnish one. If, with all the multiplied proofs which exist of the President’s anxiety for peace and of the earnestness with which he has pursued it, the authorities of that State shall assault Fort Sumter and peril the lives of the handful of brave and loyal men shut up within its walls, and thus plunge our common country into the horrors of civil war, then upon them, and those they represent, must rest the responsibility.

Colonel: The guard-boats were rather more on the alert last night than they have been for three or four nights previous. Last night we heard them, the South Carolinians, either at work on or moving pieces of iron. This morning they are at work, apparently either extending the bomb-proof on the seaward side or commencing to form a parapet for guns or a blind on that flank. I observe in the last English papers that a shipment of three rifled cannon has been made from England to Charleston. Such an addition to their battery would make our position much less secure than I have considered it; and if we’are to have a collision, which God forbid, would render it necessary to send on re-enforcements in a few days after the commencement of hostilities.

General : Nothing of marked importance has transpired since the date of my last letter. Your letters of the 2d and 6th are received. The South Carolinians on Cummings Point have been occupied in perfecting the embrasures and merlons for the three guns in the field work that bear most directly upon this fort, in connecting this battery with the bomb-proof iron-covered battery by a curtain, and in completing this latter battery and extending the parapet of its flanks. On Fort Moultrie the merlons between the guns looking in this direction have been still farther raised, made roof-shaped on top, and supported more strongly by horizontal timbers, kept in place by braces extending across the embrasures at the top. I am now mining the wharf, and am also to arrange fougasses at different points on the exterior.
There does not appear to be very great activity among the South Carolinians, although the force is maintained the same.
I hear that five columbiads have arrived in the city from Richmond, and more are expected.
It is reported that the floating battery prepared in the city is a failure^ the draught being greater than was expected.

I am, sir, with sentiments of the highest regard, &c.
ROBERT ANDERSON,
Major, U. 8. Army, Commanding.
Fort Sumter, S. 0., February 13,1861.
General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer U. 8. Army, Washington, JD. C.:
General : I have the honor to report that since the date of my last letter, the 11th, very little, apparently, has been done by the South Carolinians around us. The weather yesterday was quite pleasant, and a relief of some of the troops on Morris Island took place. I saw about 150 land, and was told that about the same number went away. A large number of negro laborers were likewise taken to the city, leaving only a small number at work on the parapet of the field work on Cummings Point.
This work appears to be nearly completed, and ready to open fire. In the iron bomb-proof are three heavy guns, believed to be, and from all reports are, 8-inch columbiads. The three guns farther to the left (our left) are probably 24 or 32 pounders. Those still farther to the left bearing on the channel and crossing their fire with the guns of Fort Moultrie, are of the same caliber. There is at least one gun in this position, and probably two. I cannot see them from the parapet on account of an intervening sand hill, but I saw a gin at work at the position of one of the guns. Fort Morris and the light-house battery have probably been strengthened.
One mortar was landed at Fort Johnson, and, it is reported, placed in the new battery to the south of Fort Johnson. Fort Moultrie has changed very little of late. A new flagstaff was erected a few days since, and the new State flag hoisted thereon. It is not a handsome or pleasant flag to look at, being a dark-blue ground, with a white palmetto and crescent thereon. At a distance it is not unlike a black flag, with the piratical emblem (head and cross-bones) upon it.
In this fort the preparations continue with unabating activity. The open spaces which were left for the second-tier embrasures, and filled in with a brick wall after we entered the fort, were the weakest points to resist battering. 1 have had them re-enforced in various ways, some with a solid wall of stone flagging, others with irons and lumber, and others with earth packed in between two partitions of scantling and boards. This work is not yet completed. The cement and bricks gave out some time since. In a few days, however, I shall have these as secure as necessary.
The next step will be to secure from breaching fire the loopholed windows and piers between them on the gorge. I am preparing to plate the main gate with half-inch iron, to construct fougasses on the gorge and upon each face, and to make more complete arrangements for using shells and grenades over the parapet. Yesterday I completed the mines in the wharf, and the preparations for firing them. I also cut down the brick coping of the parapet on the gorge in front of one of the guns, so as to allow it to be depressed so as to sweep the end of the wharf. Upon trial it answered the expectations, and this morning the embrasure thus formed is being enlarged a little, so as to allow the canister (in bags) to strike nearer and sweep more of the wharf.
The guard-boats were unusually active last night, and rather troublesome, too, for one of them, improving upon their ordinary tricks of run-

ning slowly past the fort at night with lights out, and close in to the fort, suddenly turned and headed directly in towards the fort. When very close our sentinel fired. The boat then sheered off and went out towards the bar. Loud voices and noises, as of riotous conduct, are reported as being heard on board.
If it should happen that supplies are sent to us by the Government, would it not be well to include cement and bricks enough to form some embrasures on the second tier?
I propose, if it meets your wishes, to write every day, if only a line, so that you may know if there is any interruption of the communication.

Colonel: I have the honor to report that we cannot see that any work is being carried on at either of the works in sight, except that at Fort Moultrie they appear to be making some changes. They may, perhaps, be engaged in removing some of the heaviest of the guns of their battery, either to place them in the floating battery or on Morris Island, where their fire would be more effective against this work than it would be from Fort Moultrie. By the by, I should like to be instructed on a question which may present itself in reference to the floating battery, viz: What course would it be proper for me to take if, without a declaration of war, or a notification of hostilities, I should see them approaching my fort with that battery?

The assumption of all questions relating to forts, arsenals, &c., by the Congress of the Southern Confederacy appears to have placed a sudden check upon the military enterprise of the South Carolinians. The only operation performed yesterday was th& firing of three shots from the iron bomb-proof battery on Cummings Point, apparently for the purpose of trying the embrasure shutters. These shutters appear to be of iron, and are arranged like a trap door, with a hinge at the upper edge, so that two men can open it—having, probably, a counterpoise in the interior.

I have had the parapet cut down in front of one of the 24-pounders on the gorge, which, by a slight alteration of the carriage, &c., enables me to get a depression of 18J°, thus commanding, with a charge of canister, the greater portion of the wharf and the right basin.

The operations of the month were steadily increased from the 1st to the 26th. The casemate arches were completed; the bluestone flagging of the first tier inside of the outer traverse circles was laid on the two faces and a part of the right flank; all of the traverse stones of the first tier were reset $ the granite flagging of the second tier on the right face was laid; the construction of the embrasures of the second tier was commenced, and the finishing of the east barrack was also commenced.
On the night of the 26th Major Anderson transferred his command from Fort Moultrie to Fort Sumter, and assumed command of the fort. The Engineer force broke up on the morning of the 28th, and the majority of the men left the fort. The regular work was then stopped, and all the remaining force was at once put at work mounting guns, under charge of Lieutenant Snyder, and otherwise preparing to meet and repulse any attack that the forces of the State might make upon us.
The few remaining days of the monM were thus employed. A considerable quantity of material remaining on hand was of great value in making the preparations, and everything was freely used for this purpose.

General : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a roll of letter paper from the Engineer Office. The work on the hostile batteries on Cummings Point continues slowly.
This morning a flag was raised up on a flagstaff situated nearly in the middle of the north front of the portion of the entrenchments denominated the “field work” in my letter of the 27th January. The body of the flag is red, with a blue union in the upper staff corner, having upon it the palmetto and crescent in white.

The placing of the cheek irons for the embrasures in the recesses of the windows on the gorge, second tier, has been carried as far as the main gate from the southeast angle. The irons are placed as shown in the margin. Stones are placed in the recesses on the first tier. These, although not as good as they might be, will answer for the present, and if broken by a breaching fire can be more easily replaced than they could be if they were on the second tier.

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential letter of the 21st instant, conveying instructions of the General-in-Chief. I have already taken steps towards executing those instructions, by conferring with Captain Ward, of the !Navy, and the quartermaster and commissary of subsistence on duty in this city. I shall see Major Thornton to-morrow. Captain Ward will not be able to take any bales of hay for bedding purposes, and at his suggestion I propose tot send mattresses to Fort Sumter instead, unless objected to by the General-in Chief. Captain Ward will provide the coal and wrood which Lieutenant HalPs memorandum calls for. In relation to clothing, I am unable to make out wiiat the memorandum requires. Instead, therefore, of writing myself to Philadelphia, I beg that the necessary orders may be given from Washington to the clothing officers in Philadelphia to send to Colonel Tompkins here the clothing required by the memorandum, and the garrison flag and cord for lanyards on this same memorandum. I shall see that everything else on the memorandum is provided here, including such groceries as might be for sale to officers, &c. The clothing should be put up in small bales, so that it may be distributed among the vessels. Colonel Tompkins will attend to its proper marking after its arrival here. Please let me know as soon as you give the

General : The work on the third breaching battery on Cummings Point has progressed so that the embrasures, three in number, are being commenced. Some work was also done on Fort Moultrie yesterday and the day before; at least it was commenced the day before. This consists of a parapet of earth in front of the scarp wall of the front that faces us, apparently intended to serve as a glacis, as it rises to the height of the cordon. It is revetted on the side next the scarp wall with barrels, and has a pretty steep slope upon the side towards us.

War Department, February 23,1861.
Maj. Robert Anderson,
First Artillery, Commanding Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor, S. C.:
Sir : It is proper I should state distinctly that you hold Fort Sumter as you held Fort Moultrie, under the verbal orders communicated by Major Buell,* subsequently modified by instructions addressed to you from this Department, under date of the 21st of December, 1860.
In your letter to Adjutant-General Cooper, of the 16th instant, you say:
I should like to he instructed on a question which may present itself in reference to the floating battery, viz : What course would it he proper for me to take if, without a declaration of war or a notification of hostilities, I should see them approaching my fort with that battery ? They may attempt placing it within good distance before a declaration of hostile intention.
It is not easy to answer satisfactorily this important question at this distance from the scene of action. In my letter to you of the 10th of January I said:
You will continue, as heretofore, to act strictly on the defensive, and to avoid, by all means compatible with the safety of your command, a collision with the hostile forces by which you are surrounded.
The policy thus indicated must still govern your conduct.
The President is not disposed at the present moment to change the instructions under which you have been heretofore acting, or to occupy any other than a defensive position. If, however, you are convinced by sufficient evidence that the raft of which you speak is advancing for the purpose of making an assault upon the fort, then you would be justified on the principle of self-defense in not awaiting its actual arrival there, but in repelling force by force on its approach. If, on the other hand, you have reason to believe that it is approaching merely to take up a position at a good distance should the pending question be not amicably settled, then, unless your safety is so clearly endangered as to render resistance an act of necessary self-defense and protection, you will act with that forbearance which lias distinguished you heretofore in permitting the South Carolinians to strengthen Fort Moultrie and erect new batteries for the defense of the harbor. This will be but a redemption of the implied pledge contained in my letter on behalf of the President to Colonel Hayne, in which, when sj^eaking of Fort Sumter, it is said:
The attitude of that garrison, as has been often declared, is neither menacing, nor defiant, nor unfriendly. It is acting under orders to stand strictly on the defensive, and the government and people of South Carolina must know that they can never receive aught but shelter from its guns, unless, in the absence of all provocation, they should assault it and seek its destruction.

A dispatch received in this city a few days since from Governor Pickens, connected with the declaration on the part of those convened at Montgomery, claiming to act on behalf of South Carolina as well as the other seceded States, that the question of the possession of the forts and other public property therein had been taken from the decision of the individual States and would probably be preceded in its settlement by negotiation with the Government of the United States, has impressed the President with a belief that there will be no immediate attack on Fort Sumter, and the hope is indulged that wise and patriotic counsels may prevail and prevent it altogether.
The labors of the Peace Congress have not yet closed, and the. presence of that body here adds another to the powerful motives already existing for the adoption of every measure, except in necessary self-defense, for avoiding a collision with the forces that surround you.

Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Colonel : I have the honor to send herewith some slips from the Charleston Mercury of yesterday. That paper publishes everything that is calculated to bring on a collision. I do not consider the rumor worthy of the least attention, but it accounts for the increased vigor exhibited last night, and continued to-day, in pushing forward their works on Cummings Point and at Fort Moultrie. They were working at the former place until midnight last night, and a large force is busy there now on the parapet (in which openings are formed apparently for four embrasures), and in hauling up timbers from a raft. A large shed has been put up, which may be intended for a bomb-proof storehouse or a magazine. At Fort Moultrie the glacis is being rapidly extended, and it is high enough to cover their wall, as if they expected me to attempt breaching it. They are also at work this morning on the gun battery at Fort Johnson.

FEDERAL RE-ENFORCEMENTS AT HAND.
The special dispatches of the Mercury announcing that a stealthy re-enforcement of Fort Sumter had been determined on, and that Federal troops, in boats, might be expected at any moment that circumstances should happen to favor their attempt to reach the fort, were confirmed about 9 o’clock last night by telegrams received by the governor. Shortly afterwards dispatches came up from Fort Moultrie, stating that the lieutenant in charge of the harbor watch had reported that he was informed by a pilot that the steamship Daniel Webster had been seen by him off Cape Romain at. noon. Notice was immediately given to the different posts. General Dunovant and Captain Hamilton proceeded immediately to Fort Moultrie; Major Stevens repaired to the Morris Island batteries. Everything was got in readiness for the expected visitors.
Up to the hour at which we go to press (half past 4 o’clock) there has been nothing seen either of the Daniel Webster or her boats. We are very sure that the gallant troops on Morris and Sullivan’s Islands will keep a bright lookout for both.

SECOND DISPATCH.
Washington, February 21—6 p. m.
There is the best of reason for believing that Holt designs re-enforcing secretly, by boats, at night. The re-enforcements have already been sent. You may look ont for them at any moment. The programme is also to surround Fort Pickens with ships of war. That post is considered impregnable to the Southern forces. The whole anxiety of Scott and the coercionists centers now in Fort Sumter. There the Cabinet has determined that Lincoln shall find everything ready to his hand.
Fort Sumter.—The Washington correspondents of Northern papers are continually disposing of this formidable post in divers ways. The last bulletin which we notice u settles the fact ” in this summary style:
“I Jiave just read a private letter from a citizen of South Carolina, formerly in Congress from that State, which states that Fort Sumter will be taken, at whatever cost of life, on or before the 4th of March next. The writer is himself to « ake part in the enterprise, and as he is also perfectly well informed in regard to the intentions of the State authorities, it may be considered that this information settles the fact, if there is any doubt of it, that the fort is to be taken, and without reference to what the Montgomery government may advise or order on the subject.”
Fort Sumter, S. C., February 23, 1861.
General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General : I have the honor to report that the work upon the batteries on Cummings Point was continued last night until 12 o’clock. This increased activity seemed to have been consequent upon the visit of some official of rank, probably Governor Pickens, to these batteries in the afternoon. Guns were fired from the batteries and from Fort Moultrie in considerable numbers about the same time that the steamers [arrived] bearing the person or persons who were visiting the batteries, and were either salutes of six and seven guns each or were merely practice firing. The principal work consists of that upon the battery that I reported yesterday as being in process of construction, and upon the erection of sheds of this form—
which you perceive can be turned into bomb-proofs, covering them with earth. One of these, situated at the extreme western point of Cummings Point, is already up, and a sufficient number of rafts were towed there last night to construct two or three more.
At Fort Moultrie a force of about fifty laborers is still at work embanking the glacis in front of the face towards us. Yesterday I completed placing the cheek irons for the embrasures in the recesses of the windows on the gorge, and to-day I shall charge the fougasses on the esplanade at the gorge, and then commence clearing the parade of rubbish. I have also to take down another temporary building to obtain fuel. I have a second one yet standing, that will furnish fuel as long as the provisions will last. The weather is very pleasant and warm.
I received from the Department another roll of writing paper to-day, with two bundles of envelopes, one of large and the other of medium letter size.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

This morning a large force is engaged on the covered way on Cummings Point, and smaller parties on the new battery this side of the bomb-proof battery, and extending the glacis at Fort Moultrie.

three-gun battery in the field work to the east. The high wind of last night blew down the storehouse and quarters that I mentioned yesterday and the day before.
At the mortar battery south of Fort Johnson a party commenced work soon after dinner yesterday (Sunday) and worked until night, throwing up a mass of muck in front of and against the parapet, apparently to protect it from the wash of the surf, and also to increase its thickness.
On Fort Moultrie they are still at work at the glacis. It appears now that it is not so nearly parallel to the face that fronts us as I drew it in my letter two days since, but rather inclines to be parallel with the beach. It is already extended so as to cross “Fort street.” It is evident that this may be used as a shelter for a line of mortars, but I hardly believe it will be so used, as there is already built a battery for mortars lower down the island.
The South Carolinians had only three or four mortars, and I have heard of the arrival of but three since the commencement of hostile preparations.
The health of the command is very good, with no sickness among the officers or men of sufficient importance to take them from a single day’s duty. Major Anderson is and has been well, and there was no foundation for the report of his illness.

position for a line of mortars. The work on the other batteries around us was hardly worthy of note yesterday.
The troops on Fort Moultrie practiced with ball to obtain the ranges of the channel and especially of that point in the main channel where it turns towards the city. The buoy on this side of the channel at this point is five eighths of a mile from us, in a direction a little south of east. The practice was excellent, all the shot striking the water nearly in the same spot; so it will be seen that the ranges are well understood now, and any vessel coming in must not expect to fare as well as the Star of the West.
The second fougasse on the gorge was charged, means for firing arranged, and the stone loaded upon it during the day yesterday.
I am to submit to-day to Major Anderson a written memorandum of the condition of the work and its capabilities to resist a bombardment, together with any additional preparations that I have to suggest. He also requires the same of Lieutenants Snyder and Meade.

They were upon siege carriages.

The work that I spoke of in my last letter as being commenced upon the middle of the curtain, connecting the first breaching battery and the second, has not sufficiently developed itself to be positive in its character, but it appears to be a large magazine and a battery for three or more guns. A considerable force is also at work on that portion of the field work looking towards Fort Moultrie and the channel, but I cannot see what is being done. I have no doubt that it is the construction of one or more embrasures, in addition to the one there before, to fire on the channel. The floating raft intended to be used to breach the walls of this fort was launched yesterday in town. I can see it with my glass. The iron does not appear to have been yet put upon the timber. If I am correct in this, it will require several days to prepare it for action.
Yesterday I was principally employed in demolishing the temporary building for fuel, removing materials, &c., of blacksmith shop to the casemates, clearing the parade, &c.
I have strongly recommended the increasing of the present armament of the gorge (six 24-pounders) at once, by means of the casemate carriages, so altered as to answer for barbette carriages, but the recommendation has not yet been acted on.
I did not write to the Department yesterday morning, having been closely employed until it was too late to do so before the mail closed.

The work then in progress on the batteries on Cummings Point has continued steadily, but without any marked activity; the fourth embrasure in battery No. 3 (breaching) is revetted and the parapet nearly finished; the work on the curtain of 1 and 2 is either a magazine or a bomb-proof of timber to be used as a battery, like battery No. 2. Little of note is observed at Fort Moultrie. The large bag of cotton or wool still remains in each embrasure precisely as it was placed some time ago, which makes me now believe that the guns on that face have really been dismounted to be used in other batteries.

The guns looking toward the channel are covered by high and solid merlons so that they cannot be taken in flank, and are kept in good working order, as is evidenced by their frequent practice. Last evening the South Carolinians practiced from the batteries on Cummings Point, from Fort Moultrie, and from the channel battery above the Moultrie House, on Sullivan’s Island. I cannot obtain with the glass satisfactory observations of what is being done with the floating breach battery or “raft.” I am inclined to think, however, from information, that there is a distrust of its success in the minds of many military men in the city. I think it can be destroyed by our fire before it has time to do much damage.
I received yesterday directions from Major Anderson which I gladly proceeded to execute, to the effect to increase the armament of the barbette tier in the way recommended by all the Engineer officers. I have put Lieutentant Snyder and the whole gang of workmen at this work. We will adapt one casemate carriage to serve for barbette and mount one 42-pounder to-day.
In obedience to requirement all the officers handed in to Major Anderson u confidential” estimates of the force necessary to insure a re-enforcement of this fort, or to relieve it, yesterday morning. These were sent to Washington.* My estimate was as follows: To land and carry the batteries on Cummings Point and Morris Island, 3,000 regulars, or 10,000 volunteers ; to land and carry the batteries on Sullivan’s Island (at the same time), 3,000 regulars, or 10,000 volunteers more; to hold the above positions after taking them, 10,000 regulars, or 30,000 volunteers. The forces to be overcome in the attack are supposed to be those of the South Carolinians, aided by troops that may be gathered from the adjoining States at short notice.
If time be given for concentration of the troops of this section the above estimate will be inadequate.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. G. FOSTER,
Captain of Engineers.
Fort Sumter, S. C., March 2,1801.
[General Totten:]
General : There is very little activity to be observed in the surrounding batteries this morning, although the weather is remarkably fine. The little that is being done is in the field work on Cummings Point, which is being enlarged to the eastward, evidently with a view of covering the whole of this point with the work, having the parapet as near high-water line as practicable, as it now is in that portion of the work towards us. The batteries will then all be included in a continuous line, extending from the point towards the entrance to “Light-house Creek,” around to the seaward. The breaching battery No. 3 is completed, as is also the work on the middle of the curtain of 1 and 2, which is a mortar battery with a magazine.
The cheering news from Washington of the action of the Peace Conference and of the House of Representatives gave us great satisfaction.
One 42-pounder gun was put in position and the carriage put in good order, so that the gun can be used with more effect than the others on the barbette tier. Three 32-pounders are being removed to the gorge,

The work in the third breaching battery yesterday indicated that the platforms for the guns were being laid, and that it was being made ready for its guns; one 24-pounder has stood in front of it for three days. A small working party is still engaged upon the mortar battery on James Island. It is reported from the city that the floating battery does not come up to anticipations, inasmuch as it draws seven feet of water without its armament, and requires a counterpoise on the reverse to counteract the tendency to tip towards the front, owing to the weight of the shield on that side. Yesterday three steamers landed troops and supplies on Cummings Point, and appearances indicated that preparations. were making for immediate action in case the news from Washington exhibited a coercive policy on the part of the administration. It is reported that General Beauregard visited the batteries on Cummings Point yesterday.

General : I have the honor to report that during the day, and especially towards night, unusual activity was observed among thfc South Carolinians around us. Several steamer loads of men were landed ,on Cummings Point. The number was greater than the arrangements for shelter, apparently, for I observe quite a large number grouped about their bivouac fires this morning. Their suffering must have been considerable during the night, for the weather suddenly changed from the warm temperature of the preceding days to a high degree of cold for this climate, the wind blowing fresh from the north.
I learn that portable hot-shot furnaces have been furnished to several, and probably all, of the batteries. The mortar battery on James Island, south of Fort Johnson, is armed, but the number of mortars is not ascertained. The magazine in the flank of this battery is also finished. The mortar battery on Sullivan’s Island, west of Fort Moultrie, is also armed.
All the batteries on Morris Island are armed. The guns range from 32-pounders down, with the exception of the iron bomb-proof, which is (I think, from all reports and observations) armed with 8 inch colum-biads—three of them.
The raft does not meet expectations. It is being covered with railroad strap-iron instead of the T rail. This has a cross-section of about three-fourths or one inch by two inches or two and a half inches. They are now ironing the top portion, the front not being yet commenced. Two 8-inch columbiads are lying on the wharf ready to be put on board. I do not think this floating battery will prove very formidable.
We have not yet received the inaugural address of President Lincoln, although it is reported from town that it is coercive in its character, and that much excitement prevails.

General : The increased activity exhibited in the batteries of the South Carolinians yesterday continues this morning. The work on Morris Island is mostly confined to the strengthening of breach battery Ho. 3. On James Island a considerable force is still engaged in strengthening the mortar battery. Generally speaking, there is more earnestness exhibited now than for several days previous to the 5th instant. The Confederate flag was displayed yesterday from the custom-house. General Beauregard is, it is understood, in command of the forces here under the authority of the Confederation. The reception on Morris Island that we observed on the 4th was that of Governor Pickens and General Beauregard.

Colonel : I have the honor to report that we can see the South Carolinians engaged this morning strengthening and extending considerably what We supposed to have been intended for a mortar battery at Fort Johnson. Small parties are also working at Nos. 9 and 10, and a very heavy force at the bend of the island, this side of No. 1. Whether they are constructing another battery there, or strengthening one that is already there, I cannot tell. One of my officers reports that he has counted nine 24-pounders which have been landed at Cummings Point within a week. Yesterday he saw several shot or shells, which appeared to be about eight inches in diameter. They are certainly busy strengthening the batteries already constructed, and probably adding others.
It appears to me that vessels will even now, from the time they cross the bar, be under fire from the batteries on Morris Island until they get under the walls of this work. I do not speak of the batteries which have been constructed on Sullivan’s Island, as I am not certain of their positions. Fort Moultrie will, of course, be a very formidable enemy.

ticing at drill the fact of one of the guns being shotted was forgotten, and hence the occurrence.
I commence this morning to close the openings of the loopholes on the first tier solidly with stone. In raising the second 10-inch columbiad from the parade to the terre-plein yesterday afternoon the strap of the upper block broke when the gun was nearly up, and it fell, breaking the cross-pieces of the derrick, striking the end of the casemate arch of the first tier, and burying itself one-half its length in the ground. No one was injured, for the first signs of giving way had been observed and every one made to stand clear. The injury to the derrick will be soon repaired and the columbiad again hoisted.
Last night a severe storm of wind and rain arose, which lasted all night, and bids fair to be renewed to-day.
The men in the batteries on Morris Island are actively at work repairing damages to the parapets and in extending the field work around on the channel side of Cummings Point and forming new batteries there. Three or four 21-pounders on siege carriages were landed yesterday. I have before reported that the evident intention was to form a large field work entirely covering the point. Its present extent will require one thousand men to defend it, and the work still continues.
I have omitted to report previously that a guard ship', or bark, is anchored on the main ship bar, apparently as a signal ship; also, that the two revenue cutters taken from the Government are usually anchored on the side of the main ship channel towards Cummings Point—one of them northeast of the point and the other more to the north of it. They are armed with guns or howitzers, probably of small caliber.
The storm of last night swamped one of the boats here. It was the Port Moultrie barge, brought over with the command.

General : The sudden change of temperature from the warmth of yesterday to the cold of last night and this morning seems to have checked the ardor of the laborers on the field work on Cummings Point, as but little activity is observed this morning.

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer TJ. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General : The line of intrenchments on the channel side of Cummings Point, or rather of Morris Island, is now extended down to the rear of the Star of the West battery. This line is composed of redoubts, connected by lines of parapet serving for curtains. The rear of the redoubts, or the parts towards us, are raised so high as to secure them from our reverse fire. There is one in rear of the Star of the West battery, situated on the top of the sand hill, which conceals that battery from our view, and two more between this and the works on Cummings Point. Both of these are situated on sand hills, and well protected in their rear, as described above.
The weather being unusually pleasant, their operations are actively carried on this morning. Other work is being done farther down the beach, say six hundred yards below the Star of the West battery. I cannot make it out at present. It is probable that it is to be another small battery to fire on the channel, and to be closed in the rear.
I am inclined to think, from the materials that have been carried in that direction, that the defenses at the mouth of the Stono have been much strengthened. This river was an avenue by which and Wappoo Creek the city could be approached by vessels drawing less than eight feet of water. The defense of this point has, therefore, not been neg-

lected. The idea seems to be to place their batteries all along the beach between Cummings Point and Light-house Inlet (which is also fortified), so that a landing must be attempted under the fire of at least one battery. Some little work is being done on Fort Moultrie, strengthening the merlons of the guns on the sea front.
It now appears that the rear of Fort Johnson is protected by a line of intrenchments which comes out on the beach a little above the mortar battery, and probably runs across to the old Martello Tower, situated about 500 yards southeast of the wharf, near the beach.
NTo unusual movements are observed, except the firing of one gun in the city at about llh o’clock last night. A negro boy, escaping from the city, came down last night about 11 o’clock in a canoe to this fort. He was at once sent back. The guard-ship anchored inside the main ship bar has, I observed, housed her topmasts.

My Dear Sir : Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort Sumter, under all the circumstances is it wise to attempt it? Please give me your opinion in writing on this question.*
Your obedient servant,
[A. LINTCOLK]
Answer.
In reply to the letter of inquiry addressed to me by the President, whether, u assuming it to be possible now to provision Fort Sumter, under all the circumstances is it wise to attempt itf I beg leave to say that it has received the careful consideration, in the limited time I could bestow upon it, which its very grave importance demands, and that my mind has been most reluctantly forced to the conclusion that it would be unwise now to make such an attempt.
In coming to this conclusion I am free to say I am greatly influenced by the opinions of the Army officers who have expressed themselves on the subject, and who seem to concur that it is, perhaps, now impossible to succor that fort substantially, if at all, without capturing, by means of a large expedition of ships of war and troops, all the opposing batteries of South Carolina. All the officers within Fort Sumter, together with Generals Scott and Totten, express this opinion, and it would seem to me that the President would not be justified to disregard such high authority without overruling considerations of public policy.

CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.--------UNION.
Major Anderson, in his report of the 28th ultimo, says:
I confess that I would not he willing to risk my reputation on an attempt to throw re-enforcements into this harbor within the time for our relief, rendered necessary by the limited supply of our provisions, and with a view of holding possession of the same with a force of less than twenty thousand good and well-disciplined men.
In this opinion Major Anderson is substantially sustained by the reports of all the other officers within the fort, one of whom, Captain Seymour, speaks thus emphatically on the subject :
It is not more than possible to supply this fort by ruse with a few men or a small amount of provisions, such is the unceasing vigilance employed to prevent it. To do so openly by vessels alone, unless they are shot-proof, is virtually impossible, so numerous and powerful are the opposing batteries. No vessel can lay near the fort without being exposed to continual fire, and the harbor could, and probably would, whenever necessary, be effectually closed, as one channel has already been. A projected attack in large force would draw to this harbor all the available resources in men aud material of the contiguous States. Batteries of guns of heavy caliber would be multiplied rapidly and indefinitely. At least twenty thousand men, good marksmen and trained for months past with a view to this very contingency, would be concentrated here before the attacking force could leave Northern ports. The harbor .would be closed. A landing must be effected at some distance from our guns, which could give no aid. Charleston Harbor would be a Sebastopol in such a conflict, and unlimited means would probably be required to insure success, before which time the garrison of Fort Sumter would be starved out.
General Scott, in his reply to the question addressed to him by the President, on the 12th instant, what amount of means and of what description, in addition to those already at command, it would require to supply and re-enforce the fort; says:
I should need a fleet of war vessels and transports which, in the scattered disposition of the Navy (as understood), could not be collected in less than four months; 5,000 additional regular troops and 20,000 volunteers; that is, a force sufficient to take all the batteries, both in the harbor (including Fort Moultrie), as well as in the approach or outer bay. To raise, organize, and discipline such an army (not to speak of necessary legislation by Congress, not now in session) would require from six to eight months. As a practical military question the time for succoring Fort Sumter with any means at hand had passed away nearly a month ago. Since then a surrender under assault or from starvation has been merely a question of time.
It is true there are those, whose opinions are entitled to respectful consideration, who entertain the belief that Fort Sumter could yet be succored to a limited extent without the employment of the large army and naval forces believed to be necessary by the Army officers whose opinions I have already quoted.
Captain Ward, of the Navy, an officer of acknowledged merit, a month ago believed it to be practicable to supply the fort with men and provisions to a limited extent without the employment of any very large military or naval force. He then proposed to employ four or more small steamers belonging to the Coast Survey to accomplish the purpose, and we have the opinion of General Scott that he has no doubt that Captain Ward at that time would have succeeded with his proposed expedition, but was not allowed by the late President to attempt the execution of his plan. Now it is pronounced from the change of circumstances impracticable by Major Anderson and * all the other officers of the fort, as well as by Generals Scott and Totten, and in this opinion Captain Ward, after full consultation with the latter-named officers and the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, I understand now reluctantly concurs.
Mr. Fox, another gentleman of experience as a seaman, who, having formerly been engaged on the Coast Survey, is familiar with the waters of the Charleston Harbor, has proposed to make the attempt to supply the fort with cutters of light draught and large dimensions, and his proposal has in a measure been approved by Commodore Stringham, but

[Chap. I.
he does not suppose or propose or profess to believe that provisions for more than one or two months could be furnished at a time.
There is no doubt whatever in my mind that when Major Anderson first took possession of Fort Sumter he could have been easily supplied with men and provisions, and that when Captain Ward, with the concurrence of General Scott, a month ago proposed his expedition he would have succeeded had he been allowed to attempt it, as I think he should have been. A different state of things now, however, exists. Fort Moultrie is now rearmed and strengthened in every way ; many new land batteries have been constructed; the principal channel has been obstructed; in short, the difficulty of re-enforcing the fort has been increased ten if not twenty fold.
Whatever might have been done as late as a month ago, it is too sadly evident that it cannot now be done without the sacrifice of life and treasure not at all commensurate with the object to be attained; and as the abandonment of the fort in a few weeks, sooner or later, appears to be an inevitable necessity, it seems to me that the sooner it be done the better.
The proposition presented by Mr. Fox, so sincerely entertained and ably advocated, would be entitled to my favorable consideration if, with all the light before me and in the face of so many distinguished military authorities on the other side, I did not believe that the attempt to carry it into effect would initiate a bloody and protracted conflict. Should he succeed in relieving Fort Sumter, which is doubted by many of our most experienced soldiers and seamen, would that enable us to maintain our authority against the troops and fortifications of South Carolina? Sumter could not now contend against these formidable adversaries if filled with provisions and men. That fortress was intended, as her position on the map will show, rather to repel an invading foe. It is equally clear from repeated investigations and trials that the range of her guns is too limited to reach the city of Charleston, if that were desirable.
No practical benefit will result to the country or the Government by accepting the proposal alluded to, and I am therefore of opinion that the cause of humanity and the highest obligation to the public interest would be best promoted by adopting the counsels of those brave and experienced men whose suggestions I have laid before you.

sage of vessels larger than sloops of war; so that, before it was obstructed, a naval attack, to be very formidable, must have consisted of many vessels of this kind.
In designing the defenses of Charleston Harbor, therefore, it was considered that Fort Sumter, with Castle Pinckney, would suffice, with some improvement of Fort Moultrie, and the erection of batteries in time of war on James Island at the position called Fort Johnson. A deeper entrance would have demanded a stronger system.
The South Carolina troops have strengthened Fort Moultrie and added batteries thereto 5 they possess Castle Pinckney; they have erected batteries at Fort Johnson, and, not having Fort Sumter, they have planted a number of guns (number not known) on Morris Island.
These last do not, certainly, bring their system up to that which included Fort Sumter ; but they, as is represented, have also so blocked the main channel, or made its navigation so intricate, that only vessels light in draught can enter—vessels unavoidably weak to resist and impotent to assail.
If we suppose a squadron of war vessels as large as can be forced through the impediments of the main bar to have overcome that difficulty, and, under pressure of steam, to advance in daylight (as I think would be indispensable), they would suffer greatly from the fire of Morris Island, Fort Moultrie, aiid its adjacent batteries—but they would suffer much less than the small vessels, because much stronger and with vital parts better secured, and because their own fire would, to a certain extent, keep under, and, to a great degree, render uncertain the fire of the batteries. But whether larger or smaller, the vessels have not merely to pass the fire of the batteries—they must remain exposed to it. Because, before getting beyond the fire of Fort Moultrie, they come within scope of Fort Johnson, and while yet under the guns of these batteries they will be reached by Castle Pinckney. There is no point of shelter within these waters ; and although the squadron of heavy sloops might survive the dangers of the passage, they could not long endure the cannonade that would be concentrated on any anchorage. In these very waters, this problem was settled in the Revolutionary War by the contest between the squadron of Sir Peter Parker and the single work of Fort Moultrie—then certainly not more powerful than now.
To enable the supposed squadron to remain, it is indispensable that a military force should capture the batteries from the land, and be strong enough, besides, to hold possession against the troops now assembled in and around them, and those that would rapidly come from the interior.
Should small vessels attempt this entrance by daylight, their destruction would be inevitable; at any rate, the chances of getting through would Be too slender to justify any such enterprise. We have certain information that there is much practice with these guns, and that the practice now is good. If this risk were to be run by daylight, the vessels might have a draught of about eight feet, and could use the u Swash Channel,” or a passage between this and the main channel, or, finally, the latter. But I must repeat that unless we were to find a degree of inaptness and imbecility, and a want of vigilance and courage that we have no right to assume, this attempt by daylight with small vessels, even of great speed, must fail.
There remains another project, namely, to enter at night by the u Swash Channel” with a few (two or three) fast steam-tugs, having a draught of only (or about) five feet. To do this it will be necessary to take position before dark off this channel, so as to get upon the proper leading line to be followed after dark by the ascertained course,

or, possibly, by tbe bearing of tbe lights of Fort Sumter. With proper precautions in screening the lights and fires of the boats, &c., I think the risk would not be so great, considering only the batteries, as to deter from this attempt, provided the object were of very great importance. I should expect one or two, perhaps all, of these vessels to reach Fort Sumter, and the shoal upon which they must be grounded—provided no other impediments awaited them.
But, in the first place, it is a necessary condition that the boats arrive off the harbor before night. If they can see to take these bearings, they can be seen from the shore. In the next place, it seems impossible to fit out any expedition, however small and unobtrusive, without arousing inquiry, and causing the intelligence to be transmitted by telegraph. We may be certain,' therefore, that these tugs will be waited for by steamers lying in the1 channel way, full of men.
This mode of relieving Fort Sumter, or another by men in rowboats passing up the same channel, is so obvious that it is unreasonable to suppose it has not been duly considered and provided for, where so much intelligence and resource in military means have been displayed in the scheme of defense, and so much earnestness and energy in execution. We know that guard rowboats and steamers are active during the night $ and that they have all the means of intercepting with certainty this little expedition, and overpowering it, by boarding—a commencement of war.
This attempt, like any other, will inevitably involve a collision.
This raises a question that I am not called on to discuss, but as to which I may say that if the General Government adopts a course that must be attended with this result, its first measure should not be one so likely to meet disaster and defeat 5 nor one, I may add, which, even if successful, would give but momentary relief, while it would open all the powers of attack upon the fort, certainly reducing it before the means of recovering Charleston Harbor, with all its forts and batteries and environs, can possibly be concentrated there.
Respectfully submitted.

General Scott7s memoranda for the Secretary of War.
It seems from the opinions of the Army officers who have expressed themselves on the subject—all within Fort Sumter, together with Generals Scott and Totten—that it is perhaps now impossible to succor that fort substantially, if at all, without capturing, by means of a large expedition of ships of war and troops, all the opposing batteries of South Carolina. In the mean time—six or ten months—Major Anderson would almost certainly have been obliged to surrender under assault or the approach of starvation ; for even if an expedition like that proposed by G. Y. Fox should succeed once in throwing in the succor of a few men and a few weeks’ provisions, the necessity of repeating the latter supply would return again and again, including the yellow-fever season. An abandonment of the fort in a few weeks, sooner or later, would appear, therefore, to be a sure necessity, and if so, the sooner the more graceful on the part of the Government.
It is doubtful, however, according to recent information from the South, whether the voluntary evacuation of Fort Sumter alone would have a decisive effect upon the States now wavering between adherence to the Union and secession. It is known, indeed, that it would be

charged to necessity, and the holding of Fort Pickens would be adduced in support of that view. Our Southern friends, however, are clear that the evacuation of both the forts would instantly soothe and give confidence to the eight remaining slaveholding States, and render their cordial adherence to this Union perpetual.
The holding of Forts Jefferson and Taylor, on the ocean keys, depends on-entirely different principles, and should never be abandoned; and, indeed, the giving up of Forts Sumter and Pickens may be best justified by the hope that we should thereby recover the State to which they geographically belong by the liberality of the act, besides retaining the eight doubtful States.
[InclosTire C.]
Lieutenant HalVs notes.
I have the honor to state that I could not concur with Captain Bod-gers, with whom I was directed to confer, in his plan for the entrance of the harbor of Charleston with men and provisions for Fort Sumter. He proposes to procure a vessel (steamboat), with a draught of not over six and one-lialf feet, in some Northern port, and with the cargo to be cleared for Charleston, letting it be known, as if in confidence, that the design is to force a landing on the southern extreme of Morris Island; to carry the batteries by the rear and destroy the channel; to bring in the vessel, the vessel to regulate her speed so as to arrive off the bar in a dark night and at high tide, and to proceed through the Swash Channel with her lights extinguished; in case of discovery and being fired at, to drop a cork with a light in it, which would deceive the gunners. If the batteries are lighted up the men cannot see in the distance; if they are not, the lights will not be visible. The commander is to be allowed to back his vessel in case of a storm on the way down.
My objections to this plan are very numerous. In the first place, the deception would be apparent, as no one would attempt a forced landing with means possible to such a vessel. Secondly, not being a sea-going vessel the danger to life and the success of the undertaking is so great as to appear imprudent at best. Thirdly, it is unsafe to calculate upon not being seen off the bar, as a number of watch vessels, some with troops and cannon, are stationed off and along the entrance. Fourthly, even though the above dangers should all be safely passed and it should prove a moonless night and high tide at a proper time, still a chance shot through the machinery would defeat the enterprise.
The plan is grounded upon the most fortunate and improbable circumstances. It might succeed; but I think failure would be the rule. By an examination of the chart of the harbor of Charleston it will be seen that the Swash Channel passes outside the range of all the batteries erected along the entrance, except, perhaps, the small one near Cummings Point (of one 32-pounder and one 12-pounder), and this can be safely neglected. Fort Moultrie can bring several guns to bear for a mile and a half (not ten minutes), but their field has been greatly reduced by the traverse with small embrasures lately thrown up on the parapet. Considering as effective all the means in the hands of those hostile to the undertakings, the following are at present to be noticed: The channel will not admit of more than six and one-half feet draught with ease in sailing; at least one steamer with troops and field guns will be near the bar; a line of pilot schooners and signal vessels form a cordon outside the bar; the main ship channel is obstructed with sunken ships; Maffitt?s Channel is raked and crossed by the fires of Moultrie and batter-

ies placed along Sullivan’s Island; the buoys and range lights are removed; the anchorage, except a small area, is under the fire of guns from the several fortified points; the Swash Channel is readily followed by ranging Fort Sumter on St. Michael’s till within five hundred yards of the fort, where a detour to the right will be necessary. Carefully navigated, passing very near the north side of the fort, the vessel may be brought to the wharf at high tide. If not successful, small boats may be furnished by the fort. The only effective guns are those of Fort Moultrie on this entrance. I have the honor to propose that a war vessel (the Brooklyn best) be dispatched with two schooners and two ordinary steam-tugs, each of not more than six feet and a half draught, and under the same pretension as that first proposed, and this combination will give color to the rumor. One of the schooners is to be loaded with provisions entirely, and the hay is to be stored on the starboard. The other, with some provisions, is to carry the troops. The vessels arrived off the bar, the Brooklyn can keep all hostile vessels at a distance and make the following arrangement:
The vessel with provisions is to be placed upon the right, next a screw-tug, next the vessel with troops, and again a tug. The right-hand vessel will cover those on the left, protecting from fire the troops and means of locomotion. The vessels should arrive off the bar two hours before high tide, so that the tide will be rising all the way in, and if grounded may be floated off in a short time. To prevent vessels from the city and the cutters inside the harbor from interfering, the fort shall be signaled, and will reply by lowering its flag or showing a light, and will prevent any vessel going out. Signals should be agreed upon, and the time, day or night, also. Two field pieces, loaded with canister, might be used to meet a desperate attempt to board the vessels. The hay in bales should be wet, to prevent heated baUs from setting fire to the vessels.

Memorandum of Gapt. G. V. Fox.
Washington, D. C., February 8,1861. Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, U. S. Army, Washington, D. G.:
General : The proposition which I had the honor to submit fully in person is herewith presented in writing. Lieutenant Hall and myself have had several free conferences, and if he is permitted by the South Carolina authorities to re-enter Fort Sumter, Major Anderson will comprehend the plan for his relief. I consider myself very fortunate in having proposed a project which meets the approval of the General-in-Chief, and I ask no reward but the entire conduct of the part, exclusive of the armed vessels. The commander of these should be ordered to co-operate with me, by affording protection and destroying their naval preparations near the bar, leaving to me, as the author of the plan, the actual operations of relief. I suggest that the Pawnee be immediately sent to the Delaware Breakwater to await orders; the Harriet Lane to be ready for sea, and some arrangement entered into by which the requisite steamer and tugs should be engaged, at least so far as not to excite suspicion. I would prefer one of the Collins steamers. They are now being prepared for sea, and are of such a size and power as to be able fearlessly to run down any vessels which might attempt to capture us outside by a coup de main. I could quietly engage one and have her ready to start in twenty-four hours’ notice, without exciting suspicion. I shall leave for New York at 3.10 p. m., and any communication previous will find me at Judge Blair’s. If the Pawnee pivot-gun is landed it should certainly be remounted.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

St. Germain Hotel, New York, February 6,1861.
Since the repulse of the steamer Star of the West at Charleston it may be assumed that all the channels over the bar are obstructed, but as the bar is more than four miles in length the spaces between these channels are too extensive to be closed; therefore at high water and smooth sea the harbor is perfectly accessible to vessels drawing, say, seven feet of water. The United States have no steamers of this draught. The skillful officers at Charleston, aware of this fact, will conclude that relief must go in at high water in boats or light-draught steamers, incapable of bearing a very offensive armament. They will be perfectly prepared for such attempts by arming and heavily manning all the steamers they possess, antf at the critical moment will throw themselves alongside of the relief vessels, and thus jeopardize the movement by the very detention of the conflict. To elude their vigilance or attempt a stratagem, however ingenious, I consider too liable to failure. I propose to put the troops on board of a large, comfortable sea steamer, and hire two powerful light-draught New York tug-boats, having the necessary stores on board; these to be convoyed by the U. S. steamer Pawnee, now at Philadelphia, and the revenue cutter Harriet Lane. (The Pawnee is the

only available steam vessel of war north of the Gulf of Mexico, draws twelve feet of water, and has seven heavy guns. As a steamer, she seems to be a failure, but may be got ready for this emergency; at least she is, unfortunately, our only resource.) The Harriet Lane I understand to be an excellent and efficient vessel; but either of these steamers alone may be liable to capture by an overwhelming force.
Arriving off the bar I propose to examine by day the naval preparations and obstructions. If their vessels determine to oppose our entrance (and a feint or flag of truce would ascertain this) the armed ships must approach the bar and destroy or drive them on shore. Major Anderson would do the same upon any vessels within the range of his guns, and would also prevent any naval succor being sent down from the city. Having dispersed this force the only obstacles are the forts on Cummings Point and Fort Moultrie, and whatever adjacent batteries they may have erected distant on either hand from midchannel about three-quarters of a mile. At night, two hours before high water, with half the force on board of each tug within relieving distance of each other, I should run in to Fort Sumter.
[Inelosiire Gr.]
Yew York, February 23,1861.
My Hear Blair : Mr. Blunt received a telegraph from General Scott a few days since which he thought indicated an adjournment of my plan; but I put the construction upon it that another was substituted for mine, and I feel certain it must be “ boats.” To corroborate this the Yew York Times, of February 21, says: uGovernment has determined to relieve Fort Sumter by boats at night.” I consider this plan possible, and the alternative of mine, but inferior at every step. The distance from Fort Sumter to outside is five miles—an hour’s pull. From this point the open ocean, winter season, and at night, say two hundred men (requiring for six months five hundred and forty-six barrels of provisions) are to be put into boats, rowed over a very dangerous bar, and subjected for half an hour to a fire of grape from sixty guns. Besides, if a single tug (they have four) eludes Major Anderson’s vigilance, she would run in amongst these boats with perfect impunity to herself and utter destruction to them. I have made two cruises on the coast of Africa, where the passing of bars by boats, unless very light and in broad daylight, was considered the most dangerous duty we were subjected to, fatal accidents being common in the smoothest weather. Moreover, this plan has been spoken of publicly in connection with the U. S. ship Brooklyn, and from this fact is probably made a special study by the Charlestonians.
I simply propose three tugs, convoyed by light-draught men-of-war. These tugs ‘are sea-boats, six feet draught, speed fourteen knots. The boilers are below, with three and a half feet space on each side, to be filled with coal. The machinery comes up between the wheel-houses, with a gangway on either hand of five to six feet, enabling us to pack the machinery with two or three thicknesses of bales of cotton or hay. This renders the vulnerable parts of the steamer probf against grape and fragments of shells, but the momentum of a solid shot would probably move the whole mass and disable the engine. The men are below, entirely protected from grape—provisions-on deck. The first tug to lead in empty, to open their fire. The other two to follow, with the force divided, and towing the large iron boats of the Baltic, which would hold the whole force should every tug be disabled, and empty they would not impede the tugs. When such men as George W. Blunt,

Charles K. Marshall, and Eussell Sturgis, all seamen, give my plan the preference, it must have merit. At Kinburn, in the Black Sea, eight gunboats passed in the night forts mounting eighty guns—only one boat hit. The next day^ in broad daylight, the Cracker (English) came out under their deliberate fire—distance nine hundred yards. The Yladimar (Russian steamer at Sebastopol) was under fire at various distances during the whole war, but her motion prevented her being disabled. How few of Dahlgren’s shots hit the target with all the elements of success he is capable of producing! I am sure I could convince the authorities of the preference that is due to this plan, if I could argue the plan instead of write it.
Sincerely yours,

Hew York, March 1,1861.
Bear Blair:
I just met Russell Sturgis, who has charge of most of the tow-boats in the harbor, and he informs me that the Charleston authorities have opened negotiations here for the purchase of two tugs, and that the two proposed are two of the three I had selected, being the only three really fit for the work in the whole city. I thought it best to give you this information at once, as the probability of re-enforcing Fort Sumter except by landing and capturing their forts will be lessened with such fine boats as 1 have described in their possession. Captain Sturgis has put these boats in order, notwithstanding my plan has the go-by, for we all feel that a severe discussion must bring it up again.
I met a Havy officer to-day who has just received a letter from Hart-stene. He is captain in the S. C. Havy with the same pay as a U. S. captain, and has charge of the coast defenses. He thinks he has prevented an attack upon Sumter so far, but says it will soon be done, and will be a very sanguinary affair. Paul Hamilton, esq., commands the floating battery now launched. They have four tugs, which do not amount to much compared to one of these powerful Hew York ones. # # # # # # #

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer TJ. 8. Army^ Washington, D. C.:
General: Considerable activity is exhibited this morning in the batteries on Morris Island and in the vicinity of the mortar battery on James Island. Three steamers have landed on Cummings Point quite a large number of men, both laboring and military, with three barbette carriages and four guns, either 24 or 32 pounders, and quite a large quantity of supplies. The operations, however, which are not fully defined at this time, appear to be directed to the continuation of the works of defense on the channel side, and also to the further strengthening of the works as far down the beach as the light-house and mouth of the Stono River. On James Island the work is confined to the construction of about one hundred and fifty yards of covered way on the beach, connecting the mortar battery and the flank of the line of in-trenehments in rear of Fort Johnson, where it comes out on the beach.
I am still engaged in filling up the exterior openings of the first-tier loopholes on the gorge. One-half of the gorge is thus strengthened. I have put the two 10-inch columbiads in good working order. The opening through the masonry wall in rear of the main gate has also been lined with iron plate in such a way that the main gate may not be shaken when the 8-inch howitzer in rear is fired through the opening. I am also clearing the parade of rubbish.

It is supposed that this was Vice-President Stephens, of the so-called Southern Confederacy. Three rounds were fired from all the batteries on Morris Island, except No. 1, apparently as much for practice as for saluting, for most of the guns not pointed in this direction were shotted. This firing enabled me to detect the positions and approximate calibers of the guns in these batteries.
The marginal sketch represents this roughly:
No. 1. Battery of sand and palmetto logs, four 24-pounders.
No. 2. Iron-clad battery, three guns, 42-pounders or 8-inch columbiads.
No. 3. Battery of sand and palmetto logs, three guns, 24-pounders or 32-pounders.
No. 4. Battery of sand and palmetto logs, with one 8-inch columbiad or 8-inch sea-coast howitzer.
No. 5. Star of the West battery, five guns, 24-pounders or 32-pounders.
a is a large magazine $ &, c, d are defenses of the character of redoubts on top of three sand hills.
There were two guns at each round fired from the light-house battery.
Three or four more guns were landed yesterday with barbette carriages, and most of them (in fact, all that are removed from the landing which is in front of battery No. 1, where there is deep water close in shore) were carried around upon the channel side. One, at least, was placed in battery No. 4, making four guns in that battery at present.
These guns with barbette carriages came from Castle Pinckney, nearly the whole of the upper tier of which is being removed for this purpose. None of the guns from Fort Moultrie bearing upon this fort or the channel have been removed. No work is being done on the batteries looking towards us. All preparations are directed to strengthening the channel batteries very much, and to covering the present batteries in the rear, which was before open.
No work of any magnitude is being done on Cummings Point to-day (Sunday). On James Island the work on the covered way connecting the flank of the line of intrenchments and the mortar battery is being continued.
The weather is pleasant, although there are indications of a storm brewing.

Colonel: I have the honor to report that we see them at work at the large battery near Fort Johnson, behind which they appear to be constructing something with heavy timbers, and at battery No. 1, on Morris Island, which they are extending. At the last firing from this battery both shot and shell were thrown., They are also at work on a new battery, not far from the Moultrie House, on Sullivan’s Island. This makes, as far as we can judge, four batteries between the fort and the east end of the island. As we are very deficient in ammunition, I have directed the quartermaster to turn over to the Ordnance Department a quantity of flannel shirts, from which I shall have cartridge bags made.
Our sick-list is the same as when last mentioned. They practice daily, firing shot and shell in the direction of the junction of the Swash and Main Channels. Their practice is pretty good. They'are firing now from heavy mortars in rear of the iron-plated battery on Cummings Point. I have no ammunition to spare, and, therefore, do not show them our proficiency in artillery practice.

(Received A. G. O., March 28.) Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General 77. 8 A.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that everything is quiet around us, and that we do not see any work being prosecuted except that at the new battery at Fort Johnson. They are practicing this morning with shells from the columbiads at Fort Moultrie and from a mortar battery between Nos. 9 and 10.
I inclose herewith a report of the condition of our fort. It will be seen that a great deal of work has been done since we came in. We are now about finishing the closing of the openings in the gorge—a measure first suggested by Captain Doubleday.
I have not noted the different operations we have been engaged in from time to time, as I did not deem them of sufficient importance to require it.

Fort Sumter, S. C., March 24,1861. Maj. Robert Anderson, First Artillery, Commanding:
Sir : In accordance with verbal instructions given by you, we have the honor to submit the following report upon the condition of Fort Sumter when occupied December 26, 1860, the measures taken to put it in a state of defense, and its present condition:
Condition of the worTc December 26,1860.
The barbette tier was ready for its armament: Three 24-pounders were mounted at the left and three more were ready to be mounted at the right gorge angle.
NOMENCLATURE*
SALIENT
Me second tier of arches was not ready for its guns. The embrasures were not yet placed, and forty-one openings, eight feet square, were left in the scarp wall for this purpose. Those on the flanks (20) were closed only with a sheathing of 1-inch boards; the remainder, on the faces (21), were either entirely open or closed with three courses of brick dry-laid,

or, as on the left face, with two courses laid in mortar; some few were only half closed. One 32-pounder was mounted, for experimental purposes, on the right flank.
First tier.—Eleven 32-pounders were mounted on the left face. Guns could be mounted throughout. The forty-one embrasures were closed with the ordinary 6-inch wooden shutters, secured with a wooden brace and rope lashing. Two small posterns in the gorge angles were closed, each with two doors, the outer hooked, the inner barred. The soldiers7 quarters were unfinished, and as those portions that were tenable were occupied by workmen, the transferred garrison was placed in the officers7 quarters, which were completed.
The parade was crowded with temporary wooden buildings (6), used as shops and storehouses, with a large amount of flagging, lumber, sand, shell, and brick, and with the ordnance, consisting of sixty-six guns with their carriages and 5,600 shot and shell. The communications through these incumbrances were very difficult.
The main postern was closed by two gates, each of two 4-inch leaves, secured with wooden cross-bars; they were loopholed and were weak and insecure.
On the gorge seven loopholed doors were closed with 5-inch wooden shutters; twelve magazine ventilators with wooden shutters at the throat; fifty-one loopholed windows were not closed. The esplanade and wharf were much incumbeled with flagging, sand, and brick, and by two apparatuses, twelve feet high and attached to the scarp wall, for hoisting boats.
The garrison transferred from Fort Moultrie consisted of seven officers, seventy-six enlisted men, and forty-five women and children. There were three officers, one enlisted man, two hundred and five laborers, and one woman at Fort Sumter. One hundred and fifty of the laborers were discharged within a few days, and the women and children were shipped to New York early in February, 1861, leaving at this date a garrison consisting of ten officers, seventy-five enlisted men, and fifty-five laborers. There has been and is an ample supply of water and a sufficiency of fuel, principally in the shape of lumber, flooring, and gun carriages.
Immediately after the transfer of the garrison to this place, and your assuming command, instructions were given to limit the defense to the barbette and first tier, closing all openings in that tier, except three or four at each angle, where guns were to be mounted, and all openings in the second tier, permanently and securely. The first labors were directed to mounting the proposed armament, and to closing these openings, after which such defenses were prepared as the situation of the garrison suggested, until this date, when the condition of the work is as follows:
Barbette tier.—The armament is fully described in the accompanying figure.* It consists, in all, of twenty-seven guns, one of which, a 42-pounder, is mounted at the left shoulder angle on a casemate carriage placed on the chassis of a 10-inch columbiad, and a 24-pounder at the left gorge angle is so arranged and the parapet so cut away that it can be depressed to 18° and fired upon the end of the wharf. Several machicoulis galleries of 1^-inch plank (five lined with J-inchiron plate) are placed on the parapet, one on the center of each face and flank, and three on the gorge, over and commanding the main postern; 225 shells, mostly 8-inch, are arranged as grenades, to be rolled oft the parapet and exploded by means of a lanyard of proper length. Thunder-barrels are placed at each angle and over the main gate; fragments of stone, brick,

&c., along the breast-height for missiles; twenty-three flights of steps lead to the parapet; ammunition in limber-boxes is placed convenient for instant use, and grape, canister, shot, and shell in abundance at each gun. Some five hundred cartridge bags have been made. The powder is well stored in the first-story magazine in the left gorge angle.
Second tier.—The 32-pounder on the right flank is dismounted; the forty-one 8-foot square openings are securely closed by a 3-foot brick wall, laid in cement, and backed in twenty-seven by two feet of sand, kept in place by a sheathing of boards or by barrels, in eight by two feet of flagging-stones, laid dry, and in six by dry brick, or re-enforced only by piles of finishing-stuff* and flooring-boards.
First tier.—The armament consists of twenty-seven guns, and is fully described in the plan adjoined.* There are eighteen guns ready for instant service, sixteen of the embrasures in front of which are closed with the original 6-inch wooden shutter, and also with an inner 6-inch shutter fitting close to the throat, and through the center of which a link from the outer shutter passes; an iron key tightens both firmly together. Two are closed by iron shutters of J-inch iron plate; all are further secured by a 10-foot brace abutting against the gun run “from battery.97 Where guns are mounted (9), but not required for immediate use, the embrasures (9) are closed temporarily, in addition to the outer shutter, by stone flagging, notched to fit the throat and laid flat, or by brick laid in mortar. There are fourteen embrasures, behind which guns are not mounted, of which eight, on the flanks, are closed by an 18-inch brick wall laid in mortar against the outer shutter; one by the dry-stone flagging, and the remainder (five) on the right face, by an entire embrasure filling of brick and stone laid in mortar.
The doors of the two posterns on the flanks are strengthened by 3-foot brick walls laid in mortar against the outer doors.
On the parade four 8-inch and one 10-inch columbiads are mounted as mortars (see preceding plan), and point to Morris Island and Charleston. All the, temporary buildings and the lumber have been removed for fuel, the flagging turned on edge against the quarters or in the ends of the casemates, the shell spread on the walks, the sand and brick used, with a stone revetment, for splinter-proof traverses about the guns and in front of the hospital. The lantern has been removed from the light-house and placed on a platform in the center. The entire parade is clear.
Main postern.—A stone and brick wall laid in cement is built against the outer gate to within four feet of the lintel. It is three feet six inches thick and six feet high. Through it is a manhole one foot eleven inches wide. An 8-inch sea-coast howitzer on a casemate-top carriage only looks through the manhole.
In the door above the wall are four loopholes, reached by steps. One leaf of the gate is firmly bolted shut; the other can be opened or securely shut, and through

in the cross wall to which it is hung. Material is at hand with which to close the outer door permanently. The walls of the stairways leading
to the second floor are closed with lj-inch plank, and openings over the postern are arranged for throwing grenades.
The gorge.—In the second story the thirty-four windows and six magazine ventilators are protected by placing in each twowrought-iron embrasure jams, eight inches thick and three feet six inches long, permitting of musketry fire over them. In the first story the seven doors are closed Avith a 5-inch wooden shutter, against which, outside, is built a 9-inch brick wall, laid in cement, and outside this a pintle stone, 8 feet by 2 feet 2 inches by 1 foot 3 inches, with pieces of flagging, fastened in with wooden wedges and melted lead; the six magazine ventilators by large stones and lead against the Avail and shutter; and fifteen windows are closed by the pintle stone and flagging, fastened Avith the wedges and lead. In all these openings the filling is placed against the offset at the throat, by which a solid wall, two feet thick and well secured in the rear, has been obtained.
On the esplanade two 8-inch sea-coast howitzers are mounted on casemate carriages only, one each side of the main gate, to sweep the gorge and the approaches to it. The stone, &c., has been removed, leaving only a row along the edge to prevent grenades rolling off*. Two fougasses, of 12 feet diameter, charged with 50 pounds of powder, are placed against the foot of the scarp wall, one in the center of each half gorge. Two mines, charged with 25 pounds of powder, are sunk in the wharf 40 feet apart. A wooden fence, 8 feet high, at each end of the esplanade, extends from the scarp to low water. The stones of the enrockment in front of embrasures to be opened are removed. A deep cut in the enrockment on the left flank obstructs communication.
Bespectfully submitted.

exterior loophole openings on the first tier of the gorge, also the construction of the large splinter-proof traverse in front of the hospital. To-morrow I shall cut away a small portion of the brick interior slope so as to allow the 10-inch columbiad at the west gorge angle, barbette tier, to be traversed sufficiently to fire on the Cummings Point batteries. The construction of a second splinter-proof traverse to cover the front of the magazine and ordnance room, will also be commenced. I am having an inventory taken of all Engineer property, in accordance with your directions of the 21st instant, received yesterday. I regret that I am not able to make the return of property for the third and fourth quarters of 1860, in consequence of all papers relating to the subject (except the vouchers) being withheld by the authorities of South Carolina. The reason that I delayed so long to make the property return for the third quarter is this : The commencement and rapid increase of the work upon the fortifications in this harbor during the last month of this quarter and the three months of the following quarter took all my time and attention, and the purchases in town, and settlement of freight bills and accounts, took all the time of my clerk, Mr. Legar6. I finally hired another man to assist him to bring up the accounts and to enable him to make the return of property, but before this was done they desired to secede from the office. I insisted that Mr. Legar6 should finish the property return, which he promised to do•, but before he had finished it the State seceded, and he left the office. My overseer also left me suddenly on the 28th of December, and the hurry of preparation for defense prevented me taking an inventory of property at that time.
A considerable amount of material has been used in these preparations. I can assure you, however, that everything used has been well applied and was necessary. Trusting that the above explanation of the circumstances that prevented my making the required returns may be found satisfactory,
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Capt. J. G. Foster, Corps of Engineers, Charleston, 8. C. :
Captain: In compliance with your request in letter of the 20th instant, the sum of $1,000 will be placed to your credit with the assistant treasurer at New York on account of Fort Sumter, and to guard against the chance of its not being available in time, through the inability of the Treasurer to provide the money, instructions will be given to Lieutenant Gillmore to see that your checks upon the assistant treasurer to that amount are honored.
It is hoped that in case of the evacuation of Fort Sumter you will be able to bring away the books, drawings, papers, and perhaps light articles of value in your care, but it can hardly be expected that you can secure the heavy articles of property. You should, however, do so if you can.
Should the fort be evacuated, you will, as suggested in your letter of the 14th instant, leave with the command, and report in person, with your assistants, Lieutenants Snyder and Meade, at this Department.

P. S.—I inclose herewith a correspondence between the South Carolina officials and myself in reference to some points to which attention was called some time since. Expecting a reply to my last communication, I have delayed sending these letters off, but now do so, as no rejoinder will probably be made.
Respectfully,
R. A.
[Inelosnre No. 1.]
Fort Sumter, S. C., March 13,1861. His Excellency Gov. F. W. Pickens :
Sir : I have the honor herewith respectfully to inclose, for the consideration of your excellency, a note received yesterday by the clerk of Captain Foster from the beef contractor, which appears to show an interference with your excellency’s orders.
I am confident in the event of your excellency having made any change in your instructions in reference to my supplies I would have been promptly notified thereof. A similar interference may have prevented my receiving some boxes of solidified milk, which have been several days in the city to my address and which cannot have been detained on account of freight, as it was prepaid. This certainly would not, in the eyes of the transportation agent, come under the head of contraband of war or prohibited articles. It may be as well for me to mention here a few points which have not received that attention to which I think they are entitled.
About six weeks ago I sent, under cover to Col. L. M. Hatch, quartermaster-general, a note from Sergeant Renehan, of this command, to his brother-in-law, asking him to send from Fort Moultrie his private property, which was already packed up, and I respectfully asked Colonel Hatch if he ;would be pleased to give it his attention. Eo reply has been received to my communication, nor have the articles been sent.
About a month since instructions were given by the honorable Secretary of War that Captain Foster’s private property on Sullivan’s Island, as well as some public papers in the office in Charleston, should be sent down. Eeither the property nor the papers have yet been received here.
Early in January I sent some officers to Fort Moultrie for certain private property left there. They were received in so different a manner from the pivility and courtesy that characterized the manner of Colonel De Saussure that I. have not ventured to make another attempt to obtain possession of it, and I am thus cut off from regimental books (not public property) and office papers, valuable, to us, and merely interesting to others.

Some of the officers of this command have been put to considerable inconvenience and discomfort by the detention in the city of their hired servant, who left the post with a permit from the honorable Secretary of War. His detention after the discovery that the correspondence, at first characterized as a “ very improper one,” proved to be u nothing* more than what might have been expected between any silly persons in their situations,” is unwarranted. I attached no importance to this matter from the first, and so remarked to a gentleman who came down to see me in reference to it. No one, not even an owner of a slave, would have a right, under such circumstances, to prevent his return, and it was undoubtedly called for in this case by common civility and courtesy, as the officers have no opportunity of replacing him.
In regard to packages arriving from time to time, through the express or otherwise, it* it is necessary to trouble your excellency for special permits whenever articles of such minor importance as condiments, &c., are to be sent down to us, it is questionable with me whether it would not be better tor us to do without them altogether, and to send instructions to the various express companies not to receive any packages destined for my command.
With sentiments of high consideration and regard, -
I am, very respectfully, your excellency’s obedient servant,

Maj. Robert Anderson:
Sir: I am instructed by his excellency the governor to inform you that he is unwilling to modify his original permission that you should receive from the markets in this city such supplies of fresh meat and vegetables as you might indicate. A proper investigation will be instituted to inquire what obstacle has been interposed to the execution of the orders given oil the subject.
I will inquire why Lieutenant-Colonel Hatch has not sent the private property of Sergeant Renehan which was left at Fort Moultrie.
With respect to the furniture left by Captain Foster in the house occupied by him before he left Sullivan’s Island, and the papers, &c., left in his office in this city, I reply that Captain Simonton was requested to separate the furniture claimed by Captain Foster from his own, and send it to Fort Sumter through the quartermaster-general. This has been delayed, I believe, chiefly on account of some reclamations on the part of Captain Simonton for injuries done to his own furniture during the time the house was occupied by Captain Foster, and for rent. I have been informed that the matter has been attended to by Captain Simonton within the past few days, and I will take steps to have Captain Foster’s property sent to him without delay. As to the papers, Mr. Legare, who was indicated by Captain Foster as a proper person to carry .out his wishes, reported to me that he had collected and sent the papers, &c., to Captain Foster.
With respect to the property which you failed to recover from Fort Moultrie, I am informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Ripley that he sent word to you that if you would transmit an inventory of any articles of property left by you he would endeavor to collect and send them to you, but that he received no reply to his offer.

As to the servant referred to in your letter, it is proper that I should say that I am unwilling to discuss any question of right or courtesy growing out of the case beyond the unquestionable privilege of a slave owner to permit or not, at his own pleasure, the return of his slave to a hostile fort; but, as you have put a different interpretation on the language employed by me in my letters on the subject than I designed, I desire to state what I did mean: “The very improper correspondence” between the slaves to which I alluded had reference to the slaves alone, as information was given by the woman to the boy of operations in this city which were not proper to be communicated to any one in your garrison, and the reply of the boy clearly showed that his temper and principles had not been improved by a residence in Fort Sumter. The other words of mine, which you quote—“nothing more than what might have been expected between silly persons in their situation”—were meant as kind expressions on my part, to disabuse the minds of Dr. Crawford and other officers at the fort of any unfavorable impression upon me of a complicity on their part with the improper correspondence of idle negroes.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 15th instant in reply to mine of the 13th to his excellency the governor.
I hasten to ask you to refer to my letter to his excellency, and you will see that I did not solicit any modification of his original permission about receiving supplies of fresh meat and vegetables. I am satisfied with the existing arrangement, and only called attention to a reported interference of it. I thank you for your promise in reference to the property of Captain Foster.
Lieutenant-Colonel Ripley did kindly offer to attend to collecting any «private property” left on the island by the officers, and I thanked him for having done so.
The property alluded to in my note is not, strictly speaking, private, but belongs to the regiment or post, and therefore was not, in my opinion, embraced in his offer. My object in mentioning this matter was to call attention to it, in order that such directions might be given regarding it as might be deemed proper.
I beg leave to assure you that I had no desire to discuss the question of right or of courtesy in reference to the treatment my officers received in the failure to return the hired boy, and my remarks were intended to apply to the professed owner of the boy, who, neglecting his duty as owner or master for months, had permitted the boy to hire himself out, every one supposing him to be free, and now, at a time when the exercise of his “undoubted right” puts gentlemen here to a serious inconvenience, for the first time asserts his rights of ownership.
His excellency mentions in his letter to me, received yesterday, that the boy is a slave, and, of course, that ends the matter. In justice to myself I must state that I did not intentionally place a forced construction on your words. The day your first letter was received about the boy a gentlemen came down to see me about the “improper correspondence,” which he was told had reference to the negroes joining us in the event

of a collision. He remarked to his informants, as he told me, that he thought it a foolish story, advised them to say nothing about it, and said that he was certain, at all events, that I had no idea of anything of the kind, and came down to tell me of the rumor.

My Dear Major : Having been informed that Mr. Lamon, the authorized agent of the President of the United States, advised Governor Pickens, after his interview with you at Fort Sumter, that yourself and command would be transferred to another post in a few days, and understanding that you are under the impression I intended under all circumstances to require of you a formal surrender or capitulation, I hasten to disabuse you, and to inform you that our countries not being at war, and wishing as far as lies in my power to avoid the latter calamity, no such condition will be exacted of you, unless brought about as the natural result of hostilities.
Whenever you will be prepared to leave the fort, if you will inform Governor Pickens or myself of your intentions relative thereto, we will be happy to see that you are provided with proper means of transportation out of this harbor for yourself and command, including baggage, private and company property. All that will be required of you on account of the public rumors that have reached us will be your word of honor as an officer and a gentleman, that the fort, all public property therein, its armament, &c., shall remain in their present condition, without any arrangements or preparation for their destruction or injury after you shall have left the fort.

I only alluded to the pledge referred to by you on account of the high source from which the rumors spoken of appeared to come, and which, in the eyes of many officers of high standing, might be considered a sufficient reason for executing orders which otherwise they would not approve of; but I regret now having referred to the subject.
I remain, dear major, yours very truly,

I only regret that rumors from any source made you, for one moment, have the slightest doubt as to the straight path of honor and duty, in which I trust, by the blessing of God, ever to be found.

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General: The only work being done this morning in the surrounding batteries is on Cummings Point, where small parties, apparently of soldiers, are at work on the parapets of battery No. 3 (looking towards Fort Moultrie) and the redoubt on the sand hill in rear of the Star of the West battery. They appear to be repairing the damages caused by the wind and rain of yesterday and last night. More guns were landed on Cummings Point, but how many I cannot tell. Three of them, apparently 24-pounders on siege carriages, are now on the beach at the place of landing.
Two messengers from the city, Lieut. S. W. Ferguson, formerly of the Army, and Colonel Chisolm, came yesterday as bearers of a letter to Major Anderson from General Beauregard.
My operations are confined to the collection and counting of materials,

clearing of the parade, construction of splinter-proof traverse in front of ordnance room, and cutting of interior slope of parapet, so as to allow the 10-inch columbiad at the west gorge angle to traverse so as to fire on all the batteries on Cummings Point.
It was with great pleasure that I received the expressions of the approval of the Department contained in your letter of the 23d.

Colonel : I have the honor to report that everything was quiet last night. As we do not see the iron-plated floating battery this morning in the position it has occupied for some time, it is probable that it has been moved to guard some one of their exposed entrances.

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General: Very little is being done in the hostile batteries beyond the repairing of damages to parapets, except at the James Island mortar battery, where about fifty men are at work on the covered way to the left flank of the intrenchments, and upon an extension of the battery to the right. The floating battery was moved from her moorings last night, and removed to some place not within sight. The city papers stated some days since that she was to be taken to the mouth of the Stono, and it is probable that she was taken down there, on the high tide of last night, through Wappoo Creek.
The two messengers of the day before came again yesterday, with a second communication from General Beauregard to Major Anderson. Upon the whole, appearances are very pacific in this harbor at present, and no hostile demonstrations are made, or great activity in preparation exhibited. The three siege guns still remain in the same position on the beach at Cummings Point.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

On James Island a party of fifty men are at work extending and enlarging the mortar battery at its right flank. This is evidently to be so enlarged and furnished with guns as to constitute the strong point on which rests the left flank of the line of intrenchments which covers Fort Johnson, and perhaps the city on that side. In this fort, the splinter-proof traverses being completed and the parade well cleared, the men are at work hoisting to the terre-plein the 32-pounder chassis, to be used for temporary traverses between the guns.

The three batteries outside of the Star of the West have certainly guns of very heavy caliber; this we know from the great extent of the ranges and from the reports.
As our provisions are very nearly exhausted, I have requested Captain Foster to discharge his laborers, retaining only enough for a boat’s crew. I hope to get them off to-morrow. The last barrel of flour was issued day before yesterday.

Four heavy guns, one of them an 8-inch columbiad or 8-inch sea-coast howitzer. All fired yesterday.
Battery No. 7.—These guns are not all in the same battery, but are distributed along the beach apparently in three batteries. Eleven guns fired yesterday. All were very heavy guns except two, which I think were field pieces in a sort of second tier at a and b.
Above these batteries, on the sand hills, is a line of in-trenchments surrounding a house, and also several tents. The field pieces are apparently at a and b, capable of being used to defend the flanks of this intrenchment, and to fire on the channel. Their rear is covered, each with a traverse.

(Received A. G O., April 4.) Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. 8. Army:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that everything is still and quiet, as far as we can see, around us. The South Carolina Secretary of War has not sent the authority, asked for yesterday, to enable me to send off the discharged laborers. Having been in daily expectation, since the return of Colonel Lamon to Washington, of receiving orders to vacate this post, I have kept these men here as long as I could $ but now, having nearly completed the important work of cleaning up the area, &c., I am compelled, in consequence of the small supply of provisions on hand, to discharge them. An examination of the accompanying report of the A. A. C. S. will show that the supply of provisions brought over would, had the issues been limited to my command, have lasted for a longer period than that mentioned in my letter of December 26, 1860. I have not made frequent mention of the question of our rations, because the Department was kept fully informed, from time to time, of the state of our supply. Lieutenants Talbot and Hall gave full information in reference to it when they went on, and on the 27th of January a detailed statement was sent on, from which any one in the Commissary Department could have told, knowing the number of souls in the fort, including the Engineer laborers, the exact amount on hand at any given time.*
I told Mr. Eox that if I placed the command on short allowance I could make the provisions last until after the 10th of this month; but as I have received no instructions from the Department that it was desirable I should do so, it has not been done. If the governor permits me to send off the laborers we will have rations enough to last us about one week longer.

The governor of South Carolina has not sent the permission alluded to yesterday, and to-day notice has been received that no butter can be sent down and only one quarter of a box of soap.

Washington, April 3,1861.
To the Secretary of War :
Under the strongest convictions on some military questions upon which great political events seem abouf to turn, I feel impelled to state them, since they are of a nature to derive, possibly, a little weight from my official relation to them, and since, moreover, circumstances might cause my failing to make the statement in time to be considered as a grave delinquency. I refer particularly to the question of defending or abandoning Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens. '
Fort Sumter.—In addition to what I have heretofore said as to the impracticability of efficiently re-enforcing and supplying this fort, I will now say only that if the fort was filled with men and munitions it could

hold out but a short time. It would be obliged to surrender with much loss of life, for it would be bravely and obstinately defended, and the greater the crowd within the greater the proportionate loss. This issue can be averted only by sending a large army and navy to capture all the surrounding forts and batteries, and to assemble and apply these there is now no time. If we do not evacuate Fort Sumter it will be wrested from us by force.
Fort Pickens.—Were this fort provided with a garrison of eight hundred or one thousand good soldiers, fully supplied with everything necessary to the best defense, and ably commanded, its utmost term of resistance would be about three weeks—rather less than more. Were the besieging army practiced in the war of sieges, it would hardly be maintained for a fortnight. With a garrison of three hundred to five hundred men only, and in its present destitution of essential means, its siege supplies consisting of guns and ammunition merely, and these scanty and not of the best kind, the siege must be a very short one. But even the making good the deficiencies would, as stated above, only defer the issue for a week or so. In any case a quick surrender would be inevitable.
Regarding the fort independently of co-operation on one side or the other of a naval force, or of other fortifications in the harbor, these conclusions are not to be doubted, without disregarding all military experience. The occupation by the investing forces of the shore opposite, with numerous batteries pouring their showers of shot and shell into the fort, while the regular siege operations upon Santa Rosa Island were going on, would materially abridge the term of resistance. A naval force uniting in the defense, but confined to the waters outside of the harbor, might, to a certain extent, increase the casualties of the besiegers, but would not materially retard the operations. In that case the approaches would be pushed along the inshore face of the island, leaving the breadth of the island, with its sand hills and ridges, between them and the ships ; and, moreover, two or three batteries planted on the out-shore face, and sheltered from the fire of the fort by sand hills and traverses, would compel ships to keep an out-of-range offing. Could this naval force act upon the bay side of Santa Rosa Island as well as upon the sea side, the progress of a siege, if practicable at all, might be greatly retarded. Under such circumstances this kind of attack would hardly be undertaken. Were the investing forces numerous and enterprising they might, nevertheless, even then attempt a coup de main; and, provided the garrison were weak in numbers, and worn out by a protracted cannonade and bombardment from the opposite shore, the chances of success would warrant the attempt.
But I consider that the passing of vessels of war into the bay would be a very hazardous proceeding in the face of Fort McRee, Fort Barrancas, its advanced battery, and several other batteries that all accounts agree in stating have been erected and mounted along the shore, from the navy-yard inclusive to and beyond the light-house. It is possible, however, that this channel might be passed at night by swift war steamers without utter destruction, and there might be retained by one or more of them enough efficiency to prevent the hostile occupation of the lower part of Santa Rosa Island, and the prosecution there of siege operations against Fort Pickens. In such event resort would certainly be had to cannonade and bombardment from the batteries on the opposite shore, and these plied with vigor and perseverance would at last reduce the fort to a condition incapable of resisting vigorous assault, since the garrison would be exhausted, and the means of defense on the cannonaded

﻿234	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap. I.
side have little efficiency left to them. The masonry on that part of the fort is exposed to sight, and to battering from top to bottom, and is pierced besides by a gateway and numerous embrasures, greatly weakening it. Every shot fired from the other shore would strike the walls, and every shell fall within them. With a brave and well-supplied garrison there would be an obstinate holding out, no doubt, but a surrender would at last close a scene in which on our side no other military virtues had room for display but fortitude and patience. The response of the fort to shot and sheil would be by shot and shell, but with little proportionate chance of injury to the enemy’s impassive batteries of sand.
This last mode of attack could be prevented, even with the command of the inner waters only, by landing upon the main shore a military force sufficient to capture all the^e forts and batteries, including the navy-yard. Admitting the supposition (quite unreasonable as I estimate our available army force) that we can before it is too late disperse the 3,000 or 5,000 men now in hostile array there and regain these possessions, what then ? The Confederate States can assemble a large additional military force at Montgomery by railroad, and throw it down also by railroad upon Pensacola. Here there would be the struggle between the two armies—on land, and not between forts and batteries.
The question that next arises is not whether this great nation is able with time to supply ample means in soldiers and munitions for such a conflict, but whether, having expended nearly all its ready strength in reconquering the harbor fortifications and navy-yard, it could send timely and adequate re-enforcements. With our present military establishment and existing military laws I do not see how this would be possible before all that had been gained would be lost.
The seceded States, considering themselves as in a state of quasi warfare, see that if there is to be a struggle the very utmost of their military energies and resources will be called for. »They see, besides, that to contend with the greater chance of success they must profit by our present state of military weakness, and under the first glow of a great political change they rush ardently into the requisite preparations. TJpon the battle-field of Pensacola or its environs they are now stronger than we can become without the help of Congress, and they can and will augment their strength there if necessary beyond anything we can hope to do for yet many months.
The above and much like reasoning convince me that we cannot retain Fort Pickens, provided the other side is really in earnest, and follows up with like promptitude and energy their early military preparations. If we do not vacate this fort the result predicted as to Fort Sumter will certainly be realized here also—it will be taken from us by violence.
Should the above reasoning not meet acceptance, or for political reasons should it be decided to hold and defend this fort to the last, then I have to say that every soldier that can be spared should be sent to its relief with the utmost dispatch, accompanied by military supplies of every kind and in the greatest abundance.
To supply in some sort the want of a naval force within the bay as large a force as can be spared from the immediate protection of the fort should be encamped upon Santa Rosa Island at some distance from the fort, maintaining communication with it and detaching parties to watch the upper part of the island. These will give timely notice of the entrance thereupon of hostile troops, and will prevent the erection of batteries against our ships lying off shore, through which all supplies for the fort must be derived.

While the fort is uninjured many men need not remain within its walls to secure it from surprise or escalade. Of course the detached troops must he kept within reach of quick recall. Such measures may delay somewhat, though neither these nor any others now within our reach will, in my opinion, prevent the loss of Fort Pickens.
I present these thoughts to the consideration of the Secretary of War, and, if he thinks them of sufficient interest, to the perusal of the President, because they force themselves from me by the vehemence of the convictions.
Treating it purely as a professional question, I do not presume to advise as to the policy of the Government in this connection, merely presenting what seem to me to be incontrovertible facts and inevitable consequences of a military nature, that may, perhaps, be allowed to bear upon the political question.
Having no personal ambition or party feeling to lead or mislead me to conclusions, I have maturely studied the subject as a soldier bound to give all his faculties to his country, which may God preserve in peace! Eespectfullv submitted.

Hoping still that you will be able to sustain yourself till the 11th or 12th instant, the expedition will go forward; and, finding your flag flying, will attempt to provision you, and, in case the effort is resisted, will endeavor also to re-enforce you.
You will therefore hold out, if possible, till the arrival of the expedition.
It is not, however, the intention of the President to subject your command to any danger or hardship beyond what, in your judgment, would be usual in military life; and he has entire confidence that you will act as becomes a patriot and soldier, under all circumstances.
Whenever, if at all, in your judgment, to save yourself and command, a capitulation becomes a necessity, you are authorized to make it.
Respectfully,
SIM OK CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
War Department,
Washington, April 4, 1861.
Capt. G. Y. Fox, Washington, D. C.:
Sir : It having been decided to succor Fort Sumter you have been selected for this important duty. Accordingly you will take charge of the transports in New York having the troops and supplies on board to the entrance of Charleston Harbor, and endeavor, in the first instance, to deliver the subsistence. If you are opposed in this you are directed

to report the fact to the senior naval officer of the harbor, who will be instructed by the Secretary of the Navy to use his entire force to open a passage, when you will, if possible, effect an entrance and place both troops and supplies in Fort Sumter.

Washington, D. (7., April 4, 1861. Lieut. Col. Henry L. Scott, A. JD. (7., New York:
Sir : This letter will be handed to you by Capt. G. V. Fox, ex-officer of the Navy, and a gentleman of high standing, as well as possessed of extraordinary nautical ability. He is charged by high authority here with the command of an expedition, under cover of certain ships of war, whose object is to re-enforce Fort Sumter.
To embark with Captain Fox you will cause a detachment of recruits, say about two hundred, to be immediately organized at Fort Columbus, with a competent number of officers, arms, ammunition, and subsistence. A large surplus of the latter—indeed, as great as the vessels of the expedition can take—with other necessaries, will be needed for the augmented garrison of Fort Sumter.
The subsistence and other supplies should be assorted like those which were provided by you and Captain Ward of the Navy for a former expedition. Consult Captain Fox and Major Eaton on the subject, and give all necessary orders in my name to fit out the expedition, except that the hiring of vessels will be left to others.
Some fuel must be shipped. Oil, artillery implements, fuses, cordage, slow-match, mechanical levers, and gins, &c., should also be put on board.
Consult, also, if necessary, confidentially, Colonel Tompkins and Major Thornton.
Bespectfully, yours,

nab, which, erroneously mistaking the light house off this harbor for that of Tybee, and having failed to get a pilot, was entering the harbor.
The remarks made to me by Colonel Lamon, taken in connection with the tenor of newspaper articles, have induced me, as stated in previous communications, to believe that orders would soon be issued for my abandoning this work. When the firing commenced some of my heaviest guns were concealed from their view by planking, and by the time the battery was ready the firing had ceased. I then, acting in strict accordance with the spirit and wording of the orders of the War Department, as communicated to me in the letter from the Secretary of War dated February 23,1861, determined not to commence firing until I had sent to the vessel and investigated the circumstances.
The accompanying report presents them. Invested by a force so superior that a collision would, in all probability, terminate in the destruction of our force before relief could reach us, with only a few days7 provisions on hand, and with a scanty supply of ammunition, as will be seen by a reference to my letter of February 27, in hourly expectation of receiving definite instructions from the War Department, and with orders so explicit and peremptory as those I am acting under, I deeply regret that I did not feel myself at liberty to resent the insult thus offered to the flag of my beloved country.
I think that proper notification should be given to our merchant vessels of the rigid instructions under which the commanders of these batteries are acting ; that they should be notified that they must, as soon as a shot is fired ahead of them, at once round to and communicate with the batteries.
The authorities here are certainly blamable for not having constantly vessels off to communicate instructions to those seeking entrance into this harbor.
Captain Talbot is relieved, of course, by order NTo. 7, from duty at this post. I avail myself of this opportunity of stating that he has been zealous, intelligent, and active in the discharge of all his duties here, so far as his health permitted him to attempt their performance. I send him on with these dispatches, to give the department an opportunity, if deemed proper, to modify, in consequence of this unfortunate affair, any order they may have sent to me. I will delay obedience thereto until I have time to receive a telegram after Captain Talbot’s having reported to the War Department.

Commanding Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbor :
Major : In obedience to your directions, we visited Cummings Point and the schooner, bearing the United States flag, which was fired into by the batteries on Morris Island, and respectfully present the following statement concerning the affair:
The commanding officer on Morris Island,Lieut. Col. W. G.DeSaussure, stated that a schooner with the United States flag at her peak endeavored to enter the harbor this afternoon about 3 o’clock; that in accordance with his orders to prevent any vessel under that flag from entering the harbor, he had fired three shots across her bows, and this not

causing her to heave to, he had fired at her, and had driven her out of the harbor; that he thought one or two shots had taken effect, and that if he had a boat that could live to get out to her he would send and see if she were disabled, and inform Major Anderson at once, but that he had no proper boat, as the schooner was at anchor in a very rough place; that the revenue cutter had gone out to examine her condition. We ascertained the schooner to be the Rhoda H. Shannon, Joseph Marts, master, of Dorchester, N. J., bound from Boston to Savannah with a cargo of ice, having left the former place on March 26. On account of unfavorable weather, the master had obtained but one observation, and that was an imperfect one on yesterday. On his arrival off Charleston Bar, supposing himself to be off Tybee, and seeing a pilot-boat, he directed one of his men to hold the United States flag in the fore rigging as a signal for a pilot. As none came, the flag was taken down in a few minutes, and the master undertook to bring his vessel into the harbor without a pilot. He did not discover that he was not in Savannah Harbor until he had crossed the bar and had advanced some distance in the harbor. As he was passing Morris Island, displaying no flag, a shot was fired from a battery on shore across the bows of the schooner. The master states that he thought they wished him to show iiis colors, and that he displayed the United States flag at his peak. One or two shots were then fired across the schooner’s bows, but he did not know what to do or what the people on shore wished him to do; that he kept the vessel on her course until they fired at her, and one shot had gone through the mainsail, about two feet above the boom, when he put her about and stood out to sea, anchoring his vessel in the Swash Channel, just inside of the bar; that the batteries kept on firing at his vessel for some time after he had turned to go out to sea.
The master of the schooner stated that before leaving Boston, he had learned how affairs stood in Charleston Harbor, and that Fort Sumter was to be given up in a few days; that they had established a new confederacy down South.
After satisfying ourselves that the vessel was uninjured, and as she was lying in a very rough place, we advised the master to move his vessel—either to stand out to sea and go on to Savannah, or to come into the harbor and anchor.
On our return we stopped at Cummings Point, and stated the facts to Lieutenant-Colonel De Saussure. He said that the vessel would not be molested if she came into the harbor.
The schooner weighed anchor a short time after we left, and stood in towards Morris Island for some distance, but finally turned about and went to sea.
Respectfully submitted.

Lieutenant Snyder is directed to give your excellency a detail of the statement made to him yesterday by the captain of tne schooner which was fired upon by the batteries on Morris Island. I regret very much that there were no boats to warn her, or to give her instructions as to the course of conduct she would have to pursue in entering the harbor, and I regret, too, that the firing was continued after she had turned and was attempting to leave the harbor. Believing that the fortunate issue of this affair, without injury or loss of life, was providential, and still hoping that God will so direct the counsels of all in authority that we shall soon be relieved from our unpleasant position, I have the honor to remain, with sincere regard, your obedient

General Jos. G. Totten,
Chief Engineer U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General : The permit for my men* to leave did not arrive yesterday, and I have put them at work again until it does arrive.
Yesterday, at about 2 o’clock, the batteries on Morris Island commenced firing at a schooner that was entering the harbor when she was about up with the channel buoy (channel buoy No. 3, Coast Survey Chart of 1858), or about one mile from this fort.
The first shots were fired in front of her, and the subsequent ones directly at her. The schooner hoisted the American flag. After receiving a few shots she turned about to run out through the Swash Channel. After a few more shots she lowered the American flag, but stood on her course until nearly or quite out of range of the guns of the batteries, when she came to and anchored. The batteries on Morris Island continued firing at her—at least, one of them did—until she anchored. Major Anderson sent a boat with Captain Seymour and Lieutenant Snyder to ask the reasons for the firing from the commanding officer on Morris Island, and also to obtain permission to board the vessel and ascertain her condition, object of visit, &c.
The main points of the reports of these officers upon their return were, that the officer in command on Morris Island, Colonel Wilrnot He Saus-sure, acted by orders from his Government, one of which was to force a vessel to show her colors by firing across her bows, and another to fire on any vessel attempting to enter with the American flag flying.
The vessel was ascertained to be the Rhoda H. Shannon, from Boston to Savannah, loaded with ice. She was a schooner of 180 tons burden.
Her captain was an ignorant man, and, owing to thick weather and making a mistake in his reckoning, mistook this harbor for the one to which he was bound. He did not know what they wanted him to do.
None of the shots struck his vessel, and only one struck anything about the vessel, and that passed through one of his sails, about two feet above the boom.
I obtained more important information through Lieutenant Snyder of the channel batteries than I possessed before.
In the short time before this letter is to go I can only say that all the

Capt. Samuel Mercer,
Commanding U. 8. 8. Powhatan, New York:
Sir : The United States steamers Powhatan, Pawnee, Pocahontas, and Harriet Lane will compose a naval force, under your command, to be sent to the vicinity of Charleston, S. C., for the purpose of aiding in carrying out the objects of an expedition of which the War Department has charge.
The primary object of the expedition is to provision Fort Sumter, for which purpose the War Department will furnish the necessary transports. Should the authorities at Charleston permit the fort to be supplied, no further particular service will be required of the force under your command, and after being satisfied that supplies have been received at the fort, the Powhatan, Pocahontas, and Harriet Lane will return to New York, and the Pawnee to Washington.
Should the authorities at Charleston, however, refuse to permit or attempt to prevent the vessel or vessels having supplies on board from entering the harbor, or from peaceably proceeding to Fort Sumter, you will protect the transports or boats of the expedition in the object of their mission—disposing of your force in such manner as to open the way for their ingress and afford, so far as practicable, security to the men and boats, and repelling by force, if necessary, all obstructions towards provisioning the fort and re-enforcing it ; for in case of resistance to the peaceable primary object of the expedition a re-enforcement of the garrison will also be attempted. These purposes will be under the supervision of the War Department, which has charge of the expedition. The expedition has been intrusted to Capt. G. Y. Fox, with whom you will put yourself in communication, and co-operate with him to accomplish and carry into effect its object.
You will leave New York with the Powhatan in time to be off Charleston Bar, ten miles distant from and due east of the light house, on the morning of the 11th instant, there to await the arrival of the transport or transports with troops and stores. The Pawnee and Pocahontas will be ordered to join you there at the time mentioned, and also the Harriet Lane, which latter vessel has been placed under the control of this Department for this service.
On the termination of the expedition, whether it be peaceable or otherwise, the several vessels under your command will return to the

Colonel : I have the honor to report everything still and quiet, and to send herewith the report of Lieutenant Snyder, who I sent yesterday with a short note and a verbal message to the governor of South Carolina. No reply has been received to my note.
I cannot but think that Mr. Crawford has misunderstood what he has heard in Washington, as I cannot think that the Government would abandon, without instructions and without advice, a command which has tried to do all its duty to our country.
I cannot but think that if the Government decides to do nothing which can be construed into a recognition of the fact of the dissolution of the Onion, that it will, at all events, say to me that I must do the best I can, and not compel me to do an act which will leave my motives and actions liable to misconception,
I am sure that I shall not be left without instructions, even though they may be confidential. After thirty odd years of service I do not wish it to be said that I have treasonably abandoned a post and turned over to unauthorized persons public property intrusted to my charge* I am entitled to this act of just ice at the hands of my Government, and I feel confident that I shall not be disappointed. What to do with the public property, and wrhere to take my command, are questions to which answers will, I hope, be at once returned. Unless we receive supplies I shall be compelled to stay here without food, or to abandon this post very early next week.

In the interview with the governor, Captain Talbot only being present, I stated all the circumstances connected with the visits of Captain Seymour and myself to Cummings Point and the schooner Ehoda II. Shannon, which had been fired into by the batteries on Morris Island, on the 3d instant. I called his attention to the fact that he had not complied with his own proposition, to warn all vessels bearing the United States flag not to enter the harbor. The governor replied that he and General Beauregard, with their staff officers, were standing on the piazza of the Moultrie House, on Sullivan’s Island, and saw the whole affair, and 16 R R

that my statement corroborated entirely his own personal observation, although it differed slightly from the report of Colonel De Saussure, the commanding officer on Morris Island. The governor said that the commander of the vessel whose duty it was to warn vessels not to enter the harbor had left his post, and had reported that the weather was too boisterous and the sea too rough for him to go out to the schooner Shannon; that this commander had already been sent for, and would be dismissed; that the commander of the cutter would be reprimanded for not going out and examining whether the Shannon were disabled; and that peremptory orders had been sent to Morris Island to stop this random firing.
The governor also said that if Major Anderson deemed it his duty to send out, under unfavorable circumstances, and examine the condition of the schooner Shannon, it was doubly theirs, imposed by humanity, and also by the commercial interest of their harbor.
General Beauregard was invited in, and I repeated what I had said to Governor Pickens to likn. The general replied in the same terms as the governor, adding that the practice firing on Morris Island would take place at particular hours.
There was an objection made to Captain Talbot leaving Fort Sumter for Washington, but this was finally overruled and the captain allowed to depart. The governor said that orders had been received from Montgomery not to allow any man in the ranks, or any laborers, to leave Fort Sumter, and not to allow Major Anderson to obtain supplies in Charleston : that Mr. Crawford, a commissioner from the Confederate States, now in Washington, had sent a dispatch to him stating that he was authorized to say that no attempt would be made to re-enforce Fort Sumter with men or provisions, but that Mr. Lincoln would not order Major Anderson to withdraw from Fort Sumter, and would leave him to act for himself; also, advising the governor not to allow any supplies to be sent from the city to Fort Sumter.
I called the attention of both General Beauregard and Governor Pickens to the schooner lying near the left flank of Fort Sumter. They said they knew nothing of her, but would send and ascertain, and direct her to move further from the fort. Governor Pickens remarked that as they were now acting under the authority of the Confederate States he had consulted with General Beauregard, who was now in command of the troops stationed here.

Lieutenant Snyder accompanied him to the city as bearer of a communication to the governor and General Beauregard, relating to the firing upon the schooner Bhoda II. Shannon, and to the presence of the revenue cutter so near the walls of this fort. The result of this mission, so far as I understand it, is this: First, Captain Talbot, after some consultation, was permitted by the authorities to proceed to Washington. Second, it was stated that no Engineer employe or enlisted man would

be permitted to leave the fort until the command was withdrawn, in consequence of a dispatch from Commissioner Crawford, at Washington, to the effect that “ I am authorized to say that this Government will not undertake to supply Fort Sumter without notice to you [Governor Pickens]. My opinion is that the President has not the courage to execute the order agreed on in Cabinet for the evacuation of the fort, but that he intends to shift the responsibility upon Major Anderson by suffering him to be starved out”; and that no more supplies for the fort could come from the city. Third, that more stringent orders would be given to regulate the firing from the batteries and to restrict random firing, not, however, changing in the least the order to fire on any vessel attempting to force her way in after being warned off. Fourth, disclaiming any knowledge of the revenue cutter so near the walls, and expressing a determination to investigate the subject.
In returning from the city Lieutenant Snyder called for the mail at Fort Johnson, where he also took on board a small supply of beef and cabbages, which had come from the city the day before, too late for our boat. Soon after the return of the boat from town, the cutter moved her anchorage to a position about four hundred yards from the left shoulder angle. My force is now at work putting up splinter-proof traverses on the terre-plein.
My supplies of provisions that I laid in before the commencement of the investment were yesterday reduced to one half-barrel of cornmeal, one-seventh barrel of grits, and eleven codfish. Everything else that is necessary for the support of the Engineer force is drawn from the scanty stores of the command.
There appears to be no unusual activity in the surrounding batteries, owing, perhaps, to a high wind which has prevailed for three days.
I inclose a sketch of the batteries and number of guns, based upon the observations of Lieutenant Snyder. Captain Talbot can give you any detailed information that may be required.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel : I have the honor to report that everything is quiet around us. The schooner (she is a revenue cutter) reported as lying near our work still remains there. One of her officers boarded our mail-boat yesterday, and said that his orders were not to permit any boat to pass from Fort Sumter to the shore without bearing a white flag. I do not believe that General Beauregard has either placed her where she is or given her those orders, and I have written to him to-day in reference to it.
A mortar battery near Mount Pleasant is firing shells this morning. I have also called the generaFs attention to that firing, as some of the shells have burst nearer to us than is safe. The truth is that the sooner we are out of this harbor the better. Our flag runs an hourly risk of being insulted, and my hands are tied by my orders, and if that was not the case, I have not the power to protect it. God grant that neither I nor any other officer of our Army may be again placed in a position of such mortification and humiliation.

General : I have nothing new to communicate this morning connected with the batteries on Morris Island or the other batteries of which I have before written. Nothing appears to be doing except making the necessary repairs to embrasures, parapets, &c.
A mortar battery situated on the shore, a little to the east of Mount Pleasant, commenced practicing yesterday and this morning, throwing the shells very near this fort. It is situated about 13 degrees to the east of north, on a line drawn from the center of this work. This battery, with the one on Sullivan’s Islaud, the two on Morris Island, and the one on James Island, will enable the besiegers to reach every part of this work with their shells. Against these the casemates must prove the principal protection, for, with the exception of the splinter-proof traverses formed of the gun carriages, I have not enough timber or sand bags to form shell-proof shelters on the terre-plein. The revenue cutter (former buoy-tender) lies in the same position. The only supplies received yesterday were some vegetables that came from the city to Fort Johnson two days before. None came from the city. I received yester-terday General Orders Nos. 6 and 7. The mail continues to be delivered regularly.

Bear General: I deem it my duty to call your attention to the fact that some of the shells fired this morning from the mortar battery at Mount Pleasant have exploded so near this work as to render the further firing dangerous to the occupants of this fort, unless the direction of the mortar is changed. I hope, therefore, that, to guard against the possibility of such an event (one, I know, that you would never cease to regret), you will issue such orders as are proper in the case. I think it as well, too, to mention another thing which occurred yesterday and has annoyed us. You know that since January 14,1 have, in accordance with a suggestion from and an arrangement made by his excellency Governor Pickens, been sending my mails to and receiving them from Fort Jackson about 12 o’clock daily. Although I did not deem it necessary to do so, I have always had a white flag in the boat. As she is dispatched, however, in accordance with the instructions of the executive, and is (the whole distance) in view of and uncler protection of

the guns of this fort and of Fort Johnson, the case does not really require the use of that flag. Nothing has ever been said about it until yesterday, when on its return from Fort Johnson with my mail she was stopped by a row-boat from the vessel which remains anchored oft the left flank of this fort (the one about which Lieutenant Snyder spoke to his excellency and yourself, and of which you said you knew nothing), and an officer in charge told my men that his orders were not to let any boat go from Fort Sumter to the shore without a white flag and that he must raise it. I do not believe that you have given these orders, and I am unwilling that my officers shall leave here, as we hope to do in a few days, under the impression that you have either had that vessel placed so much nearer to us than any vessel has ever been anchored before or given her such orders. I have never regarded myself as being in a hos-tile attitude towards the inhabitants of South Carolina, and have been very particular in treating every one who has approached me or with whom I have had any intercourse with the greatest civility and courtesy. I hope that you will at once give your attention to both these matters, and I most earnestly hope that nothing will ever occur to alter, in the least, the high regard and esteem I have for so many years entertained for you.

In regard to the vessel lying near Fort Sumter, orders were given by me, as early as the 4th instant, for its removal to some other point, and if it lias not been done steps will be taken to have it removed forthwith.
The orders to hail boats passing to and from Fort Sumter without a white flag was not intended by me to apply to your mail-boat at 12 m., and orders will be given to the proper officers to allow it to pass as heretofore. Let me assure you,major, that nothing shall be wanting on my part to preserve the friendly relations and impressions which have existed between us for so many years.
I am, major, very truly, yours,

Colonel: I have the honor to report that the man who has charge of our mails on his return trip yesterday brought no mail, but a communication from General Beauregard, herewith inclosed. I immediately sent him back with a note to the commanding officer of Fort Johnson, requesting him to return our mail bag, which wras done.
The South Carolinians continued all day yesterday the vigorous prosecution of the works mentioned in 97 and 98, and this morning shows that the parapets and traverses have been both heightened and strengthened.
Last night the guard-boats, of which we saw eight on duty, were very vigilant guarding all the channels, and we see signal vessels very far-out beyond the bar. The garrisons of Castle Pinckney and Fort Johnson, and of the batteries on Morris Island, have been strengthened yesterday and this morning.
A detachment of about sixty horsemen was landed this morning at Cummings Point.
This morning we see another gun, the fourth, in the new battery on Sullivan’s Island. This battery will bear directly upon any boat attempting to land stores at the left flank, and will, independently of the showrer of shells which will be thrown over our fort, soon drive us from our barbette guns on both flanks. All we can do after that will be to use the guns of the lower tier. We have bread enough by using (as we have been doing for two days) but half rations to last until dinner time on Friday.
My command is in fine spirits, but I see that the long confinement, with the constant excitement, is telling on them. None of us could endure fatiguing labor for any length of time. I shall direct all the command to sleep to-night in the bomb-proof.
We are busy constructing a traverse to guard the gate from the fire of the batteries on Cummings Point, preparing sinks inside, making arrangements for a hospital for the wounded, &c., placing the ammunition in secure positions under the second tier of casemates convenient for use, &c.
We shall make every preparation for the attempted landing, and I have already had the embrasure—the only one that can be used-cut large enough to receive a barrel.

Colonel : Although not permitted to send off my daily report, I shall continue, as long as 1 can, to prepare them, so that if an opportunity is afforded me I shall have them ready. I have the honor to report that everything around us shows that these people are expecting the arrival of a hostile force, and they are making most judicious arrangements to prevent the landing of any supplies at this fort. Yesterday and this morning the garrisons of the works around us were re-enforced. Last night rockets were thrown.up from Charleston and Mount Pleasant, about 12 o’clock, and a row-boat, bearing a red light, came down from Charleston and communicated with the guard-boats, consisting, as far as we could observe, of seven steamers and four schooners, and returned to the city about four this morning.
We see the iron floating battery this morning at the west end of Sullivan’s Island, admirably placed for pouring a murderous fire upon any vessel attempting to lay alongside our left flank, and also well situated for enfilading the flanks of this work. With all our w atchfulness—and I think no garrison was ever blessed with a more vigilant set of men— none observed the bringing down of that raft. They have also commenced another battery, say about eighty yards from the west end of Sullivan’s Island.
They appear to be determined to get as powerful a fire as possible on the point designated as the one where provisions are intended to be landed, and, had they been in possession of the information contained in your letter of the 4tli instant, they could not have made better arrange-

merits than those they have made, and are making, to thwart the contemplated scheme.
The least dangerous course would he for the officer in charge of the supply vessel, after passing Cummings Point, to run to our wharf and round to, alongside the west face of it. He would thus avoid, whilst unloading, the fire from Fort Moultrie, the batteries at the west end of Sullivan’s Island, and Of the iron floating battery, only being exposed to the fire of the batteries in this end of Cummings Point and of Fort Johnson, and at low tide the vessels would be protected by the wharf from the fire from Cummings Point It would be hot work unloading her, but not so bad as at the other place. We nearly finished last night a traverse, designed to protect our right flank barbette guns from the enfilading fire of the guns on the west end of Sullivan’s Island, and we shall, God willing, strengthen that one, and complete the traverse to the left of the main entrance. The officers and men, thauk God, are in pretty good health; and, although feeling aware of the danger of their position, have greater anxiety about the fate of those whom they expect to come to their succor than they entertain for themselves.

Washington, D. C., April 12,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have the honor to report that in obedience to your instructions, dated April 6, 1861,1 left Washington on the evening of the same day in company with Mr. R. S. Chew, and arrived at Charleston, S. C., on the evening of the 8th instant. Immediately after my arrival I visited Governor Pickens, and, having informed him of the nature of my written instructions, stated that Mr. Chew had requested me to ask his ex . celleney for an interview at his earliest convenience. The governor replied that he would receive Mr. Chew at once, and shortly after I accompanied Mr. Chew to the governor’s quarters. Mr. Chew read to the governor, in my presence, a message from the President of the United States, handing him a copy of the same, which was compared by the governor. The governor stated to Mr. Chew that, South Carolina having ratified the constitution of the Confederate States, General Beauregard now had charge of military affairs in the vicinity of Charleston, and that, as General Beauregard was near at hand, he would desire to have him present at the interview'. To this Mr. Chew assented, and General Beauregard having been called into the room, the governor read and handed to him the copy of the message which he had just received.
In compliance with your verbal instructions, I asked Governor Pickens if I would be permitted to proceed to Fort Sumter for the purpose of remaining on duty at that post. The governor referred me to General Beauregard for an answer, by whom the request was peremptorily refused. I then asked if I would be x>ermitted to hold communication with Major Anderson at Fort Sumter, writh the distinct understanding that alter such interview I should immediately return to Charleston. This was also refused, General Beauregard remarking that no communication whatever would be permitted with Major Anderson, except to convey an order for the evacuation of the fort, such being the instructions received from Montgomery.

I then informed Governor Pickens and General Beauregard that I had no further official business to transact with them, and that it was the desire of Mr. Chew and myself to start North that night. Both replied that there would be no obstruction to our departure, and each of them detailed an officer of the staff to escort us to the railroad depot. We left Charleston at 11 o’clock p. m. on the 8th instant, arriving here this morning. We were detained several hours at Florence, S.

Sir : As the Convention sent for me yesterday, to be informed upon important business, I take the occasion to say that, under my order, Castle Pinckney was taken, last evening, and the United States flag hauled down and the Palmetto banner run up in its place. And I also ordered a detachment from an artillery regiment to occupy Sullivan’s Island; and if it could be done without any immediate danger from mines, or too great loss of life, to take Fort Moultrie and to run up the Palmetto flag, and put the guns in immediate preparation for defense. I have now full possession of those two forts. I considered the evacuation of Fort Moultrie, under all the circumstances, a direct violation of the distinct understanding between the authorities of the Government at Washington and those who were authorized to act on the part of the State, and bringing on a state of war.
I therefore thought it due to the safety of the State that I should take the steps I have. I hope there is no immediate danger of further aggression lor the present.

Hon. Howell Cobb,
President of the Provisional Congress:
Sir : I had the honor last night to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, in which you informed me that the Provisional Congress had taken charge of the u questions and difficulties77 now existing between the several States of the Confederacy and the Government of the United States.* In the reply made to you by telegraph I stated that I would communicate with you by letter, and added to it the expression of the urgent conviction of the authorities of the State as to the period in whieh the reduction of Fort Sumter should be complete. And, in the first place, let me offer you my warm congratulations upon the success ivhich has attended you in the organization of the Provisional Government. May it be equal to the emergency of every occasion w7hich can arise, and be to each State in this new confederation the efficient guardian of those rights, which, ignored or usurped under the former confederation, has united these States in the bonds of a new political compact.
In taking charge of the uquestions and difficulties77 which relate to Fort Sumter, it will be necessary for the Congress to apprehend rightly their present position. The force of circumstances devolved upon this
See resolution, adopted February 12, p. 254.

﻿Chap. L]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-------CONFEDERATE.	255
State an obligation to provide the measures necessary for its defense. It bas been obliged to act under the guidance of its own counsels, but lias never forgotten the interest of its sister States in every measure .which it was about to provide for its own safety. And I beg to assure you that, in all which it may at any time do, a regard for the welfare and wishes of its sister States in the new confederation will exercise a marked influence upon the conduct of this State.
The u questions and difficultiesv of Fort Sumter can scarcely be fully appreciated, unless by those who have been familiar with its progress from the commencement of its history to the present moment. If it shall appear otherwise, it has, nevertheless, been the constant, anxious desire of this State to obtain the possession of a fort which, held by the United States, affected its dignity and safety, without a collision, which would involve the loss of life. To secure this end every form of negotiation which could be adopted, in consistency with the dignity of the State, or had the promise or seeming of success, has been honestly attempted. To all of these attempts there has been but one result: A refusal in all cases, positive and unqualified, varied only as to the reasons which were set forth for its justification, has followed each demand. And now the conviction is presented to the State, derived from the most calm and deliberate consideration of the whole matter, that in this persistent refusal of the President of the United States is involved a denial of the rightful independence of the State of South Carolina.
The questions and difficulties, therefore, of Fort Sumter, comprehend now, as you w ill perceive, considerations which are political as well as military ; and it would scarcely be considered that an undue estimate was made of the former if they were said to be as important as the latter. The establishment of them, moreover, is of the utmost consequence to every State which has united with this State in the bonds of a new confederation. The State has held its right to the possession of Fort Sumter to be the direct and necessary consequence of its right, as a sovereign State, to have the control of a military post within its limits, W'hich post, during the period of the political connection of the State with the other States, was held by the United States for the protection of South Carolina because South Carolina was a part of the United States, arid being so, upon the United States was devolved the obligation to provide that defense for this State. With the termination of the political connection between South Carolina and the United States the obligation of the United States to defend that State ceased, unless that State itself was the property of the United States. If the State was an independent power the rightful control within its limits of a military post, which involved its dignity and affected its safety, was and is recognized by the plainest rules of public law. The denial, therefore, of the right of the State to have possession of the fort was, in fact, a denial of its independence. Eor has there been even a colorable pretext for a consistency of that possession by the United States with the independence of the State, since the President authorized the distinct avowal that it was held as a military post. The sole use of it as a military post is in the control (called by the President the protection) it gives to the United States of the harbor of Charleston. The assertion, then, as you will perceive, of the rightful independence of the State carries necessarily with it the right to reduce Fort Sumter into its own possession, which is held, as it is, by a hostile power, for an unfriendly purpose. It is a hostile power when it asserts a right to exercise a dominion over the State, which that State refuses to recognize as consistent with its own dignity and safety ) and its purpose cannot be otherwise than uur

## p. 256 (#272) ############################################

﻿256	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C. [Chap.L
friendly when it can only be to enable the United States to commit to its military subordinates a power to refuse “to permit any vessels to pass within range of the guns” which are within its walls. It has, therefore, been considered at once proper and necessary for this State to take possession of that fort as soon as the measures necessary for the accomplishment of that result can be completed, and it is now expected that within a short time all the arrangements will be perfected necessary for its certain and speedy reduction. With the completion of these preparations and the assurance they afford of success, it has ever been the purpose of the authorities of this State to take this fort into the possession of the State. The right to do so has been considered the right of the State, and the resources of the State have been considered equal to the exercise of that right.
Whatever may be the mode in which the Congress will take charge of these “ questions and difficulties,” I trust that it is considered that in the solution of them you will regard the position which the State of South Carolina now occupies in relation to them. That position is marked by these propositions: That the right to have possession of the fort is a right incident to the independence (she) the State has asserted; that, to obtain possession of the fort, she has exhausted all modes which, consistently with her dignity, can be devised for a peaceful settlement; that the failure of such attempts has remitted her to the necessity of employing force to obtain that which should have been yielded from considerations of justice and right, and that as soon as her preparations are completed the reduction of that fort should be accomplished.
In the absence of any explanation or direction connected with the telegram received from you, I have assumed that the policy and measures which have been adopted by this State, and which are in prosecution, will be recognized as proper. In the consideration of the question of Fort Sumter, I have not been insensible of those matters which are in their nature consequential, and have, I trust, weighed, with all the care which befits the grave responsibilities of the case, the various circumstances which determine the time when this attack should be made. With the best lights which I could procure in guiding or assisting me, I am perfectly satisfied that the welfare of the new confederation and the necessities of the State require that Fort Sumter should be reduced before the close of the present administration at Washington. If an attack is delayed until after the inauguration of the incoming President of the United States, the troops now gathered in the capital may then be employed in attempting that which, previous to that time, they could not be spared to do. They dare not leave Washington now and do that which then will be a measure too inviting to be resisted.
Mr. Lincoln cannot do more for this State than Mr. Buchanan has done. Mr. Lincoln will not concede what Mr. Buchanan has refused. Mr. Buchanan has placed his refusal upon grounds which determine his reply to six States, as completely as to the same demand if made by a single State.
If peace can be secured, it will be by the prompt use of the occasion, when the forces of the United States are withheld from our harbor. If war can be averted, it will be by making the capture of Fort Sumter a fact accomplished during the continuance of the present administration, and leaving to the incoming administration the question of an open declaration of war. Such a declaration, separated, as it will be, from any present act of hostilities during Mr. Lincoln’s administration, may become to him a matter requiring consideration. That consideration will not be expected of him, if the attack on the fort is made during his ad-

ministration, and becomes, therefore, as to him, an act of present hostility. Mr. Buchanan cannot resist, because he has not the power. Mr. Lincoln may not attack, because the cause of the quarrel will have been, or may be, considered by him as past.
Upon this line of policy I have acted, and upon the adherence to it may be found, I think, the most rational expectation of seeing that fort, which is even now a source of danger to the State, restored to the possession of the State without those consequences which I should most deeply deplore. Should such consequences, nevertheless, follow from an adherence to this policy, however much I would regret the occurrence, I should feel a perfect assurance that, in happening under such circumstances, they demonstrated conclusively that, under the evil passions which blind and mislead those who govern the United States, no human power could have averted the attempted overthrow of these States; and that, in the exhibition of an ability by the States of the new confederation to maintain their rights, there could be found satisfaction in the reflection that their sufferings at this time might purchase for them quiet and happiness in time to come.

I have the fullest confidence that you and Congress will do everything that may be due to the honor and the rights of South Carolina.
Of course we feel that our honor and safety require that Fort Sumter should be in our possession at the very earliest moment possible. We have had great difficulties to contend with. By the extraordinary move-

ment of the United States garrison from Fort Moultrie we were suddenly and unexpectedly precipitated into a situation which created the most hostile feelings, and were at the outset involved in the most scientific and expensive branches of modern warfare, where the most exact military knowledge and experience were required.
I felt this, and therefore telegraphed you to come by Charleston on your way to Mississippi, in order to consult on military matters, &c. I again sent to the governor of Georgia for General Twiggs, and then sent to you for a military engineer, as I desired the highest military approbation. Before taking the last step I earnestly wished the best military counsels.
Major Whiting is here, and thinks our energies have been too much directed to attacking Fort Sumter, and not enough to the defenses of the harbor, so as to prevent re-enforcements, &c. You will see him, and, of course, now we will await your orders and the directions of Congress, as we feel that our cause is common, and that it is due to our common government that we should do nothing to involve all the States united in a permanent war by any separate act of ours, unless it shall be necessary in self-defense or to prevent re-enforcements; but in the mean time I will go on with the same activity as ever in preparing our defenses and our men for any event that may arise.
We would desire to be informed if when thoroughly prepared to take the fort shall we do so, or shall we await your order; and shall we demand the surrender, or will that demand be made by you?
An answer to this by telegram is desired.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Your letter to President received. This Government assumes the control of military operations at Charleston, and will make demand of the fort when fully advised. An officer goes to-night to take charge.

War Department, C. S. A.,
Montgomery, March 1,1*861. His Excellency F. W. Pickens, Governor, cSee, :
Sir : Your letter of the 27th ultimo addressed to the President has been referred by him to this Department for reply.
In controlling the military operations in the harbor of Charleston the President directs me to say that everything will be done that may be due to the honor and rights of South Carolina.
The President shares the feeling exjiressed by you that Fort Sumter should be in our possession at the earliest moment possible. But this feeling, natural and just as it is admitted to be, must yield to the necessity of the case. Thorough preparation must be made before an attack is attempted, for the first blow must be successful, both for its moral and physical consequences, or otherwise the result might be disastrous to your State in the loss of many of those whom wre can least afford to spare. A failure would demoralize our people and injuriously affect us in the opinion of the world as reckless and precipitate.

Entertaining these opinions, the President directs me to say that he is engaged assiduously in pressing forward measures to effect results in which all are interested. Under the fourth section of an act of Congress to raise Provisional Forces for the Confederate States of America, and for other purposes, a copy of which I have the honor to inclose in another communication of this date, the President has appointed Peter G. T. Beauregard brigadier-general to command the Provisional Forces of this Government in the harbor of Charleston. General Beauregard will be accompanied by an adjutant, whose duty it will be to receive into the Provisional Army, with their officers, under the provisions of the act aforesaid, the forces of your State now in Charleston.
General Beauregard has the entire confidence of the President and of this Department, and I beg to commend him as possessing every soldierly quality.
I have the honor to be, with high regard, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.

Montgomery, March 1,1861.
Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard :
Sir : You will proceed without delay to Charleston and report to Governor Pickens for military duty in that State.
You are authorized by your appointment as brigadier-general, under the proyisions of the third section of an act of the Congress to raise Provisional Forces for the Confederate States, to receive into the service of this Government such forces as may be tendered or may volunteer, not to exceed five thousand men, as you may require, or for whom you can make suitable provision. A copy of the act referred to has been this day transmitted to Governor Pickens.
You will report to this Department your arrival at Charleston, and give such information with respect to the defenses of that harbor as you may consider important. You will also secure, if possible, the services of a competent adjutant, and report your action in that behalf to this Department.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General Beauregard, Commanding at Charleston:
General : The Secretary of the Treasury has directed Governor Pickens to transfer to your credit, as commanding officer at Charleston, the sum of $20,000, to meet your present necessities. Other arrangements are in progress, with every prospect of speedy success, to place to your credit such sums as you may need from time to time. If you have failed to secure the services of a competent assistant adjutant and quartermaster, let me know it without delay, as I can now supply you with these officers. As there may be some temporary dissatisfaction with the State troops at Charleston, owing to the fact that you have superseded their commanding officers, it might be proper for you, as soon as possible, to muster one or more companies at least into the

Provisional Army. This would give you an organized corps and independent action.	t
I suggest, unless in your opinion it is absolutely necessary, that you decline to receive any cavalry into the Provisional Army, as you are aware the cost of this arm of the service is very heavy, and it is more than probable that the necessities of your position at Charleston will not require this outlay.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Peter G. T. Beauregard having been appointed brigadier-general of the Confederate States of America, and having been ordered to assume command of the troops in and near Charleston Harbor, will be obeyed and respected accordingly, and all State officers of the volunteers, enlisted men, and militia, on duty, are commanded to obey all orders emanating from him.

Washington, March 4,1861.
Gov. E. W. Pickens, Charleston, S. C. :
Do not permit any attack on Sumter without authority of Government of Confederated States. This is all important. Inaugural means war. There is strong ground for belief that re-enforcements will be speedily sent. Be vigilant.
LOUIS T. WIGFALL.
I concur, and believe this Government will act promptly.
L. Q. WASHINGTON;
War Department,
Montgomery, March 4, 1861.
His Excellency the President of the Confederate States :
Sir : I have the honor to transmit herewith the estimates required for the service of the War Department for twelve months:
Schedule A* is the estimate for the support of three thousand troops—the probable number now at Charleston—to be mustered into the service of this Government, under the act of the Congress u to raise Provisional Forces for the Confederate States of America, and for other purposes.”
Schedule B# is the estimate for the support of two thousand additional troops, should the same be required at Charleston, to be mustered into the service under said act.
Schedule C* is the estimate for the Regular Army of the Confederate States, under the bill now pending before the Congress.
* The items of these schedules are not deemed of sufficient importance for publication ; their totals are as follows:
Schedule A...;............................................. $1,323,766 72
B..................:.........;............................... 860.228 45
C............................................................ 6,533/760 00

﻿[Chap. I.
262	OPERATIONS IN CHARLESTON HARBOR, S. C.
The note appended to Schedule A explains the seeming discrepancy in that estimate and Schedule 0 the estimate for the Regular Army.
No estimate has been made for any of the State forces that may be mustered into the service of this Government, under the Provisional Army bill, other than those of South Carolina.
There were no data in this Department upon which any approximate estimate could be made, as no returns have been received from any of the the States except South Carolina of the number of troops to be tendered, or that may volunteer under the-provisions of the act referred to.
It is probable that the Regular Army to be provided for cannot be organized in time to meet the possible emergencies of the service, and the only present available forces belong to the military organizations of the respective States.
As no estimate is made for any of these State troops except those of South Carolina, and as the appropriations for the Regular Army could not be used for the support of the Provisional Forces without legislation to that effect, I would suggest that this authority be conferred by the Congress.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.
Headquarters Fort Moultrie, S. C.,
March 5, 1861.
Maj. N. G. Evans, Adjutant* General, South Carolina Army:
Major : In accordance with the orders contained in your letter of this date, Major Smith’s battalion of the First South Carolina Volunteers is now embarking for Morris Island. Their departure will leave a total of 305, including 63 Vigilant Rifles, who are all required for guard at the five-gun battery. Of the 242, Company D, of the Artillery battalion, has been down but a few days, and are in constant readiness for duty in the floating battery. Their total present is 74, and deducting them, I have but 171 total, to man 15 guns on the channel, requiring 75; 11 guns on the Sumter battery, 55; 4 guns on the oblique battery, 20, and 40 men for the mortar battery, requiring 190 at least, to say nothing of guard duty at the fort, which, of course, must be attended to. In addition to this, the absence of a force of some efficiency entails upon this command the necessity of keeping up the guard at the eastern end of the island and at the steamboat landing ; and, in addition, I have set my men at work on the fortifications, to complete traverses, &c. I respectfully represent that in my opinion an efficient force for support to the batteries on this island is absolutely necessary, and that the artillery should be kept to the duties of their batteries alone. Again, the principal quartermaster’s duty on this island now falls on the battalion quartermaster of the artillery, who is now commanding a company, and cannot be spared. I respectfully represent that when a command is sent it should have its own quartermaster and staff.
In order to prepare as quickly and as fully as possible for contingencies, I have the honor to request that I may have permission to select from recruits (now in the various depots) a sufficient number to fill Companies A; B, and D, of the artillery battalion, to the maximum strength allowed by law, viz, ohe hundred privates to a company. I request the permission to select, because there are many newly-en-

listed recruits, who would have to be rejected, and of the enlisted men the artillery will be more specially required. Any failure in that branch of the service, I fear, may result in disaster. In this estimate above I do not include the infantry recruits, now on this island, who, I do not think, will be efficient for some weeks.
I have the honor to request, in conclusion, that you will bring this letter as soon as possible to the consideration of the brigadier-general commanding.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. S. EIPLEY,
Lieutenant-Colonel, Artillery, Commanding.
Washington City, March 5,1861,
General L. Pope Walker,
Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.;
Dear Sir: Judge Clay asked me before he left here to telegraph and write to Governor Moore any matters of importance. This was before the formation of the Provisional Government at Montgomery. Nothing has occurred since that request to justify a special dispatch, and now it appears to me that if there should be movements of troops or ships which come to my knowledge it would be better to send them to you. I shall do so on learning anything of importance in a reliable way. I may send the dispatch in a letter to Eichmond to be telegraphed from there, or I may send it from here, as circumstances dictate.
The inaugural undoubtedly means war, and that right off. I have never doubted as to Lincoln’s views, and nothing would have changed them but the secession of the border States, who have not acted.
Mr. Crawford is here, and will proceed to execute the duties of his mission as soon as the new Secretary of State is installed. This will be, I suppose, to-morrow morning at furthest.
I was present last evening at a consultation of Southern gentlemen, at which Messrs. Crawford, Garnett, Pryor, De Jarnette, of Virginia, and Wigfall, of Texas, were present. We all put the same construction on the inaugural, which we carefully went over together. We agreed that it was Lincoln’s purpose at once to attempt the collection of the revenue, to re-enforce and hold Fort Sumter and Pickens, and to retake the other places. He is a man of will and firmness. His Cabinet will yield to him with alacrity, I think. Seward has, of course, agreed to the inaugural, and the pretenses of his conservatism are idle.
We believe that these plans will be put into execution immediately. I learn five or six United States ships are in New York Harbor, all ready to start. The United States steamer Pawnee came here the other day suddenly from Philadelphia, fully provisioned and ready to go to sea.
I understand that it is spoken of in Army circles to re-enforce Sumter by sending in men in whale-boats by night. This will probably be attempted in the first instance. After the garrison is re-enforced sufficiently to stand an assault, then the attempt may be made to fight the way up by five or six war vessels. Simultaneously or prior to this will be the change of programme at Pensacola by the United States, Pensacola being a point of infinitely more importance. Considering this and the evident purpose announced in the inaugural, would it not be expedient to prevent anything in the shape of dispatches, letters, or messengers from going to Slemmer or the other United States officers or men

at Pensacola? By this you will have the advantage of knowing the movements from this point before the Government officers at Pensacola.
We shall endeavor to get bold of movements as soon as possible, and to advise you. Of course we labor under great difficulties in procuring early intelligence.
There is a general concurrence in the opinion that if any attack is made on Sumter it should be by order of the Government of the Confederate States and not by South Carolina alone.
Yery truly yours,
L. Q. WASHINGTON.
Will you please show this letter to the Hon. Mr. Perkins, Secretary of the Navy?
I fear the present Virginia Convention will not pass an ordinance of secession unless a collision or war ensues; then public feeling will force them to it. There is a majority of old Federal submissionists, who got in by pretending to be resistance men.

Commanding Fort Moultrie, 8. C.:
Colonel: The general commanding desires that you send immediately to the five-gun battery, commanding Maffitt’s Channel, two 32-pounders,, with the necessary ammunition, as ordered yesterday, and have them mounted. Be on the lookout to-night for the Crusader, a four-gun brig, reported to be on her way with one hundred and twenty men for the re-enforcement of Fort Sumter.

Capt. S. W. Ferguson, Aide-de- Camp, Charleston 8. C.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication (private and confidential) of this date. In reply, I have to state that I have no means at my disposal to send the 32-pounders from this post to the five-gun battery this evening, nor have I a gin to dismount or mount them. Moreover, I have not a single artificer to send to that battery, to build the traverses or pintle centers, some 290 indifferent artillerymen (71 of the 290 held in readiness for special service), 53 volunteers at the five-gun battery, and 318 helpless infantry recruits, almost without arms, without clothing, and totally and entirely unfit to meet the euemy, constituting all of my command. I will send the guns as soon as I can have the pintle centers and traverse circles in position 5 but, I imagine, the engineer in charge of the works is without the means to do the work required. Should the Crusader, however, come in this direction to-night, I beg to suggest, if the guard-boats do their duty, that I can attend to her case with the force at my disposal, although inefficient at this post.	#

I had the honor to send a communication, concerning the state of this command, last evening to Major Evans, adjutant-general, to which I beg now to refer.
To day, for lack of laborers, the men have been employed on the defenses, and I beg to say that the more drilling and the less of labor they do for some time to come the more efficient they will probably be.

Charleston, March 6,1861.
President Davis, Montgomery:
My Dear Sir : I inclose you, according to promise, a statement showing the strength of the volunteer division of South Carolina. Some of the regiments are commanded by highly accomplished graduates of our military academies, and some by officers of the Palmetto Regiment. It is altogether a superb body of troops, and I think will give a good account of themselves by their acts.
Under the skillful conduct of General Beauregard the works here are likely to be put promptly in the best possible condition to prevent re-enforcements. The danger to be feared is that light-draught vessels, barges, or boats in the night may be sent in through the two middle channels, known as the Overall and North Channels; but you doubtless get fuller information than I can give you on these points.
Mr. Miles has doubtless apprised you of my readiness to enter the service of the confederation in the capacity you indicated. I say to you, however, frankly, that I should like to see my brigadiers in the held with their commands, or so many as maybe needed, and be there myself with my present rank. If raising General Beauregard’s rank a grade does not embarrass you, I would cheerfully report to him. The exhibition of skill, promptness, and energy by General Beauregard is highly gratifying to the authorities here.
I am, very sincerely and truly, yours,

Brig. Gen. G. T. Beauregard,
Commanding Charleston and vicinity :
General : I would respectfully call your attention to the following points in connection with the Ordnance Department in this vicinity:
I find no props under the center rail of the chassis, or elsewhere. Unless these props are supplied the guns are liable at any moment to dismount themselves. The chassis of the carriages at the iron battery at Cummings Point have not sufficient inclination, and unless the guns are secured by rope or other tackle they will probably soon dismount themselves. I have ordered all the necessary barbette carriages to be made, and as soon as possible spare parts of all kinds should be made, especially for the old carriages. I find only mortar shell at Fort Morris, and those I examined at the iron battery were case-shot—not even mortar shell. There is a scarcity of proper fuse-plugs and fuses. The small number of fuses at Fort Moultrie is being multiplied by cutting them in parts. I fear this may not only defeat the object intended but render the fuses of very little use at all. The magazine at Fort Morris, if possible, should be overhauled and rearranged. Hot-shot furnaces, or even stoves, should be supplied at Morris Island batteries.
I remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The affair of selections has been referred to General Dunovant. I am fully aware of the difficulties of your position, but from your zeal and known ability to surmount obstacles I have no doubt you will give a good account of yourself and command when the hour of trial shall have arrived. I regret (in the movement of troops lately taken place) you had to be deprived of the command on Sullivan’s Island, for which position I know you are highly qualified, but the necessities of the service required the order to be given. Whenever practicable a different arrangement will be made.

Major : The general commanding desires that the embrasure enfilading battery, and the mortar battery beyond Moultrie, be constructed first, unless you have already commenced the one across the bay, in which case you will continue the latter to completion, and, instead of adding those two 32-pounders from Moultrie to the five-gun battery, as ordered, he intends to add them to the first-named mortar battery, with a strong traverse between them and the mortars. They must also have strong flank traverses.
Major Trapier will please caution Capt. S. Y. Tupper, of the five-gun battery, that the traverses and pintles being on a wrong level at that battery, the chassis must be propped up in their middle when the gun is fired to prevent its breaking, the slope being too steep.

March 7, 1861.
Brigadier-General Dunoyant :
General : I have the honor to inform you that in the firing at this post yesterday, the 18-pounder guns, which are the largest at this post, were found entirely insufficient to command the Stono Channel of this entrance. At an elevation of five degrees the balls failed to reach the Stono Channel. I take occasion, therefore, again to call this matter to your attention, and to request that two 32-pounders, or, at all events, two 24-pounders, be ordered to this post. In a conversation with Colonel Manigault, of the board of ordnance, on Friday last, March 1, I was led to believe that two 24-pounders would be sent to this post in a few days ; but they have not yet been received. Except our field guns, we have here but two 18-pounders.
In the present uncertain aspect of affairs, when any point seems subject to assault, I would suggest, for your consideration, the remoteness of the troops here from effective assistance, and the smallness of the force under my command. If the fortification had been brought to a comparative state of completion, we could hold it against large odds. The planters of John’s Island, who volunteered to complete it, as I was informed, left it not half finished, and the troops have bestowed much labor upon it, to bring it to a defensible condition. I therefore again call your attention to the smallness of the force here (considering the unfinished state of the fortification), to the difficulty of timely succor, and to the impracticability of a retreat, surrounded, as we are, by rivers, and without transports being furnished us, if retreat should become necessary.
I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

Sir: In compliance with the order of yesterday, I left a detachment of forty-seven men, of the Begiment of Bifles, at Secessionville, to keep open communication with Morris Island. I would respectfully request that they be ordered to join the regiment again. They will be of little or no service for this purpose. Five ordinary employes of the quartermaster’s department would answer the end quite as well. Furthermore, Secessionville is not the proper point for the mere purpose of communication. The point should be Clark’s Landing, and the route from Hill’s Landing direct, thus avoiding a long detour. There is yet another

reason. Every post should keep open its own communication. They will feel far more interest in the work than the members of another regiment, who are to have no share in the honors of the contest. If your excellency agrees with me, I would suggest that orders to that eifect be issued immediately, so that they can make use of the means of transportation now engaged in transferring the commissary stores.

Brigadier-General Beauregard,
Commanding Army Confederate States of America:
General : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letters of yesterday’s date, and thank you for the confidence you express. Did I not, however, make known my deficiencies, I should mislead the officer in command, and possibly entail disaster, from not having such as can be supplied. With regard to the command on Sullivan’s Island, I am very glad to be relieved from the details of it, as it enables me to give my attention to what I have no doubt is considered as of the first importance—the preparation of the artillery service. I beg to take the liberty of suggesting the importance, in my opinion, of the first turn in the beach of this island, east of this fort, as a position for a channel battery, rather than the position now occupied by the five-gun battery. From that point the guns can command every channel, and especially the north and south channels, where the vessels having re-enforcements are bound to come in, as things at present stand. Now those channels are only protected by this fort. If labor can be obtained and the work commenced, I would respectfully recommend the removal of four guns from the five-gun battery, leaving one, which can be so arranged as to traverse completely around and make the addition formerly proposed from this fort, or even more, in addition to the mortars which are to be placed there. The Maffitt Channel would be completely blocked and the new battery would materially add to the defenses of the channels mentioned above.

This morning I learned that a steamer, the Chesterfield, was at the south point of the island, with the four guns, and with a framed stable, to be used for the horses of the battery of field artillery.

the stable at an intermediate point, where I propose to pitch my camp. Not being certain that it would be practicable to land the 12-pounders and the stable on the beach, I gave verbal orders, leaving it to the discretion of Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton to have them brought round the north point of the island, in order to be conveyed by the creek, on the west side of the island.
My quartermaster has just reported to me that the master of the steamer (Flynn, I think, is his name), in disobedience of my orders, and alleging orders to himself to land everything at the south point (but showing no written order to that effect), is proceeding to put out, not only the 24-pounders and the 12-pounders, but the timber of the stable, at the south point. This will be exeedingly inconvenient, as it will be an immense labor to haul all the material of the stable through the heavy sand this side of the south point. I have sent down Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton, with orders to arrest and confine the master of the steamer, put the next officer in command of the boat, and bring back the stable, together with the 12-pounders, to the north point of the island, whence they can be conveyed (in a smaller vessel) through the back creek. I am not sure, however, that this will be in time to remedy the inconvenience, as the landing of the material may be completed before Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton gets to the point. I respectfully suggest the necessity of putting the commanders of steamers in the service of the quartermaster-general under better control. Repeated instances of misconduct, negligence, and disobedience have come within my observation.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
MAXCY GREGG,
Col. First Regiment 8. C. Vols.j Commander on Morris Island.
P. S.—Since writing the above letter, which was too late for this morning’s boat, Captain Flynn, of the Chesterfield, being brought to my quarters, under guard, and having promised to carry the stable and the two 12-pounders to the north point of the island, has been released from arrest and sent back to the command of his boat. If Daly, the master of the little steam-flat, obeys the orders given to him by Colonel Hatch, and comes to Cummings Point this afternoon, I shall be able to send the lumber and guns up the back creek by his boat. But his previous conduct leaves me in entire uncertainty whether to expect him.

State of South Carolina, Engineer Bureau, Charleston, S. (7., March 8, 1861. Maj. Gen. S. R. Gist, Adjutant and Inspector General:
General: Owing to very pressing engagements, as also owing to daily reports not having been sent in regularly by the engineers in charge of the several works under construction in the harbor of Charleston, my daily reports have been interrupted for the past three or four days.
I have now to report that the reconstruction of the mortar battery on the beach at Fort Johnson is very nearly completed. It is designed to move two mortars from this battery and place them where I commenced a battery, for the removal of the four mortars from the beach battery. The battery and magazine for these mortars will be completed in a few days. On Morris Island all the guns and mortars which have been sent over have been mounted and placed.
The following postscript, attached to an order of the 7th instant, from the commanding general, will show, to some extent, future operations on Morris Island, viz:
At Cummings Point on Morris Island he wishes all work stopped at present, except at the iron battery (finishing the work he ordered there) and at the condemned mortar battery (which he ordered to be changed into a bomb-proof). The balance of the working force will immediately (under charge of Colonel Lamar, who has command of the working parties) be put to work constructing those channel batteries he ordered Major Whiting to mark out, so as to have them completed as soon as practicable.
Twenty-eight laborers (all that could be procured) worked yesterday on a battery for four 24-pounders, near the steamboat landing, at the point of Sullivan’s Island, ordered by the commanding general, for enfilading the guns en barbette on Fort Sumter.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : The Department letter of the 2d instant has been received, but could not be answered sooner. Governor Pickens, who obligingly affords me all the assistance in his power, as well as all his officers, suggests that the State of South Carolina should continue to defray all the present current expenses incurred within its limits, so as not to comfdicate the present moneyed difficulties of the Confederate States Government. This would probably be a very proper arrangement.
With regard to the supposed temporary dissatisfaction of the State troops, alluded to by you, upon consultation with the governor, he advises that the brigade of State Regulars should remain as at present organized, until required to enter the Federal service, but in the mean time to be under my orders. Its commanding general and staff* have readily assented to this arrangement, and by the order of the governor (already communicated to the War Department), it must have been seen that all the troops (State, Regulars, and Volunteers) in or about Charleston have already been put under my orders, and I can perceive among them no spirit of opposition or dissatisfaction. On the contrary,

they appear to be animated with the most kindly feelings towards me, and seem highly pleased at the order assigning me to their command.
I have already given the information here that cavalry would not, at present, be called into the service of the Confederate States.
Everyone here seems to be gradually becoming aware, through my cautious representations, that we are not yet prepared for the contest, and that the first work in order is to endeavor to keep re-enforcements from getting into Fort Sumter by increasing our channel defenses, which I hope to be able to accomplish in about a w~eek or ten days. In the mean time I will go on organizing everything around me.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. T. BEAUREGARD, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
War Department, C. S. A.,
Montgomery, March 9,1861. Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, Charleston:
General : Your report of the 6th instant has been received at this Department. What you have done and what you propose to do is approved. Push forward your contemplated works with all possible expedition, especially with the view to prevent the re-enforcement of Fort Sumter. This must be prevented at all hazards, and by the use of every conceivable agency. Fort Sumter is silent now only because of the weakness of the garrison. Should re-enforcements get in, her guns would open fire upon you.
There is information at this Department—not official, it is true, but believed to be reliable—that five or six United States ships are in New York Harbor all ready to start.
The United States steamer Pawnee has left Philadelphia suddenly for Washington, fully provisioned and ready to go to sea, and it is probable that the effort to re-enforce Sumter may be made by sending in men in whale-boats to-night. Should this plan succeed and the garrison be re-enforced sufficiently to stand an assault the attempt may be made to fight their way up by five or six war vessels.
In his report to this Department Major Whiting suggested the possibility of re-enforcements by land. Upon examining the map it occurs to me that this possibility might be accomplished in two ways: First, at the south of Morris Island there is an inlet which connects with Schooner Creek, and affords a water communication in the rear of all our works directly up to Fort Sumter. The creeks are, however, very winding, and probably if taken in hand at once could easily be obstructed by sinking flats or boats. Second, Stono River affords, I should think, an entrance to vessels of from eight to twelve feet draught, which may land troops on James Island, or go through a cut known as James Island Cut. Neither method, I take it, would be practicable if any troops were on James Island 5 but in the absence of them a sudden rush might possibly avail.
These suggestions are made without special knowledge, and are submitted for your consideration.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.

Sir : I inclose you herewith the report of Col. M. Gregg, First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers, commanding on Morris Island, at the entrance of this harbor, reporting the circumstances connected with the accidental shooting of a loaded gun towards Fort Sumter on the 8th instant. From the inquiries thus far made, it would appear to have been entirely accidental; but I have ordered a thorough investigation of the affair to be made at once, and in order to prevent the recurrence of an event which might be attended with such disastrous consequences, I have ordered that hereafter no gun should be practiced with without first ascertaining whether it be loaded or not.

[Chap. I.
Hdqrs. Provisional Army Confederate States, Charleston, S. 0., March 11,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.;
Sir : I have taken the earliest opportunity my present duties would permit (yesterday) to make a thorough reconnaissance of the country south of this city to the Stono River and its mouth, to determine what works are required to prevent an enemy from approaching in that direction, either to throw re-enforcements during the night into Fort Sumter, through the Stono River, Folly River, or Light-house Inlet, and their numerous and intricate branches (see Bache’s maps of Charleston Harbor and adjacent coast and country), or to attack Charleston. I have selected the sites and ordered the construction of some field works that will, I think, effectually guard those channels of approach; but we must have time and means to complete them. With good assistants (chiefs of Engineers and Ordnance) this could probably be done in about eight or ten days; but Major Whiting and Captain Boggs (two most reliable an efficient officers) have been recalled to Savannah by the governor of Georgia, and I am again left to my own resources. Their absence fills me with care and grief, for other very important matters demand my attention; in fact, a great deal in the way of organization remains still to be attended to. I find a great deal of zeal and energy around me, but little professional knowledge and experience. I earnestly request the immediate return of the two officers just named, or that two others, of equal ability, if they can be procured, be sent me. Probably Capt. G. W. Smith, of Eew York, and Captain Gorgas might be induced to come, if a positive rank could be offered to them. Should an enemy succeed in effecting a landing on the Stono River (a very navigable stream), or anywhere else in that direction, I will take a position with all my disposable forces in a very advantageous location I have selected, a little in advance of the Savannah road bridge, leading into Charleston, covering, at the same time, the bridge with a tete-de-pont. From thence I will oppose to the last his direct attack, or take him in flank and rear, to cut oft* his communication, if practicable.
With regard to my letter of the 12th, referring to my present commission in the Confederate service, I desire to state that should my application to be appointed in the Regular service, instead of the Provisional one, occasion any embarrassment to the President, I desire it to remain unnoticed; and, moreover, should he at any time consider it necessary for the good of the service or safety of the country to send here an officer of more experience than myself, I hope he will do so without hesitation, as I care more for the success of our arms and of our cause than for the honor of being in command here, and I would serve under the orders of such a commanding officer with the same zeal and activity as at present.
I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hon. L. P. Walker Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the three telegrams of the 13th and 14th instants.* I telegraphed an answer to-day.
Major Whiting has this day reported for duty. Captain Northrop informed me a few days ago that he had informed you he could not at present accept the commission offered him. I would at present have no need of him. I have ordered the Drummond-light oiterator to be here forthwith, for his services will be required as soon as the apparatus arrives. After instructing two or three persons here he might be sent to New Orleans.
By the orders transmitted to-day it will be seen that I am straining every nerve to be ready to meet successfully any re-enforcements that may be intended for Fort Sumter. I believe in a very few days I will be ready at all points. I have made a thorough reconnaissance of all the coast approaches to Charleston, and, with a little time, see not much difficulty in preventing an enemy from using them with any prospect of success. I have succeeded in obtaining, for about ten days, the services of a competent ex-officer of the Ordnance, who is on a visit here—Lieut. Charles C. Lee, now professor in a military school of North Carolina. I hope, with his assistance, to be able to put the ordnance at this place in a better condition than it is at present. Captain Boggs, during the very few days he spent here, had already done a great deal towards that very desirable end. I found so much opposition here to the employment of Capt. J. P. Jones, Lieutenants Williams, O’Brien, and Robertson, as company officers in any of the regiments here, that I put the first two on ordnance duty, as receivers of ordnance, &c., at the batteries, and the other two as assistant engineers. Lieutenant Williams has been quite sick since his arrival Jiere; the others appear to be very zealous and energetic. As to Captain Jones, I cannot yet speak of him with much certainty ; but although regretting not to be in command of his company, I

My Dear Sir : By the authority of the Secretary of War, I have established a recruiting station here, and I am induced to believe that it will meet with decided success. By the time an officer can reach here there will probably be one hundred recruits to examine. The moneyed arrangements are all made. I have concluded that it would be better not to send the men to Charleston until they were examined. We will then avoid the danger of having to pay the passage money for men not fit for service. I was merely requested and authorized to recruit here for the Army of the Confederate States. I have made arrangements for sending them to you, supposing that you would have use for them, or, if not, that you could have them enlisted and drilled till they were ordered elsewhere. Be pleased to confer with the Secretary of War on the subject if you have no orders. The recruiting will go on rapidly, and as I determined this morning not to send men before they were examined, I telegraphed you for an experienced officer. The men will be kept together until he comes. If this shall reach you before you have sent an officer, be pleased to refer him to William T. Walters, of the house of Walters & Co., 68 Exchange Place, with whom I have made the financial arrangements.

A person will be sent from this place to-night to perform that duty, with instructions to report to you if in Baltimore, and in your absence to William T. Walters, 68 Exchange Place, Baltimore. It will be much cheaper to ship the men as steerage passengers than by rail, and he will be so instructed unless you have special reasons for a contrary course.
Although it would be most agreeable to all of us to have you here, it occurs to me that you could render more efficient service by remaining in Baltimore until our recruiting depot is fully and successfully established as an institution.

Sir : The probability is, if there be any reliance on rumors semi-official in their character, that Port Sumter will be shortly abandoned. Of course, it would be proper to afford Major Anderson and his men a safe conduct out of the harbor; but before this is done you must feel perfectly assured that there are no mines laid with trains within the fort. This might be individually accomplished by informing Major Anderson that you intended immediately on its abandonment by him to occupy it, and to take possession of everything left behind ; that you did not desire to do this, except upon an inventory to be made out by yourself and one of his officers, and the proper officer to be detailed by him to perform this duty would be Foster, the Engineer.
Should he reply to this proposition that he cannot consider what course you may pursue after his abandonment of the fort, and therefore decline to assist in the inventory, it will be your duty to communicate to him the existence of the rumor, and to demand from him such assurance of its falsity as shall fully satisfy you. If he declines to give this assurance it will be your duty to prevent their departure. It is hardly probable that he will decline either of these propositions, but should he decline both you must pursue the course herein indicated, and keep him where he is.

General Beauregard :
My Dear General : I have read the papers and your note to Major Anderson. As to the inventory suggested, of all public property, would it not be well to wait his propositions first ? Because, if we propose an inventory, it will imply that our Government is to be responsible for the amount in any future settlement, whereas, considering that the United States forces inaugurated a state of hostilities, approaching a state of war (by the removal from Moultrie, by leaving the carriages, spiking the guns, and cutting down the flagstaff, and left the fort in actual flames, which would have reached the magazine if I had not taken possession and stopped the progress), then the attempt to throw re-enforcements in and the whole course of the Government and command here, has forfeited all claim for future accountability for armament and public property in this fort now 5 besides, the expenses they have forced us to, in order to ward off fhe conquest and subjugation intended by their occupation of Sumter, all cancel the obligation to account. If Anderson should offer or desire to have an inventory, then I will agree to it with pleasure, or any reasonable request, so as to get them out without difficulty. But I would, when they retire, sign the inventory with a protest against the Government being finally responsible, unless it might be expedient to do so in a full settlement. I have no idea that Anderson has as yet any authority to agree to your propositions in any shape, because I do not think the Government has yet empowered him. I merely throw out these suggestions for the present, and have no objections to your sending a letter somewhat like yours, if you think the time has now arrived.

Sixty-four recruits arrived here from Baltimore, under the charge of Mr. E. E. Haslett, on Saturday, the 23d instant, and were sent to Castle Pinckney. They will be enlisted to-day. Captain Childs and Lieutenants O’Brien and Eobertson have been assigned to duty with them. The quartermaster-general of the State of South Carolina has kindly offered to furnish them with the necessary rations, clothing, &c., to be settled for hereafter. It would, perhaps, be economical to prescribe the uniform for the Eegular Army as early as practicable. Mr. Haslett informs me that a bounty was promised these men, but does not know the amount—thinks about $25 or $30. I have, therefore, to request that you notify me what amount will be paid, and under what regulations, that I may cause the same to be noted on their muster and pay rolls. I am just informed that Lamon, special messenger from Washington, has arrived, and is now conferring with the governor.

Sir : The Department letter of the 21st has been received, and I inclose you herewith the copy of the letter I have thought proper to address to Maj. Robert Anderson, with whom I am personally well acquainted, t His answer will be communicated to the Department as soon as received, and I have no doubt it will be satisfactory. Mr. Lamon left here last night, saying that Major Anderson and command would soon be withdrawn from Fort Sumter in a satisfactory manner. I am, however, progressing with my offensive and defensive batteries, which will all be finished and armed to-morrow night or the day after. I find great difficulty, for want of an ordnance officer, in properly organizing the armament, &c., of said batteries. I have this day had assigned to me for that duty Lieutenant Rutledge, South Carolina Navy, who I hope will be of assistance to me in that department.
As already telegraphed, Capt. W. H. Stevens, of the Engineers, is not at present required here. He might be usefully employed at Savannah if not wanted elsewhere, or I may soon have need of him for the defenses of the sea coast of South Carolina, which I may have to order hereafter.
Four of the Drummond lights ordered for this harbor have this day arrived, with the required instructions, a copy of which is herewith inclosed. No operator could be sent with them. I have procured the welcome and generous services of Professor Gibbes, of Charleston College, for the purpose of instructing a proper person here in their use. I have no doubt that Professor Riddle, of New Orleans, postmaster, would be happy to give his assistance in a like manner for the six sent there, two of which might be sent to Pensacola or some other harbor. With tour here we shall have enough now.

pledge that might be required of him, for he is, in my opinion, a most gallant officer, incapable of any act that might tarnish his reputation as a soldier; and, should he ask for any assistance of Governor Pickens or myself for the removal of his command from this harbor, it will be a sufficient guarantee that Fort Sumter will be left in its present condition. At any rate, when he makes the said application, an officer will be appointed by me to verify the fact and make proper arrangements with him.

Brig. Gen. G. T. Beauregard,
Commanding Charleston Harbor, Charleston, S. C.:
Sir : The Government has at no time placed any reliance on assurances by the Government at Washington in respect to the evacuation of Fort Sumter, or entertained any confidence in the disposition of the latter to make any concession or yield any point to which it is not driven by absolute necessity, and I desire that you will govern yourself generally with strict reference to this as the key to the policy of the Government of the Confederate States.
You are specially instructed to remit in no degree your efforts to prevent the re-enforcement of Fort Sumter, and to keep yourself in a state of the amplest preparation and most perfect readiness to repel invasion, acting in all respects—save only in commencing an assault or attack, except to repel an invading or re-enforcing force—precisely as if you were in the presence of an enemy contemplating to surprise you.
The delays and apparent vacillations of the Washington Government make it imperative that the further concession of courtesies such as have been accorded to Major Anderson and his command, in supplies from the city, must cease; and, in general terms, the status which you must at once re-establish and rigidly enforce is that of hostile forces in the presence of each other, and who may at any moment be in actual conflictj but as past conditions have allowed this Government to continue thus far courtesies of personal convenience to Major Anderson and his officers, it is proper now, as these courtesies are required to be determined by the necessities of your position, that you signify in respectful terms to Major Anderson that all communication with the city from the fort and with the fort from the city, for any purpose of supply is absolutely inhibited; and after having so notified that gentleman at the very earliest moment practicable you will make your surveillance of the harbor and the enforcement of the rule of instruction indicated in the notice to the commander of Fort Sumter as rigid as all the means at your command and the most watchful vigilance can secure.
Until the withdrawal of the Commissioners of this Government from Washington—an event which may occur at any moment—no operations beyond what is indicated in the foregoing would be admissible. Promptly, however, on the receipt by this Government of the intelligence of such withdrawal the Department will transmit to you specific instructions for your guidance.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER, Secretary of War.

Sir: Your letter of the 4th instant has been received. In reply to your inquiry as to Major Anderson7s mails, I have to say that the policy of the Government is most decided that there shall be such a surveillance of Charleston Harbor and of Fort Sumter as shall assure this Government that the latter is, for all military purposes, entirely isolated. The courtesies which have been accorded to the commander of that fortress have been, in the opinion of this Department, taken advantage of in some cases by persons whose object in visiting Fort Sumter was chiefly to obtain information of the state of our defenses, to be communicated to the Government at Washington. Acting, then, on the leading ideas that the military isolation of Fort Sumter and the prevention of all possible espionage by the Washington Government are absolutely required, you are directed, while allowing Major Anderson to receive his mails, to exercise such instructive discretion as will secure the ends in view.
Minute instructions, covering every possible case, cannot, of course, be given you, but you are directed to exclude possibility of the admission of any one who may be sent by or be favorable to the Government at Washington, always excepting such messenger or bearer of dispatches from that Government as you may be fully assured shall be conveying orders for the surrender or evacuation of the fortress.
You are specifically instructed to permit no one of the persons now in Fort Sumter to depart therefrom; and to secure absolute compliance with this requirement you will use the utmost vigilance and apply all the means at your command. And in this connection the Department would ask your attention to a telegraphic statement‘generally published under date of “April 4th,77 to the effect that Lieutenant Talbot, an officer of the garrison of Fort Sumter, had been allowed to depart therefrom. As this is in apparent conflict with the instructions communicated to you by telegraph, the Department presumes that there were special reasons, affecting the public interest, which, in your judgment, made the case properly exceptional, and I shall therefore be pleased to be made acquainted with the circumstances.

Sir : The War Department letter of the 6th instant has been received. I send herewith a copy of the letter addressed yesterday to Major Eobert Anderson, stopping his provisions from this city, in obedience to the instructions of the Department.* He has not yet answered it, probably on account of the prevailing bad weather, or perhaps he wishes to await the orders of the United States Government.
Lieutenant Talbot was allowed to go to Washington in order to diminish as much as practicable the number of Major Anderson’s officers, and in the hope that he would communicate to the Government at Washington their true condition in Fort Sumter, which Governor Pickens and myself have reasons to believe is not satisfactory to them.
On account of the unfortunate publication this morning of the proceedings of the State Convention of South Carolina, containing a detailed report of the State secretary of war, giving the exact condition, strength, and number of batteries and troops collected for the defense of this harbor, I have called out the balance of the five thousand men to which I have been limited by my instructions of the 1st ultimo-—a measure rendered still more necessary on account of the warlike preparations at present being made by the United , States Government with so much mystery.

To meet this condition of affairs, this Department, acting with reference to the power vested in the Executive by the act of the Congress entitled uAn act to provide for the public defense,” suggests to your excellency the necessity of calling at once for three thousand volunteers, to be drilled, equipped, and held in instant readiness to meet any requisition from this Department. These troops will, of course, not be receiving pay until they shall be mustered into service, but the emergency is so pressing that your excellency will fully appreciate the great importance of thorough preparation, especially in regard to instant capacity to move.

If possible you will please make this arrangement, or else select some other competent officer of the army of the Confederate States for the same purpose.

State of South Carolina,
Headquarters, April 9, 1861. To the President of the Confederate States:
My Dear Sir : I send by the bearer important dispatches to the Secretary of War, and beg to call yonr immediate attention to them. The bearer is Colonel Hayne, an aide of mine, and will return immediately to me. If you have anything particular to General Beauregard or myself, you can trust it to him, and he will bring it back immediately. Since I inclosed the dispatch to the Secretary of War Major Anderson has written a polite note to General Beauregard, requesting that the letters taken from the mail might be returned, as he had been notified that his mails would be stopped entirely. The general returned for answer that the private letters had been sent to their destination, but the official letters were sent to the Confederate Government, because rumors, well established, indicated that Mr. Fox had violated his faith to me in visiting the fort, under the guarantee of Captain Hartstene, who went with him. The pledge was that he visited Major Anderson by authority, for pacific purposes entirely. You see that the present scheme for supplying the fort is Mr. Fox’s. It is thought that the attempt will be made to-night, and we have doubled our steamboats on the harbor and bar.
Since I wrote to the War Department we have increased the forces on Morris Island to two thousand one hundred men, and ten companies of fine men arrive to-night, in the next train, of eight hundred men, and two more regiments arrive to-morrow. We hope to have about six thousand men there on the harbor batteries and posts. I trust we are ready, and if they come we will give them a cordial reception, such as will ring through this country, I think. I hope we are not mistaken; but, at any rate, we will try and do our duty.

Hon. Mr. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : At the request of General Beauregard I inclose the within. I took possession of the mails this morning from Sumter, and retained the packages marked u official.” These are all sent you. The private letters are all sent, as directed, to their owners. I did this because I consider a state of war is now inaugurated by the authorities at Washington, and all information of a public nature was necessary to us. The mails and all intercourse of any kind with Sumter are now forbidden, and I immediately refused Captain Talbot any interview with Major Anderson, and also his request to be restored to his command in the fort. I called in General Beauregard, and made Captain Talbot and Mr. Chew repeat in his presence what they had said and what the former desired as to Sumter, and General Beauregard entirely and immediately concurred.
You will see by these letters of Major Anderson how it is intended to supply the fort; but by God’s providence we will, I trust, be prepared for them; and if they approach with war vessels also, I think you will hear of as bloody a fight as ever occurred. We now have three thousand seven hundred men at the different posts and batteries, and will have by to-morrow three thousand more, which I have called down. From my calculation, I think they will have about two thousand six

hundred, and will attempt to land in launch-boats with 24 and 12 pounders, and it will probably be on the lower end of Morris Island, next the light house. If so, we will have a fine rifle regiment to give them a cordial welcome from behind sand hills (that are natural fortifications), and two Dahlgren guns will be right on them, besides four 24-pounders in battery. I have four hundred fine Enfield rifles that have been practiced at nine hundred yards, and on that island, altogether, we have now one thousand nine hundred and fifty men, and are increasing it today.
There has just arrived on the bar a fine rifled cannon from Liverpool, of the latest maker (Blakely gun), an improvement upon Armstrong, or steel rolls or coils, with an elevation of seven and one-half degrees to a mile. It throws a shell or twelve-pound shot with the accuracy of a dueling-pistol, and only one and one-half pounds of powder. Such, they write me, is this gun, and I hope to have it in position to-night. We expect the attack about 6 o’clock in the morning, on account of the tide.

Additions of sand bags are being made to the covering of the magazine, between Nos. 2 and 3, and to the left flank of No. 1, where I think they are constructing a service magazine.
I am busily at work constructing splinter-proof shelters on the terre-plein. I obtain timber by taking the gun carriages to pieces, and form the covering of the 2-inch iron pieces for embrasures, as seen below. The plates are spiked on, so as to be securely retained in their places, even if struck by a shell, which I am confident it will turn.
Our supplies are entirely cut oft* from the city, and those on hand are very limited.
The besieging forces worked all day yesterday, whenever the intervals between the showers of rain would allow.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. G. FOSTER,

P. S.—I received yesterday a letter from the Secretary of War to Major Anderson, which, by mistake, had been enveloped to me. I handed it to Major Anderson without reading.

Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General TJ‘ S. Army:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that the resumption of work yesterday (Sunday) at various points on Morris Island, and the vigorous prosecution of it this morning, apparently strengthening nearly all the batteries which are under the fire of our guns, shows that they either have received some news from Washington which has put them on the qui vive or that they have received orders from Montgomery to commence operations here. I am preparing by the side of my barbette guns protection for our men from the shells, which will be almost continuously bursting over or in our work.
I had the honor to receive by yesterday’s mail the letter of the honorable Secretary of War, dated April 4, and confess that what he there states surprises me very greatly, following as it does and contradicting so positively the assurance Mr. Crawford telegraphed he was authorized to make. I trust that this matter will be at once put in a correct light, as a movement made now, when the South has been erroneously informed that none such will be attempted, would produce most disastrous results throughout our country.
It is, of course, now too late for me to give any advice in reference to the proposed scheme of Captain Fox. I fear that its result cannot fail to be disastrous to all concerned. Even with his boat at our walls the loss of life (as I think I mentioned to Mr. Fox) in unloading her will more than pay for the good to be accomplished by the expedition, which keeps us, if I can maintain possession of this work, out of position, surrounded by strong works, which must be carried to make this fort of the least value to the United States Government.
We have not oil enough to keep a light in the lantern for one night. The boats will have, therefore, to rely at night entirely upon other marks. I ought to have been informed that this expedition was to come. Colonel Lam on’s remark convinced me that the idea, merely hinted at to me by Captain Fox, would not be carried out. We shall strive to do our duty, though I frankly say that my heart is not in the war which I see is to be thus commenced. That God will still avert it, and cause us to resort to pacific measures to maintain our rights, is my ardent prayer.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
EOBEET AKDEESOK,
Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

I learned this morning, with surprise, that the Hahlgren had been dismounted at Sullivan’s Island, my countermand of your orders not having been forwarded, as it seems. In this case it must either be sent over here or at once remounted in its former position; the latter is, of course, the quickest.

General Beauregard :
Hear General : I have had under my charge during the night, in addition to my three steamers, the Charleston. The Seabrook came down about 8 o’clock and received orders, but I knew nothing of her during the night. She did not obey my orders. This morning I saw her anchored away to the southward. The Catawba has been all night in the offing. It is my opinion that Sumter can be' relieved, by boats from vessels outside of 4he bars, on any night as dark as the last, or, if we have to take it, you had better be making a beginning. If a vessel of war is placed off each bar, when Sumter opens I will lose all my steamers, as there will be no escape for me. Therefore, before firing, these steamers should be called in. If the steamers are to guard the entrances, please send them down before dark, that they may be positioned. Yesterday I looked into Bull’s Bay, at Stono, and saw nothing.
Excuse my bad writing, my hands are so cold, and my light is so bad that I can scarcely see. I have ordered the Charleston up.

Captain Hartstene and the naval officers are of opinion that the barges can pass our batteries in a dark night, hence we must be prepared to fire on their landing place, which will be the western face and postern of Sumter, not seen by any of our guns. Captain Hartstene is going to light up the entrance of the harbor with floating light-wood fires, and our Drummond lights must be set in active operation as soon as the alarm of “boats are coming” is given.

I have sent verbal orders to Eipley a moment ago to endeavor to put forthwith that dismounted Dahlgrengun (now on the Sullivan Wharf) in position near the extreme end of said island, and then to construct a hasty parapet in front of it. Its main object is to enfilade the landing of the western face of Sumter, and the postern in that angle, for that is where the disembarkation is going to take place. Will you see at once to the execution of these instructions % Then I wish Captain Hamilton to mark out the best position for his battery, just outside of said western point of Sullivan’s Island, for the same purpose as that already indicated by me for the Dahlgren gun, and to let me know when he will require a steamboat to report to him for that object.

Dear General : I inclose the within that you may see what General Bonham offers. His command is confined to the volunteer regiments, ordered into service under a bill to raise ten thousand volunteers in reserve. Three of his regiments are ordered here now. One difficulty I apprehend in his command is that General Dunovant will object, perhaps, to his command over him; but this is nothing, if you desire Bonham to command the whole as major-general. Yet, under the resolutions of the Convention, reporting to you for orders as commander of all, confirmed by myself, I will order him to report to you, with all his staff, and make a special order for him. Perhaps he might be of great service in bringing all into one command for you, and I know he would fight like a true soldier. Besides, he has knowledge, derived from actual service in Mexico, and stands high in the State. But, general, you must candidly say if it is suitable to you, for at this critical juncture I desire to do nothing but what is agreeable to you.

Sir : I have the honor to transmit the inclosed copy of a correspondence with Major Anderson, in consequence of which our fire was opened upon Fort Sumter at 4.30 o’clock this morning, as already communicated to you by telegraph.* The pilots reported to me last evening that a steamer, supposed to be the Harriet Lane, had appeared off the harbor. She approached slowly, and was lying off the main entrance, some ten or twelve miles, when the pilot came in.

Heavy firing all day. Several guns dismounted in Sumter. Our batteries all safe. Nobody hurt. Four steamers off the bar. The sea pretty rough.

Maj. W. H. C. Whiting,
Acting Adjutant and Insp. Gen., Morris Island, 8. C.:
Major : It is reported from the lookout on the light house that three steamers are in sight off the bar. One is supposed by the light-house keeper to be the Harriet Lane. This one is in sight from the hill at my camp, and appears different in its build and rig from a merchant steamer. A heavy gun was fired a short time since at sea, probably from this steamer.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
MAXCY GREGG,
Colonel First Regiment South Carolina Volunteers.
P. S.—The steamer referred to is also reported to have approached the merchant steamer which was off the bar, and has now gone southward.
April 12,1861—afternoon.
The Pawnee, Harriet Lane (certain), and the Baltic (conjectured, from my knowledge of her build) are at anchor close at the North Channel ; Illinois (conjectured) at anchor at the main bar. The wind and sea strong from the southeast; heavy surf. Troops are posted for the night. As many more as you can send will be welcome. No casualties whatever. Troops in good spirits. With your re-enforcements send, if possible, crackers and dried beef, or other provisions, in their haversacks. Shells still fire badly, owing to fuses prematurely bursting. The ships may try to send boats in. Already guns are trained and ranged for night firing on the landing. It is doubtful if the ships will try it. They may. If they run past they will have to go to the city. Men fire deliberately.
By order of General Simons:
W. H. C. WHITING, Adjutant and Inspector General.
Fort Palmetto, Stono Inlet, S. C^ April 12,1861. Brigadier-General Beauregard :
General : I have the honor to call your attention to the force at this point. From the accounts received from abroad, large military preparations seem to have been made against us. A vigorous diversion of their force may be made at this point, and as your attention is much occupied by the large preparations in Charleston Harbor, I take the liberty of bringing our force here to your notice, that you may increase it if the same is, in your opinion, expedient. We have been occupied all day strengthening our fortifications by the use of sand bags. With some

Commanding Provisional Forces, Charleston, 8. C.:
Sir : You were pleased to say, in your letter of yesterday, to Governor Pickens, in reference to my tender of services: u So soon as a sufficient force shall have been collected on Morris Island or elsewhere to form two brigades thereat, I shall be most happy to accept his [my] proffered services.” There being now on Morris Island the two regiments belonging to General Simons’ brigade, Colonel Gregg’s regiment of volunteers, and Colonel Kershaw’s regiment, also the whole or a part of Colonel Hagood’s regiment (both of my division), making as large or a larger number of my division proper than of General Simons’ command proper, I submit that the state of things contemplated in your letter has arisen, and respectfully ask to be assigned immediately to that command.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. L. BOJSTHAM,

Headquarters, State of South Carolina,
April 12, 1861.
Dear General: The display at Lighthouse Inlet, perhaps, is a feint, and if so, they intend to re-enforce, as you say, through Bull’s Bay and Sullivan’s Island Inlet; but I think there is danger at Stono, and of coming up in the rear of the city by the Long Bridge. The regiment, stationed at the race-course, is in good position, but they ought to have pickets out, so as to be in hearing of Stono, so as to report immediately to the colonel of the regiment if any attack is made. If they come through Sullivan’s Island Inlet or Creek, then Castle Pinckney might play her guns as they turn around to Sumter.
Bespectfully,
P. W. PICKETS.
Headquarters, April 12,1861.
Dear General: Plan of battle just determined on at Gregg’s quarters. Whiting, Huger, Gregg, Trapier, and Simons all agree that we greatly need infantry, to defend the batteries from assault. Pour large steamers are plainly in view, and standing off the bar all day. Unanimous opinion that a landing will be attempted, and fears that some of the batteries will be taken, unless supported. Have made the best distribution of the troops we have, but need every man you can send. Should you not be here personally to direct? Such is the general opinion. I send this by order of Simons, who is at Gregg’s, and left me here to write, and send without delay.
Yery respectfully,
LOUIS T. WIGFALL.
P. S.—We have no glass here, and have to rely entirely upon the eye to examine steamers. Pour plainly in sight, and another vessel out a short distance. Pight expected to-night.

Charleston, 8. 0., April 12,1861. Lieutenant-Colonel De Satjssure, Morris Island, 8. €.:
Sir : In order to economize our mortar ammunition, I desire that at or after 12 m. this day you should double the interval between the firing of the shells ; that is, four minutes instead of two during the day, and twenty minutes instead of ten during the night. The action of your mortar batteries in that respect will guide the others elsewhere. Be careful, also, not to fire too fast at your other batteries, and to call in time for additional ammunition when required.

Maj. W. H. C. Whiting,
Assistant Adjutant-General, &c., Morris Island, S. C.:
Major : Your note is received. Firing, I hope, will soon be better. To save ammunition of mortars, the time between each shell thrown should be doubled by day and by night—that is, four minutes instead of two for the first, and twenty minutes instead of ten for the last. I have written to Colonel De Saussure to that effect. This change should take place after 12 m. this day. The batteries elsewhere will follow those of Cummings Point. Great care should be taken at the other batteries (gun) not to fire too fast or uselessly, and timely calls for ammunition should be made. 1 have requested Colonel Wigfall to lend his assistance to General Simons as a volunteer aid. Be careful to strengthen the force protecting the batteries on south end of Morris Island, for if a landing is made it will be done there, probably. How would it do to send General Bonham to command from about the lighthouse down to Lighthouse Inlet? I am trying to dispatch to that locality as many new arrivals as possible. They will do very well for those hills.
Yours, truly,

I also told Captain Hartstene to go out to the fleet and tell them that the fort was now ours, but under the safe-keeping of Major Anderson, and that no attack could be made upon it by them.
In the morning I will order two of Colonel Ripley’s companies and two of De Saussure’s to take possession of Fort Sumter.

the IT. S. Navy, has just communicated with him. He first inquired if Major Anderson had surrendered, to which (as informed by Colonel Wig-fall, aide-de-camp) he was answered “Yes; unconditionally.” Second, if he could communicate with Fort Moultrie, to which he was answered “No.” (He evidently supposed the commanding general was at Moultrie, as he afterwards said.) Third, he asked if he could be permitted to come in, under a flag of truce, and take Major Anderson off*. If not, whether he could come in with a merchantman and do the same. If not, that whether he could come in with his boats for the purpose. To these inquiries General Simons replied that transportation could be furnished for Major Anderson to the fleet, but that the commanding general was at hand, and could be communicated with at once, with the understanding that no hostile demonstration should be made during the night by the fleet. The lieutenant was informed that you would be furnished with his questions, and he might return for answers to-morrow morning, under a flag of truce. The lieutenant gave his personal guarantee that no hostilities would be attempted, and said he would return in the morning to hear your reply. He informed Major Whiting that their mission was not hostile, but one of peace.

I have also, by request, ordered a detachment of thirty men and two officers from Captain Johnson’s company, to take post at the redoubt at the entrance of Santee River, that post being unoccupied. Have also taken possession of thirty muskets for said detachment from a quantity here in store. Also, a quantity of army stores.
I have detailed Captain Daggett as bearer of this report, who will furnish any further information you may require as to the defense at this point.
All of which is respectfully submitted and, hoping it may meet your approbation, I am, very respectfully, vours,
W. C. WHITE,

Headquarters Artillery, S. I. and M. P.,
Fort Moultrie, S. C., April 13,1861. Maj. D. R. Jones, Adjutant-General:
Major: I have the honor to report that we have had only two personal casualties in the force under my command, both very slight, and are privates in Company A (Sullivan and Miller). The effect of the enemy’s fire upon this fort has been pretty effectually to demolish the quarters and to injure the hot-shot furnace to a certain extent. The effects of the Sumter, enfilade, Dahlgren, floating, and mortar batteries, has been to keep the enemy from his barbette guns. The direct fire has been quite accurate for the distance, several shots having passed through the arches of the second line of casemates, two or three into his lower embrasures, and many grazing the crest of his parapet and penetrating the roof of his quarters. Still, our direct fire is only annoying, and I have directed it to be economized, to look out and keep the men as fresh as possible for the channel fight, which, it is to be presumed, is impending. I note what has been said respecting the hot-shot furnace, and shall endeavor to attend to it, although it has three shot-holes in it, which has already rendered one bay inefficient. I have directed Captain Hamilton, and the floating battery especially, to be economical with their ammunition, and have to request that the latter be supplied with one hundred rounds of shell and one hundred cartridges, with appurtenances, by boat this evening from the city. All our 9-inch and 8-inch shells are defective, and Captain Hamilton has filled several with, rice to use them as solid shot. It would be well to have the floating battery supplied also, if possible, with 42 and 32 pounder ammunition, as it will be especially effective in keeping out re-enforcements.
I also have to suggest that Captain Martin be supplied with one hundred and fifty shell and ammunition, with authority to practice as much as he pleases until lie gets his shell in. All the mortar practice is wild, owing to the range and the effect of the wind. As I am sorely pressed for time, I have respectfully to request that such requisitions as are approved may be ordered from headquarters.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. 8. RIPLEY,
Lieutenant-Colonel Artillery, Commanding.

P. S.—One of the rear transoms of Captain Hallonquistfs mortars, being made of pine, is split. I shall endeavor to have it repaired. The merlons stand very well, except the vertical palmetto logs, which collapse under our own fire. One 42-pounder shot entered the embrasure, but, being stuffed with a cotton bale, had no further effect than to take a splinter off a carriage. The new 8-inch columbiad carriages will not stand much.

E. S. RIPLEY.
Charleston, S. C., April 13,1861. Brig. Gen. James Simons, Morris Island, S. G. :
My Dear General : The accumulation of troops on Morris Island requires that another general officer should be sent to the southern end of that island. General Bonham has consented to go there in command, until we can divide the forces into two brigades, when he will assume command of the whole as major-general, to act under my orders. In the mean time, should circumstances bring your commands together, he will necessarily assume the command; otherwise to attend only to his half (about) of the island, and you to yours, but to mutually assist and support each other, in case of need, and in the defense of our country and sacred cause.
Major Whiting will remain acting inspector-general of the whole island. He will communicate (a?s well as yourself) all the information in his possession to General Bonham. I will endeavor to be with you as soon as practicable, or whenever required.

Fort Moultrie, S. C.,
April 13,1861.
General Beauregard, Charleston, S.C.:
General : Fort Sumter has been set on fire, and as it is very important (with the vessels outside threatening to enter) to have all experience, I have determined to remain and avoid or prevent a re enforcement. I do not think that there are more than three vessels off. Colonel Ripley and myself will endeavor to prevent an entry here to-night. 1 will, as you said, make myself useful; more* so, probably, than I could at any other point. I shall go out in a row-boat during the night, with signals arranged, and reconnoiter the entrance and give timely notice of any boats approaching. I think the fire-hulk inside of Sumter had better not be lighted, as it will probably dim our vision.
I have just made out the vessels off. They are the Pawnee, Harriet Lane, Nashville, Atlantic, and a merchant schooner. They cannot enter in their vessels. With a good lookout (for a lookout stationed here, and a boat off in the channel, together with their fire-hulks, which are still floating in a line around Fort Sumter), I think you need have no fear of an entrance here. They are all here, and in fine spirits. Ripley is a most valuable officer—cool, collected, and energetic. He keeps all in spirits and up to their work. I have all the batteries on this island, and give the best directions, as I think may be useful, particularly in regard to looking out for and firing at boats or shipping. The guns are all intact, and in fine working order.

lance without such a force as would render a coup de main impossible. The men behaved very well and kept well on the alert. I visited the whole line last night (after midnight) and found everything quiet; but you are aware that this cannot last over such a long line of defenses, with an uncertainty as to the point of attack. Opinions differ as to whether anything got into Sumter last night. There may or may not. The night was dark, and occasionally stormy, and a heavy sea running. If anything did, it could not have been very extensive. .Perhaps they desire to lay off, and send in one boat at a time or once a night. This is the most feasible plan, and that which I most fear. If it is in your power I beg you to come here for myself personally. I am nearly broken down for want of rest. The gentlemen you sent are very efficient. Quartermaster Hatch should send down tents for the general and his staff. We are without accommodations, and are temporarily in the hospital, which we may at any time be compelled to leave.

My Dear General: I beg an immediate answer, by the bearer, to this. Captain Lee, Corps of Engineers, has preferred to me a claim to u the honor of being sent to Sumter this morning.” The very faithful, skillful, and laborious duties performed here for three months continuously by Captain Lee entitle him to this distinction, if he so considers it. As the Chief Engineer of the Confederate Army, and charged

with the supervision of the works on Morris Island, I have no hesitation in saying that I consider Captain Lee entitled to the credit of the engineering work done here, with his assistants. To it he has devoted his time and personal interests. Captain Lee naturally feels aggrieved at having been superseded on the eve of action, on the occasion of my being relieved from engineering duty (although, undoubtedly, that was due to the supposed state of his health). Captain Lee does not desire to make the report called for in your order, but claims to be sent to Sumter. I indorse this claim, and most respectfully and earnestly request that you will return an order sending Captain Lee, for the present, to Sumter, on duty with the garrison. It is certainly due to his untiring devotion, he not being absent from his post for three months, and it is the reward which he has asked for.
W. H. C. WHITING, Adjutant and Inspector General.

mortars from Stevens’ battery and place them behind Gadbuy’s during the night, and one just below the Dahlgren. Sturgis will never venture under vertical fire. The enemy will know nothing of the move. No epaulement is necessary, nature having provided that. The weak point of the island is the low flat between Yinegar Hill and Gadbuy’s, affording, as it does, no cover to the troops, and a point of attack by which the enemy might endeavor to separate or cut in two our line. I have issued the orders for this move, but will hold their execution for your approval. I would like also to have the Dahlgren (used by Hamilton in the late action) immediately, for placing at Light house Hill (Battery Huger). These movements should be commenced, if decided upon, at on^e. We require, also, more artillerymen. The Palmetto Guards should return to the island to man their mortars. Perhaps some could be spared from Pleasant and Johnson. I would respectfully indorse the remounting of a few 24s (now in the city) on Pinckney, and a mortar to be sent there. The channel defenses must be immediately increased by more columbiads; three from the iron battery, two 42s from the Point, and five 42s from Sumter (lying on the parade). The three 8-inch columbiads, half buried, to be used as mortars in Sumter, can be made available, if quickly done; the 10-inch on a mortar carriage also. The serviceable battery of Sumter should be put in order and supplied without delay. Had not Major Trapier better attend to these constructions % The pintles can be placed at once; the carriages have been ordered; perhaps there are some extra ones at Sumter; the epaulements to be constructed at leisure. A traverse breastwork, three hundred yards, running back from Yinegar Hill, is directed to be constructed. Please visit this post.

The detachment that fought the battery (a portion of Company D, of the artillery battalion) could serve it again, but as the company is well drilled at the exercise of heavy guns, you will, no doubt, require its services in the harbor. If authority could be obtained from the honorable Secretary of the Confederate States Navy for me to enlist twenty-five seamen, four of which to be rated petty officers, and Mr. Grimball and Ingraham could be assigned to me, I could take charge of the battery and perhaps make her useful.

General : I have to report that on the 3d instant, being at Fort Clinch, I received a telegram from my clerk informing me that troops of the State of Georgia were moving to occupy Fort Pulaski, by order of the governor. I replied by telegraph, directing Mr. Hirsch to inform 318

the commandant of Engineers of the fact. 1 took the first opportunity to reach Savannah on the 6th, and arrived last night. This morning I proceeded to Fort Pulaski, which I found occupied by Georgia troops, commanded by Colonel Lawton. I was received with great civility, and informed by him that he held possession of all the Government property for the present, by order of the governor of the State, and intended to preserve it from loss or damage. He requested a return of the public property, both Ordnance and Engineer, which I have given as existing January 1. Those returns for the fourth quarter, 1860, will be forwarded with my quarterly papers, signed as usual up to the commencement of the present quarter. I can sign no more, however, for I cannot be responsible for property of the charge of which I have been forcibly deprived. I have directed Ordnance Sergeant Walker tore-port at Oglethorpe Barracks until further orders. The fort keeper I have discharged.
On Saturday, 3d instant, the regular mail-boat from Fernandina to this place, by which I intended to travel, was taken off the line by the governor of Florida and ordered, as I was informed, to Saint Augustine, with a force to seize the ordnance mounted in the water battery of Fort Marion for the purpose of arming Fort Clinch.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary for me to say to the Department that in the present condition of Fort Clinch the idea of arming it either for offense or defense is simply absurd. My presence, however, is necessary there, for I know that I have sufficient influence in the community to prevent anything like spoliation or plunder of the public property by lawless individuals. I shall, therefore, return there on Wednesday, the 9th instant. Previous to leaving that post, I received assurances from the principal citizens to the effect that they would promptly put down anything like an attempt on the part of unauthorized mobs, to take a dime’s worth of the large amount of valuable material and property at the fort. They manifest a desire that the work shall continue without molestation, and this I believe to be the desire also of the members of the State Convention. I have a force of sixty men at work pushing the masonry as rapidly as possible. On the authority of Department letter of 9th ultimo, I have continued the work with the funds in my hands. The payments for December, which will be immediately made, will exhaust all funds in my hands belonging to Fort Clinch, and perhaps exceed a little. I have, as will be seen by the monthly statement, enough of other funds to continue for the present; but unless a portion at least of my last estimates is sent to me, I shall be compelled to close my operations. I respectfully request instructions. It is necessary to inform you that the telegraph is in the hands of the State authorities, and no message of a military or political character is allowed to be sent or delivered except by permission of the governor. The telegram of Mr. Hirsch to Colonel De Bussy was refused until countersigned by Governor Brown.
As to the Savannah Biver improvement, no interference with the property belonging to the appropriation has been attempted, nor is any at present anticipated. I have, however, directed the discharge of all employes except a watchman. Fort Jackson remains as heretofore.
The mail between Charleston and Fernandina having been discontinued, I request that communications be addressed to me via Savannah.
Very respectfully,
WM. H. C. WHITING,
Captain of Engineers.

Letter from Col. H. K. Craig, Chief of Ordnance Z7. S. Army, in reference to transfer of detachment from the Charleston to Augusta Arsenal.
Ordnance Office, Washington D. C., January 19, 1861.
Sir : The inclosed letter from Captain Elzey to the Adjutant-General of the Army is submitted for the perusal of the Lieutenant-General commanding, and for such action as he may deem proper in the case, with the remarks that the captain had no means of knowing whether the Colonel of Ordnance had or had not consulted higher authority on the matter, even if such consultation, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, had been requisite.
The Ordnance detachment had been ejected from the Charleston Arsenal by the treasonable violence of the State authorities, and it became absolutely necessary to shelter it elsewhere*. The Augusta Arsenal, Ga., under the control of this Department, where ample quarters are prepared for its enlisted men, is the nearest acceptable military post to which the detachment could be sent. The order to that effect was given after a full consideration of its propriety, and it is believed that if Captain Elzey had taken the pains to offer such explanations as his information warranted, the excitement alluded to by him need not have occurred, or might have been readily abated.
With much respect,

He reported here by telegraphic order from Colonel Craig. This movement on the part of Colonel Craig I believe to be wholly unauthorized by the War Department. It was injudicious and impolitic, added much to the excitement in Augusta, and was very nigh producing serious difficulties in this quarter, the people believing it to be a re-enforcement to my command. I had no previous knowledge of it whatever.

Washington, D. C„ February 15,1861.
Sir : In compliance with your letter of this date, I have the honor to submit the following complete report of the surrender of the United States Arsenal at Augusta, Ga.:
On the morning of the 23d of January, ultimo, I received from the governor of Georgia, then in Augusta, backed by a superior force of State troops, numbering some six or seven hundred, a verbal demand of the arsenal, which I refused. Shortly after came through his aide de camp a written demand in the following terms, the substance of which was telegraphed by me to the War Department, to wit:
Augusta, January 23, 1861.
Sir : I am instructed by his excellency Governor Brown to say to you that, Georgia having seceded from the United States of America and resumed exclusive sovereignty over her soil, it has become his duty to require you to withdraw the troops under your command, at the earliest practicable moment, from the limits of the State.
He proposes to take possession of the arsenal, and to receipt for all public property under your charge, which will be accounted for on adjustment between the State of Georgia and the United States of America.
He begs to refer you to the fact that the retention of your troops upon the soil of Georgia after remonstrance is, under the laws of nations, an act of hostility, and he claims that the State is not only at peace but anxious to cultivate the most amicable relations with the United States Government.
I am further instructed to say that an answer will be expected by to-morrow morning at 9 o’clock.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HENRY R. JACKSON,
Aide-de-Camp, <fc.
About 1 o’clock on the night of the 23d of January, ultimo, I received from the War Department the following reply to my telegram, to wit:
Washington, January [23, 1861.]
Capt. Arnold Elzey,
Second Artillery, Commanding Augusta Arsenal, Ga. .*
The governor of Georgia has assumed against your post and the United States an attitude of war. His Summons is harsh and peremptory. It is not expected that your defense shall be desperate. If forced to surrender by violence or starvation, you will stipulate for honorable terms and a free passage by water with your company to New York.
* J. HOLT, Secretary of War.
To have resisted such a force, then ready to attack me, with my knowledge of large re-enforcements at Savannah and Atlanta, ready to come up by rail at a moment’s warning, would have been desperation in my weak position. I therefore directed my adjutant to address and convey the following note in reply to the governor’s demand:

Sir : I have the honor to inform you that this arsenal was taken possession of by four companies of volunteers from Mobile at daylight this morning. I did not make, nor could I have made, any resistance, as they had scaled the walls and taken possession before I knew anything about the movement. t
The governor has demanded all the public property, and his men now have entire possession of the arsenal.
I telegraphed to you to day for orders as to what disposition is to be made of the enlisted men and of myself. If, unfortunately, my telegram should not be answered, I will wait here a few days in hopes of hearing from you; but in the event the mails should be stopped, I will discharge all those that desire it, and bring the others with me to Washington.
The men have not been paid, and I fear that now there is no prospect of it at present.
I shall probably leave here by the 11th instant, unless I should receive other orders. As it was impossible for me to hold this place with my seventeen men, I trust that the Department will not hold me responsible for this unexpected catastrophe.

THE SECESSION' OF ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI. IChap. Hi.
at Mount Vernon were on yesterday * peacefully occupied, and are now held by the troops of the State of Alabama. That this act on my part may not be misunderstood by the Government of the United States, I proceed to state the motives which have induced it, and the reasons which justify it, and also the course of conduct with which I design to follow that act.
A convention of the people of this State will, in pursuance of a previously-enacted law, assemble on the 7th instant. I was fully convinced by the evidences which I had that that convention would at an early day, in the exercise of an authority which in my judgment of right belongs to it, withdraw the State of Alabama from the Government of the United States and place it in the attitude of a separate and independent power. Being thus convinced I deemed it my duty to take every precautionary step to make the secession of the State peaceful, and prevent detriment to her people.
While entertaining such a conviction as to my duty, I received such information as left but little, if any, room to doubt that the Government of the United States, anticipating the secession of Alabama, and preparing to maintain its authority within this State by force, even to the shedding of the blood and the sacrifice of the lives of the people, was about* to re-enforce those forts and put a guard over the arsenal. Having that information, it was but an act of self-defense, and the plainest dictate of prudence, to anticipate and guard against the contemplated movement of the authorities of the General Government. Appreciating, as I am sure you do, the courage and spirit of our people, you must be sensible that no attempt at the coercion of the State, or at the enforcement by military power of the authority of the United States within its jurisdiction in contravention of the ordinance of secession can be effectual, unless our utmost capacity for resistance can be exhausted. It would have been an unwise policy, suicidal in its character, to have permitted the Government of the United States to have made undisturbed preparations within this State to enforce by war and bloodshed an authority which it is the fixed purpose of the people of the State to resist to the uttermost of their power. A policy so manifestly unwise would probably have been overruled by an excited and discontented people, and popular violence might have accomplished that which has been done by the State much more appropriately and much more consistently with the prospect of peace and the interests of the parties concerned.
The purpose with which my order was given and has been executed was to avoid and not to provoke hostilities between the State and Federal Government. .There is no object, save the honor and independence of my State, which is by me so ardently desired as the preservation of amicable relations between this State and the Government of the United States. That the secession of the State, made, necessary by the conduct of others, may be peaceful is my prayer as well as the prayer of every patriotic man in the State.
An inventory of the property in the forts and arsenal has been ordered, and the strictest care will be taken to prevent the injury or destruction of it while peaceable relations continue to subsist, as I trust they will. The forts and arsenal will be held by my order only for the precautionary purpose for which they were taken, and subject to the control of ^ the convention of the people to assemble on the 7th instant.
With distinguished consideration, l am your obedient servant,
;	A. B. MOORE.

Beport of Lieut Frederick E. Prime, U. S. Corps of Engineers, of the seizure of fort on Ship Island, Miss.
Biloxi, Miss., January 30, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the works at Ship Island were visited by an armed body of men on the forenoon of the 13th instant. They stated to the overseer that their object was to take possession of the works, and, al^o, that they were acting on their own responsibility. After a short stay on the island, they left without interfering in any way with the work. * On the afternoon of the same day another party, also armed, landed at Ship Island; their statement to the overseer was the same as that made by the first party. A flag was hoisted previous to their departure that evening. Ten men were left on the island, who occupied a vacant engineer building. As no interference was attempted on their part, operations were continued, so as to close the works as rapidly as possible. On the morning of the 20th instant, a third armed body of men took forcible possession of the works and engineer property at Ship Island. From that moment I considered myself relieved from all connection with those works. The forcible seizure on the 18th instant of the yrorks and engineer property on east end of Dauphin Island (reported to the Department by Lieutenant Beese) has, in like manner, relieved me from all responsibility respecting Fort Gaines. The forcible occupation of Fort Morgan and my arrest at Pensacola have, I consider, relieved me from all connection with my other works, unless it be Fort Pickens, now garrisoned by the line of the Army. My duties are thus restricted to the settlement of outstanding liabilities against the works formerly in my charge. Should the Department, however, consider that I have, or may have hereafter, other duties to discharge with respect to these works, I would respectfully request that I be furnished with instructions to that effect.

the same time that the steamer came to take the hands, provisions, &c., and prevented the shipment of anything but personal property, and demanded the surrender of fort and all property pertaining thereto.

ance. I mailed a copy of the governor’s order, &e., this morning at Chattahoochee, but finding that it would not be forwarded on account of the excitement—they have taken all the public property in spite of all I could do—I refused giving up the keys, but the governor telegraphed to the commanding officer to insist on the delivery of the same, and I was compelled to give them up. I would be pleased to receive advice as to what disposition I shall make of myself and men.

Sir: I am obliged to perform what is to me a painful duty, viz, to report to the Chief of Ordnance that all the military stores at this place were seized this morning by the order of the governor of the State of Florida. A company of volunteer soldiers marched to the barracks and took possession of me, and demanded peaceable possession of the keys of the fort and magazine. I demanded them to show me their authority. An aide-de-camp of the governor showed me his letter of instructions authorizing him to seize the property, and directing him to use what force might be necessary.
Upon reflection I decided that the only alternative for me was to deliver the keys, under protest, and demand a receipt for the property. One thing certain, with the exception of the guns composing the armament of the water battery, the property seized is of no great value. The gentleman acting under the governor’s instructions has promised to receipt to me for the stores.

A. J. SLEMMEB,
First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding Fost.
CoL S. Cooper, Adjutant-General U. 8. Army.
Fort Pickens, Fla., February 5,1861.
Sir: Having heard rumors that the forts and other public property in Pensacola Harbor were to be seized by troops under the orders of the governor of Florida, and having been advised of the seizure of the torts in Mobile Bay, I deemed it proper, having received no instructions from Washington, to endeavor to prevent, by all the means in my power, a like seizure here.
On the morning of the 7th ultimo, accompanied by Lieutenant Gilman, I called upon the commander of the navy-yard, Commodore Armstrong, to consult with him in reference to some plan to be adopted to insure the safety of the public property. We had a similar consultation on the evening of the same day and on the morning of the 8th. The commodore, in the absence of any orders, deemed it inexpedient to cooperate with us.
On the morning of the 8th I removed all the powder from the magazine in the Spanish battery of Fort Barrancas to the inner magazines, because, from its exposed position, it was liable to seizure at any moment. I also caused all the batteries to be put in working order, and at night placed a sergeant’s guard in the fort with the drawbridge raised. That night a body of men (about twenty in number) came to the fort with the evident intention of taking possession. The corporal of the guard caused the alarm to be given, upon which the assailants retreated precipitately. The guard was immediately strengthened by half the company, but nothing further occurred that night.
On the morning of the 9th I received through the mail a letter, of which the following is a copy:
Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, January 3, 1861.
First Lieut. A. J. Slemmer,
First Artillery, or Commanding Officer Barrancas Barracks, Fla.:
Sir: The General-in-Chief directs that you take measures to do the utmost in your power to prevent the seizure of either of the forts in Pensacola Harbor by surprise or assault, consulting first with the commander of the navy-yard, who will probably have received instructions to co-operate with you.

REPORTS.

Immediately on its reception, accompanied by Lieutenant Gilman, I called on Commodore Armstrong to consult with him. He had received orders to co-operate with me. We decided that with our limited means of defense we could hold but one fort, and that should be Fort Pickens, as it commanded completely the harbor and the forts, and also the navy-yard, and, in case of necessity, could be more readily re-enforced than either of the others, and presented the best means of defense. In order to act on this decision, the commodore promised to send the U. S. steamer Wyandotte at 1 o’clock p. m. to take us over, to give us all the men he could possibly spare, and to allow the steamer Wyandotte and the storeship Supply to anchor under the guns of the fort, in order to protect the land approach.
At 10 o’clock a. m. I came with the greater part of my command, Company G, First Artillery, to Fort Pickens to mount guns and make necessary preparations for defense, leaving Lieutenant Gilman at Barrancas Barracks with the remainder to make the necessary arrangements for removal. At 1 p. m. Lieutenant Gilman, seeing no signs of the promised assistance, called to see the commodore, and was informed by him that the only assistance he could afford would be to furnish some provisions and take the command over, which fact Lieutenant Gilman reported to me at Fort Pickens. I immediately stopped all work, sent the men backhand with Lieutenant Gilman went to see the commodore. I stated that I had been deceived by him ; that he had promised me men and the co-operation of the two vessels of war, besides the mere fact of giving us provisions and taking us over; that with my command, only 46 strong, I should never dream of defending so large a work, calculated for upwards of 1,200 men; that I had been at work on that promise, and had thus lost a day’s time in the preparation of Fort Barrancas for defense; that he had distinctly promised me what I asseverated. The commodore then sent for Commander Farrand, Lieutenant Benshaw, and Lieutenant-Commander Berryman, and gave instructions for carrying out the original design.
Captain Berryman, of the steamer Wyandotte, promised to be ready to leave his wharf at 5 p. m., at which time all should be in readiness at the Barrancas wharf for removal. I immediately returned to Barrancas Barracks to make preparations. As time was very limited all means were used to place the public property on the wharf for removal* Night came, and yet no signs of assistance. The company labored until 12 m., when a heavy fog coming in rendered it highly improbable that the steamer would come that night. At 8 a. m. on the 10th a flat-boat was sent to the wharf, which was loaded, as well as all the small boats which could be had. We were landed at Fort Pickens at about 10 a. m. On the way over, Captain Berryman turned over to me thirty ordinary seamen from the yard, without arms or equipments of any kind. We labored all day until niglit carrying up the stores to the fort, and arranging for its defense. I directed that all the powder in Fort Barrancas should be taken out and rolled to the beach, for transportation if possible; if not, for destruction. Nearly all the powder and all the fixed ammunition for the field battery was brought over'that day. All the guns bearing on the bay were spiked by my orders, in position, as I had neither means nor time to dismount them. The provisions required were, by agreement with the commodore, to be drawn from the Supply as they were wanted, instead of sending them from the yard; yet, almost the instant we landed the master of the yard came with some small stores in a barge, bringing with him an order from Commodore Armstrong to land the stores immediately and proceed to anchor off the

center wharf of the yard. As I was not ready to receive the stores, th% Supply remained at her anchor that night.
On the morning of the 11th I was informed by Captain Walke that he had received another order from Commodore Armstrong to deliver the stores and return to the navy-yard. Captain Berryman also told me that he expected to sail that evening or the next morning for the south side of Cuba. I immediately caused the following note to be addressed to the commodore by my acting adjutant, Lieutenant Gilman:
Fort Pickens, Fla., January 11,1861. Commodore James Armstrong, TJ. S. Navy:
Sir : I understand that it is your intention to withdraw from this fort the protection of the U. S. steamer Wyandotte and the storeship Supply, contrary to the agreement between you and myself day before yesterday. I again have the honor to state, as I did to you in presence of several officers at our last interview, that without the aid of those vessels it will be utterly impossible, in my opinion, for me to protect this harbor, and I shall therefore, in case this assistance is withdrawn, instantly relinquish all hope of defending the place, and report the state of affairs immediately by a messenger to Washington. I most respectfully request an immediate answer as to whether the assistance above referred to is to be withdrawn or not.
I am sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
(By order of A. J. Slemmer, First Artillery, U. S. Army, Commanding Fort Pickens:)
J. H. GILMAN*
Second Lieutenant, First Artillery, Acting Adjutant of the Post*
To which the commodore replied as follows:
Commandant’s Office, U. S. Navy-Yard, Pensacola,
Warrington, January 11, 1861.
Lieut. A. J. Slemmer, TJ. S. Army, Commanding at Fort Pickens, Fla.:
Sir: In rejdy to your communication of this date, I have to state that the U. S* storeship Supply was sent to Fort Pickens by my order merely to convey the provisions you required and to return to this navy-yard. The Supply is not a vessel of war, and having been sent to this station on the special service of conveying stores and coal to Vera Cruz for the vessels of the home squadron stationed there, it is my duty to dispatch her to that port at the earliest moment practicable, in conformity with the orders I have received from the Navy Department, from which orders I cannot deviate further.
The steamer Wyandotte may be retained, for the purpose of Co-operating with you, until further orders.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JAMES ARMSTRONG,
Commandant?
The Wyandotte and Supply remained at anchor under the fort that night. Captain Berryman sent me during the evening thirty muskets aud bayonets to arm the ordinary seamen, which he had procured after some difficulty from the navy-yard. He also had for me some musket cartridges which were promised me from the yard, as my supply was limited.
On the morning of the 12th, Captain Walke, of the Supply, showed me a communication to him from the commodore, saying that the yard was besieged, and that when attacked the Supply must immediately proceed to Vera Cruz. I received no information from the yard whatever of the fact. I immediately addressed a note to the commodore, to this purport:
Commodore James Armstrong,
Commandant U. S. Navy-Yard, Warrington, Fla. :
Sir : I am informed that the navy-yard is besieged. In case you determine to capitulate, please send me the marines to strengthen my command.
I am, sir, very respectfuUy, your obedient servant,

To which I received no reply. Several hours after this the United States flag was lowered from the navy-yard. The Supply was towed outside by the Wyandotte, and both vessels remained anchored at a distance of about five miles. That night Captain Berryman told me that his orders of the previous evening were to co-operate with me, but especially that he must not fire a gun unless his vessel was attacked. He could offer me no assistance in case I were assaulted. Left thus entirely to depend on ourselves for defense—eighty-one men, including officers— active preparations were made for flank defense, the guns being loaded with grape and canister, and the embrasures closed as well as possible.
Qn my arrival I found that there was not a single embrasure shutter in the fort. I caused some to be constructed, and others to be taken from Fort McRee to supply the deficiency. Just after retreat four gentlemen (three in military clothing) presented themselves at the gate, and demanded admittance as citizens of Florida and Alabama. They were told that by order no person was permitted to enter the fort. They then asked to see the commanding officer. I immediately went to the gate, accompanied by Lieutenant Gilman. Mr. Abert, engineer of the yard, presented Captain Randolph, Major Marks, and Lieutenant Rutledge. After a pause, Captain Randolph said, u We have been sent to demand a peaceable surrender of this fort by the governors of Florida and Alabama.” To which I replied that I was here under the orders of the President of the United States, and by direction of the General-in-Chief of the Army; that I recognized no right of any governor to demand a surrender of United States property; that my orders were distinct and explicit. They immediately withdrew.
At 12 o’clock at night the men were paraded and told off to the different batteries in anticipation of an attack, slow-match lighted, with lanyards and port fires in hand ready to fire. No signs of an attack; night very dark and rainy. We still labored on the 13th strengthening our position, and at night threw out sentinels beyond the glacis. Men stood at the guns as on the night previous. Night very dark and rainy. On the night of the 13th a body of some ten men were discovered evidently reconnoitering. A shot was fired by them, which was returned by the sergeant. They then retreated. Nothing more could be seen of the party that night. On the 14th nothing of interest transpired. Men by this time almost worn out with labor, standing guard, and at the batteries day and night, for we anticipated an attack at any moment.
On the 15th Colonel Chase, commanding the forces of Florida, accompanied by Commander Farrand, late of the U. S. Navy, asked for a consultation, at which Colonel Chase read me the following letter:
Headquarters Pensacola District,
January 15, 1861.
Lieut. A. J. Slemmer,
U. S. Army, Commanding Fort Pickens, Harbor of Pensacola:
Sir: I have full powers from the governor of Florida to take possession of the forts and navy-yard, &c., &c., in this harbor. I desire to perform this duty without the effusion of blood. You can contribute toward this desirable result, and, in my judgment, without sacrifice of the honor of yourself or your gallant officers and men. Now, as commissioner on the part of the governor of the State of Florida, I request the surrender of Fort Pickens and the public property it contains into my hands, to be held subject to any agreement that may be entered into between the commissioners of the State of Florida and the Federal Government at Washington. I would not counsel you to do aught that was dishonorable; on the contrary, to do that which will secure for you the commendation of all Christian gentlemen; and if you refuse and hold out, for whom do you consent that blood shall flow—the blood of brethren f Certainly not tor the deadly enemies to the assaulters, for they are not such, but brethren of the same race. If the Union now broken should be reconstructed Fort Pickens and all the

[Chap. IV.
public property passes peacefully under Federal authority. If a Southern Confederacy separates itself from the Union would it not be worse than folly to attempt the maintenance of Fort Pickens or any other fortified place within its limits ?
Listen to me, then, I beg of you, and act with me in preventing the shedding the blood of your brethren. Surrender the fort. You and your command may reoccupy the barracks and quarters at Barrancas on your simple parole to remain there quietly until ordered away, or to resume the command of the harbor should an adjustment of present difficulties in the Union be arrived at.
All the baggage and private property of any kind belonging to yourself, officers, men, and their families shall be preserved to you. Consider this well, and take care that you will so act as to have no fearful recollections of a tragedy that you might have averted, but rather to make the present moment one of the most glorious, because christianlike, of your life.
I beg of you to receive this communication in the same spirit in which it is offered.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. H. CHASE.
I asked, uHow many men have you IP The colonel answered, u Tonight I shall have between eight and nine hundred.” I then said that I would consider his letter, and would give my answer the next morning. I also desired to consult with the captains of the Supply and Wyandotte, which vessels were lying off the navy yard under a white flag. The colonel said he would make arrangements for their coming to the fort, and would see them as he passed. I made this request for two reasons—first, because thereby I would gain more time for resting my men (who were completely exhausted), and, second, because I deemed it but courtesy on my part to consult them with reference to anything which would affect our common flag, and because one of them was in name co-operating with me. They did not come, however. I afterwards learned that the permission came in such a form that they could not accept it.
The next morning I saw with surprise both vessels under way going out of the harbor. I immediately sent a boat with Lieutenant Gilman to learn the cause of the movement. Captain Walke desired Lieutenant Gilman to go on board the Wyandotte—that he would join him there. On Lieutenant Gilman’s representations Captain Walke ordered the Wyandotte to stay and render us assistance, and take us off if necessary on being overcome by a superior force. The following letter was then sent to Colonel Chase at the navy-yard:
Fort Pickens, Fla., Pensacola Harbor, January 16, 1861. Col. W. H. Chase, Commissioner for the State of Florida :
Sir: Under tbe orders we now have from the War Department, we have decided, after consultation with the Government officers in the harbor, that it is onr duty to hold our position until such a force is brought against us as to render it impossible to defend it, or until the political condition of the country is such as to induce us to surrender the public property in our keeping to such authorities as may be delegated legally to receive it.
We deprecate as much as you or any individual can the present condition of affairs, or the shedding of the blood of our brethren. In regard to this matter, however, we must consider you the aggressors, and if blood is shed that you are responsible therefor.
By order of A. J. Slemmer, first lieutenant, First Artillery, commanding :
J. H. GILMAN,
Second Lieutenant, First Artillery, Act. Post Adjt.
Captain Berryman took this letter to the yard, and then ran out of the harbor.

pounder flank-defense howitzers, besides placing my field battery on the ramparts for effective- service.
On the 18th the steamer Wyandotte came again in sight. Received another letter from Colonel Chase, of which the following is a copy:

Which was answered as follows:

Col. W. H. Chase, Commanding Forces of Florida, <fc.:
Sir: Before I can answer your communication of this date, it is necessary that I communicate with Captain Berryman, of the U. S. steamer Wyandotte, co-operating with me. The result of such conference I will make known to you to-morrow morning.

A gun was fired to attract attention, and signal made to send a boat ashore. The steamer came to anchor off the southeast bastion of the fort. On the morning of the 19th the following reply was sent:

Sir : In reply to your communication of yesterday I have the honor to state that as yet I know of no reason why my answer to your communication of the 16th should be changed, and I therefore very respectfully refer you to that reply for the answer to this.

On the 20th a party of sailors from the steamer Wyandotte came to assist us to mount a 10-inch columbiad. They labored that day and part of the next with imperfect materials, but at last succeeded in placing it in the trunnion beds. On the 22d and 23d nothing of importance transpired. We have had almost continued rain since the occupation of the fort.
On the 24th, thinking it time that better feelings should exist toward us, I sent a boat under a white flag to the navy-yard, in order to obtain, if possible, the mail matter which had accumulated now since the 9th instant. It was refused by the authorities at the post-office. I then addressed the following note to Colonel Chase:

Sir : I have the honor to request that you will permit Captain Berryman to procure, or have-procured for him, the mail matter, letters, papers, &c., which may have accumulated for me and my command at the Warrington post-office. My mail matter has been refused me from the office, and I therefore make this request of you as com-mander-in-chief of the forces, and from a knowledge of your personal character.

I will immediately inquire at the post-office about your mail matter, and attend to your request. I would also inform you that you may be supplied with fresh provisions daily if you desire. I will communicate with you again.

Sir : I have given strict orders this morning that no citizen or soldier should be permitted to pass from this side towards Fort Pickens, or to land on Santa Rosa Island, and I now inform you of the fact, and also that I shall use every effort to have my orders executed. I have just been informed that some four or five men started on a fishing excursion on the island, and as they must have been ignorant of my orders just issued, I would request that if they have landed on the island they may be sent back.
Any collision growing out of persons going over to the island or near Fort Pickens would be most unfortunate in the present state of affairs, and I would request you to join me in preventing it; and to this effect I would also request that persons in boats may be warned off, and if any should land, they should be ordered to re-embark. This should be done in a way to prevent angry feelings between the parties.

Sir : It gives me much pleasure to learn of your order with reference to the passage of boats and men to Fort Pickens and Santa Rosa Island from the yard and vicinity. I have given strict orders to allow no boats to land, and in all cases of boats aj>proach-ing the island I am notified of the fact.
This morning I was informed by my sentinels that a boat with four men was approaching the island above the fort and from the navy yard. I immediately sent and had them apprehended, saw the men myself, and directed that they be re-embarked for the navy-yard, which was done, I believe, without any ill feelings being engendered. I will, rest assured, do all in my power to prevent any collision growing out of boats landing on the island, and sincerely hope that your orders and vigilance may prevent any from coming over without your permission and flag.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,	*

First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding Fort Pickens.
Later in the day the mail for myself and command was brought over from the yard with the following note:

the honor of the American Army. Through all the toil and excessive labor by day and standing by the guns at night, for ten days wet to the skin, without adequate sleep or rest, not one word of complaint has been uttered, but the most cheerful obedience readily given to all commands. Had we been attacked during those days dreadful would have been the havoc, and we were menaced every day and night, from the 12th to the 26th, by the increasing number opposite us, numbering at one time over 2,000 men. All that prevented, I am confident (for such was the pitch to which their mad folly had carried them), was Colonel Chase’s knowledge of the strength and means of resistance within the fort, and our steady and firm adherence to the course determined on from the beginning, not to allow ourselves one moment to think of surrendering unless absolutely overpowered by numbers.
I would recommend especially to the favorable notice of the General-in-Chief, First Sergeant Alexander Jamieson, Sergeant Boyd, Corporals Caldwell and O’Donnell, of Company G, First Artillery, for especial coolness and activity in their several stations.
Of Lieutenant Gilman I have only to say that during the whole affair we have stood side by side, and if any credit is due for the course pursued he is entitled equally with myself.
I have descended into particulars in many places, but I did so to show the difficulties thrown in our way in the execution of our orders, and by persons, too, who had it in their power to render us the greatest assistance.
Troops occupy Fort Barrancas, Barrancas Barracks, and Fort McRee. No guns are mounted at Fort McRee to my knowledge. On the 11th, Lieutenant Erben, of the storeship Supply, destroyed all the powder and the materials he could not bring over to Fort Pickens which would be necessary for the revolutionists to mount the guns, thus doing good service to the United States.
The present armament here, mounted and for service, is as follows: Fourteen 32-pounders, seven 12-pounders, one 8-inch sea-coast howitzer, one 10-inch columbiad, six field pieces, twenty-five 24-pounder howitzers—flank defense. Total, 54.
I have provisions for five months for my present command; also a sufficient quantity of water.
Nothing of interest has transpired from the 26th ultimo up to this date except the reception of orders by telegraph, and since by special messenger, with reference to the landing of troops, &c.
I would most respectfully request that a surgeon be detailed for the command.

two reliefs for duty. They mount guard every other day. All the casemate flank-defense guns are in good order and serviceable. In barbette I have on the land approach nearly all the guns mounted and available. I have now more guns shotted than with my command in case of an attack I could use. There are no preparations now which look to an attack on the fort that I am aware of. Scaling ladders were prepared some time since in the navy-yard, and are now ready for any emergency. Sand batteries were in progress of erection immediately opposite, but I think more to keep the volunteers employed than for effective service. The distance is too great for breaching batteries unless heavy and rifled cannon were used, of which they have none now available. Shells could, however, be thrown into the fort from these batteries. The fort can be attacked on all sides by storming parties landing from the other side in boats under cover of the night, and with a small force it would be almost impossible to prevent its being taken.
Under present orders the vessels of the Navy ordered here could, in case of an assault, render me little or no assistance, as before they could land their forces the fort would be taken.

Sir : I have the honor to report that in consequence of the recent seizure by unauthorized persons of several forts and arsenals in the Southern States, I have placed my entire command in Fort Taylor for the purpose of protecting it. 1 shall, until orders from the General Government to the contrary, defend it to the best of my ability with the scanty force (forty-four men) at my disposal.

Sir : In consequence of the disordered state of public affairs, of the reported seizure of various neighboring forts and arsenals, of my own lack of means for maintaining a secure guard of this most important fortification, and of the near approach of the discharge of most of my enrolled mechanics and laborers, I deem it my duty to call upon you to make [secure] the military custody of Fort Taylor, and to adopt such measures 'for its security as you shall deem proper. I shall heartily cooperate in my appropriate capacity as an officer of Engineers, and shall in a few days complete all the defensive preparations now required. I would, therefore, hereby ask you at once to assume the military command of Fort Taylor. I shall by letter of this date ask Captain Craven, of the Mohawk, to consult with you and give his aid for this object.

I have four months’ provisions and 70,000 gallons water, but we cannot stand a siege against any organized army, and therefore should be re-enforced immediately. Two vessels of war should be stationed here to protect the entrance to the harbor and prevent a landing beyond the range of my guns. Mail facilities having ceased through Florida, all orders for this post should be sent via Havana from New York through the American consul.

Fort Taylor, Key West, Fla.,
January 26,1861.
Sir : I have to report that no demonstration has been made upon this fort to this date. There is no apprehension from the population of Key West, but I have no doubt that a force will soon appear at any moment from the mainland. If my company was filled up to a hundred men, and a sloop of war stationed in this harbor, there would be no danger of any successful attack, or even an attempt at present. The defenses are improving daily.

p. s.—I have received no communication from the Department in answer to my letter of December 11,1860.
Fort Taylor, Key West, Fla.,
January 31,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt on the 26th instant of a communication [following] from the headquarters of the Army, dated the 4th instant, ordering my whole company to this fort. I had anticipated the order some time ago. This is the only dispatch I have received from the Department on this subject. There are about sixty men, mechanics and laborers, on the work, who are willing to take the fate of it, and assist in defending the same. I require at least fifty more muskets for these men. If my company was raised to a hundred and a sloop of war stationed here there would be no apprehension of an attack at present. The powder is not the best, and the supply of ammunition is limited except for heavy guns. It is very necessary that the Ordnance Department should attend to it immediately. I have sent a requisition direct to Colonel Craig. The fort is being put in a very good state of defense by Captain Hunt, and will be in a short time able to stand an attack very sucessfully. With a vessel of war in the harbor a landing could be easily prevented.
I transferred to Major Arnold six 8-inch columbiads, with seven hundred shells; two 6-pounder and two 12-pounder howitzers, with a small supply of ammunition for the latter; 10,000 pounds of powder. He has all of his guns mounted and in position, and is really stronger than I am, as he cannot be attacked by land. We have communication with each other every few days.
In about a week I shall have ten 8-inch guns on the gorge or land front, which will enable me to prevent the establishing of breaching batteries without considerable difficulty. The General-in-Chief may rest assured that this work will not be taken without a severe struggle.
The Macedonian passed Key West on the night of the 29th instant for Tortugas. The Brooklyn arrived in the harbor this morning and will sail to-morrow night. All well on board.
I would suggest that a paymaster be ordered here to pay the troops. Last payment to October 31.

Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, January 4,1861.
Sir: It is the direction of the General-in-Chief that you transfer the whole of your company to Fort Taylor. Be on your guard against surprise or assault, and do the utmost in your power to prevent the seizure ot your fort. Consult with the commander of any United States man-of-war in the harbor, and invite his co-operation. Such commander will probably have received orders (if they can be got to him) to act in concert with you.
Major Arnold with his company is ordered from Boston, to proceed by steamer, if possible to garrison Fort Jefferson. There is some apprehension that an expedition is fitting out in Charleston to take one or both of the forts, Taylor and Jefferson. It is hoped that Captain Hunt may, with his workmen, be able to give you some assistance in defending yourself. If necessary for that purpose you may take one or two boxes of the muskets shipped in the Water Witch intended for Captain Meigs.

Sir: I have the honor to report for the information of the General-in-Chief that I found on my arrival here, notwithstanding the energetic, well-directed, and highly-commendable efforts of Captain Meigs, the Engineer in charge, that Fort Jefferson could not be successfully defended from a judiciously-planned and concerted attack with a formidable force without having each front of the work and each bastion armed with artillery.
By the advice of Captain Meigs I dispatched the steamer Joseph Whitney, with Captain Meigs, Engineers, and Lieutenant Benson, Second Artillery, to Key West, where there is an abundance of guns and munitions, with a letter to Captain Brannan, commanding Fort Taylor, directing him to confer with Captain Meigs, and to send me such guns, &c., as Captain Meigs might deem necessary for the immediate defense of Fort Jefferson, in order that the honor of the Government and the defense of both forts might be maintained.
I am happy to report that Captain Meigs has returned from Key West in the steamer Joseph Whitney with six 8-inch columbiads and four field pieces and an ample supply of ammunition, which, with the two field pieces I brought from Fort Independence, will enable me as soon as they are in position to make a strong defense, most probably to hold this important position—the key of the Gulf—against any force that is likely to be brought against it.

Harbor of Tortugas, TJ. 8., January 23,1861.
Sir: I have to report that I returned this morning on board the steamer Joseph Whitney, towing the Horace Beale, loaded with guns and ammunition, which I obtained from Fort Taylor. Lieutenant Benson, in whose charge you had placed the steamer, rendered me valuable assistance in embarking the heavy materials. Captain Maffit, of the TJ. S. steamer Crusader, to guard against every possible contingency, kindly convoyed us from Key West.
I recommend that one 8-inch columbiad be placed in the first right-curtain casemate on the right and left of bastions A, C, and E; one flanking gun in the casemate next the curtains in each bastion.
The artillerymen will be able to disembark and transport the guns and ammunition, and from the laborers of the Engineer Department all needful manual aid will be afforded. Two mules belonging to the Engineer Department are also at your service, if useful. A casemate gun and sling cart are on board the brigantine. A truck and wheelbarrow are in the Engineers’ park. The guns, I believe, can all be in place by to-night.
The Mohawk, which at my request came here on our arrival at Key West, will, I doubt not, if you desire it, remain here until the guns are in place $ after which it would hardly be necessary to detain her, so far as the safety of this work is concerned, if she has other duties of importance to look after. Her presence, however, would, if she is not urgently needed elsewhere, be only a prudent and proper precaution.

A company from the post at Fort Clinch, with a 6-pounder, was also dispatched to the beach, which, in addition to another 6-pounder from town, made the whole of our defensive and offensive armament. When I arrived in view of the vessels I found a

bark stranded at one and one-half miles from shore, with her sails set and abandoned by her crew, who had just landed, and in the offing was a large United States man-of-war, which I have since learned was the Yincennes. The bark was one of the prizes of the Jeff. Davis privateer, seeking a harbor, and which she very nearly effected. After much maneuvering the man-of-war anchored, sent out her boats, which, finding it in vain to try to save the vessel, set fire to her, and she is burned to the water’s edge. Our 6-pounders were unavailing, and I take occasion to say that we have not a military company at this post capable of service as artillerists. Few of our volunteers have ever seen anything larger than a musket before coming to this station. The enemy can at any moment land here and take possession without much hinderance from our defensive works. We are entirely at his mercy. After setting fire to the vessel the man-of-war left our shores, and has not since been seen till late to-day. I learn she was seen this afternoon again in the offing. The name of the prize vessel is the Alvarado, owned in Boston, commanded by G. 0. Whiting. She left Cape Town, Table Bay, in Africa, on June 3. Her cargo was wool, sheep and goat skins, old copper and iron, and some crude medicines, and was valued at $70,000. She was taken by the Jeff. Davis on July 21, in latitude 25° 30' and longitude 61°. Cargo owned by Isaac Taylor, of Boston, Mass. Captain Whiting and wife, with a negro steward, were on board of the prize sent home by Captain Coxsitter, of the Jeff Davis. Whiting and his wife have been landed on our shores, with no other apparel than that they had on. I had them sent to a boarding house, and shall communicate with the Confederate States marshal, and put them under his charge. The ladies with great philanthropy have raised enough money to clothe our enemies. They will, therefore, be provided for. The prize crew are all safe, and were glad to escape in a boat from the stranded bark.

Sir : With this you will receive an order assigning you to duty according to your brevet rank, and placing you under my command. You will proceed without delay to the Barrancas and assume the command of the troops and forts in and about Pensacola Harbor. You will wait on the commander of the Pensacola navy-yard, ask his hearty co-operation in the great object of your mission, viz, to prevent the seizure of those works or either of them by any body of men whatsoever. Should either of them be preoccupied by any hostile body of men you will first summon them to surrender, and, in case of refusal, consult with the naval commander as to the sufficiency of your joint means to compel a surrender, and if it should appear to both on grave consideration that the means are sufficient you will exert them to a reasonable extent to effect that object.
Should the intruders surrender without the application of force you may permit them to depart in peace, with the promise of an exemption from legal pursuit, and if the surrender be the result of the application of force permit the captives to depart, but without any promise whatever.
With every confidence in you, I remain yours, truly,

Sir : You are designated to embark with your company on board the sloop-of* war Brooklyn to re-enforce Fort Pickens, of which you will become the commander as well as of other forts and barracks which it may be in your power to occupy and defend with the co-operation of any naval commander or commanders at hand, although it is understood that Fort Barrancas and probably Fort McRee are already in the hands of the seceders. It is probable that the Brooklyn may be obliged to land you outside the harbor, but it is hoped not so far from Fort Pickens as to be beyond the protection of its guns if the debarkation should be opposed. Cff course, the company will be first landed to cover the supplies which are intended for the fort. The Brooklyn will touch at Key West. Deliver the accompanying letter to Captain Brannan, and desire him to communicate freely with Major Arnold, who sailed eight days ago from Boston to occupy Fort Jefferson, giving him intelligence of your movement, and the intention to re-enforce both Forts Taylor and Jefferson with a company each, hoping and believing that the latter is in the possession of the major.
The General-in-Chief, by whose direction I write, has every confidence in the zeal and ability of the officers of the First Artillery.
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servant,

Washington, D. C., January 23,1861. Hon. J. Holt, Secretary of War:
Sir : I proceeded to Pensacola, Fla., pursuant to orders received from the General-in-Chief, with dispatches to Commodore Armstrong, IT. S. Navy, commanding the navy-yard at that place, and agreeably to your request submit the following statement respectfully to your notice:
On my arrival at Pensacola I, as soon as the light of day would permit, went to the beach (having learned on the cars when about twenty miles from the city that the yard had been surrendered, and that two vessels—the Wyandotte and Supply—of the IT. S. Navy, were in the harbor) to make a signal to Captain Berryman, of the Wyandotte, in order to place in his hands the dispatches intended for Commodore Armstrong, the latter being a prisoner of war. I there found no sign of a naval vessel, and learned that they were distant some seven miles. I then returned to the hotel, and after having arrived on the porch, where I had been only a few minutes, I was arrested by two persons, who said they were authorized by Colonel Chase to arrest me. They carried me to the latter?s house, where I was brought before the colonel, in the presence of some six or eight persons, and requested, or rather demanded, to surrender my dispatches, which I refused to do, as my dispatches were for Commodore Armstrong. Colonel Chase then said he would allow me to deliver them to Commodore Armstrong in the presence of Captain Randolph, then in charge of the navy-yard for the State of Florida. I proceeded to the yard in company with three troopers belonging to the State troops, and saw the commodore, who received my dispatches sealed, and they, still sealed, were demanded from him 23 R R

by Captain Randolph, who opened them and then forwarded them to Colonel Chase. 1 remained at the yard all of one day, having been placed on parole of honor not to communicate with any officer of the United States Government either at the forts or at the yard, but learned from reports and what I saw that the fort occupied by the United States had been re-enforced by some thirty or more sailors belonging to the navy-yard. The yard had been surrendered, and all the officers, with the marine guard, had been placed on their parole, and the latter had been placed on board of the Supply, to be conveyed to New York. The yard, as also Fort Barrancas, was occupied by State troops, and Fort McRee was to be occupied so soon as troops should arrive.
I left on the 15th instant, and was given by Colonel Chase the following, in order to allow me a safe passage through the country:

Lieut. Gen. W. Scott :
Dear General: The President is much disturbed by a telegraphic dispatch which announces that the Brooklyn has sailed with two companies instead of one as was ordered. I assured him that the dispatch must be inaccurate, but would be glad to repeat the assurance on your authority.
Sincerely yours,
J. HOLT.
Pensacola, January 28,1861. To Hon. John Slidell, or, in his absence,
Hon. R. M. Hunter, or Governor Bigler :
We hear the Brooklyn is coming with re-enforcements for Fort Pickens. No attack on its garrison is contemplated, but, on the contrary, we desire to keep the peace, and if the present status be preserved we will guarantee that no attack will be made upon it, but if re-enforce-rnents be attempted, resistance and a bloody conflict seem inevitable. Should the Government thus attempt to augment its force—when no possible call for it exists $ when we are preserving a peaceful policy—an assault may be made upon the fort at a moment’s warning. All preparations are made. Our whole force—1,700 strong—will regard it as a hostile act. Impress this upon the President, and urge that the inevitable consequence of re-enforcement under present circumstances is instant war, as peace will be preserved if no re-enforcements be attempted. If the President wants an assurance of all I say from Colonel Chase, commanding the forces, I will transmit it at once. I am determined to stave off war if possible.
Answer promptly.

Lieut. Adam J. Slemmer,
First Regiment Artillery, IT. 8. Army, Commanding Fort Pickens: Sir : The dispatch of which the inclosed is a copy was transmitted today, and the hope is indulged that it will be received before the arrival of the Brooklyn. Lieutenant Saunders goes as the bearer of this communication in order that the Department may be assured that the dispatch has reached you safely, and has suffered no alteration in its transmission, and also that his return may afford you an opportunity of reporting fully all that has occurred in connection with your command since the transfer of your forces to Fort Pickens. In the absence of any detailed information as to the circumstances under which this movement was made, I can only commend its patriotic purpose and express the gratification felt by the Department at its success.
You are instructed to act strictly on the defensive, and avoid as far as possible a collision with the hostile troops concentrated at Pensacola and in the adjacent forts. Should you, however, be attacked you will make the best defense of which your position and resources are capable. The naval forces of the United States now at Pensacola, or which may hereafter arrive there, it is expected will cordially co-operate with you. You will observe that it is expressly understood as the basis of instructions forwarded to you that the communication between yourself and others in command at Pensacola and the Government is to be kept open and unobstructed. You will avail yourself of this provision, and report by special messenger to the Department as events may justify or require it.
In your dispatches by Lieutenant Saunders you will make known the details of the transfer of your command, the forces which you now have available for active service, the strength of your position, the character of the preparations, if any, in progress which look to an assault upon the fort, and all other matters in any manner bearing upon your ultimate safety.

In consequence of the assurances received from Mr. Mallory in a telegram of yesterday to Messrs.

The provisions necessary for the supply of the fort you will land. The Brooklyn and other vessels of war on the station will remain, and you will exercise the utmost vigilance and be prepared at a moment’s warning to land the company at Fort Pickens, and you and they will instantly repel an attack on the fort. The President yesterday sent a special message to Congress commend-

ing the Virginia resolutions of compromise. The commissioners of different States are to meet here on Monday, the 4th February, and it is important that during their session a collision of arms should be avoided, unless an attack should be made or there should be preparation for such an attack. In either event the Brooklyn and the other vessels will act promptly.
Your right, and that of the other officers in command at Pensacola, freely to communicate with the Government by special messenger, and its right in the same manner to communicate with yourself and them, will remain intact as the basis on which the present instruction is given.
J. HOLT,

ISAAC TOUCEY, Secretary of the Navy.
Fort Taylor, Fla., January 31,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army :
Sir : My company left Fortress Monroe, Va., on the 24th of the present month, and arrived at this place this morning. The Brooklyn will coal at this place, and then proceed to Fort Jefferson. As there was but a very small supply of fixed ammunition at Fort Monroe for field howitzers, I took only two 12-pounder field howitzers and four mountain howitzers. There was plenty of ammunition for these last, but I could only obtain about one hundred and fifty rounds for the 12-pounders.
I have communicated your instructions to Captain Brannan, in command at this place, and have been informed by him that Major Arnold arrived at Fort Jefferson on the 18th instant^ Captain Brannan furnished him with six 8-inch columbiads, ten 6-mch field guns, two 12-pounder field howitzers, 10,000 pounds of powder, 700 8-inch shells, and a small amount of ammunition for the field guns. Captain Brannan states that the supply of ammunition on hand is small and the quality bad. The citizens of this place are well disposed, and when the re-enforcements arrive it can be maintained against any force that the seceders may bring against it.
The desiccated vegetables for my command could not be had in Norfolk. Will you please have a supply sent me as soon as possible? I understand that it is impossible to obtain, any fresh provisions at Pensacola.
A schooner arrived at this place yesterday, after five days from Pensacola. All of the forts except Fort Pickens were in the hands of the seceders. The strength of these forts was about 3,000 men. All was quiet when the schooner left, and the volunteers were not at all satisfied with their duties. I give you this report as it was given to me. It is probable that you may be in possession of later and more reliable information, but for fear that you may not, I here mention it in my communication.
The privates taken from the companies at Old Point to fill up my company were not regularly transferred. Will you be kind enough to order their regular transfer, as it will greatly simplify the company returns ?
I am somewhat doubtful about being able to obtain a supply of fuel at Fort Pickens. However, I shall write to you as soon as I arrive, and give you all the information in my power.
Lieutenant Craven, tJ. S. Navy, leaves this place this evening for New York, and has kindly offered to take charge of this communica-

P. S.—My having just arrived from a sea voyage I trust may be deemed a sufficient excuse for any irregularities in this communication.
Pensacola Harbor, Fla., February 7,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Assistant Adjutant-General, U. 8. Army:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I arrived on this station yesterday in the IT. S. steamer Brooklyn, with Company A, First Artillery. I met orders here which prevent the landing of my company or the reenforcement of the garrison of Fort Pickens at present. Yesterday I landed at Fort Pickens, assumed command of the forces on the station, inspected the defenses, and had a consultation with Lieutenant Slemmer. I am compelled to remain on board the Brooklyn for the present, and can, of course, only give general instructions to Lieutenant Slemmer. I ani sorry to inform the Department that I found Fort Pickens in a very inefficient state of defense. At the time Lieutenant Slemmer removed his command to Fort Pickens there were only forty guns mounted in the fort. At present there are fifty-four in position. The accompanying sketch* indicates the position and class of guns now in position) total, fifty-four of all kinds.
Lieutenant Slemmer has with him only forty-six enlisted men for duty, and thirty ordinary seamen from the yard at this station, and the latter are entirely untrained, insubordinate, and of but little use in case of attack. There are fifty-seven embrasures that are unprovided with cannon, and are only about seven feet from the bottom of the ditch, and at present but few of them have only the common woodeii shutter, presenting only a slight obstacle to an enemy. There are only very imperfect means of barricading them. Such as they are, however, I have given orders to be immediately employed.
Lieutenant Slemmer has been obliged to employ his command in getting guns into position and in barricading the embrasures. He is obliged to keep one-half of his men under arms every night, and they are nearly all exhausted with fatigue. The guns and carriages and implements are all old, and nearly unserviceable. I have made a requisition direct on the Department for the necessary supply of guns, carriages, and ammunition. The supply of this last is very inadequate. There is no ammunition for the columbiads, no cartridge bags for them, nor flannel to make any. In fact, had it been the intention of the Government to place the fort in the state to render its defense impossible, it could not have been done more efficiently than it has been done. The post is without any medical officer, and if it is intended to defend it there should be an Engineer officer sent at once to the station. I trust that the Department will immediately order that the supplies requested be sent. There are no bunks either for the hospital or for the troops, and but little bedding for the sick. I request a supply may be sent. There are plenty of provisions for the present, although I should like some desiccated vegetables and supplies for the officers. I

would mention that all of the troops will be compelled to live in open casemates, and many of them will soon be on the sick-list.
The seceders have a considerable force in and about Pensacola; what number I am unable to say positively, but they are estimated at about 1,700 men. They are disorderly, and very unwilling to be controlled. Their leaders, from what I can learn, I believe are sincere in their intention to observe the armistice, but their ability to control the men under their command is very doubtful. They are engaged in erecting batteries, are making sand bags, &c. They have plenty of means of transporting their troops to Santa Rosa Island, and can attack the fort on all sides at once. At present there is not one trained man to a gun within the fort. Should the enemy decide to attack, it is exceedingly probable that he might succeed in penetrating into the fort before my company could i e landed or any succor could arrive from the fleet. I should therefore urge upon the Department the necessity of the fleet taking up a position such as to prevent the landing of any forces within one and a half miles of the fort; this would give time to provide for the defense of the work and the landing of the troops from the fleet; otherwise we may have the mortification and disgrace of seeing the fort taken by a body of untrained troops under our very noses.
Should the armistice be broken, my company, all the marines, and as many sailors as may raise the garrison to four hundred men should be immediately landed. All of the advantages of the present armistice are entirely on the side of the seceders. I would therefore urge upon the Department the necessity of immediately re-enforcing the garrison. The two additional companies ordered to Forts Taylor and Jefferson are not immediately required for the defense of those works. In fact, in their present state, and with the forces now in them, they would be stronger than Fort Pickens will be when garrisoned with four hundred men. Captain Meigs kindly offered his services, if necessary, to assist in the defense of this piace, and I request the Department that he may be ordered to repair to this place.
Lieutenant Slemmer has done all that it has been possible to do with the small force under his command. His resolution to defend his post at all hazards evinces the highest moral courage on his part, but at the same time I must state that with any amount of vigor on the part of the assaulters his defense would have been hopeless. His resolution has* probably been the means of preserving Fort Pickens from the seceders.
Yours, &c.,
I. VOGDES, Captain, First Artillery.
P. S.—I must not be understood as recommending any violation of the existing armistice, but the collection of an amount of troops on the station as may be necessary for the defense should anything occur to rupture the present armistice.
Fort Pickens, Fla,, February —, 1861. Hon. J. Holt, Secretary of War:
Sib: I have to report that since my last letter per Captain Sands, 17. S. Navy, matters have assumed no different form. I am continuing the defenses of the fort, and with my command will soon have it prepared to repel an attack. I have now seventy-eight guns mounted and ready

for action. I will put up to-morrow three 10-inch light mortars. I have no others. The casemate embrasures are closed, some with brickwork and others with stone and pieces of wood. These will be strengthened as time permits. I am making canister for some of my barbette guns, there being none in the fort. An abatis of brush is being placed about the exposed points of attack. I have two 10-inch columbiads mounted, in order to render inefficient any battery which may be erected on the opposite side. There are two others in the fort which can be mounted if necessary. All work has been stopped on these batteries, according to the promise of Colonel Chase. I do not think there are more than four hundred State troops occupying the fort and barracks opposite. Fort McKee is occupied, but no guns mounted to my knowledge.

Having observed a battery in course of erection upon which they were mounting heavy guns, 8-inch columbiads, and as this battery would rake two bastions and the connecting curtains of this fort, I addressed the following note to Colonel Chase:

Sir : I observe you are erecting and arming a battery west of the light-lionse. I deem it my duty to protest against its further continuance, and also of all batteries which may bear on Fort Pickens.	/

To which I received the following satisfactory reply:

I am determined to make good the assurances that I have given, that no attack shall be made on Fort Pickens, and to discontinue all preparations for one, as stated in my letter to Capt. S.

I do not consider the erection of batteries on this side as aiming at an attack on Fort Pickens ; but, desiring to avoid all actual or implied preparations for an attack, I will give orders for the discontinuance of the erection of the battery.

U. S. Steamer Brooklyn, Pensacola Harbor, Fla., March 17,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : On the 24th of last January I left Fort Monroe, Ya., with sealed orders from the headquarters of the Army, which assigned me to the command of the forts in this harbor. On my arrival at this station I met a telegraphic dispatch from the Secretary of War which instructed the commander of the Brooklyn not to land my company for the present. A few days since I requested a copy of the post return from Lieutenant Slemmer in order to make a monthly return of the whole command. He declines furnishing me with it, as he holds that the telegraphic dispatch superseded my orders, and of course deprived me of the right to command. I do not so construe the dispatch, nor can I consider it as binding upon me, as I have never received a copy of it, nor is it in any way directed to me. I can hardly imagine that the Department could intend that I should be superseded by an officer junior to myself both in grade and rank, and that it would have at least informed me directly of the fact if such had been its intention.
I need not point out to you how important in the present critical state of affairs it is to have a perfect unity of command. Should anything occur that may render it necessary that my company should be landed, it is necessary that some previous arrangements should be made for its

361
reception and distribution of the whole command. It is unnecessary for me to state that such arrangements cannot be made by Lieutenant Slemmer, nor can I for one moment consent to his dispensing of either myself or my command. Besides which, until Lieutenant Slemmer declined sending me the return, I had no idea that he disputed my right to command, and I had made arrangements with Captain Adams, commanding the naval forces on this station, to land a force of marines and sailors, which, with my company and the troops now in the fort, .will raise the command to live hundred men. This force, in my opinion, will be sufficient to hold Fort Pickens against any force that may attempt to carry it by escalade. There is, however, a great deficiency both of ammunition and supplies for so large a command. The medical supplies are very limited. There are no bunks either for the hospital nor for the men. The casemates are open, and have only brick floors. At present the men are in the officers’ quarters, but these will be required for the officers, and would besides be entirely inadequate to accommodate so large a command. To expose the men to sleep on the damp brick floors, exposed as they would be to the inclemency of the weather, would soon place most of them on the sick-report.
It is important that requisitions should be made for medicines and quartermaster’s supplies of lumber, bunks, and clothing for the command. 1 directed the attending surgeon and the acting assistant quartermaster to make the necessary requisitions, but whether they have done so or not I cannot say, as they have not been submitted to me.
I think that the above statement will satisfy you as to the importance of placing things upon such a footing as may settle at once the right to command. I have not deemed it judicious to take the course with Lieutenant Slemmer which I should have taken at any other time, but I think I have said sufficient to satisfy you that it is important that all ambiguity as to my right to command should be at once removed. I therefore ask that instructions may at once be given for me to at once * take up my residence within the fort, which the authorities now seem to think is contrary to the agreement entered into.
I deem it important that the commissary and quartermaster’s department at this post should Tbe supplied with money, as it is impossible to obtain supplies without it.
Some batteries have been erected by the seceders between the navy-yard and Fort Barrancas, on the shore. These may offer a very serious obstacle to the ships-of-war entering the harbor. The troops, however, I think can be safely landed on Santa Rosa Island, and enter the fort without encountering any serious impediment. May I request that you will give your early attention to the above case, and let me know your decision?
Yours, &c.,

If the intention Qf the Department is to place re-enforcements in the fort, I would recommend that subsistence stores be sent immediately.

I did what I could to teach them the contrary. In the afternoon I took them to Pensacola and delivered them to the city marshal, to be returned to their owners.. That same night four more made their appearance. They were also turned over to the authorities next morning.
On the evening of the 12th I received this communication:
Headquarters Troops of Confederate States,
Near Pensacola, Fla., March 13, 1861. To the U. S. Officer commanding Fort Pickens, Fla.:
Sir : The bearer of this communication, Capt. R. C. Wood, Army of the Confederate States, waits upon you in my behalf with the purpose of obtaining information necessary to enable me to understand our relative positions. He will communicate to you my views, and receive such reply as you may be pleased to make.
I have the honor to be your obedient servant,
BRAXTON BRAGG, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
As I was absent at Pensacola delivering up the negroes, I did not see Captain Wood. I made the following answer, accompanying it with copies of the agreement entered into by Colonel Chase and the War Department, with copies of such other papers as would enable the general to understand our positions:
Fort Pickens, Fla., March 13, 1861. General Braxton Bragg, Comdg. the forces, $c., near Pensacola, Fla.;
Sir : Your communication of this date reached this post during my absence. I have the honor to send you a copy of the agreement entered into between Colonel Chase, Senator Mallory, and the War and Navy Departments, with such other communications as may enable you to under stand our relative positions. Please let me know as soon as convenient whether you will consider the agreement binding on your part or not.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. J. SLEMMER,
First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding.
To which I received the following reply:
Headquarters Troops of Confederate States,
Near Pensacola, Fla., March 13, 1861. Lieut. A. J. Slemmer, Commanding Fort Pickens :
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge your communication of this date with its inclosures. In announcing to you my intention to conform strictly to the spirit of the agreement entered into by Colonel Chase, I beg to suggest to you that the erection of a battery on Santa Rosa Island bearing directly on our navy-yard is, in my view, directly in conflict with the spirit of the agreement. The erection of the works on this side bearing on the channel cannot, I conceive, be taken as a menace against Fort Pickens, and the act seems to me fully justified as a means of defense, and especially so under the threats of the new administration.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BRAXTON BRAGG, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
The battery which the general mentions has no reality, and I so requested his aid, Lieutenant Gaines, to inform him.
On the 15th I made the following answer:
Fort Pickens, Fla., March 15, 1861. Brig. Gen. Braxton Bragg, Comdg. Forces C. S., near Pensacola, Fla.:
Sir : I placed yesterday your communication of the 13th instant before the commander of the squadron off the harbor. This will account for the delay in announcing

to you that the assurances given are perfectly satisfactory. Of the erection of the batteries on either side, I have only to say that our views on that point are directly opposite.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
A. J. SLEMMER,
First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding,
I sent yesterday by mail (via New Orleans) my monthly returns and muster rolls for February. I hope they will arrive safely. I was then not aware that Commander Adams would send a special messenger.
I would most respectfully call the attention of the commanding general to the fact that there is mention'of a notification being given as to the termination of the agreement on either side.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. J. SLEMMEK,
First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding.
U. S. Steamer Brooklyn, March 21,1861.
[General Scott:]
General : I wrote to you a few days since asking you to decide the subject of command on this station. Since then Lieutenant Gilman has arrived. I hope, however, that you will give my communication a careful consideration, and will see the necessity of establishing a unity of command on the station. As I mentioned in my communication, it is indispensable that there should be a perfect understanding between the troops and the naval forces, and the positions to be occupied beforehand be fully determined upon. How this can be done when the troops will have to land only when the fort is attacked I am unable to see. It cannot be done unless Lieutenant Slemmer is to be allowed to give me orders and to assign me a position, and to that 1 never will submit. I will endeav or to perform my duty, I trust, on all occasions, but I never will submit to be commanded, directly or indirectly, by my junior. Moreover, when I enter the fort I become its commander, and will be held responsible for its defense. This will be, probably, when the enemy is already before its walls, and when 1 must, of course, be ignorant of the disposition which Lieutenant Slemmer has made for its defense. How am I to be held accountable for its defense when I have not the command until the last moment ? I trust, general, that you will see at once the false position in which I am placed, and at once relieve me from it. If not, I enter my protest against being in any way held accountable for what may take place.
Until within a few days the naval and military forces have been supplied with fresh provisions from Warrington and Pensacola, but General Bragg has issued an order prohibiting any supplies being furnished to us, and prohibits the citizens communicating with us, except by special permission.
The conditions of the agreement entered into by the late Government and Major Chase and Senator Mallory give every advantage to the se-ceders, yet some of them deny the right of those two gentlemen to make it. They are not required to give any notice of its abrogation, and may atta ck the fort without a moment’s notice, and under the most favorable circumstances it will be impossible to send any assistance to the fort from the ships in less time than three hours. Should there be the least panic among the troops within the fort it would probably be taken. There are about forty guns mounted, and the garrison is about one man

[Chap. IV,
to a gun. They could only make a single discharge, and would not probably be able to reload the guns. Should those on any of the fronts be discharged too soon, that front would be left without any defense. Moreover, the garrison is kept constantly harassed, and is almost every night obliged to be under arms, from fear of attack. With the present garrison, my company, and one hundred marines, which we could obtain from the fleet, I think it would be perfectly secure from assault.
Our means of communication with the Government are very uncertain. We do not feel certain that our communications have reached the Department, nor do we know whether the Department’s messenger to us may not have been intercepted. Of course, we do not know how we are expected to act. I would suggest that a small steamer should ply between here and Havana, so as to communicate with the mail steamer from Yew York at that port. The supplies at the fort are getting low, and those of the naval forces are still lower. These last have not ten , days’ supply.
The Brooklyn leaves to-morrow for Key West or Havana in order to obtain a supply. Should she not succeed, the naval forces will have to be withdrawn. The Brooklyn has by far the most efficient battery of any of the ships on the station, and is besides probably the only vessel that could take up a position to effectively cover our landing. It is much to be regretted that she should be withdrawn at this juncture. My company is to be transferred to the frigate Sabine.
Major Tower, of the Engineers, arrived on the 19th, but under the existing arrangement cannot reside within the fort. Even was he there, not having any force to labor, he could not do much. I have endeavored to lay before you a true statement of the disadvantageous position in which we are placed, and I trust that so far as it can be done it will be remedied. Whatever may be done, I trust that we will be soldiers enough to do all that lies in our power to uphold the honor of our country’s flag, and prevent its forts from being seized by those in rebellion against its authority.
Yours, truly,
I. YOGDES, Captain, First Artillery.

I have no specific instructions from the War Department, but the course of my duty is clear, and I mean to follow it.

Fort Pickens, Fla., March 30,1861. The Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters of the Army :
Sir : I have the honor to report that matters have not assumed a hostile attitude. Everything appears quiet. Troops are being quietly concentrated and preparations made for an immediate movement should the present amicable agreement be interrupted. From all I can learn, there are now nearly one thousand enlisted men occupying the various posts and batteries in the vicinity and five thousand expected. Since my last report the redoubt between Fort Barrancas and the bayou has been occupied and made an ordnance depot. Nearly all the powder has been transferred from the navy-yard to that post. The troops are organized and apparently under good discipline, a marked difference existing between them and the volunteers who first occupied these positions. Guns are being mounted at Fort McBee. The light-house battery has four 8-inch columbiads which bear directly on this work. Another battery of four 8-inch columbiads is situated to the east and front of the naval hospital. Beport says that another battery has been constructed at the old light house. I cannot distinguish any signs of it, however. If made, it is effectually masked.
Fort Barrancas is fully armed. Guns are mounted in the navy-yard for its protection. These works are being strengthened and completed each day, and soon the position will be one which will be very difficult to reoccupy, and one which will jxrove a serious annoyance to this post. Shot and shells can be thrown from each of these works into Fort Pickens. I have protested against the prosecution of these works, but with no effect. Colonel Chase did stop the work, but his successors have continued them on the plea of being for defensive purposes. With one or two batteries established on Santa Bosa Island, Fort Pickens would be in almost as bad a position as Fort Sumter. Fort McBee and these batteries would be able to drive off any shipping and prevent the introduction of re-enforcements and provisions. I have thus far succeeded in preventing any lodgment on the island, and will consider any such movement a breach of the agreement.
It is very necessary that we should be informed as to passing events, and would, therefore, most respectfully call the attention of the Commanding General to the fact that from the 23d February until the 29th March no important communication has been received. We receive nothing but from the sufferance of the opposing forces, which at any moment may be stopped should anything occur contrary to their desires. I am now left without an officer, but will request the transfer of Lieutenant Langdon to the fort during the absence of Lieutenant Gilman.
Fresh provisions are now denied us. If it is the intention of the Government to hold this fort, I would most respectfully suggest that the stores and supplies necessary for the effective defense of the work be forwarded immediately, with definite instructions as to their being landed.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

[Chap. IV.
proceed with the least possible delay to that place, and you will assume command of all the land forces of the United States within the limits of the State of Florida. You will proceed to New York, where steam transportation for four companies will be engaged, and, putting oh board such supplies as you can ship, without delay proceed at once to your destination. The engineer company of Sappers and Miners; Brevet Major Hunt’s Company M, Second Artillery; Captain Johns’ Company C, Third Infantry; Captain Clitz’s Company E, Third Infantry, will embark with you in the first steamer. Other, troops and full supplies will be sent after you as soon as possible.
Captain Meigs will accompany you as engineer, and will remain with you until you are established in Fort Pickens, when he will return to resume his duties in this city. The other members of your staff will be Asst. Surg. John Campbell, medical staff; Capt. Rufus Ingalls, assistant quartermaster; Capt. Henry F. Clarke, assistant commissary of subsistence; Bvt. Capt. George L. Hartsuff, assistant adjutant-general; and First Lieut. George T. Balch, ordnance officer.
The object and destination of this expedition will be communicated to no one to whom it is not already known. The naval officers in the Gulf will be instructed to co-operate with you, and to afford every facility in their power for the accomplishment of the object of the expedition, which is the security of Fort Pickens against all attacks, foreign and domestic. Should a shot be fired at you, you will defend yourself and your expedition at whatever hazard, and, if needful for such defense, inflict upon the assailants all the damage in your power within the range of your guns.
Lieutenant-Colonel Keyes, military secretary, will be authorized to give all necessary orders, and to call upon the staff department for every requisite material and transportation, and other steamers will follow that on which you embark, to carry re-enforcements, supplies, and provisions for the garrison of Fort Pickens for six months. Captain Barry’s battery will follow as soon as a vessel can be fitted for its transportation. Two or three foot companies will embark at the same time with the battery. All the companies will be filled up to the maximum standard, those to embark first from the recruits in the harbor of New York. The other companies will be filled, if practicable, with instructed soldiers.
You will make Fort Jefferson your main depot and base of operations. You will be careful not to reduce too much the means of the fortresses in the Florida Reef, as they are deemed of greater importance than even Fort Pickens. The naval officers in the Gulf will be instructed to cooperate with you in every way, in order to insure the safety of Fort Pickens, Fort Jefferson, and Fort Taylor. You will freely communicate with them for this end, and will exhibit to them the authority of the President herewith.
The President directs that you be assigned to duty from this date according to your brevet rank In the Army.
With great confidence in your judgment, zeal, and intelligence, I remain, respectfully,

Wilmington, N. C., April 2,1861. General Jos. G. Totten, Chief Engineer, Washington, D. (7.:
General : I have the honor to report my return from Fort Clinch, and my performance of the duty assigned to me by your order of the 18th ultimo, so far as I have been able to perform it.
I have paid off all the employes mentioned in Captain Whiting’s letter of the 8th ultimo, and discharged all not before discharged except the fort keeper, Mr. J. A. Walker, and two laborers. I thought it best to retain the services of these two laborers, partly because the sand embankments inside the fort require constant attention, and partly because I was not able to sell any of the public property.
After I had paid off the accounts, Colonel Butler, commanding the Florida militia at Fernandina, very politely informed me that the authorities of that State had virtually taken possession of Fort Clinch, and that any sale of its property by the United States would be regarded as illegal, and that he thought it his duty to resist such sale if necessary. After some conversation, finding myself unable to change his resolution, I was, of course, compelled to yield.
The State of Florida, or the Confederate States, will probably soon take formal possession of Fort Clinch.
I have told Mr. Walker that while things remain as they are he may regard himself and his two assistants as in the service of the United States, at least until he shall be officially informed to the contrary, but that whenever the property or the fort shall be actually seized the United States will be no longer responsible for services.
There are some small accounts for supplies and for services still unpaid. As soon as I receive them I will forward them to the Department for your decision.

It will be perceived from the within report that while this property is nominally in the possession of the United States, it is actually under the control of the Florida authorities, as is shown by their refusal to permit the sale of the same.
Should the United States, therefore, continue its expenditures for the care of the fort and the property thereat? Unless the Government de-

IT. S. Transport Atlantic, [New York,] April 6, 1861—2J p. m. Hon. Wm. H. Seward, Secretary of State :
Dear Sir : By great exertions, within less than six days from the time the subject was broached in the office of the President, a war steamer sails from this port; and the Atlantic, built under contract to be at the service of the United States in case of war, will follow this afternoon with 500 troops, of which one company is sappers and miners, one a mounted battery. The Illinois will follow on Monday with the stores which the Atlantic could not hold.
While the mere throwing of a few men into Fort Pickens may seem a small operation, the opening of a campaign is a great one.
Unless this movement is supported by ample supplies and followed up by the Navy it will be a failure. This is the beginning of the war which every statesman and soldier has foreseen since the passage of the South Carolina ordinance of secession. You will find the Army and the Navy clogged at the head with men, excellent patriotic men, men who were soldiers and sailors forty years ago, but who now merely keep active men out of the places in which they could serve the country.
If you call out volunteers you have no general to command. The general born, not made, is yet to be found who is to govern the great army which is to save the country, if saved it can be. Colonel Keyes has shown intelligence, zeal, activity, and I look for a high future for him.
England took six months to get a soldier to the Crimea. We were from May to September in getting General Taylor before Monterey. Let us be supported; we go to serve our country, and our country should not neglect us or leave us to be strangled in tape, however red.

Dear Sir : We expect to touch at Key West, and will be able to set things in order there and give the first check to the secession movement by firmly establishing the authority of the United States in that most ungrateful island and city. Thence we propose to send dispatches under cover to you. The officers will write to their friends,

## p. 369 (#385) ############################################

understanding that the package will not be broken until after the public has notice through the newspapers of our success or defeat. Our object is yet unknown on board, and if I read the papers of the eve of our departure aright our secret is still a secret in New York. No communication with the shore, however, will be allowed.
Your dispatch arrived as I was on my way to the Atlantic, just before the hour at which she was to sail, and two or three hours after that appointed for the Powhatan. When the arrow has sped from the bow it may glance aside, but who shall reclaim it before its flight is finished ?
A violent gale compelled us to lay head to wind for twenty-four hours. We ran one hundred miles out of our course. The Powhatan having taken this gale earlier may have got through it with less delay, so that it is not now likely that we will overtake her. She had orders to call off Key West, and by boat or signal ascertain whether we had passed. It is important that she should reach the port before us.
Permit me to urge the importance of the purchase of these Collins steamers. Britain has already taken the first, the Adriatic. Jeff. Davis or the United States may take them. They were built under contract subject to be taken at a valuation if needed for war. This ship, the Atlantic, cost $750,000. We have chartered her at $2,000 per day for thirty days, with the privilege, at the end of thirty days, of retaining her at that price, giving her up, or purchasing by the United States at $350,000, one-half her cost. During the height of the gale she showed no signs of weakness, rode easily, without labor, and the very line of cabin-lights reflected from a mirror, which doubles all distortions, was straight and true. This too with forty tons of horses in place of port-guns on her bow, and thirty tons of hay and stores on her after-hurricane deck. The weight of 10-inch pivot guns would not therefore hurt her. Thus far we have lost but one horse, exhausted by struggling after falling during the gale.
The Baltic I hope is chartered on terms like those of the Atlantic. Both should belong to the United States. British agents, if not Southern envoys, are after them. Had we been on board a vessel less staunch and seaworthy not a horse would have been seen on deck and the ship might have shared the fate of the San Francisco.
The dispatch and the secrecy with which this expedition has been fitted out will strike terror into the ranks of rebellion. All New York saw, all the United States knew, that the Atlantic was filling with stores and troops. But now this nameless vessel, her name is painted out, speeds out of the track of commerce to an unknown destination. Mysterious, unseen, where will the powerful bolt fall ? What thousands of men, spending the means of the Confederate States, vainly beat the air amid the swamps of the southern coast, and, filling the dank forts, curse secession and the mosquitoes!
Buy all the steamships, fill them with troops and stores, start them on such mysterious errands, and Mr. Memminger will need more loans and South Carolina herself will grow sick of rebellion.
God promised to send before his chosen people an advance-guard of hornets, Our constant allies are the more efficient mosquitoes and sand-flies. At this time the republic has need of all her sons, of all their knowledge, zeal, and courage.
Major Hunt is with us, somewhat depressed at going into the field without his horses. His battery of Napoleon guns, probably the best field guns in our service, is to follow in the Illinois; but the traitor Twiggs surrendered his horses to the rebels of Texas, and the company 24 R R

of well-trained artillerists finds itself, after eight years of practice in that highest and most efficient arm, the light artillery, going into active service as footmen. They, too, feel the change deeply.
I inclose a memorandum which Major Hunt has written at my suggestion, and I bespeak your influence to see that he is supplied with horses. If, in the end, this be not found the best field for the campaign— and I am not yet prepared to advise on this point—then these trained men and officers, these instructed soldiers, may be easily transferred to another field and replaced by some company whose training will suit the duties to be performed at our destination. The major served through the Mexican war in Duncan’s famous battery, was brevetted for Churubusco, again for .Chapultepec and the City of Mexico, and commanded the battery at Molino. These are historic names. Such an officer should be encouraged, promoted, translated to that sphere to which his peculiar training and skill will be most useful to his country. I have been gratified, even surprised, at the soldierly and loyal spirit with which these officers go upon this expedition. Whether our aim be Charleston, Savannah, Dominica, Pensacola, Mobile, Key West, Louisiana, or Texas, they do not know, but with cheerful trust in the Government they rely upon its wisdom and patriotism, and not a sad brow or a complaining spirit is on board. This loyalty and devotion is beautiful. It promises for the country, if properly appreciated and encouraged, a most efficient army, animated by hope and patriotism. From such .men, and not from the pillows used to bolster up political reputations, should the colonels »of your new regiments be selected. Such men will raise regiments at their call. The soil will sprout armed men. They can train them into soldiers who will save the country, if arms can save it. All patriots should look to these things. On the spirit and loyalty of your officers ^depends the success of your armies.
I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. C. MEIGS,

Memorandum for Captain Meigs.
My battery, dismounted in consequence of Twiggs’ treason, left its horses at Fort Brown, Tex. The guns, light 12-pounders (the new canon-obusier of Louis Napoleon), are the only 6nes in our service of that kind. They were brought off by the company in spite of extraordinary efforts on the part of the Texans to get possession of them. Their firing is very accurate, and with equal mobility they have much greater power than the 6-pounder. Each is perfectly adapted to the use of all the projectiles known in the service—shot, shell, spherical case, and canister. The fire of one portion of the battery is therefore never sacrificed to that of another, as so often happens in .ordinary batteries, where the fire of the gun must often be sacrificed to that of the howitzer, and vice versa.
The men of the company are well instructed both as drivers and cannoneers, a work requiring time and patience, and it is of great importance that the knowledge they have acquired by long training should not be lost to the service, for neither drivers nor cannoneers can be improvised when wanted. The battery has with it its forge, battery-wagons, harness, &c., and requires only horses to make it thoroughly efficient. These ought to be supplied at once, as they would convert a comparatively inefficient, because uninstructed, infantry company into an efficient field battery.

Bvt. Maj. L. G. Arnold, Commanding Fort Jefferson:
Sir : You will take measures for the occupation by sea-coast earthen batteries of all the points in the harbor of Tortugas necessary to secure a complete command of the anchorage and of the channels of entrance thereto. For this purpose you will consider that a certain number of sailing vessels of the Navy will be available. They will be moored in such positions as to command the anchorage and the passes, and will themselves be supported by the shore batteries. These batteries should be constructed to resist projectiles now used in our own and European navies, and should therefore be provided with earthen parapets of not less than twenty-four feet in thickness. It is considered that no battery should contain less than three pieces of heavy caliber, and that the means disposable will not permit more than three to be constructed at any one point. The batteries should be closed works capable of offering some resistance to a sudden assault; should contain bomb-proof magazines for a small supply of ammunition, renewable from the ships or from Fort Jefferson, and will be occupied by detachments from the crew, of the troops or the garrison of the fort, relieved at short intervals.
Sufficient shelter for the garrison must be provided. For this purpose temporary sheds of lumber will suffice. The guns should be mounted in barbette. They will be supplied either by the fleet or by the Ordnance Department. The works will be constructed of the materials to be found on the spot, sand and fascines or gabions. Timber will be supplied from the public stores for the platforms, magazines, &c.
The points to which your attention is particularly directed as probable to be occupied are Bird Key, Sand Key, Loggerhead Key, East Key,

In their construction your command will be employed. The Engineer officers at Fort Jefferson will be called upon by you for their professional advice and assistance in this matter.
Plans, as soon as prepared, should be forwarded to the headquarters of the department for consideration and approval, but you will not wait for this approval of the complete system to commence the works.

Bequisitions have been made upon the Ordnance Department for twenty to twenty-four heavy guns with barbette carriages and platforms of timber for these batteries. If these arrive they will be used. If ships arrive before them, the guns from the ships will be landed for this use, fb be replaced by the Army pieces when received.

Colonel: In obedience to the special instructions of the General-in-Chief, I proceeded to New York on the 2d, and arrived there on the morning of the 3d instant, and was engaged until Saturday, the 6th, in preparing for this expedition. On the afternoon of that day Barry’s battery (Company A, Second Artillery), Hunt’s company (M, Second Artillery), Duane’s company of Sappers and Miners, and Companies C and E (Johns’ and Clitz’s), Third Infantry, and twenty Engineer carpenters were embarked on board the steamship Atlantic, Captain Gray. We hauled out in the stream at dark, but continued to take in cargo through the night, and on Sunday morning at 3J weighed anchor and went to sea. On Tuesday and Wednesday we had a heavy gale, dead ahead, the horses of the battery suffering very much from the heavy sea, the wet, and the cold, and were preserved only by the substantial excel-

lence of our ship and the vigilant care of the officers. Only two died during the gale, and the rest are doing well. My command are all healthy and in good spirits.
I have directed Lieutenant Balch, ordnance officer, to make on the proper offices requisitions for various articles which were not to be procured at our departure. I respectfully urge that they be sent immediately.
I ordered the purchase of two 6-pounder rifled guns, which are said to be at Fort Columbus, and that a 42-pounder rifled gun, also at that post, be sent, with all the necessary implements and projectiles, by the first vessel. I have also directed Lieutenant Balch to make a special estimate of guns for Fort Jefferson, which may be of vital importance,' and which should be furnished without delay.
I would respectfully and earnestly urge that six 42-pounder rifled guns, with implements complete, and one thousand rounds of ammunition to each gun, as specified in the requisition of Lieutenant Balch, be immediately prepared and sent by steamer to Fort Pickens. Their value will be inestimable. With them we shall be able to act, if need be, with great efficiency against Fort McKee, Barrancas, and the navy-yard, and place our opponents from an offensive to a defensive position. I earnestly solicit the approbation of the General-in-Chief on this subject, and that the guns may be prepared and sent by steam without a moment’s delay. James’ apparatus for rifling guns is at Fort Columbus, and the guns, if diligence be exercised, may be prepared for shipment in a week.
We go into Key West for two or three hours on important duty enjoined by the General-in-Chief, and from thence to Fort Jefferson for some indispensable articles, where we shall be delayed only a short time, and shall then proceed to our destination.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel: We arrived at this place this afternoon. Captain Meigs and I have had an interview with Judge Marvin which has been entirely satisfactory. He, though anxious to leave the place, will remain, having now the assurance of support from the military authority. I have found great industry, intelligence, and enterprise in putting forward the works at the fort, and consider it quite secure against any force that can at this time be brought against it. Brevet Major French, the commanding officer, has been untiring in his labors, assisted ably by Captain Hunt, of the Engineers, and the officers of the garrison. He and all his officers are, I am happy to say, entirely devoted to the Union and the country, under any and all contingencies. I have issued General Orders in relation to the posts, copies of which will be forwarded by the first opportunity. Finding here some 10-inch mortars, I have taken three of them with the necessary ammunition, and also, there being here two 6-pounder field batteries, I have directed one of them to be put on board the Atlantic.

General Orders,) Hdqrs. Department of Florida,
No. 1.	j	Key West, April 18, 1861.
In obedience to the instructions of the General-in-Chief, approved by the President of the United States, creating the Department of Florida, and assigning it to the undersigned, he hereby assumes the command of the same.
The department comprises the State of Florida and the contiguous islands in the Gulf.
The headquarters of the department will hereafter be announced. The following-named officers compose the staff of the department, and will be obeyed and respected accordingly:
Bvt. Capt. G. L. Hartsuff, assistant adjutant-general.
Oapt. R. Ingalls, assistant quartermaster.

U. S. Steamer Crusader,
Off Key West, April 13,1861.
Hon. William H. Seward,
Secretary of State, Washington:
Dear Sir : We arrived here and anchored some three miles below the fort to prevent communication. Going to the fort in a boat Colonel Brown sent notes to Judge Marvin; to Colonel Patterson, the newly appointed Navy agent; to Mr. Howe, the new collector; and to Mr. Tiler, the late Navy agent. Mr. Clapp, whose commission as marshal we brought with us, we found at the fort. To these gentlemen the general policy of the Government in regard to the tort and island of Key West was explained, and the assurance of support from their Government was received with great satisfaction. I found that Colonel Patterson has lately made himself quite conspicuous by his Union sentiments, and their open avowal. The best feeling prevails between the gentlemen now appointed and the officers of the garrison, and I have no doubt that all will work harmoniously together.
The anxiety to which Judge Marvin has been subjected has preyed upon his spirits and he looks depressed, but he is ready to do his duty and stand to his post, at least until the Government is ready to relieve him. His presence for a time, and his influence are, I think, of much importance in eradicating the treasonable spirit which has lately had full and free sway here. He will be able as now supported, I think, to accomplish it without recourse to any harsh measures.
The officers here assure us that the reports spread through the newspapers of the demoralization of our troops in Texas are untrue. The troops are well disciplined, loyal, and ready to serve their country. At

one time, when the administration then in power seemed to be allowing things to take their own course, and the Government seemed to be falling to pieces, the officers and men might have been inclined to look around for some refuge, but the first act of vigor satisfied them that they yet have a Government, and to it they will be true.
We yet have some 10-inch mortars which will be of use; some artillery for the land fronts, and a few other things which were needed to increase our strength.
The Brooklyn is supposed to have reached Pensacola about the 1st or 2d, and there is little doubt that as she carried the orders to the troops to land, they landed immediately upon her arrival.
Captain Craven, U. S. Xavy, of the Crusader, informs me that Captain Adams had told off marines and sailors enough, in addition to Captain Vogdes7 company, to make the landing party five hundred strong; so that apparently it will be left for us only to strengthen the garrison, supply it with ammunition, artillery, and stores, and to put it in position to stand a long siege. This occupation of this stronghold, within one hundred miles of Montgomery, must have a great effect upon the rebellion.
As an instance of the spirit of the soldiers, Captain Brannan was directed to detail seven of his men to fill vacancies in the command on the Atlantic, and telling them that he wanted seven men for the purpose, and that, as they were to go where there would certainly be fighting, he would prefer volunteers, the whole company stepped forward.
The administration will find I trust elsewhere that as here Union men enough will appear as soon as supported and protected by their Government they can speak with safety and effect.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. C. MEIGS,
Captain of Engineers.

Bvt. Maj. W. H. French,
Commanding Fort Taylor, Key West:
Sir: You will use the forces of your command, if need be, for the protection of the officers and citizens of the United States on this island in the discharge of their public duties, and the pursuit of their legitimate private occupations. You will not permit on the island any person to exercise any office or authority inconsistent with the laws and Constitution of the United States, and will, if necessary, prevent any such exercise by force of arms. If unhappily rebellion or insurrection should actually exist at any time, you will then publish a proclamation, with which you will be furnished, suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and will immediately remove from the island all dangerous or suspected persons. You will before publishing this proclamation take the advice of the United States judge and attorney on its necessity and expediency (its legality has been determined by higher authority), and receive with deference their opinion, giving them that consideration and weight to which their patriotism and legal knowledge entitle them. In exercising the authority here vested in you the greatest conciliation and forbearance must be observed, that while the duty be rigidly performed it may always be done in a spirit of conciliation and kindness.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, Washington:
Sir: I have the honor to inform you that immediately on the receipt of your order by Lieutenant Worden, on the 12th instant, I prepared to re enforce Fort Pickens. It was successfully performed, on the same night, by landing the troops under Captain Vogdes, and the marines of the squadron under Lieutenant [John C.] Cash. No opposition was made, nor do I believe the movement was known on shore until it was accomplished.
A strong party of officers and seamen were sent to assist in case of resistance, who afterwards returned to their ships. The marines remained in the fort, at the request of Captain Yogdes, a copy of which I inclose.* The whole expedition was under the charge of Commander Charles H. Poor, assisted by Lieutenant [Albert N.] Smith, of the Brooklyn, Lieutenants [R. F. R.] Lewis and [L. H.] Newman, of the Sabine, and Lieutenant [G. E.J Belknap, of the St. Louis; and it is highly creditable to these officers that this service was performed without accident or disorder under unfavorable circumstances. The Brooklyn, Captain [ W. S.] Walker, and the Wyandotte, Lieutenant Commanding [J. R. M.] Mull any, were very skillfully managed. They carried the landing party to the designated spot with accuracy in spite of the darkness of the night, and not having the light-house to guide them, the light having been extinguished early in the evening.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. A. ADAMS, Captain, Senior Officer Present.
Headquarters Department of Florida,
Transport Steamship Atlantic, April 15, 1861. Lieut. Col. E. D. Keyes,
Secretary to the General-in-Chief Washington, D. C.:
Colonel: I wrote you at Key West, reporting our arrival there, and took from Fort Taylor some guns and stores necessary for our expedition, and detached from the companies of the fort and barracks thirty-three men to fill up in part the companies of the command to their maximum organization, intending to take the balance from Fort Jefferson. These men are required to fill vacancies caused by desertion or other absence at New York.
We left Key West at daybreak yesterday morning (the 14th), and arrived at Fort Jefferson at 1 p. m. I found this post in the good order to be expected from its vigilant commander. The present armament of the fort is thirteen 8-inch columbiads and a field battery, and 104 barrels gunpowder, 608 shells, 150 shot, and a vessel now at the wharf is unloading thirty 8-inch columbiads and twenty-four 24-pounder howitzers, with carriages, implements, &c., complete, with 250 barrels of powder, 2,400 8-inch shells, 600 round shot, and a proportioned quantity of fixed ammunition, so that this post maybe considered secure from any force that the seceding States can bring against it. The whole lower tier of this work may with little labor be prepared for its armament. Some flagging and the traverse circles are the principal work to be done. On the recommendation of Captain Meigs, chief engineer',

I have directed Major Arnold to have four water batteries, mounting three guns each, to be erected on the adjacent keys. This being done, with the support of one or two ships of war, the whole anchorage will be within command of our guns.
I would respectfully recommend that at Fort- Jefferson for the 42-pounders ordered 8-inch unchambered columbiads be substituted, and that the wooden carriages of all three forts be replaced at the earliest possible day by iron ones. I took from Fort Jefferson twenty negro laborers for the Engineer Department, thirty-one privates to fill up the companies, so that they are now full, a field battery and four mountain howitzers, with implements and ammunition, some bricks, and a large flat. We got under way at 8 o’clock p. m., and very soon lost the flat. Her lashing-rigs and hooks, not being sufficiently strong, drew out and left her adrift. Lieutenants McFarland and Reese, of the Engineers, on the advice of the chief engineer, have been attached to this command.

HARVEY BROWN,
Colonel, Commanding.
Headquarters Department of Florida,
Transport Steamship Atlantic, April 15,1861. Bvt. Maj. L. G. Arnold,
Commanding Fort Jefferson, Fla.:
Major: My short stay at your post and the hurry of business prevented my conversing with you so freely as I could have wished on the defense of the fort. The importance of Fort Jefferson can hardly be overestimated, nor can I too strongly impress on you the importance of the constant exercise of every precaution and of the most unceasing vigilance against surprise. Your post may not improperly be considered the Gibraltar of America, and you should guard it with the same jealous vigilance you would if we were at war with a strong maritime power. No vessel. Government or merchant, should be allowed to approach without being boarded, and, if necessary, required to heave to for the purpose. Your guns should habitually be kept loaded and ready at a moment’s notice to be fired; a sufficiency of ammunition always prepared for immediate service, and the officers and men assigned to their positions, so that by day or night each can at a moment’s notice be at his post. Your drawbridge should always be raised at night, the embrasures closed and fastened, and the guards by day and night required to the observance of the greatest possible vigilance. The troops must be impressed with the necessity of almost constant fatigue in mounting guns, erecting batteries, laying platforms, &c., and other necessary work, and encouraged to a cheerful compliance with the exigencies of the service.
I am aware, major, of your zeal and ability, and of the excellent discipline that lias characterized your command, and I doubt not that you will have anticipated these suggestions. If so, no harm is done, and I wish, if any here made may have escaped you, that you will without delay give them your attention.

Fort Pickens, Fla., April 16,1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the East :
Sir : I have the honor to report that on the 14th instant it was reported to me that a small boat had landed at the wharf with a flag of truce, and that the bearer solicited an interview with the commanding officer of the post. I requested Lieutenant Slemmer, of the First Artillery, to accompany me, and repaired to the wharf. On my arrival the gentleman bearing the flag informed me that he was the bearer of a message from General Bragg, and that he was his adjutant-general. He then inquired whether I was the commanding officer of the fort. I replied that I was. He then stated that he was directed by General Bragg to inquire why the armistice in respect to re-enforcing Fort Pickens had been violated by throwing re-enforcements into it. I replied that I had never been a party to any armistice; that I had been sent by the General Government to take command of the post, and had entered under the orders of the General Government. He then addressed himself to Lieutenant Slemmer, and stated that he was directed to inquire of the former commanding officer why the armistice had been violated, to which Lieutenant Slemmer replied that he always obeyed the orders of his superiors. This ended our official interview. Alter exchanging the usual civilities customary among gentlemen previously acquainted, we parted, and Colonel Wood left the post. I would mention that Lieutenant Ingraham, formerly of the Marine Corps, was present during the interview as a witness on the part of Colonel Wood, and that Lieutenant Slemmer, at my request, performed the same duty on my part.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
I. VOGDES,
Captain, First Artillery, Commanding Fort Pickens.
Headquarters Department of Florida,
Fort Pickens, April 18,1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Keyes,
Secretary to the General-in-Chief Washington, D. C.:
Colonel : We arrived off this place on the evening of the 17th instant, having encountered a heavy norther on the passage from Tortugas. I immediately sought and obtained an interview with Captain Adams, commanding the naval forces here, who promised me every assistance in his power, and boats to land my command. I decided to land with a part of my force without delay, and while preparing to land, signal rockets from Fort Pickens, indicating an expected attack, hastened our departure. I got in the fort at 2 o’clock yesterday morning with the Sappers and Miners and a part of Clitz’s company. Our arrival probably prevented the contemplated attack. I found in the fort, besides the two companies of artillery, a detachment of one hundred marines and sailors. The greater portion of them I have sent back to the ships. In the course of yesterday and to-day all the troops and horses have landed, and a very small portion of stores, the landing of which in the surf is a slow operation.
In going over the fort and examining its condition, the miserable state of its armament, the small supply of ammunition and stores, I am almost discouraged at the task before me. The mounted guns are few in number—two 10-inch shell guns, four 8-inch howitzers, seventeen 32-pounders,

﻿Chap. IV.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------UNION.	379
and seven 18 and eleven 12 pounders. The guns are generally indifferent, and the carriages old and not to be depended on.
I have not been able to ascertain the exact force of the secessionists, but so far as I can learn their force is nearly 7,000 men. Their forts are fully armed, Fort McBee having, it is said, one hundred heavy guns. Fort Barrancas7 guns are not so heavy, and they have, besides, several heavy batteries, so that every face but one of this fort is taken in reverse, and if they take possession of Santa Bosa, which with my force I cannot prevent, they can erect batteries so as to enfilade every face.
I cannot too strongly urge the importance of the heavy rifled guns, with their carriages, for which I have estimates, sent without a moment’s delay, though how we are to get them ashore in the face of an enemy I cannot now say.
I am now impressed with my inability to return, even moderately, a fire for any considerable time, and the entrance of the Powhatan will certainly cause a collision for which I am unprepared. I have urged Captain Meigs to defer his entrance until we are better prepared. A collision at this moment would embarrass me exceedingly in unloading the ship and getting my supplies ashore, and we are so short of all necessaries that they are of the first importance. In the face of the heavy batteries she will have to encounter, I very much doubt the possibility of the Powhatan getting in by daylight, though I may be mistaken. The odds against her are fearful.
I thought it advisable to inform the secession general of the position in which I stand, so I sent to him a flag of truce with the letter marked A, to which he returned no answer, only remarking to the bearer, Captain Yogdes, that in re-enforcing this fort I had broken the truce.
It is reported to me that until the day Captain Yogdes entered the fort communication by mail was allowed, they inspecting the letters, and forwarding such as they pleased and retaining the others; but since then no letters are forwarded either to or from this post. The post-office should be transferred to this place, and an officer appointed postmaster.
I have my whole force employed in mounting guns, making roads, preparing quarters, and unloading the steamer. Many traverses are indispensably necessary for the protection of the men and guns in case of a bombardment, and I have not been able for want of tools and sand bags even to commence them. In two days I think I shall be able to make a respectable defense against the combined force of the forts and batteries, and to inflict more injury than I shall receive.
I found affairs in Key West tending to so favorable an issue that a part of the forces there may be scared. I have, therefore, ordered two companies of infantry to proceed in the Crusader, which Captain Adams has kindly authorized me to use, to this post. When they arrive and those in the Illinois, I shall be so strong as to defy the taking of this fort by assault, whatever may be the force brought against it. I think these companies should be replaced by two others if they can be spared.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

By order of Colonel Brown:
GEO. L. HAETSUFF, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Headquarters Department of Florida,
Fort Pickens, April 19,1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Keyes,
Secretary to the General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel: I respectfully report for the consideration, and I hope for the approval, of the General-in-Chief the reasons inducing me to urge on Captain Meigs and Lieutenant Porter a delay in forcing an entrance into the harbor of Pensacola. Aware of the desire of the Government that a ship should be placed there, and knowing that I was opposing the wishes of Captain Meigs, nothing but a profound sense of its necessity would have induced interference on my part; but, believing if the actual state of this post at this time were known that no such instructions would have been given, I did not hesitate to express my views and wishes in the case.
As I have already reported to you, I found this post in the worst possible condition for hostilities—the batteries out of order; some of the largest and most important guns dismounted; the necessary traverses and other protections for the troops unprepared; the garrison deficient; the subsistence nearly exhausted; the ammunition (except powder) not sufficient in important articles for one day’s service; a total want of Engineer, Quartermaster, and Ordnance tools and implements, and the fort in a complete state of confusion, all requiring the labor of every man in it; the steamer Atlantic lying here with large supplies of indispensable stores, which can only—without extreme inconvenience, involv-

ing great time and labor-—be landed within range of the guns of Fort McRee, and the vital importance of getting these stores ashore, rendered, in my judgment, delay in encountering hostilities of the utmost importance, and any act of ours provoking, or 1 may say assuredly and certainly causing it, to be premature and unwise.
Time with us is everything, and I can see but little injury accrue from delay. I cannot and will not see the flag of my country fired on without returning the fire, and I am desirous not to be placed in this category until I am able efficiently to defend myself and assail the enemy, which now I cannot do.
I desire that my remarks on the condition of the fort may not be considered as reflecting in the slightest degree on my predecessors in command. To Lieutenants Slemmer and Gilman too much praise cannot be awarded for their energy, zeal, and perseverance in keeping this post— a truly forlorn hope—and I trust they will receive the reward their gallantry merits. To Brevet Major Tower, of the Engineers, and Lieutenant Whittemore very great praise is due for associating themselves voluntarily with Slemmer in the day of his darkest hour, and for their efficiency in assisting the defense. Captain Yogdes had been in command but a few days, and had done everything during that time that his means permitted.

Col. H. Brown, Commanding Expedition:
Dear Sir : It is so quiet to-night that I think it quite important to make use of the opportunity to land all the men possible, and as I find that the boats carry more than we expected, and one-half of Mr. Hildas company is already on shore, I have ventured to use some discretion and land the rest of his company with Major Hunt’s. This leaves only the battery to be landed to-morrow with their horses. We will request the fleet to cover the landing of the horses and battery, and you can send a company of infantry to their assistance should it appear that it is best to place them east of the fort. This can only be determined after a reconnaissance of the island.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Dear Sir : 1 advise you to call upon Captain Adams to send a sailing ship to Key West to order up the Crusader with two companies of infantry and such stores as they can spare. The Wyandotte from long service, without time for repairs, is liable to break down at any moment, and the Crusader will be very useful in her place. The zeal and energy of her commander in this cause, too, will tend much to your advantage. The three companies left at Fort Taylor will be able to hold that place against all opposers. When relieved the Wyandotte might go to Key West to report, but at present, at any risk, she must be kept here. Let the carpenters make wagon-bodies as soon as possible. We will, by the

Col. H. Brown, U. 8. Army, Commanding Fort Pickens, Florida: Dear Sir : In looking carefully over the orders of the President in relation to my entering the harbor, I find them so imperative that they leave no margin for any contingency that may arise. Your letter to Captain Meigs, of the 13th, requesting me not to go in and draw the fire on you before you had time to prepare, is quite sufficient to satisfy me that any such course on my part would be very indiscreet, but, to satisfy the authorities in Washington, I would be obliged to you if you would address me a little more fully on the subject, and state as near as you can your actual condition, and the time required to make up deficiencies. If you think that in two days’ time you will be ready for me to make the attempt, please notify me, for after that time I shall have to run the gauntlet by moonlight, which would no doubt be a good time for an exhibition, but darkness would suit better for a piece of strategy. I know that I am here to give you aid and comfort, and keep any of the enemy from crossing over in boats on the inside, but while I will do all I can in the way of aid, I cannot do much in cutting off boats where I now am. Will you please make such suggestions as your good sense will dictate, and I will endeavor to follow them as near as I can.
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir: I would respectfully recommend that a mail may be made up in the quarterrfmster’s office in New York for this place, and be sent from thence byway of Havana. Also, I would suggest the propriety of transferring tne post-office at Warrington to this place. That post-office was intended principally to supply the wants of the Army and Navy, and those employed by the War and Navy Departments. The post-office is now in the hands of the seceders, and all communications* pass through their hands. General Bragg has issued an order that all mail matter for the fleet and Army should be sent to the commander (seceder) at the Pensacola navy-yard, and letters from the fleet or Army should pass in the same way. It certainly was not intended that the facilities of the mail should be provided for the enemies of the country, or that the officers of the service should be subjected to the mortification of submitting to receive their letters in this humiliating way.

Engineer Department, Washington, April 19,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir: I inclose the copy of a letter from Captain Hunt, dated Key West, April 11, which you may think advisable to lay before the Secretary of the Kavy. I may be permitted to add that the danger is a real one that Captain Hunt specifies, namely, the landing of a considerable body of hostile troops on the shore of that island, out of reach of the guns of Fort Taylor. This the fort and its garrison can in no degree prevent. If landed with heavy artillery this force may reduce the fort by siege, because as yet that part of the structure that is to cover its walls from land batteries has not been built, nor can it be erected so as to fulfill its object for a year or more.
In the mean time complete security may be assured by small, quickarmed steamers stationed at Key West and cruising in its vicinity, provided other demands of the public service will permit the Kavy Department to supply such protection.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : It will probably be known ere this time if there is reason to anticipate any active demonstration by the C. S. Army to secure possession of this work. With the probability of such an occurrence will come the duty of defeating or preventing it by anticipatory measures. It is not for me to speculate on this probability, but if it does exist it cannot be amiss for me to ask attention to the defensive problem which would then arise. I shall do this, although perfectly aware of your acquaintance with the case, and strongly hoping that a peaceful possession by the United States of this line of keys may be assured. Supererogation can be no crime in this instance.
If there is any likelihood now of a large demonstration to take this place, measures should at once be taken to prevent the landing of forces and munitions on the part of the key beyond the range of Fort Taylor guns. This landing can be made without difficulty unless something more is done, and thus regular siege can-be laid to the fort. This ought to be prevented, as it can most readily by maintaining an excess of naval force. The only good landing places not commanded by our guns are along the east portion of the south beach. You will see the landing even of a siege train there would be quite practicable if left undisturbed. But if two or three naval vessels, steamers being best, of course, are stationed along the south beach at points near the shore, say one-half mile, there is enough water, and they could cover all this line by their fires, and could also watch for any rendezvous of an attacking force in the vicinity. The same result can be attained by establishing two or three batteries along that shore and having the forces stationed here increased by several hundred men. The landing of men in boats would be quite practicable with such rapidity as to speedily outnumber the permanent garrison of the key, and, indeed, I see nothing to hinder putting several thousand ashore almost before the landing is suspected. This, however, would be made an entirely fruitless operation if our naval strength and

distribution were such as to make the lauding of stores and munitions impracticable, and the capture of the transport fleet certain. Along the north side the water is quite shoal, and a landing of men or stores could only be made by boats or scows of light draught, and, indeed, on the south beach scows would be the landing agency for stores.
You will at once see that if we are kept restrained by a superior field force suddenly landed, the debarkation could go on if no naval interference interrupts it. Open batteries could hardly be held against the assault of superior numbers, and might be turned by landing on the north side through Boca Chica or more eastern channels.
Thus, unless we have a force superior to any likely to be landed, open batteries would be rather unsafe reliances. By using abatis, &c., some power of resistance could be given to such defensive batteries, and they might be useful adjuncts. But the best and safest reliance is in a naval cordon and reef cruisers to cut up any expedition by the roots, and forbid it any foothold on this island. Our Yavy, being at once available, could crush out any demonstration and annihilate the fleet of transports on which reliance would be placed as the base of operations. The combination of a larger land artillery force with naval strength would be the same basis of defense, and this would afford the needed watch and give a chance of forming a line across the key east of the salt-house. I might discuss the strategy of the case much more, but it can hardly be needful. I should mention that the necessity of using steamers for dispatch boats in case of siege should be duly considered. Without this resource we might be for a long time shut up without information being conveyed. Whether the Havana and Yew York boats could be relied on then is to be doubted. On the whole, the main question is this: Are we in any danger of siege ? If so, landing should be made impracticable or useless by such a concentration of force here as to control the east end of the key or to cut off* all chance of landing a siege train and supplies. The attempt to use light-draught steamers to operate out of reach of naval vessels on the north side is to be considered and duly obviated.
I have been obliged to write this in haste. I do not suppose you will need to be reminded of the points considered, but it is better that I should omit nothing which might be thought my duty, should these considerations chance not to have been entertained.
Mr. Mallory wrote here, I have been told, by a recent mail, that when the 0. S. Ariny were ready, an attempt to take these works would be made, but I do not believe this would be tried were our assured strength such as to contest the debarkation.
I am glad to say that from what I have heard to-day the secessionists here have essentially given in and are beginning to see the error of their ways. Judge Marvin has at last been induced, I believe, to hold on to his place, and I trust that all conflict of jurisdictions will now be avoided. It is surmised that Judge McIntosh may conclude not to come here at all.
Yery respectfully, yours, &c.,
E. BVHUYT,
Captain of Engineers.
P. S.—Judge Marvin feels sure he will be here by the next boat, April 21. I suppose the shadow of destiny begins to show too clearly for further doubt. I think a turning point is passed, and u submission” to their former peace and quiet will, I hope, replace the rule of bad passions.

The main question is to be decided by the United States once for all. and I do not doubt that this decision is already made.
P. S.—The yellow fever is to be considered in sending men here, acclimation being very important. Crowding a large force on the key will endanger its appearance in a destructive type, and if acclimated crews and troops can be sent this would be a great safeguard.
U. S. Ship Atlantic, April 19r 1861—3.20 p. in. Col. Harvey Brown, Commanding:
My Dear Colonel : I have received your letter, and thank you for the very kind terms in which you express your difference in opinion with me. Believing that it was wrong to interrupt the disembarkation of stores by any movement of this ship while this most favorable weather lasted; yielding in all naval matters to the experienced opinion of Captains Porter and Gray ; knowing that the Powhatan has her steam down and her steam chimney under repairs, and that she cannot, therefore, move to protect us in any new position; informed that the best landing yet discovered is that at which we lay (Harris already in this quiet sea to-day stove the only boat sent towards Fort Pickens, and drenched in salt water the officers7 baggage), I concluded not to attempt to move the ship until, the work of the day being over, we could do so without delay to the unloading of stores.
Received your note as I was about entering a boat to examine the beach with Captain Porter and determine what place will do for her new berth. I am sure that were you on board and had so seen the destruction caused by the surf last evening you would agree with us and would think we had done our best. Your orders are commands to which I shall always while with you implicitly conform when they are given without leaving me discretion, and I have ordered Captain Gray to put up steam and move down the coast. We can get about two miles nearer, no more, and then we will be within fire and I think much troubled by the outer sand-bar parallel to the coast.
As for the other matter, the entrance of Captain Porter into the harbor at this time, I agree with you in opinion. It was only by exhibiting your letter to him and indorsing most thoroughly my agreement with it, and giving him a copy of the General Orders just published to all officers to co-operate as you desired, that I stopped this gallant officer, bent on a desperate deed of self-sacrifice and devotion to his country. He will await your orders, as I shall, in all obedience and fealty.
Most truly, your friend and aid,
M. C. MEIGS.
Please say to Major Tower that his wishes are being executed, and the sand bags I doubt not will be sent at the earliest opportunity; that GiUmore was left with Keyes.

168. The Saint Louis has gone to order up two companies of infantry from Key West, say 154. You have then here 858; coming up, 154; total, 1,012. The Sabine crew is 450; Powhatan, 300; Brooklyn, 300; Wyandotte, 75; total, 1,125. Crew of the Saint Louis, 250; Crusader, 100; Minnesota, 600; total, 950. Total force to be concentrated about Fort Pickdns subject to your orders, 3,087.
The soldiers will have six months’ supplies as soon as the Illinois is discharged. Now, what to do with them0? I agree with you in regard to the great importance of avoiding everything that will bring on a collision as long as possible. The policy of the Government I understand to be to hold, occupy, and possess what we now have, and not to produce collision if it can be avoided; in no case to fire the first hostile gun. The attack upon Fort Pickens must be made by bombardment or cannonade. I believe that it is impossible to land a force upon this island in face of the batteries of the Powhatan, Brooklyn, and Wyandotte, properly placed, without exposing it to sudden and swift destruction. If your men and means are all concentrated in Fort Pickens, every shell which enters the fort will tell its tale of destruction. To concentrate all these appears to me to be like putting the depot of a besieging army in the ricochet and breaching batteries. I think that the true mode of treating is that which regulates the advance batteries of a siege.
The sand hills of Santa Bosa afford good, well-protected bayous or approaches, along which material, men, horses, and artillery can be moved, properly protected from all direct and enfilading fire by works of very small extent, needed only to close a few gaps and to cut through a few ridges. An approach should be constructed across the open space at the foot of the glacis, and I think that a gallery through the glacis into the ditch may be advisable. I think that a gateway might be cut with advantage through the south entrance. I save the hauling of material and the hoisting of gun carriages over the ramparts. This gate, too, not being exposed to the direct fire of the opposing batteries, will not tempt an insubordinate^ undisciplined volunteer to fire the shot which will open the war.
The three 10-inch mortars brought from Key West and some other pieces of artillery I think might be well placed in battery outside the fort. The division of these batteries will divide the enemy’s fire, and thus lessen its destructive effect. The mortars, being reserved to throw out light and fire balls from the fort, may be placed behind one of the sand ridges in position to bombard the navy-yard and its batteries. Here the mortar battery would be protected by the guns of Pickens. The light battery and a large portion, say two-thirds, of the garrison I think should be placed in an intrenched camp in the woods where the horses landed. Here they could be without the range of the batteries on the mainland. They would occupy then five miles of the island. A plank road, with natural epaulement on east side, would afford plenty of communication. This communication would be protected by the guns of the fleet, which should be moved in position, and which could destroy any enemy attempting to cut it off.
Vedettes and sentinels upon the ridge could keep up constant communication between the fort and the intrenched camp. Captain Barry will undertake it, as a boat expedition shall land in face of his guns. The working party and guard, detailed for twenty-four hours’ duty, should be kept in the fort to protect the provisions and ammunition there deposited, to work the guns, and repel a sudden assault should the enemy be rash enough to undertake one. The troops in camp and in fort would be healthy, not exposed to fire or too hard worked, and I

think that all would be more cheerful, more comfortable, and more safe. The present crowded condition of the fort will, if it continues, bring on disease that in even a not crowded place will be destructive.
I have thrown these ideas, the fruit of much reflection upon this subject, together, colonel, for your consideration, and hope they will prove worthy of your approval and adoption. Upon you rests, of course, the responsibility which accompanies command,* and I defer to your greater experience, rank, and responsibility, merely offering that advice which commends itself to my judgment.
I am, verv truly, your friend and servant,
M. C. MEIGS, Captain of Engineers.
You know that tents for 1,000 men should be on the Illinois; that 10,000 yards of canvas afford means to cover the horses from sun and insects, and that ample stores of lumber, ordnance, provisions, &c., are here or on their way.

Col. 'L. Thomas, Adjutant-General:
Colonel : I inclose you a report of Lieutenant Slemmer in relation to an attempt of the seceders to bribe and seduce the garrison from their duty. That the attempt was made is fully proved by the fact that the money paid to Private McGarr is now actually in the possession of Lieutenant Slemmer. This noble fidelity should be rewarded, but the kind of reward I am not prepared to yet recommend. The design was to spike the flank casemate howitzer, and then to take the work by escalade. I have no. doubt but that other soldiers of Lieutenant Slem-mer?s garrison were tampered with, and I fear in one or two cases successfully, but have not yet had time to investigate the affair.

Fort Pickens, Fla., April 18,1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army:
Sir : Having had my suspicions aroused by letters passing to and from Fort Pickens and the village of Warrington, I issued orders that no letters or packages should be sent from or received at the post except those passing through my hands. Subsequent to this a roil of papers came from Warrington, addressed to Ordnance Sergeant E. H. Broady. Upon opening them a letter fell out, of which the following is a copy:
Broady : You are without exception the dam’dest fool I have the pleasure of knowing. Bragg-will give you a darn’d sight better berth than you have, and besides, you will be on the right side. Don’t be a jackass always. Look at Gardner—see his position. I have authority for offering you a like commission. Answer me. Where can I take you a cocktail ? My regards to Flynn. Come over and see me. I can assure you that permission to visit your wife, and in a capacity she will be more than glad to find you in, wiU be granted you. No humbug. Come over.

I kept this letter, determining to watch the sergeant and intercept other letters. The next day another roll of papers came to the samo address, out of which the following note was obtained:
What a jackass you are. I again renew my offer of a position with a lieutenant’s commission and all your pay twofold that is due you from the Federal Government. Also to Flyun. If you will help us along to save bloodshed, I can offer any private in the company $500, and any non-commissioned officer $1,000 too, with a guarantee of future provision as high or higher as he now stands. Every man who will take upon themselves to give us the fort without bloodshed, and save the lives of your garrison, will be well paid—all back pay, $500 for the privates, $1,000 for non-commissioned officers, and a commission in the Confederate army. This, Broady, I offer from authority. I would not offer it otherwise. You as a friend I believe will trust me. We must and will have the fort, but ’tis not worth one drop of blood ; but if it cost 5,000 lives we must and will Have it. Fill it full of Federal troops if you will, yet we must and will have it. Don’t be a darn’d fool. When and where can I see you? I will go over to-night, and will take a cocktail if you say so.
Answer first opportunity.
The same day I received private information that the troops on the opposite side were making preparations, preparing boats, &c., and intended to come over that night or the next. I immediately addressed a note to Captain Adams, commanding the squadron, informing him of the fact, and requested re-enforcements. A storm prevented the Wyandotte from coming out the harbor that night. I kept my men in position, keeping a strict watch on the sergeant. Nothing occurred. The next day I received a letter from Captain Adams, of which the following is a copy:
U. S. Frigate Sabine,
Off Pensacola, April 11, 1861.
Lieut. A. J. Slemmer, Commanding Fort Pickens, Fla.:
Sir : You have stated in your communication to me of the 10th instant, that from information received through private hands you have reason to believe that the safety of the fort depends on its immediate re-enforcement. Will you be pleased to lay this information in full before me ? So many unfoun ded rumors have been in circulation to this same effect that it is necessary to be cautious, and my orders are positive not to land re-enforcements unless the fort is actually attacked or preparations are making to attack it. Should your information be such as to justify it, I will have re-enforcements landed as soon as practicable when the state of the sea will admit of boats landing outside the harbor and at night, as you recommend.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. A. ADAMS, Captain, Senior Officer Present.
A storm prevented the steamer Wyandotte from returning to the squadron that night. On the morning of the 12th I made the following answer:
Fort Pickens, Fla., April 12, 1861. Capt. H. A. Adams, Commanding Squadron off Pensacola Harbor:
Sir : In reply to your communication of the 11th instant, I have to state the information I received is through varied sources, and all to the same effect, viz, that the troops were preparing to embark for this island, and that boats and material were ready at the navy-yard to start at any moment; that the intention was to land either last night or the night before. The weather having been such these nights that they could scarcely cross unless very determined, they may be expected at the first favorable opportunity. I have deemed my information of such importance that for the last two nights my men have been placed at the guns in readiness to"repel an.attack. My men and officers are much fatigued, and I deem it absolutely necessary that the fort should be re-enforced immediately. Provisions should also be landed "while there is yet time to do so by the Wyandotte.

On the night of the 12th instant, Captain Adams having received instructions from the Navy Department, Captain Yogdes landed with his company and the marines from the vessels, and relieved me from the command of the post. On the morning of the 11th instant I sent Ordnance Sergeant Broadyon board the frigate Sabine, as I deemed it very unsafe to keep him in the fort, even if a good man, subject to the seductive influences I knew to be at work upon him. On the morning of the 13th instant a private of my company, G, First Artillery, Owen McGarr, came to me and made the following statement:
I was on picket guard last night. During the night I saw a small boat approach the beach. I stepped back to see what it was about, when a man came before me. I brought my musket to a charge and ordered him to halt. He said, “ Don’t shoot; I am a friend.’7 He then began to talk to me and ask about the fort. While ho was talking three others came up behind me. They asked me many questions, asking me about the number of men, &c., about the flank defense, whether the guns could not be spiked, &c. Said they would give any man plenty of money if he would only spike the flank defense guns. Asked when I would be on picket guard again. I told them on Monday night. They said, “We will be over and ready.77 As they were going away one said to me, “How are you off for money in the fort?77 I said, “We have not been paid for six months.77 He then put a roll of bills in my hand and said, “ Give that to them.77
He then gave me a roll of bills, in amount sixty dollars. I have it now in my possession. There are evidences that the intention was to bribe my men to spike the flank defense and thus obtain possession of the fort.

the same effect should they be allowed to be sent. It is not necessary for me to allude to the reason of this unless its propriety should hereafter be questioned.
In regard to the force employed at Fort Taylor, I have not yet had time to see Captain Hunt, but fear that the lateness of the season, which takes the white laborers north, and the excitement in town regarding the capture of the black force at your post, will be difficulties not readily to be overcome.

Lieut. Col. E. D. Keyes,
Secretary to the General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel: I wrote you on the 19th, detailing my proceedings to that time. Having sent my dispatches by a sailing vessel, I herewith inclose duplicates.
Since my last the weather has been generally favorable, and we have been busily employed in putting the fort in a condition of defense, and in landing provisions and other stores. I have made quite as good progress as I could have expected. The steamship Atlantic will be discharged to-day, when I shall send her to New York. The Illinois arrived yesterday, and landed Brooks’ and Allen’s companies, Second Artillery, and a detachment of recruits, so that I have now at this post nine full companies; aggregate about eight hundred and sixty men. I have also sent to Key West for the two infantry companies there. My present command is more than sufficient to repel any assault that may be made on the tort, but the holding the western portion of this island and preventing the rebels making a lodgment on it is of vital importance, and to do so effectually a larger force than I now have is required. If the assistance of the ships could always be insured, my present force might perhaps suffice, but they are constantly liable to be blown off, and may be so for several days, of which an enterprising and numerous enemy might and probably would avail himself. The presence of a large force here also prevents the secessionists from weakening their force, and thus prevents diversion to other places where their presence would be more unwelcome. I propose, as soon as I can put the fort in a defensive state, to throw up field works. No. 1, about one and a half miles from the fort, to be garrisoned by Barry’s battery and two foot companies; No. 2, about the same distance in advance, to be defended by two or three foot companies, leaving five or six for the garrison of the fort. I shall then strongly urge on Captain Adams, commanding the naval forces, the necessity of keeping his ships, or at least two of them, so close to the shore as to be able to rake the island. I have already so requested, and it has been in part complied with, but great reluctance is felt in placing sailing ships so near the shore. It gives me pleasure to state that I have received from the Navy very valuable assistance, which has been cheerfully and cordially rendered.
The work in the fort is progressing rapidly under the supervision of

Major Tower and Captain Vogdes. Having now established something like system, I hope very soon to have it in fighting order. Guns are now being mounted, and traverses for the protection of the works and men being made) but there is an immense work to do. Our prospects are daily brightening, and I hope very soon to be in a situation to act both offensively and defensively. My command is in excellent health, and the men cheerful and in fine spirits. With such officers and such men I have nothing to fear from any number of rebels. Although most of my stores have been landed in full view and within range of the guns of Fort McRee, yet no hostile demonstration has been made 5 all has been quiet. I cannot at all account for their not taking possession of the island during the term of Lieutenant Sle miner’s command, its importance being so great and so evident; nor can I account for their abstaining to take the fort, their number rendering its success almost certain, unless from a reluctance on their part to commence hostilities, or their not being prepared for it. I think their present peaceful attitude arises from a consciousness of our ability to greatly distress them by destroying the navy-yard and by closing the port, while they can only hope to do us partial injury by a long and fruitless bombardment.

Colonel : Since writing my dispatches, I have seen newspaper extracts announcing the secession of Virginia, the taking Fort Sumter and Gosport navy-yard. Should this news be true the security of Key West and Tortugas might be jeopardized. I have therefore countermanded my order for bringing two companies from Key West here, and I shall urge Captain Adams to keep a ship at Tortugas and one at Key West, in position to protect the works at these places.

Col. H. Brown,
Commanding Military Department of Florida, Fort Pickens:
Dear Sir: If the news sent to Major Hunt by Colonel Bragg be correct as reported to me by Captain Porter, it becomes necessary to look for means to guard your communications and the most important posts of Key West and Tortugas against a naval enterprise. If the State of Virginia has really rebelled, and surprised the Gosport navy-yard, she has some good vessels, and she will very soon have officers to fight them, as Virginians will follow the fortunes of their native State. I do not think, then, that the two companies ordered up from Key West should now be withdrawn from that place. I think that the Sabine and St. Louis, useless here, should go, one to Key West and one to Tortugas, and be moored in position to aid in the occupation and defense

of these harbors. The letter of the President of 1st April, which you bear, and which Captain Adams has seen, gives you full and ample authority to call upon him to make this disposition of his ships.
The expedition under your command embraces the coast and islands of Florida in its scope, and your attention was particularly called to the u even greater importance” of Forts Taylor and Jefferson than of Fort Pickens. The value of all these posts is greatly increased if the news referred to be correct. I would call upon Captain Adams, in virtue of the authority in you vested by the President, to “ co-operate” by sending these ships to Key West and Tortugas. The Crusader will be very useful here, the sailing ships there. Here you need steamers, and sailing ships, except as depots, are useless. From his present position it would take Captain Adams half a day in good weather to bring his guns into play, and in bad weather he could not move at all.
The team road should be extended up the island to the landing. The sailors are hard worked and should be spared rowing. The plank between the gate and dock would make the road. Now less than ever would I put this precious material on the Atlantic and Illinois at peril of destruction by a rough, drunken volunteer’s shot. If one of these ships is struck by such a shot, apologies will not-restore her. Too little work was done yesterday on ship and shore.
I inclose a copy of your letter of the 17th instant to me, which I handed to Captain Porter indorsed, as you will see.* By this I succeeded in stopping him.

Arrived in New York, 1 devoted myself, in concert with the commander of the expedition, Col. Harvey Brown, Colonel Keyes, military secretary, and others, to the fitting out of the vessels necessary to convey the troops, horses, artillery, ordnance, and stores to Santa Rosa.
By the request of the President I sailed in the first transport ready, the Atlantic steamer, formerly of the Collins line, with instructions to remain with Colonel Brown until he was established in Fort Pickens, and then to return to my duties in Washington.
We had on board five companies of artillery and infantry, two of which were light artillery, Barry’s and Hunt’s. Captain Barry’s company carried their horses with them, 73 in number. Captain Hunt’s company, having lost their horses by the treachery of General Twiggs in Texas, were dismounted.
Such artillery as could be hastily collected, such part of the stores and supplies for six months for 1,000 men, purchased in New York, as could be embarked by the evening of the 6th April, were placed on board and the vessel hauled into the stream after sunset on that date.
She continued taking in stores during the night and sailed on the

morning of the 7th instant. While of many articles large supplies were put on board, not less than fifty days’ rations of any single article of subsistence accompanied us, and we carried with us thirty days’ forage for the horses.
The dock was left covered with stores, shovels, sand bags, forage, subsistence, ammunition, and artillery, to follow with steamer Illinois, to sail on the evening of the 8th.
These two vessels it was believed would carry supplies for 1,000 men for six months.
The uncertainty of the Government as to the condition of Fort Pickens, and as to the very orders and instructions under which the squadron off that fortress was acting, led to apprehensions lest the place might be taken before relief could reach it.
A landing in boats from the mainland on a stormy night was perfectly practicable in spite of the utmost efforts of a fleet anchored outside and off* the bar to prevent it. Such a landing in force taking possession of the low flank embrasures by men armed with revolvers would be likely to sweep in a few minutes over the ramparts of* Fort Pickens, defended by only forty soldiers and forty ordinary men from the navy-yard, a force which did not allow one man to be kept at each flanking gun.
Believing that a ship of war could be got ready for sea and reach Pensacola before any expedition in force, I advised the sending of such a ship under a young and energetic commander, with orders to enter the harbor without stopping, and, once in, to prevent any boat expedition from the main to Santa Bosa.
Capt. David D. Porter readily undertook this dangerous duty, and, proceeding to New York, succeeded in fitting out the Powhatan, and sailed on the 6th for his destination.
Unfortunately, or rather fortuhately, as the result will show, the Powhatan had been put out of commission at Brooklyn and stripped of her crew and stores on the 1st April, only two and a half hours before the telegram from the President ordering her instant preparation for sea reached the commander of the navy-yard at that place. She was got ready for sea, however, by working night and day, and sailed on the 6th, about twelve hours before the Atlantic.
Off Hatteras, on Monday, 8th, the Atlantic ran into a heavy northeast gale, which increased to such a degree that, in order to save the horses on the forward deck, it became necessary to heave the ship to under steam and keep her head to sea for over thirty-six hours. When the gale abated w,e found ourselves 100 miles out of our course, 138 miles east-southeast from Hatteras.
With all speed possible under the circumstances we made our way to Key West, where, anchoring off* the harbor and allowing no other communication with the shore, Colonel Brown, the ordnance officer, Lieutenant Balch, and myself landed by boat at Fort Taylor.
Here, calling the United States judge, Mr. Marvin, the newly-appointed collector and marshal, and the commanding officer of the fort, Major French, to meet Colonel Brown at the fort, the orders and instructions of the President were communicated to these gentlemen, and the commission of marshal for Mr. H. Clapp, intrusted to me for this purpose by the Secretary of State, was delivered to Judge Marvin.
Several secession flags floated from buildings in view of the fort and upon the court-house of the town.
The President’s orders to the authorities at Key West were to tolerate the exercise of no officer in authority inconsistent with the laws and Con-

stitution of the United States, to support the civil authority of the United States by force of arms if necessary, to protect the citizens in their lawful occupations, and in case rebellion or insurrection actually broke out to suspend the writ of habeas corpus, and remove from the vicinity of the fortresses of Key West and Tortugas all dangerous or suspected persons.
Having by restowing much pf our cargo made room for some additions, Colonel Brown here drew from Fort Taylor a battery of 12-pounder howitzers and 6-pounder guns, three 10-inch siege mortars for which shells had been embarked at Kew York, and a supply of ammunition for the field pieces; these, being placed upon a scow, were towed out to the Atlantic anchorage by the Crusader, Captain Craven, and put upon her decks during the night.
Early the next morning, 14th April, we proceeded to the Tortugas, where proper instructions were left with Major Arnold, commanding the place. Four mountain howitzers, with prairie carriages, light and suitable either for the sands of Santa Bosa or for the service upon the covered ways of Fort Pickens, with supplies of fixed ammunition, spherical case and canister, were taken on board.
Twenty carpenters and one overseer, engaged in Washington, had followed me to Kew York and were already on board the Atlantic.
To assist in the manual labor of disembarking the immense stores, to be landed on an open sea beach exposed to the broad Gulf of Mexico, Colonel Brown, under the ample powers conferred on him by the President, directed Lieutenant Morton, Engineers, to send with the expedition one overseer and twenty of the hired negroes at Fort Jefferson, and skillful with the oar and the rope. By some mistake twenty-one of the negroes embarked, and they proved hardy, willing, and cheerful laborers during the disembarkation.
Lieutenants Beese and McFarland, Engineers, here joined the expedition.
To assist in landing artillery, the attempt was made to tow a scow from Fort Jefferson to Pensacola, but it broke from its fastenings before we left the harbor. It has since been recovered at the fort.
Leaving the harbor of Tortugas after dark on the 14th, forcing our way through a heavy head sea caused by a severe norther, losing all the horse-stalls on the port bow of the steamer, washed away by the sea, though fortunately without destroying any of the horses, we reached the anchorage of the squadron off Pensacola bar at 6 p. m. of the 16th instant. It must then have been known in Pensacola, though concealed from the fort and from those afloat, that Fort Sumter had, after bombardment, surrendered on the 13th.
Communicating with Captain Adams, commanding the squadron, and exhibiting his instructions from the President, Colonel Brown called upon him for boats to make a landing immediately after dark.
The Atlantic proceeded at dark, towing the boats to anchor near the shore, and, while waiting for the boats to come alongside, the signal for attack, two rockets from the fort, was made t)y Captain Yogdes.
Captain Yogdes, with his company and 110 marines, had landed on the night of the 12th. The orders of General Scott to him to land, received some days before, had not been executed, because unrevcked instructions to Captain Adams from the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of War contradicted them. Captain Adams had therefore declined landing the troops until Lieutenant Slemmer officially informed hint that he apprehended an attack.
From the signs visible on the mainland and from information received

﻿396	OPERATIONS IN FLORIDA.	[Chap. IV.
by him, Lieutenant Slemmer on the 12th, being convinced that an attack was imminent, called upon Captain Adams to land the troops, and it was done that night.
Major Tower, Engineers, thought that this landing and very stormy weather had deferred the attack. But commotion on shore and movements visible from the fort led them to believe that an attack would be made immediately after the arrival of the Atlantic, and therefore the signal was sent up.
The ditches of the Barrancas were lighted up and much hurrahing was heard.
While the boats were collecting on the Atlantic, Colonel Brown and his staff, taking a boat of the frigate Sabine, under Lieutenant Belknap, of that vessel, pulled into the mouth of the harbor, and we landed on the beach between Forts McKee and Pickens. Passing many sentinels and patrols, we entered Fort Pickens by the north gate, and were gladly welcomed by Captain Yogdes and his officers, who assured us that five thousand men might be expected on shore in a short time.
I returned in the Sabine’s boat to direct the landing of all the men who could be got ashore during the night.
On our way to the Atlantic we met the fleet of boats, and which landed as intended, and put our two hundred men into the fort within a few hours after our arrival.
The night passed off quietly, and the next morning early all the rest of the command, with the exception of the carpenters and laborers and Captain Barry’s artillery company, retained to attend to their horses, were landed on the beach and marched into the fort.
I landed that morning, with Captain Barry and a covering party of men, about five miles from Fort Pickens and reconnoitered the island, determined upon a suitable place for landing the horses and for an intrenched camp out- of range of the heaviest artillery on the mainland, and at a point beyond which a boat canal may easily be cut across the island.
During the day and night of the 17th and the morning of the 18th the horses were got ashore. One was drowned alongside by some mismanagement, one got loose, swam twice around the ship before he was caught, and died from exhaustion alter landing, and one, turned head over heels by the surf, broke his neck. Four had died and been thrown overboard in the boisterous passage, so that seven out of seventy-three were lost. The rest landed safely, and were at once set to work to haul into the fort the immense stores brought with the expedition.
On the morning of the 17th, while engaged in landing the horses, the Powhatan, which we had passed without seeing her during the voyage, hove in sight. A note from Colonel Brown advised me that in his opinion her entrance into the harbor at that time would bring on a collision, which it was very important to defer until our stores, guns, and ammunition were disposed of.
As the enemy did not seem inclined yet to molest us; as with 600 troops in the fort and three war steamers anchored close inshore there was no danger of a successful attempt at a landing by the enemy, it was evident that it was important to prevent a collision, and her entrance would have uselessly exposed a gallant officer and a devoted crew to extreme dangers.
The circumstances had changed since Captain Porter’s orders had been issued by the President. Knowing the imperative nature of these orders and the character of him who bore them, I feared that it would not be possible to arrest his course; but requesting the commander of

the Wyandotte, on board of which I fortunately found myself at the time I received Colonel Brown’s letter, to get under way and place his vessel across the path of the Powhatan, making signal that I wished to speak with him, I succeeded at length, in spite of his changes of course and his disregard of our signals, in stopping this vessel, which steered direct for the perilous channel on which frowned the guns of McBee, Barrancas, and many newly-constructed batteries.
I handed to Captain Porter Colonel Brown’s letter, indorsed upon it my hearty concurrence in its advice, which, under his authority from the Executive, had the force of an order from the President himself, and brought the Powhatan to anchor near the Atlantic, in position to sweep with her guns the landing place and its communications.
The Brooklyn shortly afterwards anchored east of the Atlantic, and the Wyandotte took up position near her.
The landing of so many tons of stores was laborious and tedious. Whenever the surf would permit, it was carried on by the boats of the several vessels, Powhatan, Brooklyn, Wyandotte, Sabine, and St. Louis. The most useful boats engaged were the paddle-box boats of the Powhatan. One of them, armed with a Dahlgren boat howitzer, was kept ready to protect the stores and men on the beach from the guard-boats of the enemy, which would occasionally approach the narrow island from the bay opposite. None of them, however, interrupted the landing.
On the night of the 19th-20th the Illinois arrived bringing Brooks’ and Allen’s companies and 100 recruits and some sixteen stragglers from the companies embarked on the Atlantic. She brought in all 295 men and officers and a full cargo of stores.
On the 23d, having landed all the cargo of the Atlantic, having seen Colonel Brown established in Fort Pickens, I proceeded to sea in the Atlantic to leave dispatches and get coal at Key West, to return her to New York and myself to return to Washington.
The naval store of coal at Key West is small and the Mohawk was about to take her place at the dock to coal and proceed to Fort Pickens to relieve the Wyandotte, almost worn out, having been over one hundred days under steam without opportunity for repair.
The only merchant on the island who had coal for sale, Mr. Tift, sympathizing with those who are in array against his country, refused to sell coal to av steamer in Government employ, and the Atlantic was forced to come to this port as the quickest way of obtaining coal for the voyage to New York.
The seizure of the Star of the West, the issue of letters of marque and reprisal, and the proclamation of the President were not then known to us.
Large requisitions for ordnance and ordnance stores have been made by Colonel Brown. They should be forwarded with all possible dispatch.
The principal batteries constructed against Fort Pickens are beyond the range of the siege 10-inch mortars at that place, and heavy sea-coast 10-inch mortars are much needed. A battery of rifled guns is also wanted.
The distance of the hostile batteries is so great that I think, therefore, though annoying, will do little damage. Rifled 42 pounders will enable the garrison to dismount the 10-inch columbiads which arm the battery west of the light-house, and which are the most formidable opposed to them.
Sea-coast mortars placed in battery outside the fort, but protected by

its fire, will cover the whole ground occupied by hostile batteries, and will draw off much of the fire intended for Fort Pickens.
I advised Colonel Brown to place the greater part of his men in an intrenched camp outside. He has now, including marines and 21 mechanics, nearly 1,000 men in the fort.
A favorable spot for camping is found about four miles from the west end of the island. It is beyond the range of the 13-inch sea-coast mortar at the navy-yard. It is overlooked, as is the whole narrow island between it and the fort, by the guns of the steamer—9 and 11 inch guns. A good road can be made between this intrenched camp and the fort, perfectly protected by sand ridges forming natural epaulements from all horizontal fire for nine-tenths of the distance. A boat channel can be easily cut through the island just above it, and this may enlarge to a navigable inlet. Here the men and horses would be healthy, safe from annoyance and from fire.
The fort itself, it appears to me, should be treated like the batteries in front of besieging parallels. Men enough to work the guns in use and to protect it againt a sudden dart should be kept in it, and none others exposed to fire.
Thus treated, so long as the United States maintains a naval supreme acy off Pensacola, it appears to me that Fort Pickens can be held with little loss of life.
As Fort Sumter, I learned at Key West, has been bombarded and taken, I presume that the farce of peace so long kept up at Pensacola while planting batteries against the United States will soon terminate, and that the entrance of troops, provisions, munitions, and ordnance, by steam and sail, under the guns of our squadron and of our fortress, to be turned against both whenever convenient to do so, will be stopped.
The enemy did not seem to be ready to commence hostilities. They stopped the papers on the night of our arrival, l'6th, and of the next mail they allowed, I understand, only two letters to come off to the squadron, both from Southern States. They informed the garrison that Fort Sumter had surrendered without bloodshed; that General Scott had resigned; that Virginia had seceded ; that Pennsylvania troops passing through Baltimore to the defense of Washington had been robbed of 8,000 stand of arms, &c., but they continued to work the naval foundery night and day, Sundays included, casting, as was reported, solid shot for their 10-inch and other guns, and they moved artillery from Fort McRee to other positions in preparation for hostilities.
Fort Pickens, Fort Taylor, and Fort Jefferson need much to put them beyond all hazard from the attack of a naval power. Upon these wants I shall have the honor of making a detailed report.
Orders were given by Colonel Brown, as commanding the new Military Department of Florida, for the fortification of the Tortugas Keys, so as, in connection with vessels of the Kavy moved in proper positions, to command the whole anchorage. At present a fleet could enter that harbor and find secure anchorage without exposing a single ship to the fire of Fort Jefferson.
Orders were also given to the commander at Key West and to the Engineer officer, Captain Hunt, to prepare plans for intrenchments to prevent a hostile landing on the island of Key West.
Fort Taylor, with a brick and concrete scarp exposed toward the island, from which it is only 300 yards distant, cannot resist a landing, and is no better fitted to withstand bombardment than Fort Sumter. The burning woodwork of its barracks would soon drive out its garrison.
I add an approximate estimate of the United States forces on and

about Santa Rosa Island, said to be opposed by about 5,000 to 7,000 men on the mainland.

The Mohawk, at Key West, is ordered up to relieve the Wyandotte; and the St. Louis is at Key West, believed to be under orders for the Tortugas. Crusader is here to return to Key West in a day or two.
The expedition is under great obligations to the sailors of the fleet, who were ready and untiring in the severe labor of landing horses, ordnance, and stores of all kinds upon the sea beach, exposed at times to a heavy surf, which killed one horse and bilged several boats.
Lieutenants Brown, of the Powhatan, and Lewis, of the. Sabine, remained on board the Atlantic for several days, directing the boats and seamen, and were of the greatest assistance to us.
Captain Gray, commanding this steamer, the Atlantic, deserves the thanks of the Government. None could exceed him in efforts for the success of the expedition and for the well-being and comfort of all on board. Night and day he and his crew worked at their posts embarking or disembarking men and stores. His skillful seamanship carried the vessel with the loss of only four horses through a most severe gale which lasted for thirty-six hours, and his watchfulness narrowly saved her from collision with a large vessel at night and during the height of the storm.
I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

Captain of Engineers.

Order:
Colonel Brown thinks it probable that an attempt may be made by General Bragg to land forces on Santa Bosa Island with a view of making approaches by land against Fort Pickens, in which case he asks the co-operation of the squadron to prevent it. You will therefore have as many men ready to land as can be spared with safety to your ship. The signal of danger will be two rockets thrown up from the fort, which are to be answered by the ships. On seeing this signal you will immediately have your boats manned and armed for service. A detachment of soldiers will leave the fort at the same time, and march along the beach on the sea side toward the ships, displaying two red lights. They will form near the beach, opposite the ships, to cover the landing of the seamen. Their position being known by the red lights, the boats will land as near them as possible, and the men formed to unite with the soldiers in executing whatever orders are given by the commanding officer.
H. A. ADAMS,
Captain, U. S. Navy, Senior Officer Present.
Headquarters Department of Florida,
Fort Pickens, May 2, 1861. Lieut. Col. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel : I have heretofore addressed my official communications to Colonel Keyes, because he, as the agent of the President as well as military secretary of the General-in-Chief, superintended the fitting out of the expedition for the relief of the fort, which expedition was then a secret one. The reasons for secrecy no longer existing, I address my letter, according to regulations, to you. Since my last letter to Colonel Keyes nothing of special interest has occurred. We have been unceasingly employed with my whole force and part of the ship’s in preparing the fort for defense and in unloading the Illinois. Some idea of the condition of the fort for defense may be had when it is considered that every day (one Sunday excepted) since the 17th of April, the day of my arrival, 1 have had from 1,000 to 1,200 men constantly at work, and of these, 800 have been employed on the work; and although we have achieved quite as much as I expected, we want a fortnight more of work before we shall be fully prepared to resist the numerous batteries and heavy guns that are bearing all around on us. The enemy are equally busy, having large numbers at work on several batteries which are visible to us, and judging by the number of men we see around one or two other places, I think; that they have at least two other batteries we cannot see. All the guns excepting those of the forts seem of large caliber, 8 or 10 inch columbiads.
We can see one battery (No. 1) at the navy-yard; one (Ko. 2) in the rear of Warrington church—a large work, looking like an instruction camp; No. 3, near the barracks—no guns can be seen in it; a little southwest of the fort, and near the old light house, a battery (Ko. 4) of four guns, very much concealed; and south of the new light-house another (No. 5) of four guns, plainly to be seen. There is probably one more between this and Fort McBee. These batteries and the forts enfilade and take in reverse every face and curtain of this work but one.

## p. 401 (#417) ############################################

﻿Chap. IV.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------UNION.	401
Fort McBee takes in reverse one more important battery, which is exposed front, flank, and rear to heavy and numerous guns (Plan D).* I have no apprehensions whatever of an attack by escalade, as I think I can whip them in open field; and in a very few days, by the able assistance of Major Tower, I shall be so protected from bombardment as, I hope, to be able to hold the fort a long time.
A man presented himself a few nights since to one of my sentinels, pretending to be a Northern man and a reporter of a newspaper. He brought us valuable information, and thinking his safety might be jeopardized if he returned, I sent him on board the Powhatan. Captain Porter suspected him, and there is but little doubt of his being a Southerner and a spy, as the inclosed letter, marked A, will show. He tore the original up, and scattered the fragments in a spit-box. Captain Porter had them collected and pasted together. Two days afterwards a constable or sheriff came over, under a flag, with a warrant against him for theft. I dismissed him without any name.
My command continues comparatively healthy, although the men are worked hard. In the hurry and confusion of our sudden departure from New York, articles of the first importance, which had been prepared and ready to go on board ship, were left behind, and others of little importance shipped; among the former, some 8 or 10 inch shells, which, as reported to me, were in a lighter alongside the Atlantic, and yet not taken on board. A special request to have them put on board the Illinois was also neglected, and not one of the former came. I have by borrowing of the Navy obtained enough of the latter for immediate service, and one hundred of the former, so that I have now 150—not enough for one day’s continuous firing. There are a great many guns in the fort, most of them from want of shell useless. There are twelve 32 or 42 pounder rifled guns. With a full supply of elongated balls [they] would be of inestimable value, and I earnestly hope that some of this kind are, in compliance with my former requisition, nowon the way here, as also four sea-coast 10-inch mortars, and the 8 and 10 inch shells which were left behind. The 10-inch siege mortars will barely reach the navy-yard, and will not be so efficient as they should be, though I hope with the maximum charges to render them effective. I have a battery of two mortars in the ditch, and am now building another about half a mile from the first, where I also propose to erect a battery of heavy guns, if the enemy gives us time and I can get them.
I am no further enlightened than when I last wrote on the cause of delay in their opening fire on us. Every day makes me feel more secure of making an efficient defense, and in a very few days my defensive preparations will be complete. I learn from several sources that the Montgomery and Pensacola Bailroad is not finished by eight miles, and that they have two bridges yet to build.
Having received unofficial information that the President has issued a proclamation blockading the ports of the seceding States, I requested a conference with Captain Adams, commanding the naval forces, and asked him if he would not feel himself authorized to anticipate its official reception. Having also heard that a vessel loaded with an Armstrong gun and ammunition is on her way here from Charleston, I asked the captain if he would examine vessels entering the port, and stop such as have articles contraband of war. He said that his orders were to act strictly on the defensive; that a sufficient time has elapsed since the date of the proclamation for him to have received official notice of

it if it were published, and as he has received no such notice he did not feel at liberty in any manner to alter the existing status. The next day I renewed the subject in a letter, a copy of which I send you (B) with his answer (C), in which he accedes to my wishes that vessels having articles contraband of war on board shall be stopped, and Captain Porter, with the Powhatan and a small schooner I let him have, is now boarding all vessels entering the harbor.
Major Arnold reports all well at Fort Jefferson; that ne is busily engaged in strengthening his post, and that he considers himself capable of repelling any force that can be brought by the rebels against him.
At Key West the secession feeling fomented by the Confederate* Secretary of the Navy still prevails among some influential citizens. Major French’s policy has been, I fear, too tampering, and he has not taken sufficiently active measures in strengthening the Union party and fostering the Union feeling. I have therefore given him peremptory orders (letter D) on the subject. I do not consider Key West to be sufficiently garrisoned, and have therefore ordered Major French, in case of the arrival of troops there on their way north, to detain two full companies (letter E). Should no troops be expected to touch there, I respectfully recommend that two companies of regulars or four of volunteers be immediately sent to that place. A small steamer or steam-tug—one that is fast and of light draught of water—would render us very great service. I have chartered a small schooner, but have had to let the Navy have her for overhauling vessels attempting to enter the harbor, and besides a sail vessel is not suitable for our purposes.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Dear Sir : The inclosed letter will give you a pretty good idea of our uspy.w He tore it up and threw the pieces into a spit-box. I had them collected and put together. All his movements are watched. He wrote another yesterday, which I shall get hold of before long. Please save the inclosed for me. I shall probably be pulling about the channel and harbor to-night or to-morrow night. Will you direct your guard-boat to keep clear of me! I shall be in a black double-banked boat, and the enemy have none such. If the guard-boat gets close to us, the watch word is “ Bragg.”
A little pilot-boat schooner chartered by the Army arrived here yesterday. She would be a great acquisition to us for certain purposes, while here doing nothing. I am to act as guard-ship hereafter, and prevent the inside people from receiving munitions of war. The schooner would be a great assistance in enabling me to cut off fast sailing vessels. If you have the authority, do you not think that it would be well to keep her here? I will mount a rifle gun on her. Captain Adams has appointed the Wyandotte to assist me, but she draws fifteen feet of water, and could not chase those fellows over the shoal spots, and her machinery is defective. I could do more with the schooner, particularly with a breeze.
I am, very truly and respectfully, yours,

Capt. H. A. Adams, Commanding Naval Forces off Pensacola: Captain: I received yesterday the lanterns and your order, for which I am much obliged. We are sadly deficient in 8-inch shell for one sea-coast howitzer, to act against the navy-yard. I am told that' you have some. If you have and can spare a part of them it will greatly relieve me. I am also told that the Brooklyn has an abundance of 9-inch shell guns, and I would submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a naval battery near the fort of, say, three of those guns, to be manned and fought exclusively by the Navy. Their co-operation in this manner would be of the most essential importance, and the Navy associated with the Army in the defense of this fort would cause a generous emulation between the two services promotive of the best feeling. I am told that a vessel is now on her way from Charleston to this place, loaded with an Armstrong gun, ammunition, and projectiles. It is of vital importance to us that such a gun should not be used against us, and I cannot but think that with the information we now have of hostilities having actually commenced, you will be warranted in detaining her, or any other vessel having articles contraband of war, and I would suggest whether your not doing so might not be unfavorably received at home. I do not, under present existing circumstances, propose capturing the vessel, but only that entrance to this harbor should be prohibited.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Col. H. Brown, Commanding Department of Florida, Fort Pickens: Sir: I fully concur with you in the propriety of preventing munitions of war from being carried into Pensacola, and have given the necessary orders to that effect. The establishment of a naval battery on shore seems to me at this time almost impracticable. Our men are exhausted by hard work, which is still accumulating, and diminished by sickness and detachments. The remainder are necessary for the care and defense of the ships, and for landing parties to co-operate with you. Officers we have none. I am hourly looking for the arrival of Flag Officer String-ham, to whom I will refer your proposal immediately. He will have a fresh crew and officers to spare. In the mean time I would suggest that a place for the battery be selected and prepared for the guns by laying platforms, &e. They are very heavy, and will require solid foundations.

Major: Your communication of 24th ultimo, regarding affairs at Key West, is received.
The colonel commanding approves your reasons for not cutting the brush and undergrowth on the island, and you will, therefore, leave it uncut. The purchase of the schooner is also approved, but the colonel thinks it might have been better to submit the matter to the proper authority in Washington. Your proposed purchase of mules is approved, and you will send them here by the first opportunity. As soon as possible, endeavor to learn certainly whether Judge Marvin intends to resign, and if he does, direct him to report the fact to Washington immediately—by the Illinois, if possible. The colonel further directs that you ascertain definitely whether the State courts acknowledge allegiance to the United States. If they do, you will protect them fully in the discharge of their legitimate duties,* if not, you will forbid and prevent their sessions. You will give the new Federal appointments your full support and countenance.
In no case must any other flag than our national one be permitted to fly over any public building, or any body of men, doing or organized to do, anything belonging to the duties of the Federal Government. Should the necessity arise, you will be directed in your course by the letter of instructions to the colonel, and be firm and decided in executing your orders. You will go to Mr. Patterson, and having shown the authority of the colonel, will request him to furnish steamers in government employ with coal in cases of necessity. The colonel will address him personally on the subject.

Capt. T. A. M. Craven, Commanding U. S. Steamer Crusader: Captain: I have it from a reliable source that certain citizens of Tampa have threatened to burn the steamer Salvor and destroy the property of her owner, on the ground that he took cattle to the Tortu-gas for the use of the United States troops. It is absolutely essential to these keys that the communications with the mainland be uninterrupted, and I would respectfully suggest for your consideration the advantage of a military demonstration in the localities liable to be troublesome, giving those people who are disposed to annoy an opportunity for a little serious reflection upon the fact that they receive no immunity from this quarter. There are buildings at Fort Brooke which did belong to the Government. I am not aware that they have reverted to the State or to individuals. Should this be so, and you should be obliged to act strongly, sacrificing them might produce the desired effect without further procedure. Should you desire material or additional men they will readily be furnished upon your requisition.

J. P. Baldwin, Esq., Mayori Key West City:
My Dear Sir: I proposed on yesterday to print an address to the citizens of the United States on Key West. The address was delayed, and I take the opportunity to say to you, in continuation of the conversation had a few days since, that from circumstances brought to my attention direct, and from reliable sources, it is my opinion that there will be a strong effort made to distress the inhabitants of this key. Isolated and shut up by the water of the Gulf, should what I hear prove correct, the distress would be extreme upon the inhabitants of the island. It is in your power to aid in avoiding this contingency, which, whether near or remote, will be terrible when it comes. I have served in Florida during the early wars, and remember the distress of the inhabitants of Saint Augustine, to whom the government had to furnish subsistence. It is probable that such may be the case on the key. The government determining to hold it will be responsible for its loyal citizens; and should the necessities referred to arise, it will be necessary to discriminate, and those who do not belong here should be so notified.
It is also essential that it should be generally known that the functions of the commanding officer on Key West, ex officio, embrace during the present crisis all the military, including citizens desirous to bear arms for the preservation of life and property. It will be necessary for me,

Headquarters Troops at Key West,
Fort Taylor, May 5,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. 8. Army:
Colonel : The Illinois, from Fort Pickens, is in coaling, and knowing the anxiety of the Government with respect to the insulated forts, Taylor and Jefferson, I communicate direct. This key is in an excellent state for defense. The few suggestions given by me to Captain Meigs are all that will be required until winter. The more men the more disease. I have used my general authority to mount a section of Light Company K, and expect acclimated horses from the Havana in a few days, cheap and hardy. With these the island can be patrolled, vedettes kept up, and light guns moved rapidly.
The sentiment on the key is strictly selfish. The Union man to-day is the disunionist of the morrow. My effort has been to make it the interest of the citizens to be loyal, to encourage the Union men, and to lift up the faint-hearted. The judiciary (Federal) have had but little to act upon. I call upon them officially, indirectly. Brought up and resident with the citizens, it might at this time compromise. I have made myself acquainted with the respectable inhabitants under the same rules and formalities which exist elsewhere. The effect has been to open the trial sooner than might have been anticipated. Everything which should have been for sale, after a refusal, when Captain Meigs passed by on the Atlantic North, is now given—coal, water, wharfage. I am opening propositions through Colonel Patterson, naval officer, to buy out for the Government at reduced rates water lines, &c. I have asked from the mayor of Key West lists of the inhabitants, extra mouths, &c., which will have to be fed by the United States. Extraneous people will have to leave. Now there are not ten barrels of flour for sale on the island. Military organizations have been directed to make to me {ex officio) their rolls. No more troops are needed; water is scarce, not doubtful, and the command is equal to every occasion. My position has required me to take responsibility. This I never shrink from. I have the confidence of my officers and the loyalty of the rank and file. Indorse my recommendations, as they are moderate. This place is safe.

Headquarters Department of Florida,
Fort PickeriSj Pensacola, May 13, 1861. Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel : Since my last nothing of interest has occurred, and no demonstration of any kind been made by the enemy. He continues strengthening his batteries, but I cannot perceive that he has erected any new ones. The Florida and Alabama Railroad has been finished, and he has received some large guns and mortars; but, so far as I can discover, he is rather making defensive than offensive preparations. My command has been unceasingly employed in unloading ships, storing provisions and stores, and in putting up works for the protection of the men and guns in the fort, and for bombarding the enemy without. The most important would ere this have been finished but for the want of sand bags, which is so important that I had to send an officer to Havana to purchase them or gunny-bags. Major Tower states that he made a requisition for 100,000, and sent it to Washington by Lieutenant Gilman in March, and no notice has yet been taken of it, although two steamers have since then arrived, by one of which (the Philadelphia) they might have been sent.
Having understood that there were three sea-coast 10-inch mortars at Tortugas, I have ordered two of them here. I am also in daily expectation of the schooner Perrin, which sailed from New York about the 17th of April. When she arrives we shall have, it is hoped, every article necessary for offensive operations, of many of the most essential of which we are now sadly deficient.
Great abuse of the flag of truce having in two or three instances occurred, I wrote General Bragg the letter marked A, and sent it by Captain Hartsuff, assistant adjutant-general. In the afternoon of the same day his aid, Captain Wood, accompanied by Captain Stevens, of the Engineers, came to the wharf, where I met them. He brought me a letter from General Bragg, addressed to me commanding Fort Pickens. I told Captain Wood that I was by order of my Government in command of the Department of Florida; as such I had addressed General Bragg, and that I could receive no official communication that did not recognize me as such. He carried back the letter, and I have since heard nothing on the subject. But no objectionable movements have since taken place. On the 7th two steamers appeared off the bar. They were brought to by the Powhatan and Brooklyn, and afterwards x>er-mitted by Captain Adams to return to Mobile. I inclose letters B, C, and D on this subject.	*
My sick list is increasing, attributable, I think, to hard labor in a hot sun. None of the cases are very serious. I have lost two by death and two by desertion. I earnestly renew my application lor a fast-sailing steamer or steam-tug of light draught of water. Two would be better than one. Their necessity can hardly be overestimated.
Since my last the mortar battery north of the fort has been finished and the mortars put in it, and I shall in a day or two have one for four 8-inch howitzers completed near the same place. I propose also com-

mencing this week near the sea-beach, and to the east of these batteries and about six hundred yards from them, a battery for three 10-inch col-umbiads, and afterwards another for the same number of columbiads in a place yet to be selected. These finished, the guns and shells received, I hope to be able to give a good account of my command.
Company G, First Artillery (the old company), is so tainted with scurvy as to be of little or no service to me, and the disease increasing daily, I have on the certificate and recommendation of the senior assistant surgeon ordered them to Fort Hamilton (vide letter E). I have been induced to this by the long and distinguished services of this company at this place, by the report of the surgeon that a Northern climate was necessary to the recovery of their health, by the conviction that they would be of but little service to me, and by the fact that they can be sent to the North without any expense to the Government. I trust that my action will meet the approval of the General-in-Chief. I have attached the newly-joined men to Company A, First Artillery. I have directed Major French to send me by the first opportunity one of the companies now at Key West. I am amply strong to hold this fort against any force the enemy can bring against it, but not to prevent a lodgment on the island by a large force, which they can in one night throw on it, and I have therefore reluctantly ordered a company from Key West, where I think they are not strong enough; but this place is of the most pressing importance at present.
I have not received any orders or official communications, but see by the papers that affairs have materially changed since I received my instructions to act only on the defensive. Is it the intention of the Government that the same orders should govern me, or may I, if occasion offer, take the offensive ?
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brig. Gen. Braxton Bragg, Commanding Troops in Florida:
Sir : I respectfully call your attention to what I conceive an abuse of the rights and i>rivileges of a flag of truce* This morning a steamer came to the wharf of this post with a flag, in which, besides the bearer, were a number of officers of your command and some citizens with spyglasses, the professed object of the flag being to bring a private letter from a lady to a subaltern officer of my command.
A steamer a few days since, also with officers of your command on board, visited one of the ships off this post, and in going and returning, instead of keeping in a direct line, coasted along the shore on both sides as close to this fort as she with safety could.
These both-are, in my judgment, gross abuses of the flag, and I trust you will cause them to be immediately corrected. I observe and cause to be observed by my command strictly the laws of war in such cases, and expect a like observance on your part.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Capt. H. A. Adams, Commanding Naval Forces off Pensacola:
Captain : I deem it my duty to call your attention to the importance to the defense of this fort of excluding all steamers from the harbor. Their introduction would be of essential injury to us and benefit to the enemy, so that every possible precaution should, I think, be used to prevent it. I think that under no circumstances should a steamer or a vessel loaded with forage or provisions or articles contraband of war be permitted to enter. All those articles are for the consumption of the army of the enemy, and we, by permitting their introduction, are really feeding our enemies, and giving them the means of assailing us. We have information, which, though not official, is authentic, that our steamers have been seized and appropriated by the enemy; that he has issued letters of marque, and is fitting out privateers, and that our officers have been taken prisoners, our property stolen, and that one of your own officers is now a prisoner in his hands. IJnder these circumstances, should not effective measures be taken to stop all vessels? I certainly think so. Permit me to suggest that the passage at the north of the island and the landing of the Perdido should be strictly watched, and that every possible exertion should be used to prevent the introduction of supplies of any and every kind.

U. S. Frigate Sabine,
Off Pensacola^ May 8,1861. Col. Harvey Brown, U. S. Army, Fort Pickens:
Colonel : I have given orders to the guard-vessels to allow no provisions to enter Pensacola Harbor. In the absence of all instructions with regard to the blockade, I do not know how to proceed towards foreign ships, which by the laws and customs of nations are usually allowed a certain time to come and go after the declaration of a blockade, nor towards those coasting vessels which exhibit a license from the U. S. Government. My doubts on this subject prevented me from making prizes of the two steamers detained last night, which had cargoes of provisions consigned to Judah & Le Baron. I have sent them back to Mobile. The President’s proclamation of blockade is dated April 19, and it is more than time some specific directions about it should have reached me here. Should I hear of any privateers, man-of-war, or letter of marque being at sea, under the secession flag, I intend to commence making captures immediately. But I shall be greatly embarrassed what to do with them, as I have no officers to put on board and carry them to a port of the United States for adjudication. Has any progress been made in the preparation of a battery to receive the Brooklyn’s 9-inch guns, if it should be thought advisable to land them ? I am afraid the work of discharging the Philadelphia will go on but slowly, as the large boats of the Powhatan have been so much injured as to require extensive repairs, and those of the Brooklyn will be employed for a few days in ballasting the Supply.

Fort Pickens, May 8,1861.
Capt. H. A. Adams, Commanding Naval Forces off Pensacola:
Captain: I wrote you this morning on the subject of allowing provisions to enter Pensacola Harbor, and am gratified that you have so far anticipated my wishes. I am not prepared to express a decided opinion as to the foreign vessels, but as the port has not been actually declared in a state of blockade I should suppose it to be expedient to let them pass, unless they actually have on board articles contraband of war. I am, however, decidedly of opinion that no United States vessel, containing any article which will nourish or assist the enemy, should be permitted to enter, and most certainly no one, either American or secession, from a rebel State. I regret that you did not feel it to be your duty to detain the two steamers, they being in my opinion lawful prizes.
I have done nothing in relation to the batteries for the guns of the Brooklyn because I distinctly understood you to say that you could not possibly spare any gunsdrom her. I may also say that other and more pressing work would have prevented my doing it, but that I will have an engineer detailed to lay out and superintend such a work whenever you may wish to commence it, presuming, as I do, that your officers will wish the whole to be a Navy work.
Is not the unloading of the Philadelphia and provisioning and supplying this work of very paramount importance to ballasting the Supply ? I think that now, while the sea is smooth and the enemy quiet, nothing should take the boats off, and I most respectfully urge that the ballasting the Supply may be deferred until after the steamer is unloaded.
I am much obliged for the papers.

Sir: I have the honor of addressing you for the purpose of calling the attention of the colonel in command of the department to the condition of the men of Company G, First Artillery, stationed at this post. Said company has been for the last three years stationed in this vicinity, and for the last four months confined to the limits of this post. During the latter period it has been almost altogether deprived of fruits and vegetables, and during the whole of the three years but very scantily supplied therewith. Whilst occupying this fort the men and officers of the company have been taxed to their utmost capacity by physical labor and incessant watching night and day against attacks from the enemy. A number of cases of scurvy have already appeared among the men, some of them of considerable severity, and there is great reason to fear the general prevalence of the disease among them. The approach of the hot season will tend to aggravate the disease. The supplies of anti-scorbutics in the commissary stores I trust will be sufficient to prevent the appearance of the disease among the men lately arrived from the North, but I do not believe in their efficacy to relieve the cases which have already appeared or to prevent the recurrence of new cases among the men of Company G, First Artillery.

Captain: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 2d instant this 10 a. m. There have been no secession flags flying since my peremptory order on the subject. The military organization called the u Island Guards 79 has disbanded, in consequence of my directing the mayor to furnish me with the muster roll, which he did. The newspaper called the u Key of the Gulf” I suppressed, because it was uttering treasonable and threatening language against the judiciary and other United States officers. I directed the mayor to inform the editor (a Mr. Ward) that he was under military surveillance, and that the fact of his not being in the cells of this fort for treason was simply a matter as to expediency and proper point of time. To enable me to meet such cases with promptitude, I published on the 6th instant Colonel Brown’s proclamation suspending the writ of habeas corpus. At this date I have not deemed it advisable to follow it with any restrictions upon the municipal authorities or the citizens of the town. As cases have arisen they were at once met, and I will continue this gradual enforcement of the power of the U. S.

Judge Marvin has not resigned. The district attorney, marshal, and clerk are performing all duties which do not require a jury. There is no grand jury, therefore no presentments.

The ordnance and stores required, I regret, are not here, except a few 10-inch shells. I have directed one hundred with sabots and straps to be sent. This fort is daily growing in strength. The barbette guns on the face fronting the town are all in position. I am proud to say that the officers and men are in a high state of discipline and subordination, and, although another soldier might never come, I doubt whether even a lodgment could be made on the island.

imperative, assume the responsibility of ordering men under your command out of the department without his authority.
As the colonel has only your own letters and not the replies nor the special reasons for your action, he cannot judge of the immediate necessity for suspending the writ of habeas corpus, but having the approval of Judge Marvin and of the district attorney, it has his. He desires that you send here all the papers in the case.
The island being under martial law,nil its citizens must acknowledge allegiance to the Government. While the colonel wishes you to be perfectly firm and decided in upholding the laws and suppressing rebellion, he desires that it may be done in a spirit of kindness and conciliation, so that if possible they may be led from error rather than be driven into it by an undue exercise of authority. If, however, any prove incorrigible and refuse allegiance to the Government, they must be sent from the isiand immediately, without respect of persons.
The colonel does not approve of any removal of troops to Tampa or elsewhere from Key West, nor will any be made unless in case of extreme urgency. Key West is of paramount importance, and must not be weakened for any contingent service; neither does he think it at all expedient for the Crusader to leave Key West for any such purpose. He intends to address Captain Adams on the subject.
The colonel is much gratified to learn the falsity of the report that a secession flag was permitted to fly from the court-house. He commends your zeal, and is pleased to learn of the soundness of your officers.

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General :
Colonel : Since my letter of the 13th nothing of special interest has occurred. We have continued to be busily at work preparing for hostilities, and, although much retarded and delayed by the want of essentially necessary articles which should have been sent, we are now very nearly prepared. Yesterday the schooner J. ST. Genin arrived and relieved me from great anxiety, having brought me, besides three colurn-biads, a supply of 8 and 10 inch shells and of 42-pounder shot, of which I was very much in want. Major Tower estimated for 100,000 sand bags in February or March, and no notice has been taken, that we know, of his requisition, although the safety of this fort and the lives of many of the garrison depended on our getting them or some others. Fortunately, we have been able to get partially supplied by our own exertions, or this fort would now be in no condition to stand a bombardment. We are now again nearly out. I have finished the battery north of the fort, and have now mounted on it and ready for service four 8-inch howitzers and two 10-inch siege mortars. The distance of the battery from the navy-yard is one and a quarter miles, so that these guns will barely reach; but they are the best I have, and I think I can throw shells from both into the yard. Between this battery and the fort I am erecting another for two 10-inch columbiads. It will be ready for the guns in four or five days. The guns are still on board the schooner, the wind having blown so high as to make it impossible to land them.
Having to detach two companies for watching the approaches to the fort and to prevent the enemy landing, and Barry’s company having charge of the new battery (which I call Battery Lincoln), I have not force enough to man the guns and do the necessary garrison duty. I have therefore asked a steamer of Captain Adams to go to Key West and bring Jones’ company of artillery here. She leaves in the morning, and carries this letter.
I respectfully renew the request and recommendations contained in my former letters.

Dear Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and in reply beg leave to say that this Department can give no such authority as is therein asked for, and does not desire any cannon forwarded to Fort Pickens by the Union Defense Committee. If any are needed there this Department will be duly informed of it by the officer in command, whose duty it is to inform it, and whose judgment and wishes on the subject will be deemed sufficient to command its prompt attention through the agency of its own proper officers assigned by law for such purposes. The Union Committee will, therefore, please forward no ordnance to Fort Pickens.

Sir : It is my opinion that Fort Pickens cannot be successfully defended against the enemy’s forces now arrayed against us unless a sufficient number of the steamships aid your command to prevent any landing upon Santa Rosa Island. If the enemy once establish themselves on this island in the absence of a powerful steam fleet, they can in a few days build batteries to prevent ships from approaching this end of the island, and rapidly advance and reduce this work by a short siege. The heavy fire upon the flank and rear of our land fronts will prevent us from making a strong resistance if it does not dismount nearly all our guns. Two curtains of our land fronts have no guns upon them, and the flank guns are seen in reverse. The Navy must hold the island until re-enforcements arrive, or our nation must suffer another disgrace in the loss of Fort Pickens. Circumstances have much changed during

ZEALOUS B. TOWER,
Brevet Major, Chief Engineer, Department of Florida.
Headquarters Department oe Florida,
Fort Pickens, May 27,1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General :
Colonel : Since my last dispatches no hostile movement has been made by the rebels, and we have been industriously employed in preparing to defend this fort, and have nearly completed the internal defenses, at least so far as we can do without sand bags. I have also completed and armed Batteries Lincoln and Cameron, the former with two 10-inch siege mortars and one 8-inch sea-coast howitzer, and the latter with two 10-inch columbiads. I am preparing beds for one 10-inch Columbia d in the gorge of bastion D, and one in the salient of the counterscarp of bastion E. I have a gun for the former, and am daily expecting one for the latter, a schooner having three 10-inch columbiads, with projectiles, &c., having been spoken at Tortugas bound here. When she arrives I purpose erecting a battery of two guns on the point of the island south of the fort. I have established a camp about three-quarters of a mile from the fort, where the two infantry companies are encamped, and am cutting a military road in the interior of the island some three or four miles, to enable me, by prompt movements of the battery and other troops, to repel the enemy in case he makes a lodgment on it.
The schooner J. 1ST. Genin will be unloaded probably to-morrow, it being very slow work in an open roadstead. These, I believe, are all my operations since I last wrote. I see by the Herald of the 4th instant that Captain Meigs reports this fort as being secure from all possible attacks, and able to resist any that can be made against it. If Captain Meigs has made such a report he has reported what at the time was notoriously incorrect, and his report has been very injurious by probably preventing those supplies of arms and ammunition which are of vital importance, and which would doubtless have been promptly sent had our real condition been correctly reported, but which, of course, would not be to a fort able to resist any attack that could be made on it. At the time Captain Meigs left here this fort was in no condition for offense or defense. Every gun, every front, and every casemate but one was unprotected, and open to the shot and shells of the enemy, and their defense must have been at a fearful loss of life. There were only two 10-inch columbiads mounted—the only guns that can with certainty and efficiency reach the enemy—and there were not shells enough either of columbiads, howitzer, or mortar for one half day’s firing, nor have I now enough to last, even with moderate firing, more than four days$ and the only guns in the fort to be depended on are the columbiads, though I hope and believe I can reach the enemy with the 32-pounders, the howitzers, and the mortars.
I send you a sketch [inclosure I], by which it will be seen how we are surrounded, and that most of the batteries are beyond the ordinary range of our guns. It must always be borne in mind that the armament of this fort was designed to reach only to the channel. We, I trust, now will be able to defend ourselves against the enemy. We

have, however,* one vulnerable point: If he makes a lodgment on the island, and is able to approach the fort on that side, it must inevitably fall. I have no fears of his doing this so long as the ships remain to prevent it, but they are likely to be taken away, and if they are the consequences may be calamitous.
Captain McKean arrived here the day before yesterday, and immediately ordered the Powhatan and Brooklyn away, and proposed leaving himself in the Niagara. This would leave this place with ouly the Sabine, Huntsville, and Water Witch to blockade the port and protect the island—a force inadequate. I protested against the measure, and showed him my authority to do so. He consented to remain with the Niagara, but yesterday wrote me that he intended leaving immediately in the Niagara. I assented to it, provided he left all the small steamers. He has ordered the Water Witch to leave in the morning for Havana, but has not informed me as to the Wyandotte, which is now absent at Key West. I inclose copies of the letters between him and me on the subject (A to D).
The force of the rebels is said to be now from 8,000 to 10,000, so that it will easily be seen that he has force enough to occupy the island. If the ships are to be taken away by every commander that accidentally touches here, then a force sufficiently large to hold the island should be sent, but under existing circumstances I tliink the ships preferable.
On Wednesday morning about 3 o’clock it was rex>orted to me that the dry-dock was moving out. It had been for a long time rumored that she was being fitted out as a water battery, with heavy guns. . All preparations were accordingly made. She accordingly—a huge black monster—moved slowly towards Battery Lincoln until within less than a mile, when she stopped broadside to this fort. At daybreak she was seen in this position, but, no hostile demonstration from her or elsewhere being made, we remained quiet. I thought it a good opportunity to free myself from a false position—that of being obliged to act only on the defensive. I therefore wrote a letter to General Bragg (E), and not receiving an answer, having taken the opinions of the older officers of my command, I wrote him a letter marked G. My messenger brought back answers to both, F and H, all of which I here inclose. The next morning we discovered that she had been sunk, and she so remains at this time, and is apparently unoccupied. She lies within less than a mile of Batteries Lincoln and Cameron. General Bragg says her present position is accidental, and I doubt not it is so. He probably intended to move the dock to Pensacola or some other place where she would be safe in case of bombardment, but the wind being strong from the north she either broke loose or the tugs were unable to control her movements, and she was floating directly on our batteries when she was brought to anchor, and he not knowing whether I would consider his explanation as satisfactory would not hazard her loss and that of the steamers which would necessarily be employed in towing her off, and therefore he sunk her.
I have received no dispatches or instructions from Washington since I left.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HARVEY BROWN,
Major, Second Artillery, and Colonel Commanding.

Capt. W. W. McKean, Commanding Naval Forces off Pensacola:
Sir : I have just received a letter from Captain Adams, commanding the ship Sabine, stating that the ship just arrived is the Niagara, Captain McKean. She has been ordered down here to blockade Mobile and the mouth of the Mississippi, and will require the Brooklyn and Powhatan, or perhaps this ship, to assist her. These vessels will sail this evening. I respectfully represent to you that the taking away these ships will jeopardize the safety of this fort. The force of the enemy on the other side of the harbor is represented to be from 8,000 to 10,000. My force for duty is a little less than 700, exclusive of marines and sailors; so that if the ships are taken away I cannot prevent a landing of the enemy on Santa Rosa Island, their making a permanent lodgment here, and subsequent approaches on this fort. The Sabine might be spared in case of great emergency, but neither of the steamers should be taken away at this time without a more pressing urgency than that of the blockading Mobile Harbor. I therefore enter my solemn protest against the removal at this time of any of the steamships from this harbor, the safety and preservation of the fort imperiously demanding their continuance here. I inclose you the authority I have from the President of the United States to make this protest, the expedition named being the preservation of this fort, and I respectfully call on you in his name to assist me in preserving it, by keeping the ships in their present position.

Sir : The steamer Huntsville arrived this morning. She is a fine vessel, mounting one 8 inch gun on a pivot, and two 32-pounder carriage guns, and has sufficient power to tow a vessel of the largest size. I have ordered the sloop St. Louis here, and she may be looked for hourly. Do you not think that the Sabine and those vessels will be a sufficient force to prevent a landing of the rebels on the island ? I am of opinion that it will, and as it is of vital importance that the port of Mobile should be blockaded before the arms are received, I am very anxious to proceed to that point. In the event of a threatened attack the Mohawk could be dispatched for me, and as the distance is short I could reach here in a few hours. Please let me hear from you by the bearer.

Capt. W. W. McKean, Commanding Naval Forces off Pensacola:
Sir : I am in receipt of your letter of the 26th instant. Although the two sail vessels you propose leaviug will give a very inadequate support on account of the difficulty of moving them, their inability to lie close to the shore, and their projectiles being principally solid shot, yet, appreciating the importance of blockading Mobile and capturing the vessel, I will interpose no further objections to the departure of the Niagara after the arrival of the St. Louis, provided the Mohawk is permitted to continue to guard the north pass, which I consider of great importance, and that the Wyandotte and Water Witch continue here with the Huntsville to enforce the blockade and protect the island.
I again respectfully request that you will order Captain Porter immediately to return to me the small schooner which I lent him especially to assist him here, and which in so extraordinary a manner he took away without my knowledge or consent.
I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S.—u Since writing the above your communication has been handed to me. I will leave the Mohawk and Huntsville here, and will in compliance with your request direct Lieutenant Commanding Porter to order the schooner immediately back. The Powhatan is off Mobile, but it is very important that she should proceed to the Mississippi as soon as possible, for it will require three vessels to blockade that river. She had but one week’s water when she left, and cannot obtain a supply until she reaches the Mississippi.”

To the Adjutant-General :
Sir : The Department proposes to send an expedition to re-enforce Santa Rosa Island. Steamers will be immediately purchased, and one regiment of troops will be taken with the expedition.
You will prepare for signature the necessary orders.
Object of the expedition will not be known until it reaches its destination.

Col. J. W. Ripley, Chief of Ordnance:
Sir: It is reported that a battery of Whitworth guns and ammunition has been received in New York as a gift to the Government. You will take immediate steps to cause these guns—all the rifled 42-pounders prepared for Fort Pickens which may be ready in time ; the 36-pounder and 10-pounder rifles now on Governors Island; the ammunition for the above; as many 10 inch shells both for sea-coast mortars and for 10-inch columbiads, and those carriages now mounted at Fort Richmond (care being taken to provide suitable pintles for the above, so as to mount them in sand batteries on plank platforms outside the fort); materials for platforms for forty or fifty heavy guns, including all the above, and thirty 9-inch Navy guns; also all ordnance stores, materials, &c., heretofore called for for the use of Fort Pickens—to be prepared for shipment upon steamers which will be got ready by the War Department and Navy Department at the earliest moment. One hundred thousand sand bags, a complete set of heavy wheels, with slings, gins, &c., for handling the guns on Santa Rosa Island, ropes, blocks, cartridge-bags, and all the sea-coast mortars ready at the time the vessels sail from New York or Boston, will also be sent out.
It is intended to keep the destination of this expedition secret; therefore order the necessary instructions by telegraph, and do not make known their object.
Fort Pickens appears to be in danger for want of ordnance, called for long since. Where the error lies the Department does not propose to inquire. The present duty is to deal with the question as it stands, and to spare no exertion, no resources, of the Government to put it, if possible, out of hazard.
The names of the vessels will be made known to the quartermasters, New York, as soon as engaged. Some ordnance men should, if possible, be detailed to accompany the expedition. It is proposed to put up a large number of batteries on different points of Santa Rosa Island to answer the formidable fire prepared by the rebels, to silence and destroy their batteries, if possible.
The War Department desires the benefit of any suggestions you may have to offer tending to the most speedy sujiply of these essentials or any other. Is it certain that there are enough 42-pounders and other shot for guns already in battery there ? Is not more powder needed ? If so, it should be packed in metallic cases, water-proof, and not so full as to sink if thrown overboard. The means of lighting up the island in case of attack should be provided, limber for blindages and for battery magazines should be provided.

War Department,
Washington, May 29,1861. Hon. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Wavy:
Sir : For increasing the defenses on Santa Eosa Island and restoring the equilibrium lost since the late completion of the Montgomery and Pensacola Eailroad, which has enabled the rebels to multiply their batteries and arm them with large guns and mortars, the War Department desires the use of thirty IX-inch guns, Navy pattern, with carriages and implements complete, and as many shells as can be supplied on short notice. Understanding that you have at Portsmouth, or can have in a few days, the above number of guns, I request you to give the necessary orders for the shipment on board a steamer, to be chartered . and sent there to receive them for the War Department. It is proposed to send out not less than ten large steamers, with a regiment of troops. It is important that these steamers should be each armed with three or four guns, the heavier the better, and supplied with some sailors of the Regular Navy to work the guns, under the direction of a competent naval officer on each, these sailors out there on the fleet off Santa Eosa to be ready to assist in landing or setting these guns in battery on the island of Santa Eosa. The steamers.will be chartered or purchased as transports by the War Department, and their usual working crew and sailing commander, if chartered, will be furnished by the owners under the charter-party.
As late advices from Fort Pickens show that some error has been committed which has left the fort insufficiently provided with ammunition and guns to resist a bombardment daily threatened, all this should be executed with the greatest speed and secrecy. The destination of the vessel and the character of her cargo should be kept secret to all but those to whom it is necessary to make them known, in order to the speedy preparation of the expedition.
These vessels will carry, also, a number of Army 10-inch guns and of Army shells, mortars, &c., and it is hoped a battery of Whitworth rifled guns and some rifled 42-pounders. Heavy boats for landing the guns will be needed. If a suitable crew can be furnished and carried out by any naval vessel going to Fort Pickens, it will much facilitate the landing of the guns and carriages. The next best means will be, probably to send out paddle-box boats of large size. In this the War Department will depend upon the co-operation of the Navy, which is earnestly invited to secure the holding of Fort Pickens, whose military and political importance just now cannot be exaggerated.

On Sunday Judge McQueen McIntosh arrived, preparatory to the opening of his court under his Confederate States commission. He was waited upon by men of his own party, who represented the precise state of affairs- on the island; that everything was going on peaceably and quietly; that his authority would not be recognized by myself, and that if he attempted to exercise his office it would unnecessarily produce difficulties and excitement.
On yesterday Judge McIntosh called upon Judge Marvin at his office. Judge Marvin has informed me that the result of the interview was perfectly satisfactory. Judge McIntosh was strongly impressed with the uselessness of attempting to assert the Confederate States sovereignty here. He was informed how secure the persons and property were on this island, and that the inhabitants preferred to be allowed to remain as they were. Allusion was made to the military officers, and the manner of their obeying the instructions of the Government, which had given general satisfaction. Judge McIntosh decided to return, and at the request of Judge Marvin I requested Captain Craven to allow him and his friends to leave the island withbut applying to me for a permit to do so, there being an order prohibiting non residents going or coming without my authority, published since the judge came.
Judge Marvin in his conversation with me, in the presence of others, stated in an impressive manner that he fully and highly approved of every act I had performed since taking the command, with other matters relevant thereto, which it would become some one other than myself to bring to notice.	,
On yesterday I issued an order prohibiting the collecting of taxes, levies, or assessments, by any one acting under the authority of the State of Florida.
I am, captain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Judge McIntosh had not intended coming here, but was positively directed to do so by the government of Montgomery.
It is important, in order to understand the change of feeling brought about here, that I should state there has been organized on the island a volunteer company of seventy-live citizens, who propose visiting the fort on Saturday to report to me. At their request I gave them a flag to display on the occasion. Seventy of the white laborers and employes on the fort have also volunteered. For these, arms, &c., will have to be procured.

His example might have spread, and there was no way to keep him aloof from the men.
I inclose two numbers of the “Key of the Gulf,” the last published. When the paper of the 27th April appeared I spoke to several respectable citizens to have the paper suppressed, and had an assurance that it would not appear again. To my surprise, that of May 1 came out, more violent and incendiary than its previous numbers. There was great excitement among the IJnion men, and the rabid secessionists were much elated. After a perfect understanding with the district attorney, and having received Judge Marvin’s views, sent to me verbally by Captain Craven, of the Navy, the act of habeas corpus was suspended, in order to arrest without molestation the parties suspected of uttering the treasonable sentiments, &c. The editor has left the island. The Salvor today takes away Mr. Crusoe, the late magistrate of the county, and county clerk; Judge Douglas and family; Mr. Asa Tift and his negroes. Others are preparing to leave, and winding up their affairs.
No martial law has been put in force here. That code has not had to be enforced. The civil magistracy (Union men) has been installed and supported. The habeas corpus act was simply suspended for prospective purposes. Fortunately, in no instance has it been necessary to make an arrest, and as soon as the Union men elect their own mayor and council-men, and the municipal affairs are arranged on the basis of the para*-mount sovereignty of the United States laws, the proclamation may be withdrawn. Every voter will be required to swear allegiance to the United States at the polls, and every officer elected must qualify himself in the same manner.
I inclose a roll of Union citizens, who marched to the fort on Saturday, and through Mr. Maloney, a strong Union lawyer of this place, placed themselves under my orders. I received them in the usual manner, presented a flag, and the inclosed roll of 106 of the most respectable citizens at Key West was handed to me.. It is furnished to the colonel commanding, not only because it is a matter of great public importance, but as an evidence that the authority and responsibility with which I was vested have not been disadvantageously employed. About the same time a company of citizens, employes on the works, seventy-five strong, also formed and reported themselves, organized with officers, &c., to receive my orders. In the first company are Judge Marvin, Mr. Boynton, district attorney, the naval officer, collector, &c. The latter has the U. S. marshal, clerk U. S. court, &c.
I also inclose a circular upon which the citizens are about to act. The leading men are projecting a ticket with Judge Marvin for mayor, Messrs. Howe, Maloney, Campbell, and others of the most influential and respected men for aldermen.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Major: I am directed by the colonel commanding to say that he has read the papers you sent with great pleasure, and that he is much gratified by the loyalty exhibited at Key West. Your course, marked by prudence and ability, meets his decided approbation. He trusts the continuance of the same forbearance and consideration will bring all the inhabitants to their duty.
Directions have been given to Major Arnold to send you the siege battery as soon as possible. The colonel agrees with you that it is inexpedient to erect a battery on the north end of the island at present.
If you can put some guns on the Suwannee or the Wanderer, with a sufficient crew not to endanger her, it might, perhaps, be well to do so whenever either may not be required for other service.
The colonel only desires that under no contingency shall Fort Taylor and Key West be endangered in the slightest degree by detachments. The colonel directs that you send either the Suwannee or the Wanderer to this fort immediately, loaded with lumber, boards, and scantling, in about equal proportion. A little wood might be put on board.

You are confidentially informed that Fort Pickens is the destination of the regiment. It is to be embarked under your direction, with certain supplies to be prepared under immediate authority of the War Department. You will learn the probable time of embarkation, and concert with the proper agents on this subject. Your exertions will be directed towards inspecting, mustering, and equipping the regiment prior to its departure, so that it may be provided with whatever is necessary for its efficiency and comfort.

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel : Since my last letter I have received three 10-inch colum-biads, and about 300 shells and 300 8-inch shells, and I hear that the steamer South Carolina has some mortars for me, but of what kind I have not learned. I have nothing special to report. My defenses are progressing and nearly completed. The weather is hot, but the troops are comparatively healthy. I want officers in consequence of the increased number of guns I have mounted, and of batteries erected. I have not enough to fight the guns. The duty is very hard on officers and men, and the companies ought to be at the maximum, whereas there is not more than an average of two to a company for company duty, and as the officers are almost all expecting promotion, some may receive orders to leave. It is therefore proper that I should urgently press the sending more, and that I should state to you that I would not consider myself at liberty in the present state of circumstances of my command to permit an officer to leave, should I receive orders to do so, unless others arrived, or until after you shall have had time to act on this letter. I think the safety of my command might be jeopardized by doing so.
It may not be amiss, in consideration of the reports and rumors afloat here, to" say that three or four more companies of regulars would be highly desirable, but that a large force of raw troops, whether volunteers or regulars, unless sufficient to enable me to cross to the main and attack the enemy, would be worse than useless. With any number less than 5,000 of such troops I could only act defensively, and all the energies of my command would be exhausted in feeding them. Besides, the hot and sickly season is approaching, and Northern raw levies in this climate would not be efficient for hard service. I think our present position in a strategic view is good. With 800 or 900 men I keep nearly or quite as many thousands from operating elsewhere. If the enemy attacks me I can repel him, and if it be deemed advisable for me to attack him I can destroy the navy-yard and do other great injury. I therefore think that true policy dictates an increase of my command of three or four full companies of regulars for the purpose of securely holding the island in case the ships, by storms or otherwise, be driven off; that it being too late in the season to act offensively, except by this fort, no irregular troops should be sent until fall, and that more officers be immediately sent me.
I would also respectfully urge the necessity of a more prompt and attentive action in answering my requisitions and those of my staff, and would observe that sending sail vessels with stores of any kind should be discontinued. Steam only can be depended on, I renew my appli-

Battery Scott (at the southwest point of the island, opposite FortMcBee) and one sea-coast mortar in the fort.
If the rifled guns which we hear unofficially are on the way here come, I shall put two of them in Battery Lincoln, in place of two of the 8 inch sea-coast howitzers, and the remainder' in the fort. I shall very soon after this be entirely ready to act, either defensively or offensively. I would remark that the 10-inch columbiads, the 10-inch sea-coast mortars, and the rifled guns are the only ones on which any dependence can be placed, the ranges of the others being too short, unless with high charges, to reach the enemy with any effect. I have some and but little hopes that the 8 inch howitzers may reach with efficiency. I have two 42-pounders and plenty of 32-pounders, but I ha ve no confidence in them.
My advices from Key West and Tortugas are satisfactory. I consider Key West as loyal, and that no future danger need be apprehended of her disloyalty.
I inclose you a letter of Major French (A). I havfe approved of his seizing and arming the steamer in question, should she visit Key West. I have also authorized him to muster a company into service for the purpose of scanning the coast between Key West and this place and keeping my line of operations clear, provided he can depend on them, and that their being mustered into service is approved at Washington.
I have been so much engaged in preparing this post for a bombardment as to have little time to attend to other matters that require my personal attention, but which the present state of affairs renders impossible for me to give. The rebels are still at work strengthening and increasing their batteries and mounting heavy guns on them. My command continues comparatively healthy, there being no serious cases of disease, and the number diminishing.
I again respectfully allude to the facts that I am under orders to act only on the defensive unless attacked, and that I have received no orders of any kind since I have been at this post and in command of this department. It may be proper for me also to say that the relations of the rebels to our country having been so changed since the date of my orders, by the bombardment of Fort Sumter and by their declarations and acts of war, that I do not feel under any obligations to confine myself to defensive measures, should I, when ready, deem it to the advantage or honor of the United States for me to act offensively, believing that such will be the wishes of the Government,

Captain: The most direct information has reached me by a gentleman of undoubted character and a strong Unionist, that he had a conversation with Captain Hartstene, of the S. C. Kavy, who was at Tampa on a visit within this last week examining the harbor and steamers there. He tried to negotiate for the Salvor, but came to no conclusion. This steamer is better than any of the small class which have lately come from the Korth.

Further, Saint Mark’s is being fortified, and an aggressive preparation is going on upon the west coast of Florida to act upon the right flank of the line of communications between this base and Fort Pickens.
The Salvor is now at Havana. On her return I will seize her. Her owner will not sell. Captain Craven I will request to put a crew in. Soldiers and guns will be provided by myself, and she will be convoy and a towboat at the same time.
Captain Hartstene also said that Bragg had no idea of attacking Pickens, but was diverting the U. S. troops. The weight to be attached to this you have better opportunity of judging than myself.
This note is written just as the mail closes, and the few facts presented are worthy of consideration.
I have no fear about this island, and am constantly on the alert. For an expedition I can raise fifty men (citizens), whose desperate character and remembrance of wrong would bear hard upon any point of the coast Or the mainland. I believe this demonstration was anticipated by me in a former communication.

Fort Pickens, June 14,1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General :
Colonel : 1 have been kept in such entire ignorance as to the future designs and intentions of the Government respecting operations here, and whether any further are designed than the mere holding of this fort, that I have not felt at liberty to give any views on any subject apart from those relating to the fort. There is, however, one of so much importance in my estimation as to warrant my respectfully submitting it to the consideration of the Government. The weather is now intensely hot, and will probably soon be to men of Northern constitutions exposed to the miasma of the swamps very unhealthy. I would not, therefore, throw any large body of troops here until after the September gales are over. If then it is intended to operate offensively, and to repossess ourselves of the fort and navy-yard, the preoccupancy of the harbor is almost indispensably necessary.
The rebel batteries are so numerous, so strong, and so advantageously situated as, in my opinion, to preclude the entrance of large ships, except at an immense cost of life and property, and there is, too, a strong probability that vessels to obstruct the channel are sunk between this fort and McBee, and the dry-dock also lies across the channel between here and the navy-yard. I do not, however, consider it as a serious obstacle, the water being deep on both sides of it. Their entrance in the harbor being, as I conceive, out of the question, I would as a substitute use steam gunboats of light draught of water—say of four and a half feet—each carrying two or three rifled guns, and strongly armed. There are two ways by which boats of this character may be introduced into the harbor: ist, through the main entrance, by hugging closely the island shore, and taking a dark and cloudy night for the purpose; and 2d, and perhaps preferably, through the channel at the east end of the island. This is long and somewhat intricate, but I am told that six feet of water can be carried through it, and that many of our Navy officers are acquainted with it. That such boats as I propose can be carried

[Chap. it.
through is certain, for a large steamer was a few weeks since carried through it, and is now busily plying between Pensacola and the navy-yard. By reference to the map it will be seen that these vessels can lie in safety beyond the range of any guns the rebels can bring against them, supposing him to have a battery, which is doubtful, at Deer Point, but which if he has can be easily taken. It will also be seen that such an anchorage is opposite the narrowest part of the island, where the boats would be under the protection in some measure of the ships outside, and where the boats of ships can be easily hauled over and used in connection with the gunboats. The rebels have no floating force of consequence in the harbor. These vessels can therefore entirely command it and its tributaries, and entirely cut off the supplies by water of the rebel troops. By landing a sufficient force somewhere between this and the Perdido their position can be entirely invested. Six or eight boats would, I think, be sufficient, but they should be prepared so as to be ready and here in October, and the most profound secrecy as to their destination be observed; otherwise the enemy would destroy the eastern passage.
I make these suggestions rather to invite attention to the subject than as being well-digested views. There are many Army and Navy officers acquainted with the harbor who can give reliable and valuable information on the subject.
It may not be amiss in connection with this subject for me to say that I consider Fort McRee as assailable, and that with five hundred good troops more than I now have, and with the co operation of the Navy* I am confident I could in a very few days reduce it.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, 1). C,:
Colonel : Since my last dispatch I have received seven 42 pounder rifled guns, one of smaller caliber, and two 6-pounder rifled field guns, with a reasonable though insufficient supply of ammunition. We are now mounting some of these guns; have mounted two more sea-coast 10-inch mortars, and will in two or three days be ready to mount two more 10-inch columbiads and two of these rifled guns that I propose putting in batteries. After landing some powder now here and mounting the rest of these guns, I shall be prepared to defend this fort or to act offensively.
A negro deserter came to me a few days since who has been for several years employed by his master as a pilot of this harbor. He says that the rebels sank a dredging boat and a brig in the channel; that the former floated ashore and the latter is supposed to have gone to pieces, and that the dry-dock does not at all obstruct the channel, being sunk some twenty yards from it; that the rebels are building a large floating battery of very heavy timber, having prepared it at Pensacola and brought it down in pieces to the navy-yard, where it is now being put together; that the small-pox is raging among the rebel troops, and that great sickness prevails, three or four dying daily; that the rebels have a large hospital in Pensacola; that there is a detachment of troops, but no battery, at Deer Point; that they have been constantly engaged for some

weeks in removing articles from the navy-yard to Pensacola, from whence they were sent away by railroad, and that the batteries at and near the yard are very numerous and have large guns in them. The man is intelligent and has given me considerable information, which, of course, I receive with large qualification.
I again respectfully repeat what I said in one of my earliest letters, that the commanding officer of this fort should have secret-service money, to be expended at his discretion.
My sick-list is heavy and increasing, having this morning upwards of ninety on it—none serious—arising from hard work in the sun and in the water, sleeping in damp casemates, and drinking impure water. We have been nearly six weeks without rain, and with only two light storms since. One of the cisterns leaked arid we lost the water, and that of the other has to be used with great economy and only for drinking, water for cooking purposes being obtained by sinking wells. I am having a temporary hospital built about a mile from the fort, near the beach. When finished the sick will have a better chance than they now have of recovery. I have lost but three by death, one of which by an accident. I shall not send the negroes back, as I will never be voluntarily instrumental in returning a poor wretch to slavery, but will hold them subject to orders.
I am very much in want of a powerful spy-glass or telescope. We have plenty of ordinary ones, but with one of great power we could constantly possess ourselves of the most valuable information of the movements of the enetny.

Colonel : I respectfully report to you that the steamer Illinois arrived here on the 23d instant with twenty-eight Dahlgren 9-inch guns and implements and some ammunition for same. This is her whole* cargo, and not one article on board her is wanted or can advantageously be used here. I shall not therefore touch her cargo, but, having embarked Hunt’s battery on board, shall send her to Tortugas to be unloaded there. Permit me respectfully to suggest that the good of the service will be advanced by only sending us those articles for which we make requisitions and which we want, and not multitudes of articles which only encumber us; These Dahlgren guns are not fitted for our service, and their shells are fused in such a manner that only one-third of those sent can be used at all, and these are of too short range; so that were I to land these guns, I should have only 700 shell. I have no doubt of their being sent under an impression of doing us good service, whereas we are only embarrassed by these kind intentions, which are very expensive to the Government. I have ordered Hunt’s battery to embark on board the Illinois. Barry’s will in about ten days on board the Vanderbilt.

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel : I have received your letters of the 30th ultimo and 7th instant ordering me to send Barry’s and Hunt’s companies to New York, and informing me that a regiment of New York Volunteers had been ordered to re-enforce Fort Pickens. When, in the face of repeated applications and urgent entreaties for more regular officers, and of strong representations, repeatedly urged, of the necessity of more regular companies, and of my declaration that at this time volunteers would very much embarrass me, and the expression of a hope that none would be sent, nine of my officers, one-third my whole number, and two artillery companies are taken from me, and a regiment of undrilled New York City Volunteers, entirely undisciplined, are sent me, I can only attribute it to a want of confidence in my judgment, or of disbelief in, and disregard to, my urgent and repeated representations of the wants and necessities of this fort.
I respectfully submit to the consideration of the General-in-Chief the accompanying table A, showing that I am left with thirty-one officers and two hundred and ninety enlisted men less than are necessary for a vigorous defense during such a bombardment as we shall probably have.
I desire earnestly in the discharge of my duties to put self aside, and to act only for what I consider to be the best interests of the country. I cannot, under the existing state of affairs, being in the face of an enemy six or eight times superior to me in number, with batteries and forts quadrupling mine, ask to be relieved, but, as there will probably be a large force ordered here in the fall, if not sooner, I would respectfully suggest that an officer having more rank, and in whom the general will place more confidence, be sent to command this department. My ambition will be fully satisfied with the consciousness of having faithfully performed an important duty in re-enforcing and holding this fort, and in putting it in a condition to defy the whole congregated nation of rebels.

Colonel : Nothing of interest has occurred at this post since my last letter. Battery Lincoln is finished and armed. Battery Scott has its last 10-inch columbiad now mounting, and the 42-pounder rifled gun will be mounted the forepart of next week. There are four rifled guns and three mortars now here on board the Vanderbilt. I shall land them as soon as possible and mount them as soon as landed.
Not haying officers and men enough to man the guns I have mounted, and being about to increase the number, I have felt it to be a duty to bring one of the artillery companies from Tortugas here. I accordingly sent two companies of volunteers to that post, and ordered one of the companies now there to this. They may be expected in about a week, by which time I hope to have the guns and ammunition landed, and will be in a suitable state for either offensive or defensive operations.

Colonel : Although aware of the unpleasantness of the subject, and of the multiplicity of the cares pressing on the General-in-Chief, I am compelled by a sense of duty to again solicit his attention to the entire insufficiency of the garrison of this fort for its efficient defense. It may seem strange that a post successfully preserved by seventy-five men when almost without armament or protection, should not have enough

[Chap. IV.
when well protected and garrisoned by some six hundred and with ample armament, and yet such is emphatically the fact. The preservation of this fort from the day of its occupancy until the night of its re-enforcement by the troops of my command is solely attributable to the timidity—I may say cowardice—of the rebels, and in saying so I would not derogate the slightest from the merits of my predecessors, who nobly held it under peculiar difficulties, for if vigorously attacked by one-half his forces at any time it would inevitably have fallen, its successful defense being impossible.
I would most respectfully urge that while raw recruits and volunteers may be useful in the field and as infantry, they are useless except for guards and fatigue duty in a fort, and that an artillery soldier cannot be improvised in a day, but that time and tuition are necessary to make him, and that therefore the New York Volunteers are not of the slightest use in manning the guns of and defending this fort. I then again repeat that the number of officers and men is entirely insufficient to man the guns of this fort and the batteries, should they be bombarded; that twenty more officers and four more companies are required, and I respectfully urge that if no more companies be sent, at least that the officers belonging to the companies nowhere maybe ordered to join, there being but thirteen present—exactly one-half the whole.
I hope the General-in-Chief, if he thinks me to be pertinacious, will attribute my solicitude to a deep conviction of its paramount importance, founded on an intimate personal knowledge and experience of the subject. I have felt great doubt and anxiety as to the course I should pursue here in the absence of any other than instructions to act on the defensive. I have at the hazard of imputed timidity resolutely resisted every attempt to bring on a collision, and done everything in my power consistently with the dignity and honor of my country, to avoid a rupture, being determined not to fight until I was ready; and although personally fame or notoriety at least would have resulted, I have never until within a very few days—indeed, I am not now—been in a condition to warrant an attack, having never had the means of fighting for more than two days at ten hours a day ,• and although not now fully prepared, I shall, when the Vanderbilt and State of Georgia are unloaded, have shot and shells for some four days’ bombardment, and may be considered as ready. Such being the case, what course should I pursue—act still strictly on the defensive, or open my batteries against the enemy ? The reasons for the former, at the present time, are, first, that my instructions are to act strictly on the defensive, and that having in two or three instances called attention to this fact, no other instructions have been given me, although there has been time and opportunity to do so ,• second, that the relative strength of the enemy is very greatly superior, and that he has to keep some 8,000 men to watch 1,800; third, that if he attacks me and fails, his defeat will be disgraceful and fatal to his cause; fourth, that we gain more and lose less by delay than he does ; and for the latter, first, the moral influence which a successful bombardment of this fort, the destruction of the navy-yard and of the public and private buildings at Warrington, would at this time have in our country; second, the immense amount of ammunition which he must expend by his numerous batteries, and which he can ill afford; third, the destruction and demoralization of his troops, being raw bodies, and the prestige obtained by an inferior force acting offensively, and a beleaguered fort turning on its assailants—are some of the reasons which may be assigned for the two courses to be pursued.
The objections to offensive operations on my mind are these: I have

not officers and men sufficient to efficiently and with vigor carry them on 5 second, that they will at this time be followed by no decisive results, as if entirely successful I cannot pursue the advantage; third, that whatever be the result, he can and probably will claim a victory, as the bombardment will not be followed by exterior movements; fourth, that the destruction of the navy-yard and its appurtenances, which would be inevitable, and, indeed, the great object of attack, may not in view of future operations be desired by the Government; fifth, that I am within eight days of headquarters, and if offensive operatidns were desired I would be so instructed. It is proper I should in candor state that I do not consider the instructions obligatory, circumstances since having so altered, and that I had fully determined and made the necessary arrangements to open fire on the enemy when ready, my intention being frustrated by the removal of the two companies; that I sent for another artillery company from Tortugas with a view to this object, but that in consideration of the great personal advantages I might if successful derive and which may bias my judgment, and that I have seen in a newspaper that I am to be relieved, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that it is my duty to act strictly on the defensive until the pleasure of the Government be known, and which I respectfully now solicit.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Thomas :
My Dear General : I received to-day your order taking from me at one fell swoop all my staff. A few weeks since Barry’s and Hunt’s companies were taken from me, and a regiment of raw, undrilled recruits from the purlieus of New York sent me as a substitute. To-day Chalfin brings me an order for him to go, and this evening Mr. McCreery writes me a note, stating that Captain Allen had officially notified him that he was dropped, and declining to serve any longer. So I am left in the most important post in the Union with an entirely inadequate command. If there was a designed purpose to sacrifice me I could not be worse treated. It is true there is no present prospect of collision, as Bragg don’t want to and I cannot fight; but accident, the design or imprudence of an individual, may at any moment bring on a battle, and I shall have to fight it under every possible disadvantage; so that if I escape disgrace I shall be fortunate. I declare to you that I have not at this moment really one half as many officers as are absolutely necessary and not much more than half enough men for a vigorous and severe bombardment, as this will be if it comes off. I have passed three months of continued excessive anxiety and care, for no one can know the difficulty of my position since I have been here or the totally defenseless state of this fort when I came here but those who were with me. And just as I began to see the break of day and was making arrangements to fulfill what I believed to be the expectations of the country by attacking the rebels, I am suddenly stopped by the removal of two of my best companies and nine of my officers. When exerting myself to recover from this blow by bringing Dawson’s company here, I not only found them without officers, but at the same time I am again smitten by an order for the removal of all my staff, leaving me with only two officers at Batr

teries Lincoln and Cameron (one each), and only two at Battery Scott, and, exclusive of the staff, four at Fort Pickens, when the minimum should be four to each company, making twenty-eight. Now, is this right? Is it just to place an officer in such a situation when surrounded by an enemy ten times his own number, with an armament four times as many as his? Officers are promoted to the companies here, but not one comes. They are promoted from here as their chief wants them, and all go. Companies C and E, Third Infantry, have but one officer. Company A, Second Artillery, is commanded by a second lieutenant, its captain and first lieutenant being at one point. Company K, Second, has a captain and first lieutenant, who is entitled to promotion. Company F, First, has a captain under orders and a first lieutenant promoted to a captain. * Company A, First, has a captain and first lieutenant, the former entitled to promotion; so that if these officers receive their promotion and are ordered away, I shall be left without an officer. However, if the worst comes to the worst, I have made up my mind never to surrender this fort, and I leave this letter as a testimony of the reasons why it was not gloriously victorious.
Yours, truly,
H. BKOWN.

General M. C. Meigs,
Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:
Dear General : I wrote the Adjutant-General by the last steamer on the subject of a steam-tug for this place. It seems to me that strange ideas are entertained of the kind of vessels required to tow boats, as a large propeller of 500 or 600 tons burden, and drawing when light fifteen feet water, was sent; the bar over which she would be required to tow the boats having on it only some ten feet, and near the shore, where she is most wanted, there being only some eight feet. I want a powerful, swift boat, of some seventy-five to one hundred tons, neatly fitted up, and that does not draw more than seven feet water. I suppose such a boat can be purchased for $10,000 or $12,000, or can be hired for some $1,000 or $1,200 per month, and without the slightest exaggeration I am confident such a boat would have twice paid for itself in unloading the Vanderbilt alone. If troops are to be sent here in the fall to act offensively, two or three of these boats should be here for towing and for landing troops and stores. The one I now require is also wanted to run as a mail-boat to Havana and Key West. She should be sent here loaded with coal (in bags) for her own consumption. Afterwards arrangements must be made for her coaling at Key West. If one is sent, let her have a good new boiler and be in all respects in good order, there being no means of repairing here. With such a boat I can, on an average, unload a ship in half the time I now can, and if you calculate the daily charter of the steamers coming here you can very easily see the saving to the Government by having one.
Before this reaches you this fort will be in complete readiness, and I presume no fort in the United States was ever better prepared for offensive or defensive operations (if manned, which it is not half), so far as the efficiency of service and security and protection and safety of the men go, my object having been to attain the greatest possible efficiency with the least possible expense of life of my garrison, and I have spared no labor in effecting it, and I have had most efficient and accom-

plished engineers, who have devoted all their energy to the work. But I receive no orders, no instructions. My officers and companies are taken from me, and I am left helpless. But where there’s a will there’s a way, and I have the will, hut am still under orders to act only on the defensive. I have had two companies and fifteen officers, including all my staff, taken from me. A regular officer of your department here is indispensably necessary, and he ought to be a man of business. It is said you committed a blunder in sending Barry’s battery here. Whether you did or not, it has been of the most essential service, not for anything it actually did, but for reasons that will be apparent to you; but if you did commit a blunder in bringing it here, a far greater one was committed in taking it away, and this will be seen in the fall.

Brig. Gen. L. Thomas,
Adjutant-General U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.:
General: If, as is surmised, it is the intention of the Government to send the Fifth Artillery here in the fall, I would respectfully suggest, for the consideration of the General-in-Chief, the benefit to be derived to the regiment and to the service by obtaining one-half the companies required by transfer from the other artillery regiments; that four of the companies now in this department and two at Old Point Comfort be transferred to it, thus rendering it immediately fit for service on its organization, and saving the expense of the transportation of four companies from the North here.
All of the following companies, which I think may advantageously be transferred, are now and will be without captains: A, First Artillery, Vogdes’; F, First Artillery, Chalfin’s, and H, Second Artillery, late Brooks’, now at Fort Pickens; C, Second Artillery, Arnold’s, Fort Jefferson ; F or H, Third Artillery, Reynolds’ or Burton’s, and E, Fourth Artillery, Getty’s, Fort Monroe.
Captain Chalfin is now here with his company, and one of the subalterns of Vogdes’ company, transferred to the Fifth, is also here.
I suggest that Captain Getty keep his old company, and that Captain De Hart be assigned to the Third Artillery, Company F or H, now at Old Point; that Chalfin keep his own (F, First); that Seymour be assigned to the command of A, First (Vogdes’); Griffin to H, Second (late Brooks’), and Smead to C, Second (Arnold’s), the subalterns to be assigned at Washington and ordered immediately here, as also the captains, and that the regimental staff and two of the majors with Getty’s and De Hart’s companies, fully officered, be sent as early as possible, and the other companies as fast as they are recruited and organized. These suggestions are made under the supposition of the regiment’s coming here, and also that it is not, as it is also rumored, a light artillery regiment.
I have not the slightest desire to remain in this country, having already served in Florida fourteen years and upwards, and would much prefer serving in the North; but I desire distinctly to state that in the present contest I wish to serve anywhere and in any capacity suitable to my rank that may be considered most conducive to the interest of the country, without any regard to my personal predilections.

It may not be amiss to state that the enemy opposite Have light artillery, and although the removal of the two batteries from here would seem to indicate that none were considered necessary, I would with great deference venture the opinion that if we act offensively we cannot efficiently without at least one battery, and that for extensive operations we should have two batteries.

Colonel : I respectfully report my command in comparatively good health—no serious cases. I have a hospital on the beach, about one and a half miles from the fort, finished, and the sick in it. The 8-inch columbiads sent from Tortugas are here, and will be landed to-morrow and the next day. I shall then have all the guns I intend to mount. I am building and have nearly completed a battery for the two heavy mortars (12 and 13 inch) about a quarter of a mile east of the fort and near the sea-beach. I expect next week to put up a battery for three 10-inch mortars (two of which were landed yesterday) in the center of the island and about one and a quarter miles from the fort, which done, I shall have completed (with the exception of a small battery at Spanish Fort) all the works I propose to erect.

My Dear General: The Navy Department has no copy of the instructions to D. D. Porter and other naval officers under which they cooperated with the expedition of April, 1861, to re-enforce Fort Pickens.

prepared by Colonel Keyes and by myself, or the greater part of them were so prepared, and the more important papers were signed by the President.
I left all my notes of these instructions with Hartsuff, that he might make up a complete record of the orders and instructions for the headquarters of the Department of Florida, of which Colonel Brown was placed in command. As he left Fort Pickens before they were engrossed, he left my papers in the office of the commander of the department.
The department having been broken up, it is probable that the records are still at Fort Pickens or Pensacola. I believe that the records of a department, when it is discontinued, should, by military rule, be sent to the Adjutant-General’s Office at the War Department for safe keeping.
Would it not be well to send out orders for the transmission of the early records of headquarters of the Department of Florida to your office, so as to insure their preservation ?
This earliest expedition of the war was organized under exceptional circumstances, and its records do not appear to have been preserved in Washington.
Inquiry at the Navy Department, and at the Executive Mansion and at the State Department, has failed to discover any copies of the orders.
It was an Executive act, unknown at the time to any but those engaged therein, including General Scott, the Secretary of State, and the President.

CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, EJTC.
Washington, January 5,1861.
Joseph Finegan, Esq., or Col. Geo. W. Call [Tallahassee, Fla.]:
My Dear Sir : The immediately important thing to be done is the occupation of the forts and arsenal in Florida. The naval station and forts at Pensacola are first in consequence. For this a force is necessary. I have conversed with Mr. Toombs upon the subject. He will start this week for Georgia, and says if the convention of sov’y [sovereignty] will ask Governor Brown, of Georgia, for a force he will immediately send on sufficient force and take the navy-yard and forts. The occupation of the navy-yard will give us a good supply of ordnance and make the capture of the forts easier. Major Chase built the forts and will know all about them. Lose no time, for, my opinion is, troops will be very soon dispatched to re-enforce and strengthen the forts in Florida. The arsenal at Chattahoochee should be looked to, and that at once, to prevent removal of arms.
I think that by 4th March all the Southern States will be out, except perhaps Kentucky and Missouri, and they will soon have to follow.
What is advisable is the earliest possible organization of a Southern Confederacy and of a Southern Army. The North is rapidly consolidating against us upon the plan of force. A strong Government, as eight States will make, promptly organized, and a strong Army, with Jeff. Davis for General-in-Chief, will bring them to a reasonable sense of the gravity of the crisis.

My Dear Sir : On the other side [following] is a copy of resolutions adopted at a consultation of the Senators from the seceding States, in which Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, and Florida were present.
The idea of the meeting was that the States should go out at once, and provide for an early organization of a Confederate Government, not later than 15th February. This time is allowed to enable Louisiana and Texas to participate. It seemed to be the opinion that if we left here, force, loan, and volunteer bills might be passed, which would put Mr. Lincoln in immediate condition for hostilities; whereas by remaining in our places until the 4th March, it is thought we can keep the hands of Mr. Buchanan tied and disable the Republicans from effecting any legislation which will strengthen the hands of the incoming administration.
The resolutions will be sent by the delegation to the president of the Convention. I have not been able to find Mr. Mallory this morning. Hawkins is in Connecticut. I have, therefore, thought it best to send you this copy of the resolution.

President of the Convention of the State of Alabama:
In reply to a verbal communication from the body over which you preside, made by one of its members, I ihake the following statement: My information in regard to Pensacola is that Governor Perry, of Florida, has informed me by dispatch that he has ordered the forts to be occupied by the troops of Florida and asks aid from Alabama.
The force at his command in West Florida is small and not sufficient to take and maintain the forts. Troops from Alabama could reach that doint before the troops of East and Middle Florida. This fact, with the importance of the position to Alabama as well as to Florida, induces him to make the request, as I am informed. It is believed at Washington, in South Carolina, and Georgia, as I am advised from high sources, that it is not only the policy of the Federal Government to coerce the seceding States, but as soon as possible to put herself in position by re-enforcing all the forts in the States where secession is expected. I need not suggest the danger to Florida and Alabama that must result from permitting a strong force to get possession of these forts.

OPERATIONS IN FLORIDA.
[Chap. IV.
Since the receipt of this dispatch, I have had a conference with Senator Mallory, of Florida, and Senator Fitzpatrick, of Alabama, in reference to the reasons upon which it was predicated, in which they informed me that they and Senator Slidell had a personal interview with the President and Secretary of the Navy, and were assured by them that no attack would be made upon Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens, or any excuse given for the shedding of blood, during the present administration, and that they deemed it of great importance that no attack should be made by South Carolina upon Fort Sumter, or by the troops of the seceding States upon Fort Pickens, in the present aspect of affairs. I was also iuformed by them that it was the policy of the Eepublican party to force a conflict between the Federal Government and the seceding States before the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, so that the responsibility of commencing a war should not be cast upon him. It was further stated by Mr. Mallory that a special messenger had been sent by the Secretory of the Navy to the officer in command at Fort Pickens, directing that officer to prevent the ships which had been ordered to Pensacola from entering the bay. The officer sent was Captain Barron, of Virginia, in company with Mr. Mallory.
This is all the information now in my possession in reference to the attitude of the Federal Government and the seceding States.
In reference to the forces at Pensacola, I am informed by Colonel Chase that some companies from Mississippi, now at Pensacola, are desirous of returning home, being planters, business men, &c. He has asked me what must be done in regard to this matter. I have answered him by telegraph that the troops are under the orders of the governor of Florida, and that the governor of Alabama cannot specially interfere with the Mississippi troops.
I have also received a dispatch from his excellency J. J. Pettus, governor of Mississippi, inquiring how long the Mississippi troops were desired to remain at Pensacola. I have telegraphed him that the governors of Florida and Mississippi have alone the right to control the troops of Mississippi.
Notwithstanding it now appears from the authority above given that no attack is to be made upon the forts at Pensacola now in the possession of our forces at that point, I deem it inexpedient that all the troops should be withdrawn. It is important that we should be provided for any emergency that may occur, and that a sufficient number of troops should be drilled and ready to meet it. If the troops should all be withdrawn from Pensacola, it may have a demoralizing effect upon them and upon volunteers generally, unless kept under orders at some other point. It would be more expensive to the State to transport them to some other position and keep them under arms than to permit them to remain at Pensacola.
The withdrawal of the troops from Pensacola might induce the belief among the Black Bepublicans that resistance was not intended if coercion were attempted on their part, and thus give encouragement to them.
I have now briefly given the information in my possession, and also my opinion with regard to the withdrawal of the troops from Pensacola.
Very respectfully,
A. B. MOORE.

Huntsville, Ala., February 3,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Montgomery:
My Dear Sir: There is at Pensacola an immense quantity of powder, shot, and shells, which ought to be removed to the interior at the earliest possible moment. Where they now are they are constantly exposed to the danger of recapture, and if they are permitted to remain, one of Lincoln’s first movements will be to concentrate a sufficient force at that point to retake them.
In my judgment there is no hope of a peaceful settlement of our difficulties with the Government of the United States, and all our calculations should be made with reference to the breaking out of a war of vast magnitude and almost unparalleled ferocity. We had the subject of these munitions before the military committee of our Convention, but as they were on the soil of Florida, and beyond our jurisdiction, we could do nothing. Your convention will have more extensive powers.
There is still much discontent here at the passage of the ordinance of secession, but it is growing weaker daily, and unless something is done to stir it up anew will soon die away.

It was not intended, however, that the progress of the one should retard or affect the preparations for the other 5 while, therefore, steps are being taken for negotiation, earnest efforts have been made to procure men of military science and experience, and to seek for munitions and machinery suitable to remedy the supposed or known deficiencies in the existing supplies. Congress, probably, did not design to interfere with the progress of constructions which had been commenced by State authority, the instruction of troops, or other preparation, which will be useful in further operations, and I hope you will continue thus to prepare for whatever exigency may arise. As soon as a skillful engineer is available he will be sent to make an examination of the fort within your State and to aid in the works needful to the execution of the resolution of Congress, should force be the means to which we must resort.
Yery respectfully and truly, yours,
JEFF’N DAYIS.

Sir : By the inclosed order yon will perceive that you have been assigned to the command of the troops at and near Pensacola, Fla. It is of the greatest importance that the Government here should be accurately informed of the state of affairs in that quarter. The Secretary of War, therefore, desires that you will as soon as possible forward to this office a comprehensive report of whatever may come under your observation, especially in regard to affairs immediately connected with Fort Pickens. You will also be pleased to make reports to this Department as often as it may be convenient for you to do so. Yery little information in respect to the nature of the service and its requirements at the station to which you have been assigned to command has reached this Government. The Department is anxious to know accurately the condition of things there and the necessities of the service, so that it can act with full intelligence, which is so much wanting at present.
A return of your command is required.

Sir : As one of the delegates to the Alabama State Convention I have received a letter from General A. C. Gordon, of Henry County, in said State, from which I make the following extract:
Nothing doing at Apalachicola. No cotton is selling, nor can shipments he made from that port. Unless some of our companies are sent to Apalachicola it will he humed up and onr cotton taken if war should he declared. There is now over one million (value) of cotton at Apalachicola at ten cents. Call the attention of our President to the situation of our people in that particular. No forts or guns at that place to defend it. Two companies of volunteers are there without halls or powder. Something should he done, and that very soon, for the protection of that place and property. Alabama will suffer more than Florida will if that place should fall into the hands of an enemy.
A large portion of the people of Southeastern Alabama ship their cotton to that port for market, and apprehend danger to their interests there, as you will see from the above extract. Will you do me the kindness to make such suggestions in relation to the matter as you may deem proper ?

Commanding Troops near Pensacola, Fla.:
Sir: Your two dispatches dated the 12th instant* (one accompanied by a return of the troops under your command) have been received, and laid before the Secretary of War, by whom I am instructed to reply as follows:
Requisitions upon the States of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, and Florida have been made for troops to the number of five thousand, to be placed under your command, and it may be expected that a large proportion of this force will be reported to you in the course of the next ten days. A copy of the law regulating the Provisional Forces of the Confederacy is inclosed for your information and guidance,* and by it you will be governed in mustering the troops into service. It is suggested that the formation by regiments from each separate State will be the most convenient. The requisite blank muster rolls will be sent to you.
Your appointment of Colonel Forney as acting inspector-general meets fully with the approval of the Department.
In regard to an officer of experience in the Quartermaster’s and Subsistence Departments, the Secretary regrets that at present there is no one available who possesses the experience required for those responsible duties, but as soon as it will be possible to do so an officer will be ordered to report to you. In the mean time it will be necessary for you to rely upon such ability as you may have at hand.
You are desired to make known your wants in respect to artillery and the munitions of war, having in view the defense of Pensacola and the reduction of Fort Pickens. The Department would be gratified to receive your opinions in regard to that important subject, and particularly as to the probable effect of the fire from the ships in the roadstead upon parties making regular approaches to the fort.
In assigning you to the command of the forces at or near Pensacola and Fort Pickens, it was intended by the Department that the navy-yard and all things connected therewith should be included, and you are therefore to be governed accordingly. You will please convey this information to Captain Farrand as the orders of the Government.
At your suggestion, Capt. H. Oladowski has been assigned to you as ordnance officer, and he has been directed by telegraph to report to you immediately.

It is observed that you have three months’ subsistence on hand for your present force. In view of the large increase which you may expect, you will, of course, make timely estimates for additional supplies. A large quantity has been turned over to the General Government by this State. Funds will be forwarded to you as soon as possible, but it is important that your requisitions should be made on this Department specifying the different heads of expenditure.
It will not be practicable to detach General Yan Dorn upon the mission you refer to. That .officer has been appointed colonel of infantry, and his services will be immediately needed either at Fort Morgan or the mouth of the Mississippi.

Sir : The port of Apalachicola is without any means of defense, having only two hundred muskets and sixty rifles; no artillery of any kind. The commercial importance of the city may make it more than a point of ordinary interest to the United States Government, if they intend to enforce the collection of the revenue.
The citizens of the city are organized into four volunteer companies, which comprise about two-thirds of the i>eople capable of bearing arms. They are under apprehension that the city and property therein is in danger.
I beg to call your attention to the fact, and request that some means of protection may be afforded us if there is a probability of hostilities. The men can be raised there, it we had the guns.

The commanding general learns with surprise and regret that some of our citizens are engaged in the business of furnishing supplies of fuel, water, and provisions to the armed vessels of the United States now occupying a Threatening position off this harbor.
That no misunderstanding may exist on this subject, it is announced to all concerned that this traffic is strictly forbidden, and. all such supplies w7hich may be captured in transit to such vessels, or to Fort Pickens, will be confiscated. The more effectually to enforce this prohibition, no boat or vessel will be allowed to visit Fort Pickens, or any United States naval vessel, without special sanction.

One hundred and fifty men of this battalion will be immediately sent to your command, and the remainder of this battalion will follow a few days after.

[Chap. IV.
Executive Department,
Montgomery, Ala.y March 19,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.:
Sir : From the most reliable information I have reasons to apprehend that difficulty will occur in regard to the transfer of the State troops now at Pensacola to the Government of the Confederate States unless some steps are taken to avoid it. The troops express fears that they are to be transferred without the privilege of electing their colonel and majors, and that they will be continued in service for twelve months, even if pending difficulties should be amicably arranged in a shorter time.
I have said to Captains Baker and Clark, who are here for the purpose of getting information on the subject, that I did not consider there were any reasonable grounds for such apprehension; that the ordinance under which they volunteered authorized the volunteers u when organized into regiments or battalions to elect their regimental field officers,” and that I presumed this provision of the ordinance would not be disturbed. I further stated to them that said ordinance x>rovided that u volunteers shall not be accepted for a less term of service than one year, unless sooner discharged by the governor,” and that it had been my intention so soon as the three-years’ recruits should be raised, organized, and stationed at the forts to relieve the volunteers, unless there was a necessity for their services. Captains Baker and Clark seem to have no doubt that if the Secretary of War concurs in the views above expressed by me all difficulties will be removed.
I regard it as a matter of the utmost importance that this question should be so understood that the troops will not hesitate to be transferred at once. Should they decline, I fear the effect upon other troops and the public service.
In a few days companies enough will be at Pensacola to constitute a regiment, and officers can be elected. Mne companies will be there tomorrow. Will you say to me in reply to this whether or not this will be acceptable to the Confederate Government ?
I take it as granted that the volunteers will be discharged so soon as by the establishment of peace the necessity for their services ceases. Let me assure you that the object of this letter is to secure the consent of the troops to their immediate transfer. Any doubt upon the subject of their consent gives me pain and trouble.

The organization of companies will be such as may be furnished by States, but the number of privates should not fall below fifty per company. Should the companies come singly, or organized into battalions or regiments before muster into service, they will be received with such officers as have been furnished by the State, medical officers excepted.

was predicated on several occurrences which I could not explain in a dispatch, and which admitted of no delay. A strong easterly wind was blowing, calculated to drive off the United States naval vessels. It continues yet, but they hold on, though evidently with trouble. They ha ve placed an Engineer officer in Fort Pickens in violation, as I conceive, of the agreement “not to re-enforce.”' And, Anally, I have reason to believe the garrison in Fort Pickens is greatly demoralized by influences which are operating strongly in our favor. Under these circumstances I desired to know if I should be free to act when a favorable occasion might offer. Believing myself that the United States Government and some of its agents are acting in bad faith towards us, I do not hesitate to believe we are entirely absolved from all obligations under the agreement of 29th January; but as a question of political policy might be raised, I deem it prudent to ask the consent of the Department before acting on so important a matter.
I am not prepared with my batteries for anything more than a feeble defense (see my requisition for ordnance and ordnance stores), and that condition cannot be changed until I can get supplies. The only attack which I could hope to make now would be a sudden dash, distracting the enemy by a false attack, and scaling the walls in an opposite direction. The weakness of the garrison, and the ardor and ignorance of my troops, would be strong elements of success. In this movement I should not propose to Are a gun unless in the diversion.
Such is now the incessant occupation of my staff officers in receiving, supplying, and organizing troops that but iitfle can be done in other preparations. We have the force and the labor necessary, but the skill to apply them is confined to a few.

Montgomery, April 16,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Montgomery:
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following statement in relation to my recent visit to Pensacola to your attention:
I left Washington City on the morning of April 7, with a communication from the Secretary of the Navy to Captain Adams, of the United States ship Sabine, and was informed by the Secretary that I would have no difficulty in making the communication to Captain Adams under the existing agreement. I arrived at Pensacola on the morning of the 11th instant, announced myself to Mr. LeBaron as an officer of the U. S. Navy, who sent an officer with me to General Bragg. I informed General Bragg that I had come from Washington, and desired to communicate with Captain Adams, of the Sabine. He wrote me a pass authorizing me to go to the Sabine, and upon handing it to me he asked if I had dispatches for Captain Adams. I replied that I had not written ones, but that I had a verbal communication to make to him from the Navy Department. I then asked him if I would be permitted to land on my return towards Washington. He replied that I would, provided Captain Adams or myself did nothing in violation of the agreement existing between them. I remarked that I knew nothing of the agreement he mentioned. I then left General Bragg and went to the navy-yard, from whence I embarked for the Wyandotte about 4 o’clock p. m. On reaching her I was informed by her commander that he could not carry me out to the Sabine that night, in consequence of the strong wind and rough sea on the bar.
During that evening Lieutenant Slemmer, of Fort Pickens, came on board, and I had a few moments’ social conversation with him. I had no dispatches for him whatever, and I gave him no information as to the nature of the communication which I had to make to Captain Adams. Of course he knew, as did every officer on board, that I came from the Navy Department to communicate with Captain Adams. On the next

CORRESPONDENCE, ETC—CONFEDERATE.	463
morning, the 12th instant, while waiting for the sea to subside on the bar, so that the Wyandotte could go out, one of the officers suggested that we should go on shore and take a look at Fort Pickens, to which I assented. We accordingly, about 9 o’clock a. m., landed there, and walked about the ramparts for half an hour, and then returned on board. During my visit to the fort I did not see Lieutenant Slemmer, as he was asleep and I did not desire to disturb him, as I had no object in seeing him, except to pay him the proper visit of courtesy on going within the limits of his command.
At about 10.30 or 11 o’clock a. m. the Wyandotte went out of the harbor and put me on board the Sabine, somewhere near 12 o’clock. I made my communication to Captain Adams, and stated to him what General Bragg had said in relation to the agreement between them. He, nevertheless, gave me a written order to return to Washington as u special messenger,” which order you have. Of course I proceeded to obey the order, and was landed by the Wyandotte at Pensacola about 5 o’clock p. m. I was told by Captain Adams that it was not necessary for me to see General Bragg on my return, and therefore I did not stop at his quarters.
I make this statement, ready with the solemnity of an oath to be confirmed. It is made, not with regard to personal safety, or of any consequences that might result to me personally, but purely in defense of my honor as an officer and a gentleman. Several officers in the Confederate service—among them I will mention Capt. D. X. Ingraham and Surg. W. F. Carrington—I think I can appeal to with confidence.
I respectfully submit this statement to the consideration of the honorable Secretary of War.

Brig. Gen. Braxton Bragg, Commanding at Pensacola:
General : Apprehending that you might have construed the suggestions thrown out from this Department as to the erection of batteries on Santa Rosa Island, and as to the attack on Fort Pickens, into orders to proceed first to the occupation of that island, and next to an immediate bombardment and general assault of the fort, I write to say that as to both points I desire you will consult your own judgment and discretion. It is true that this Government considers the early reduction of Fort Pickens as highly important, but it is not desired that you will proceed until you shall feel assured of success through an entire confidence in your own arrangements, and the dispositions must be left with yourself, save when positively instructed.
Yery respectfully,
L. P. WALKER.
Headquarters Troops of Confederate States,
Near Pensacola, Fla., May 6, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Montgomery:
From the tenor of my orders and instructions there has existed no doubt in my mind that the Department desired me first to secure the defense of my position here, and then the reduction of Fort Pickens, if practicable. Eo suggestion has been regarded as an order to proceed in any manner contrary to my own conviction, and no step has been taken which my own judgment has not approved 5 but I have felt it a duty to lay before you the means and sacrifices necessary to accomplish the object.
The change which has been made in my proposed plan of operations is the result of unavoidable delay, by which the enemy has been enabled to frustrate my first intentions. Fort Pickens is now more than twice as strong as it was three weeks ago, and the approaches to it will be made more and more difficult every day. They are now extending their operations on the island of Santa Bosa, and every hour will add seriously to the difficulties to be overcome. The importance of rapid movement on our part is very apparent if we are to proceed to the reduction of Fort Pickens, but it would be very bad policy to move until we are prepared to succeed. My plan for a lodgment on the island is arranged, and will be executed as soon as the means are available. In the present state of that work, with a garrison fully competent for its defense, and a support at all times ready at hand in the fleet, its reduction will cost us many lives, much time and labor, and a very large expenditure of money. Whether the end will justify the means the Department must decide.
My works on this side, both for attack and defense, are nearly completed, and preparations are going on for the island movement, but we are still deficient in many essentials. Five thousand sets of infantry accouterments are necessary for the preservation of our ammunition. It is now carried by the men in their pockets, and one day’s hard service would destroy it all. A supply of musket cartridges is also a first necessity. Having yet had no response to my requisition of last March, I shall send an officer to Louisiana to see if some can be had at Baton Rouge. The present supply here would last me in an engagement about thirty minutes. Our best defense against the fleet—shells—cannot be used for want of fuses. Kot one has yet reached me. These items are not men-30 R R

tioned by way of complaint, for I know full well tlie difficulties and embarrassments which surround the Department, but simply to show how utterly impossible it is to check the enemy in his operations.
Night before last we succeeded in placing some serious obstructions in the channel between Forts Pickens and McBee, which will intimidate the fleet and seriously retard any movement to enter the harbor. It might be much more effectually blocked, but at a heavy expense for the necessary vessels. The entrance, however, of steamers would entirely frustrate our movement on the island, if it did not result in a capture of our force.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BBAXTON BBAGG, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Montgomery, May 10,1861.
Hon. Secretary of War:
Having had the honor to converse with you more than once touching the state of the public service in the State which I represent, I beg leave to present the following remarks:
There may be little doubt that in the war which is now inaugurated the enemy will not be unmindful of its vast preponderance of maritime power, and that at the same time that they press forward upon the land toward Virginia they will make a strong diversion along the Atlantic and in the Gulf. Beside the indications of their intentions at Pensacola and New Orleans, the sending out of privateers on the part of the South will be met by the North by other letters of marque, and having no commerce to prey upon they will be directed against our sea-coast and its property, and they will endeavor to ravage the sea islands of Georgia and South Carolina and the coast of Florida. The capital of the last-named State is in close proximity to the Gulf-twenty miles by railroad—and in the midst of the most dense negro population and the largest plantations in this State.
From Pensacola to Saint Augustine—fourteen hundred miles and more—there is nothing approaching to a fortification, except those at Key West and Tortugas, which are held by the foe, and are for them a convenient and illimitable naval depot. They are the keys of the Gulf.
To fortify this’immense extent of coast is impossible. Want of time, want of money, want of engineers, want of heavy guns, all forbid it. Fortunately, the entrances for vessels of any size are very few. They may be enumerated thus: Saint Andrew’s, Saint Joseph’s, Apalachicola, Saint Mark’s, Cedar Keys, Tampa. Passing over the peninsula, Key West, and its dependencies, you come on the Atlantic coast to the mouth of the Saint John’s or Jacksonville, and lastly Fernandina. Saint Augustine is fortified, though imperfectly armed. There are of cannon, of all kinds, in Florida:
At Saint Augustine: Four 32-pounders, mounted en barbette; four 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, not mounted; two 12-pounder mountain howitzers, and one brass 6-pounder field piece.
At mouth of Saint John’s Biver there are four 32-pounders, mounted en barbette.
At Fernandina: Four 32-pounders, mounted en barbette.
At Cedar Keys: Two 32-pounders, mounted en barbette.
At Saint Mark’s: Tsfo 32-pounders, mounted en barbette.

## p. 467 (#483) ############################################

﻿Chap. IV.] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.--------CONFEDERATE.	467
At Apalachicola: Two 6-pounder field pieces, brass.
At Tallahassee: * Two 6-pounder field pieces, brass.
There are no other cannon in the State, save at Pensacola. With this artillery and with the aid of an engineer much may be done to fortify to such extent as to repel vessels of war or privateers. A system of small armed steamers to cruise upon the coast would be one very powerful element of defense, but in addition to these I propose to combine the local military material of the country. I estimate the entire rank and file of Florida at a little less than nine thousand men. This is very small for a State having a sea-coast of fifteen hundred miles in extent, and an area of fifty-two thousand square miles. The country is deficient in arms, but still more in military organization and drill.
To make the material more efficient, and at the same time to meet the present exigency of coast defense, I propose that to each of the following seaports, Saint Mark’s, Apalachicola, Cedar Keys, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Fernandina, there shall be sent an officer of the Confederate Army, of the rank of first lieutenant or captain, of military ability, charged with the duty to recruit from the vicinity a company each, of not less than sixty-four nor more than one hundred men, who when recruited shall belong to the Confederate Army, and be put upon pay and rations, the said company to serve for the time being as a garrison, and to be drilled as well for infantry as artillery, subject on any emergency to be transferred elsewhere at the order of the President 5 the officers to superintend any constructions which require an engineer. This garrison to act in concert with the steamers of the coast-guard, and in case of attempted invasion to be backed by the militia of the country, around whom in action they would serve as a point dJappuL
I cannot too much press the importance of the policy that while the material of the country be made as efficient as possible in its own defense, at the same time the industrial pursuits of the country should be interrupted as little as may be by distant marches and countermarches. It is of the last importance that the crops now planted should not be disturbed nor the negroes withdrawn. Money is the sinews of war. If the plantations belonging to our Gulf coast are ravaged or deserted, to avoid the plunder of the negroes (not to speak of insurrection), the capacity of the country to contribute to the war is at an end. If the corn crop should fail a large mass of starving population will be thrown back upon the higher country, itself a buyer from the Northwest, that refuses to sell its food. I have spoken particularly of the Florida coast. It will be remembered that the coast of Florida is at once the coast of Georgia and Alabama. Macon is as near to Saint Mark’s on the Gulf as to Savannah on the Atlantic. The Sea Islands and coast of South Carolina and Georgia are equally exposed to predatory warfare; but while they have each, say, two hundred miles of sea-coast only, they reach back into the mountains into a farming country, where the slave element does not predominate, and from which aid may be drawn to the lower country of the coast.
This war will not be determined by a single pitched battle of two large armies. There will be the line of the Ohio, the line of the Potomac, the line of the Atlantic States, and the line of the Gulf States. Until we can take the ocean with a navy on equal terms with the enemy—a distant day—the conflict on these two last must be at the water’s edge.
France, under Napoleon I, had the Army of the Ehine, the Army of Italy, the Army of Spain, and the Army of England, which was so dexterously transferred to Austerlitz. It will probably result that the Confederacy will have its Army of the Ohio, its Army of the Potomac, its

Army of the Atlantic States, and its Army of the Gulf of Mexico. Florida has upward of seven hundred men in the field at Pensacola. She has nearly two thousand more embodied under the last requisition of the War Department, equipped by the State, and ready to march whenever and wherever the President may order. She stands ready to sustain the Government and the war with her utmost strength. She asks in return that her sons may have their just share of the appointments to military service, the great incentive to young Southern men. On her own soil or on any other soil she is ready to do her duty. Her men will, however, turn their faces from their homes with much more alacrity if the Government shall have initiated some system which will provide as far as may be for the protection of her coast.
I desire lastly to speak of the bays of Saint Andrew and Saint Joseph, in West Florida. The first of these is within a hundred miles of Fort Pickens, the other fifty miles further east. The depth of water is at Saint Andrew’s eighteen feet, at Saint Joseph’s twenty. Both afford the means of penetrating into Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. A single battery at the last-mentioned place would defend the harbor against incursions. I have to suggest to the Department that a competent engineer be sent to examine these bays and to report thereon.
It is not impossible that some of the ports of Florida, which by reason of their obscurity are not yet blockaded, may be made use of for the introduction of arms purchased abroad. Fernandina, on the Atlantic, and, in case of impediment there, Saint Andrew’s or Saint Joseph’s, would for this purpose be highly important, and I beg leave to call them to your attention in that point of view.

thousand. We have much sickness. In my eight infantry companies there are two hundred on sick-list. In First Eegiment three hundred, and twenty-four out of nine hundred and seventeen are sick. Hot so many in the Georgia battalion. Our troops are dispirited by inaction, desponding at the thought that they will never have a fight. I have had several conversations with the general, and find that he is regretting that no opportunity could be afforded him on the field of Manassas to show his ability to control and fight an army. From what I have seen of him I have no doubt that his selection for this command has been a most judicious one. The army has throughout great confidence in him.
I find myself a good deal abused. I have established and maintained so far order and discipline in my regiment. It is difficult to bring volunteers down to a soldier’s life, but we cannot succeed without it. If all the regiments at Manassas had been as well drilled as mine we would not have lost so many men. I refer to General W. H. T. Walker, who will be in Eichmond, as to my regiment and how we are doing.
Well, after all this I wish to say that if Virginia is to be the field of fight, that Pensacola is a fine place for a school of instruction, and the Seventh Eegiment wants to graduate in about fifteen days or thereabouts, so as to make room for some green squad. We are only in for twelve months, and I am perfectly willing to stay here that long, but I want a place for the war. Alabama is offering many troops. I believe that I can take charge of a regiment and put it in fighting order in two months or less. If you transfer me to a regiment for the war, Colonel Ooltart will have command here. He is a fine officer, and just now far more popular than I am in the regiment. If, then, Alabama should offer a number of companies sufficient to make a regiment, for which no commander has been selected, I ask for the post, to be transferred, and I refer to all the officers of this Army, regulars ^nd volunteers, as to qualifications in drill and discipline.
I rejoice over Manassas for many reasons, and over the valor of the Fourth Eegiment our boys have shouted time and again. I trust that the Government will find all their efforts crowned with success, and when we shall have soundly whipped the scoundrels the just meed of praise will certainly be given to the man who in his office is laboring day and night to maintain and care for our vast Army. May Heaven bless you and strengthen you for your great labors.

.Dear Sir: Having been recently elected and commissioned colonel of this regiment, I ask that you will give your attention to the following views: I have six companies of infantry on this (Amelia) island, two at the mouth of the Saint John’s, and two at Saint Augustine. On this island there is a sort of battery, but incomplete. The guns, four in number, 6-pounders, are badly mounted, and would not stand continued firing. I regard the battery and guns as very little protection, the range of the guns being too short to protect the channel. I have heard that forty 32-jiounders were ordered over here, also a competent engi-

neer. I hope this is so. This will satisfy our wishes on this point. Our companies here are composed of from eighty to one hundred men, more than enough to manage the guns at the battery, while their other duties in guarding the coast will give them ample employment. I would, therefore, ask that I be allowed to raise an artillery company of sixty-four men, which should be attached to this regiment. This company I could raise in a very short time. But more important to the defense of this island than anything is a company of dragoons or mounted men. This island has a sea coast stretching along the Atlantic eighteen miles in length, at any point of which the enemy could land any number of troops in surf-boats.
' The enemy’s war vessels are in sight every day; one, supposed to be the Vincennes, having on Monday burned a prize within a mile and a half of the shore. They also anchored on last Thursday evening within two miles of the shore, opposite this town, making the distance, land and water, from the town three and a half miles. Now, if I had a horse company 1 could patrol the sea beach, and they could not land without my being in so as to meet them at the place of landing. With a cavalry company I could so dispose my infantry as to meet them, the enemy, at almost any point they may attempt to land; but with only six companies on the island, placing one of these at the battery, then you have five infantry companies to protect and guard a coast of eighteen or twenty miles. I hope, therefore, that a company of dragoons will be allowed me in addition to what I have in my command. I regard this as absolutely necessary to our proper defense, and ask to refer you to a report which Captain McBory has furnished at my request, he having been captain of a volunteer artillery company on this island.
I have not as yet visited the mouth of the Saint John’s or Saint Augustine, this regiment only having been organized on the 11th instant. As soon as I can see those places I will, if necessary, report their condition.

J. A. Alexander, in reply to inquiries made by me. Citizens of Apalachicola have promised to furnish the teams. Of all places in this State Apalachicola is most important to the commercial interests of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, and at present is in a condition almost defenseless. Now is the time to prepare for its defense. A few weeks hence

may be too late. The enemy is well acquainted with the localities, and my opinion is that if they shall attempt to take Apalachicola they will land their forces for the purpose between Saint Joseph’s Bay and the city. If successful they would capture all the vessels in port, a quantity of provisions, and other valuable property, and having cut off supplies from the troops on Saint Vincent’s Island would create a necessity for their surrender. It is not probable the enemy will make the attack with a force which they may believe insufficient to accomplish these purposes.
I have examined with care the face of the country six miles in rear of Apalachicola, toward Saint Joseph’s Bay, and the grounds are very favorable for defense by artillery, cavalry, and infantry; and if no attack shall be made before the 15th of October I will endeavor to have State troops placed in suitable positions to co-operate successfully with such troops as may be there in the service of the Confederate States.
I am, very respectfully, sir, yours, &c.,

If an officer who is a good artillerist could be sent to Apalachicola he could render very efficient service in the arrangement of cannon and drilling of troops to use them.

Apalachicola, August 10,1861. General Milton, Governor Elect of Florida:
Sir : I have the honor to report that there is an absolute necessity of ten teams in order to complete the fortifications now in process of erection on Saint Vincent’s Island, and in addition to its present armament, viz, four 32-pounders, mounted on ship carriages, we shall require four 32-pounders on barbette carriages, and two 24-pounders on siege carriages. For the defense of the Saint Joseph’s road, we shall require two 24-pounders, on siege or field carriages. There is an exceedingly small supply of ammunition here, which deficiency it is necessary to remedy as early as possible, and we are in immediate need of at least one thousand friction primers.
I have the honor to be, sir, yours, very respectfully,
J. A. ALEXANDER, Lieutenant, G. S. Army.

Richmond, Va.3 August 17,1861. General Braxton Bragg, Commanding, Pensacola;
General : Your requisition for ordnance and ordnance stores, inclosed with letter of 7th August, 1861, has been referred to the Bureau of Ordnance, and returned with report that there are no guns. These guns have been specially in demand for Manassas, and great efforts are being made to supply this want. With regard to disposition of the company, the Secretary of War decides that it is a question whether you can employ it advantageously without these guns, or whether with a different armament it might not serve more advantageously elsewhere, which your discretion can determine.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

give up the keys to any person with my life. They replied that it was no use to he obstinate, for they had the magazine already in their possession, and that they had a party of twenty men around it, and were determined to keep it; if not by fair means, they would break it open. I considered a while and seen it was no use to persevere, for they were determined to have what ordnance stores there was at the post. I then told them if they would sign receipts to me for the ordnance and ordnance stores at the post, I would give it up to them. (There was no alternative left me but to act as I did.) They replied that they would do so. The receipt was signed, and [they] left fifteen men in charge of the post) the remainder proceeded to take Fort Caswell, which is in their possession by this time. I do not know what arrangement Ordnance Sergeant Dardingkiller made with them.
They have taken out of the magazine at this post nearly all the musket cartridges in it; they are also taking the guns out of the block-house and mounting them. I would have telegraphed long since, had 1 an opportunity of doing so, to the Department, but I could get no means of going to Wilmington—no person would hire me their horse or boat for that purpose. Please send me instructions how I am to act hereafter, as there is expected this afternoon 300 men from Wilmington, FT. C., to occupy both posts.
They have not as yet decided what to do with me or Sergeant Dardingkiller. I expect they will send us away as soon as they get some kind of an organization amongst them.

Fort Johnston, 3ST. C., January 10, 1861—11 o’clock a. m.
Sir : I respectfully wish to state that the party of citizens who took possession of Forts Johnston and Caswell yesterday has perceived their error. It seems that they were not sustained by the people which brought them into it, or caused them to create such an act of violence against the Federal Government. They were the leaders of a few fanatics in Wilmington, who sent a dispatch to this place that the Department had ordered the revenue cutter forward with troops to garrison Forts Johnston and Caswell, and that they should take possession of the forts before the Federal troops should arrive; that they would assist them with both men, money, and provisions. They failed to do so.
Then they came to both me and Sergeant Dardingkiller and asked us to take back the public property. I answered, Yes; if there was none of it broken, or none of the ammunition expended. It was returned in good order. As they deprived me of all quick communication with the Department, so that I might receive instructions how to act, I thought to do as I did. I wanted to go to Wilmington to telegraph this business to the Department, but when they found I was going on the schooner that runs between here and Wilmington as a passenger boat, the passengers chartered the boat from the owners to prevent me from going. I hope that the conduct of me and Sergeant Dardingkiller will

the woodwork of the quarters and barracks and of one of the drawbridges required renewing and painting; the iron-work and door and window fastenings were much rusted; the shingled interior slope was very much rotted, and the masonry in many places required repointing. The embankment of the causeway needed repairing, and the bridge across the canal to be rebuilt. A few guns (four, I believe) were mounted on the southeast or sea front, but the carriages were decayed and weak.
The site of Fort Macon was tolerably well preserved by the temporary brush jetties that were constructed last winter for this purpose.

Reports of Capt. John G. Foster, TI. 8. Engineers, of the second seizure of Forts Caswell and Johnston.
New York, May 18,1861.
General : I have the honor to report the circumstances connected with the seizure of Fort Caswell by the Militia of North Carolina, as they are reported to me by John Bussell, fort keeper, who has arrived •in this city:
The fort was taken possession of by the Wilmington Light Infantry, Col. John Cantwell commanding, on April 16. The force was subsequently increased, and a large force of laborers employed to mount the guns; to erect temporary quarters on the terre-pleins; to construct a railway from the wharf to the fort 5 to deepen the ditch of the fort, and to erect an earthen battery about one-half mile from the fort, on the beach, opposite the bar.
The eighteen guns inside the fort were mounted, and four others of the same size brought there, and also mounted, beside two guns at the main gates, inside the fort. A considerable quantity of provisions and many boxes of rifles were landed and stored in the fort. The lights in the light-houses and beacons are put out, and the Frying-Pan Shoal light-ship removed. A schooner was sunk in the new inlet to obstruct the channel, but it does not appear to accomplish this completely, as vessels pass in and out by it.
Fort Johnston was also in the possession of the insurgents, but some excitement had arisen from the occurrence of two fires simultaneously— one inside of the fort, which consumed the large building called the hospital, and the other a private house outside of the walls. Both were supposed to be the work of incendiaries, and some negroes were suspected.
The troops at Fort Caswell were actively employed in preparing for defense, making ball cartridges, &c., and W. H. C. Whiting, formerly of the Corps of Engineers, had been there to give the necessary directions as a major of Engineers of the so-called Southern Confederacy. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. G. FOSTEB, Captain, Engineers.

Fort Caswell, mouth of Cape Fear River, A. (7.—This fort was taken possession of on the 16th of April, 1861, by a militia company from Wilmington, N. C., commanded by Mr. John Cantwell. The fort keeper and ordnance sergeant were forced to leave, and all public property in the fort and at Fort Johnston, Smithville, N. C., was taken possession of.
At the time of this seizure very few guns were inside of the fort, and these were of inferior calibers, and without carriages to mount them. The gorge of the main work and the right flank and gorge of the covered way were without traverse circles for guns, which was a serious want, as these parts now bear more directly than others upon the channel, which has shifted on the bar from the east to the west shore. The fort generally was in good repair, having been quite thoroughly repaired two years since. The shot furnaces were not in good order, and required rebuilding, as is also the case with those at Fort Macon.

Headquarters Troops North Carolina Arsenal,
Fayetteville, N. 0., April 23, 1861.
Colonel: I have to report that this arsenal was surrendered to the State of North Carolina yesterday, on demand of the governor of the State, which demand was sustained by a force of one thousand and fifty rank and file of State troops, well armed and equipped. The demand for the surrender being made, supported by such an overwhelming force, after consulting with Captain Bradford, the commander of the arsenal, we did not deem it necessary to offer a resistance, which in the end could be of no avail other than the total annihilation of my command (which at the time consisted of only forty-two effective muskets), as there was no probability, or* possibility I may say, I could or would be re-enforced. I inclose a certified copy of the terms agreed upon between myself and the governor’s aide-de-camp with regard to the withdrawal of my command.
I have to-day ordered Lieutenant De Lagnel to Wilmington, N. C., for the purpose of procuring transportation for the troops to one of the northern posts.
Captain Bradford, the commander of the arsenal, and on whom the demand for surrender was made, has made an official report * to the chief of his corps, which embraces all the particulars regarding the surrender.

Duplicate of the terms agreed upon between Maj. S. S. Anderson, Second Artillery, and Warren Winslow, esq., on the part of Governor Ellis, for the withdrawal of the United States forces now stationed at the North Carolina Arsenal, in Fayetteville, N. C., and the transfer of the United States property to the State authorities.
1.	The United States troops now composing the guard at the United States Arsenal shall be permitted to march out with their arms, and all of their personal and company property of every description whatsoever.
2.	The subsistence stores necessary for their use hence to their ultimate destination shall be taken by them.
3.	The United States troops now about to evacuate the arsenal at this place shall be permitted to salute (with twenty-one guns) their flag before it is lowered.
4.	The company of United States troops now here shall be permitted to retain their quarters, and be unmolested therein, until arrangements can be made (which will be immediately done) for their removal.
5.	A safe-conduct shall be given (pledging therefor the good faith and honor of the State of North Carolina) to the United States troops now evacuating the United States Arsenal, through the State of North Carolina, to the coast; nor shall they be molested in their property or person while within the limits of the State or the waters thereof.
6.	Every facility for leaving the borders of North Carolina shall be afforded to the withdrawn command, nor shall any impediment be thrown in the way to prevent the accomplishment of this object.
7.	In order to the preservation of a peaceful condition between the parties to these terms of agreement, it is agreed that while the withdrawing United States forces remain necessarily at the arsenal awaiting transportation, the present command will be permitted to act as a guard, for the sole purpose of preserving good order and decorum within their own command.
8.	With a desire to avoid unnecessarily wounding and paining the feelings or sense of honor of the parties to these terms of agreement, no flag will be hoisted on the staff at the arsenal, or within the limits of the Government grounds, until the departure of the troops, excepting the necessary raising of the North Carolina or Confederate flag, in token of evacuation by the one party and possession by the other party.
On the part of the governor of North Carolina, these terms were fully assented to.

tillery. It will be proper to state, in this connection, the circumstances under which this change of station has been made, and with that view I will copy the remarks indorsed upon the muster rolls and company return for the past month:
On April 22, 1861, the United States Arsenal at Fayetteville, N. C., was surrendered to the State of North Carolina, upon a demand being made by the governor of the State, hacked by a force of between one thousand and one thousand one hundred men, well armed and equipped, having also several pieces of field artillery. The number of the effective United States forces was forty-two. The weakness of the command, the hopelessness of relief, the distance from the coast, and the want of supplies, which had been cut off, rendered the surrender a military necessity.
The command left the arsenal (with arms, company and personal property) on April 27, 1861, and Wilmington, K C., on April 28,1861, on the schooner Charles Dennis, and reached Fort Hamilton on the morning of May 7, 1861. Having no accurate copy of the terms of surrender, I can only give in substance the conditions upon which the withdrawal of the garrison and the transfer of the property was effected. As nearly as I can recollect they were as follows:
First. That the troops composing the guard at the United States Arsenal should be allowed to march out, retaining their personal and company property of every description whatsoever.
Second. That the subsistence stores necessary for the use of the command should be taken by them.
Third. That the flag should be saluted before being lowered.
Fourth. That the command should be permitted to occupy their accustomed quarters until arrangements for the removal of the troops could be made.
Fifth. That a safe-conduct should be given to the withdrawn command for their protection through the State to the coast.
Sixth. That every facility should be afforded for the quiet, unmolested, and speedy removal of the United States troops.
Seventh. That, for the preservation of good order and discipline in the command, the United States troops should continue to act as a guard until their withdrawal$ maintain their guards and sentinels as before.
Eighth. That during the stay of the United States troops at the arsenal, awaitiug transportation, no flag should be hoisted on the staff or within the Government inclosure, except the necessary raising of the North Carolina or Confederate flag, on taking possession by the one party and surrender by the other.
Such, sir, are, I believe, the facts attending the presence of my company at this place; but, given from recollection altogether, there may be some inaccuracies, which will be corrected upon the reception of the report of the officers commanding, respectively, the arsenal and the guard.
With respect, I remain your obedient servant,

Such a measure is here notoriously unnecessary, and has produced no little irritation in the public mind.

J. A. J. Bradford, Captain, U. S. Army,
Commanding U. 8. Arsenal at Fayetteville, N. C.:
Dear Sir : I inclose a copy of a paper presented to me this morning asking that application be made for a company of United States soldiers to be in charge at the arsenal under your command. The high standing in point of respectability and influence of the parties whose names appear to the paper entitles it to every respect, and induces me to submit the subject to your consideration.
In submitting the application I beg to call your attention to an excited state of feeling in the community, originating, as is alleged, in a sense of insecurity because of the large amount of arms and munition at your post, without adequate force for their protection. This fact strongly suggests that something should be done to allay apprehensions certainly existing, whether with or without sufficient cause. I suppose it is the expectation of the applicants that I communicate directly with the Department at Washington on the subject. I deemed it proper, and certainly respectful, to submit the request to you as the officer in command at the post referred to, for the reason that the Department would most likely consult your judgment as to the necessity of the force asked for, and for the further reason that by so doing it would be most likely to insure a more speedy reply to the application.
Hoping I may be enabled through you to give a satisfactory reply to the applicants as early as the nature of the business will allow,
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

matter, we wish most respectfully to add in this paper some of the reasons moving us in the course we have pursued. Captain Bradford mentions in his note to you that the petitioners do not state to him that the works are menaced from any quarter, and further, that beyond that he has never heard of any. We grant all that. We know of no open attack that is meditated upon the arsenal. If we did, we, as citizens of Fayetteville and Forth Carolina, would know how to meet it. The raid at Harper’s Ferry, and all subsequent events in the South, teach us that all mischief comes (and is to be especially dreaded on that account) without menace. If any attempt is made on lives and property, it will not be made with light of day and with a warning beforehand, but at the dead hour of night, when all are unsuspecting. And when we look about to know what means the assassin has at hand to enable him to carry out his dreadful designs, we find them stored up in immense quantities at our very doors, in the shape of United States muskets. swords, pistols, &c., with, as we are informed, large quantities of powder, with one single man standing as guard. We think our request not an unreasonable one, when we place it purely on the assumption that you place it—where there are arms there should be a guard to protect them, without any reference whatever to any peculiar state of affairs. It is hardly necessary to say in the close that these views of things grow out of the events most especially that had taken place within a year all over the South, and that all these unfortunate untoward events have come at all times without a menace.	-
Entertaining these views, we respectfully request that you make application to the War Department for a company of soldiers as before suggested.

S. COOPER,
Adjutant-General.
Raleigh, N. C., January 10,1861.
Hon. Warren Winslow:
Call on General Scott; demand of him .to know if he intends to garrison the North Carolina forts. Reply immediately.
JOHN W. ELLIS.
Executive Department,
Raleigh, January 12, 1861.
His Excellency James Buchanan,
President of the United States:
Sir : Reliable information has reached this Department that on the 9th instant Forts Johnston and Caswell were taken possession of by State troops and persons resident in that vicinity, in an irregular manner. Upon the receipt of this information I immediately issued a military order requiring the forts to be restored to the authorities of the United States, which order will be executed this day.
My information satisfies me that this popular outbreak was caused by a report very generally credited, but which, for the sake of humanity, I hope is not true, that it was the purpose of the administration to coerce the Southern States, and that troops were on their way to garrison the Southern forts and to begin the work of our subjugation. This impression is not yet erased from the public mind, which is deeply agitated at the bare contemplation of so great an indignity and wrong, and I now

most earnestly appeal to your Excellency to strengthen my hands in my efforts to preserve the public order here by placing it in my power to give public assurances that no measures of force are contemplated towards us.
Your Excellency will therefore pardon me for asking whether the United States forts in this State will be garrisoned with Federal troops during your administration f This question I ask in perfect respect, and with an earnest desire to prevent consequences which I know would be regretted by your Excellency as much as myself. Should I receive assurances that no troops will be sent to this State prior to 4th March next, then all will be peace and quiet here, and the property of the United States will be fully protected as heretofore. If, however, I am unable to get such assurances, I will not undertake to answer for the consequences.
The forts in this State have long been unoccupied, and their being garrisoned at this time will unquestionably be looked upon as a hostile demonstration, and will, in my opinion, be certainly resisted.
Believing your Excellency to be sincerely desirous of preserving peace and preventing the effusion of the blood of your countrymen, I have deemed it my duty to yourself, as well as to the people of North Carolina, to make the foregoing inquiry, and to acquaint you with the state of the public mind here.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN W. ELLIS.
War Department, January 15,1861. To his Excellency John W. Ellis,
Governor of North Carolina, Baleigli:
Sir : Your letter of the 12th instant, addressed to the President of the United States, has by him been referred to this Department, and he instructs me to express his gratification at the promptitude with which you have ordered the expulsion of the lawless men who recently occupied Forts Johnston and Caswell. He regards this action on the part of your Excellency as in complete harmony with the honor and patriotic character of the people of North Carolina, whom you so worthily represent.
In reply to your inquiry whether it is the purpose of the President to garrison the forts of North Carolina during his administration, I am directed to say that they, in common with the other forts, arsenals, and public property of the United States, are in the charge of the President, and that if assailed, no matter from what quarter or under what pretext, it is his duty to protect them by all the means which the law has placed at his disposal. It is not his purpose to garrison the forts to which you refer at present, because he considers them entirely safe, as heretofore, under the shelter of that law-abiding sentiment for which the people of North Carolina have ever been distinguished. Should they, however, be attacked or menaced, with danger of being seized and taken from the possession of the United States, he could not escape from his constitutional obligations to defend and preserve them. The very satisfactory and patriotic assurances given by your Excellency justify him, however, in entertaining the confident expectation that no such contingency will arise.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. HOLT,
Secretary of War ad interim.

Colonel : It is my painful duty to announce to you the surrender of the arsenal and barracks at this place to the governor of this State.
The governor collected a large force in the city here yesterday, and about 5 p. m. sent me, by his aides-de-camp, Colonels Bragg and Taylor, a summons, a copy of which I herewith inclose.
Having no assurance of re-enforcements or support, I deemed it proper, after consulting with the officers here, to yield to the demand. I also inclose a copy of the paper signed this morning.

Sir: The safety of the State of Louisiana demands that I take possession of all Government property within her limits. You are, therefore, summoned hereby to deliver up the barracks, arsenal, and public property now under your command.
With the large force at my disposal this demand will be enforced. Any attempt at defense on your part will be a rash sacrifice of life.
The highest consideration will be extended to yourself and command.

## p. 494 (#510) ############################################

﻿494	THE SECESSION OF LOUISIANA.	[Chap. VI.
showed how deeply you were moved by the portents of the times—the threatened destruction of essential rights and most vital interests of the slaveholding States under the forms of a perverted Constitution—and by the absolute duty of seeking at once for the means of self protection. The vote of the people of this State has since confirmed the faith of their representatives in legislative and executive station that the undivided sentiment of the State is for immediate and effective resistance, and that there is not found within her limits any difference of sentiment, except as to minor points of expediency in regard to the manner and time of making such resistance, so as to give it the most imposing form for dignity and success. Our enemies who have driven on their conflict with the slaveholding States to this extremity will have found that throughout the borders of Louisiana we are one people—a people with one heart and one mind, who will not be cajoled into an abandonment of their rights, and who cannot be subdued.
Whatever lingering hopes might have been felt by confiding men of the South that these dissensions would be healed by the voluntary act of the people of the North within the Union, have disappeared under the accumulating proofs that the Northern majority is implacable. No proffer of peace, on any terms, has emanated from them. The propositions tendered by the most moderate-minded and Union-loving statesmen of the South—not as expressing the whole measure of rights to which the Southern people are entitled, but as a project for conciliation to which they might be brought to consent for the old love of Union which was the passion of Southern hearts—have been contumeliously rejected.
The common cry throughout the North is for coercion into submission by force of arms, if need be, of every State, and of all the States in the South, which claim the right of separation, for causes, from a Government which they deem fatal to' their safety. There can no longer be doubt of the wisdom of that policy which demands that the conflict shall come, and shall be settled now.
The sovereign people of this State have so decreed; and within a few hours their delegates will meet in convention to put this judgment into a form from which there will be no right and no disposition within the State to appeal. Being executed by a unanimous and willing people, it will be entitled to the respect of the world, and the acquiescence of all powers and authorities whatsoever.
But it has been made apparent by the course of events elsewhere, by the intentions of those having authority in the Federal Government, as developed in their treatment of other States which occupy the same relation towards these questions as Louisiana, that this right of independent action will be obstructed by force. The hostile occupation of Fort Sumter, in the harbor of Charleston, for the purpose of overawing the State of South Carolina, subduing her to the will of the Federal authorities, and collecting taxes from her people by force, is one glaring example of the modes by which a Southern State may be subjected to duress. The baffled attempts to re-enforce that fort are of the same character of aggressive purpose as the subsequent occupation of Fort Pickens, in the harbor of Pensacola, in order to keep the State of Florida in forced connection with a repudiated Government. At the same time that these acts of extraordinary rigor in aggression are practiced toward the South, the Northern populace of Pennsylvania are permitted to defeat the action of the Federal authorities at Pittsburgh, by forbidding the transmission of the public property to its designated points in the South, on the grounds of hostility to the South, to which dictation the intimidated authorities succumbed.

REPORTS, ETC.
495
Warned by these acts, and the uniform tenor of hostile language employed in Congress against free action in the South, and the uniform assertion of the doctrine of passive obedience in the manifestoes of the executives of Northern States, and the open menaces that the incoming administration would carry out the same tyrannical purposes with even more rigor, I determined that the State of Louisiana should not be left unprepared for the emergency. She has a long and exposed frontier, on which the Federal Government possesses forts qppable of being used for the subjugation of the country and to annul the declared will of the people. Near this capital, where the delegates of the sovereign people are about to assemble, was a military depot, capable, in unscrupulous hands, of being employed for the purpose of overawing and restraining the deliberations of a free people. On these grounds, respecting the manifest will of the people, and to the end that their deliberations shall be free, and their action supported by the full possession of the whole territory of the State, I decided to take possession of the military posts and munitions of war within the State, as soon as the necessity of such action should be developed to my mind. Upon information which did not leave me in doubt as to my public duty, and which convinced me, moreover, that prompt action was the more necessary in order to prevent a collision between the Federal troops and the people of the State, I authorized these steps to be taken, and they were accomplished without opposition or difficulty. In so doing I was careful to confine myself to such acts as were necessary to effect the object with the greatest certainty and the least risk of violence. In accordance with an arrangement entered into with the commanding officer, in the presence of a force too large to be resisted, Baton Bouge Barracks and Arsenal, with all the Federal property therein, were turned over to me on the 11th and 12th instant, and on the 13th the Federal troops departed. About the same time State troops occupied Fort Pike, on the Bigolets, and Forts Jackson and Saint Philip, on the Mississippi Biver, and such other dispositions were made as seemed necessary for the public safety. Beceipts were given in all instances for the property found, in order to protect the officers who were dispossessed; and to facilitate future settlement for the necessary expenses, I have drawn on the appropriation made by the last legislature for military purposes. A detailed report of these proceedings and of the expenditures incurred* will be laid before you in a few days.
With a full sense of the responsibility I have assumed, the whole subject is respectfully submitted to the legislature. Soon after taking possession of the arsenal at Baton Bouge I received an application from the governor of Mississippi for aid in arms and munitions of war, in support of the sovereignty of that State against an apprehended attack of a similar character to that against which Louisiana had protected herself. The interests of the two States are so intimately associated in the common cause of the South, that I deemed it my duty, not only from considerations of courtesy to a sister State, but in further execution of my duty to Louisiana regarding the approaches of Federal troops from above, to comply with his request, upon the assumption on the part of the State of Mississippi of the same terms of responsibility taken by me for the State of Louisiana. I accordingly directed to be forwarded to the order of Governor Pettus the following munitions of war: 5,000 flintlock muskets; 3,000 percussion muskets; 1,000 Halls rifles, flint locks; 200,000 cartridges, buck and ball; 1,000 pounds of rifle powder; 6 24-pounder guns and carriages; 500 24-pounder shot; 1,000 pounds cannon powder.

The supply of material of these descriptions remaining on hand is ample for the wants of the State. In this action I trust to meet with the approval of the legislature.
In all these movements for the defense and .protection of the State, I am proud to say that I have been supported with patriotic cheerfulness and alacrity by the volunteer soldiery of the State.

It is not within the province of the legislature or the executive to forestall the action of the State convention by advising any particular form for the assertion of the rights of the State in the reclaiming of her independence, or in executing her sovereign will, as announced by that tribunal. The future of our Louisiana rests in the counsels which shall be adopted by her freely chosen representatives ; and we have reason to trust that they will decide calmly, wisely, and well. But we may be permitted to invoke the merciful care of Divine Providence so to guide them in the path which leads to safety, to honor, and to prosperity, that they may be sustained by the hearts and hands of a confiding people in building up a separate nationality, or finding an honorable place in a new and more perfect union of equal confederated States.

Sm: I have the honor to report that I this morning received a telegram from the overseer at Fort Saint Philip, stating that that fort as well as Fort Jackson had been taken possession of by the State troops, and asking for instructions. My instructions to him were to stop operations at once, and to close all accounts with the Government, at the same time transmitting to you by telegraph a statement of the occurrence. The hands discharged will be up here in a day or two, and there is nothing to pay them with. What the actual amount due them is I cannot tell until I hear again from Mr. Dart, the overseer ; but $300 would cover it, and I respectfully suggest that if the convenience of the Treasury does not admit of the remittance of the remainder of the

appropriation for this work, nor of the amount allowed by the Department from the contingent fund for its use, yet it may be, perhaps, in a position to furnish without delay this smaller amount of $300 for the payment of the white hands, who are really in need of it. Hoping that my action in the matter may meet the approval of the Department,
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I have this day made a requisition on Bvt. Lieut. Col. A. C. Myers, A. Q. M., of which I inclose a copy, t also inclose a copy of his reply. In conversation with many persons in this city to-day, I am astonished to find a most marked and determined change of feeling towards the Government at Washington. Under all circumstances I consider that any purchase of subsistence in this market for and on account of the United States, would run great risk of seizure for the use and benefit of the troops now in arms in this State.

New Orleans, La., January 28,1861. Capt. C. L. Kilburn, G. 8., U. 8. Army, New Orleans:
Captain : I have your communication addressed to me as assistant quartermaster, U. S. A., New Orleans, La., inclosing me a copy of an order from the War Department, dated Washington, January 9,1861, directing you to resume your duties in New Orleans; also making requisition on me for an office, a warehouse for packing stores, and for your allowance of fuel and quarters as allowed by Army Regulations, or the commutation thereof. In reply, I have to inform you that I cannot comply with your requisitions. My duties as an officer of the U. S. Army cease this day by the act of the sovereign State of Louisiana in taking possession of all property under my control belonging to the United States of America.
I am your obedient servant,
A. C. MYERS, Lieutenant-Colonel, A. Q. M.
New Orleans, February 2,1861. General Jos. G. Totten, Chief Engineer) Washington) D. C.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of instructions of the 16th ultimo. This delay is due to the fact that at the time of its arrival, and for several days afterward, I was absent at the forts. The State has employed one former overseer and several hands, and in a day or so the river revetment and levee at Fort Saint Philip will be ready for the rise of the river. The materials, however, which we had collected at Fort Jackson for the construction of the lower battery are being wasted as fast as raw troops know how.
I have also to inform you that I have this morning had served upon me a paper signed by the governor of the State of Louisiana, demanding possession of all United States property under my charge, and offering receipts for the same, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. As I have no authority for entering into any such transaction with the State of Louisiana, nor the power to retain possession of this property in opposition to the will of the State, I have refused to accept such receipts, leaving to the State the responsibility of forcible seizure of such property.
The mint and custom-house were yesterday seized by the State. As I learned the day before that such was to be the case, and that thereafter money could be drawn from the former only under authority of the governor, I removed therefrom the unexpended balance of $543.57 of the appropriation for the harbor on Lake Pontchartrain, which has been lying there idle for years, and have applied it to the payment of the clerk and hired men employed upon the forts, to whom the Government was indebted, and whose wants were pressing in the extreme. Such an application I know to be unauthorized, but the emergency of the case will, I trust, be my justification. I acted upon the supposition that the Government would prefer having its money go into the hands of those who were justly entitled to it rather than into the State treasury.
I should like to hear the opinion of the Department in reference to this matter.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
WALTER MCFARLAND,
Brevet Second Lieutenant, Engineers.

Sir : Your communication of the 28th ultimo, inclosing copy of a demand made upon you for the surrender of the public property in your possession to the State of Louisiana, has been submitted to the Secretary of War, by whom I am directed to return the following reply:
The demand of the government of Louisiana for the surrender of the United States property in your charge was an act of spoliation to which you seem to have yielded in anything but a commendable spirit. The adjustment of your accountability to the Government for that property is a matter for consideration at the proper time.
Your resignation had been accepted by the President prior to the receipt of the letter herein referred to, and it is needless to say the action of the President had no reference to the circumstances alluded to by you in connection with it.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. COOPER, Adjutant-General,

This letter is returned to the Secretary of War because it shows a splenetic spirit and contains offensive language from a source personally irresponsible.

all other property under his control and in his possession, belonging to the United States/’ were seized, and are now held under your authority.
The title of the United States to the stores, &c., thus taken is not controverted, they having been purchased with its funds, much of which was received by citizens of Louisiana. Their presence within your State, however it might excite the cupidity of wicked men, was in every respect lawful and harmless, and could in no degree, I should suppose, compromise the public safety. Their seizure, under the circumstances, was an act of flagrant and atrocious spoliation, which I can scarcely believe had the sanction of a government professing to be organized for the maintenance of law and order, and to be regulated by those principles of justice and morality which are inseparable from the civilization of the age.
I invite your excellency’s attention to the matter as one which, you must perceive, much more deeply concerns the honor and fair fame of Louisiana than it does the pecuniary interests of the United States, and I await your reply in the confident expectation that you will disavow this discreditable act of your subordinate, and order a restoration of the property to the United States.*
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. HOLT,
Secretary of War.
New Orleans, February 9,1861.
General Jos. G. Totten,
Ghief Engineer, Washington, D. G.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 28, relieving me from duty at this post, and ordering me to Key West. In reference to so much of it as relates to transfer of property and funds to Major Beauregard, who has arrived, I have to state that there is nothing to transfer, all money having been paid out and all property seized upon by the State authorities. The monthly papers have already been forwarded, and the quarterly papers will be transmitted also as soon as ready. I shall leave by the first opportunity for my new destination.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

New Orleans, La., February 13,1861. To the Military Board of the State of Louisiana,
New Orleans, La.:
Gentlemen : As time presses, and it may soon become urgent to prepare for the worst, permit me to make a few suggestions, which may lead towards that desirable end. In the first place, we must look to our most vulnerable point, the Mississippi River; for one single steamer, with only two or three heavy guns, coming into the port of New Orleans, would in a few hours destroy millions’ worth of property or lay the city under a forced contribution of millions of dollars.
It is an undeniable fact that in the present condition of Forts Jackson

and Saint Philip any steamer can pass them in broad daylight, and that, - even when in a proper condition for defense, they could not prevent the passage of one or more steamers during a dark or stormy night, except with the assistance of a properly constructed raft, or a strong wire-rope, across the river, between the two forts, so as to arrest the course of said steamers, even for only half an hour, under the severe cross-fire of said works.
The first thing to be done is to commence the constructions of (or prepare at least the materials for) said obstacles. Then the guns of the land fronts of Fort Jackson ought to be mounted at once on the river fronts. The guns, chassis, and carriages at Baton Bouge, Forts Pike and Wood, Battery Bienvenue, &c., where they are not required at present, ought to be sent at once to these two forts on the river, to be put in position as advantageously as possible on their river fronts; not overlooking, however, their flank guns of the other fronts. All said chassis and carriages ought to be tried forthwith by double charges of powder and shot. Ample supplies of ammunition ought to be sent there forthwith. The trees along the river masking the fire of those two forts, up and down, ought to be cut down at once, particularly those on the Fort Jackson side. In a few words, no expenses ought to be spared to put those two works in a most efficient state of defense, for fifty thousand or a hundred thousand dollars spent thus might, a few weeks hence, save millions of dollars to the State and the city of New Orleans.
A rough calculation shows me that the raft spoken of would cost about forty thousand dollars, and three wire-cables probably sixty thousand dollars. I prefer the first. Mr. John Boy, my former assistant architect on the new custom-house, would be of great assistance in the construction of either of said obstacles.
In haste, I remain, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. T. BEAUBEGABD.
Executive Office,
Baton Rouge, La., February 16, 1861. His Excellency James Buchanan, President of the United States:
Sir : I inclose a letter received recently from the acting head of the War Department, Washington.* I infer that it was written without being submitted to your inspection, for throughout your long and distinguished service as a legislator, diplomatist, and executive you have been known to be a strict observer of the conventionalities of official intercourse. Without commenting on the tenor and spirit of the letter, I take pleasure in assuring you that I will promptly communicate to your Excellency any information you may desire concerning the action of the State of Louisiana in relation to any property lately belonging to the Federal Government, when such information is asked for in an appropriate manuer and in respectful terms. With the highest regard and esteem for your Excellency, I remain,

troops, numbering over 1,000 men, under Col. Ben McCulloch. On that morning I received a summons requiring me u to deliver up all military-posts and public property held by or under your [my] control.” It is herewith, marked No. 9. I immediately (with Major Nichols) proceeded to my office, and found the troops and public property surrounded by the Texans. After a conversation with the commissioners, in presence of all my staff and the officers of the post, it was agreed that the United States troops should march out of the city, taking with them their arms, clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and all the necessaries for a march out of Texas.
On the 17th instant I received another summons from the commissioners (copy herewith, marked No. 10), to which I replied under the same date, a copy of which is herewith, marked No. 11. The commissioners replied to this (copy herewith, No. 12), stating the conditions of the march out of Texas (see letter referred to in the proceedings of the commission), and demanding the surrender of the guns of the light batteries, a demand to which I could not accede. The commissioners were instructed to demand that the route of the troops should be by way of the coast. I objected to this strongly until I found that, unless I yielded that point, there would be immediate collision, and deeming it probable that by yielding this I could save the guns of the light batteries, I reluctantly did so. (See my letter of the 18th instant, marked No. 13, addressed to that body.) The commissioners, in reply (copy herewith, No. 14), accepted my conditions. I have to remark that whilst the commissioners were in session the State troops were in rapid march upon the city of San Antonio. General Orders, No. 5, herewith (No. 15), will inform you of the disposition of the troops. A copy of the circular of the commissioners is also herewith, No. 16.*

The letter from the commissioners of the people of Texas, dated the 11th instant, was deliberated on, and the following reply agreed upon, viz:
Sak Antonio, February 12, 1861.
Gentlemen: We, the military commission appointed by Major-General Twiggs, have had the honor to receive your communication of the 11th instant while in convention, demanding of ns “in the name and by the authority of the sovereign People of Texas, in Convention assembled,” a delivery of “all arms of every description, military stores, including quartermaster’s, commissary, and medical stores, and public moneys, and everything else under the control of the general in command belonging to the Federal Government,” adding that, “ if an affirmative answer is not given to this demand,” you submit the following questions for our consideration and reply, viz:
“ Do you consent and agree to the following stipulations:
“1. That everything under the control of the general commanding in the Department of Texas shall remain in statu quo until the 2d day of March next ?
“2. That no movement, change of position, or concentration of the troops shall take place ?
“3. That none of the arms, ordnance, military stores, or other property shall be disposed of before that time, ordinary consumption excepted ?
“4. That upon the 2d day of March the public property in Texas shall, without delay, be delivered up to 4-he undersigned, or such other commissioners who may be authorized to act on behalf of the convention ? ”
To the first of the foregoing interrogatories we have the honor to state that we are willing that everything shall remain in statu quo until the 2d day of March next, provided that the general commanding the department shall not receive orders from higher authority than himself to remove the troops from Texas, or find it necessary to resist the inroads of marauding parties of Indians—the enemies of Texas and of our commoni country—or attack upon the troops or military posts in Texas by irresponsible parties coming from any quarter whatsoever.
With regard to your second proposition, it is hereby agreed that no movement or change of position of the troops shall take place unless the commanding general shall find it necessary to act under the contingencies mentioned in the next preceding answer.
To the third question we reply, that as it is not the intention of the commanding general to dispose of, or to place out of reach of the authorities of Texas, any of the property otherwise than to meet with it the common wants of the military service, so do we agree to your proposition.
And to your last inquiry we have to remark that a compliance with the demands of Texas, whether made through you or other commissioners appointed for the purpose, will be yielded under the following conditions, viz: That the moneys in the hands of disbursing officers being out of the control of the commanding general, and considered as peculiarly a matter of individual accountability to the Treasury of the United States by those officers, involving the responsibility of their bondsmen, and being necessary for the payment of the troops and debts already contracted in Texas, they will not be relinquished on the demand of Texas. That the troops now in the Department of Texas shall retain their legitimate arms in possession, and march out of Texas with them, the requisite ammunition, clothing, and camp and garrison equipage, quartermaster’s stores, subsistence, medical and hospital stores, and such means of transportation of every kind as may be necessary for an efficient and orderly movement of the troops from Texas, prepared for attack or defense against any aggression from any source. That the officers of the general staff at department headquarters, their families and movable property, shall be transported in their egress from Texas by the public means now at this depot, which means shall be retained for that purpose; and when such service shall have been performed, the said means shall be surrendered to the regularly-authorized persons to receive them. That ail property delivered up to the authorities of Texas under the foregoing stipulations shall be receipted for by agents appointed by said authorities.
We are, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servants,

The commission met pursuant to adjournment.
Present: Maj. D. H. Yinton, quartermaster; Maj. S. Maclin, paymaster ; Capt. R. H. K. Whiteley, Ordnance Department, on the part of the United States.

Gentlemen : The undersigned, commissioners on behalf of the Convention of the People of the State of Texas, acting through the committee of public safety, have had the honor to receive your communication of the 12th instant, while in conference, and have the honor to reply to the answers contained in your note, as follows:
We are unable to accept as satisfactory your answer to that question in our note of the 11th instant, relating to the movements or position of the troops in Texas, as your reply, by a reasonable construction of its language, if not in express terms, asserts the right and intention of the general in command of the Department of Texas to make any movement by the tropps that may be ordered by an authority higher than himself. The question is, consequently, left unanswered so far as it relates to the object which the undersigned had in view in presenting this question for consideration, which object was fully set forth in the conference of the 11th instant.
(Note.—In explanation of the words “ which object was fully set forth in the conference of the llth instant,” on second }j>age, the undersigned refer to the conversation

had at that time with reference to the movements of the troops toward the Kansas and New Mexico frontier, and the Indian country east of Red River.)
If the question he considered as answered by your reply to it, then the undersigned are constrained to consider it as a substantial denial of their demand on that subject.
The non-acceptance of the terms contained in your second answer rests upon the same reasons as those set forth in reply to your first; answer.
The third answer is as the undersigned had reason to believe it would be, and is accepted.
The terms embraced in your reply to our last inquiry are acceptable, with the following conditions, viz: 1st. That all moneys in Texas, for the payment of the troops, or the liquidation of debts of every description incurred on behalf of the Federal Government shall be considered applicable to those purposes, and be turned over to the commissioners for their disposal accordingly, and guarantees will be given by the undersigned for the prompt payment of the same; and all funds in Texas held for the Federal Government, not included in the above exceptions, shall be given up and receipts by the undersigned accordingly given. That portion of the last answer is accepted which claims the retention by the troops in Texas of their arms and clothing, camp and garrison equipage, quartermaster’s stores, subsistence, medical and hospital stores, and such means of transportation of every kind as may be necessary for an efficient and orderly movement of the troops from Texas, prepared for attack or defense against aggression from any source; provided, the troops shall march to the coast, and in detachments of not more than 200, each detachment to be at least three (3) days’ march apart, and upon arriving at the point or points of embarkation, the teams or "means of transportation, with the artillery (if any be taken by the troops), shall be delivered up to the agents authorized to receive and receipt for the same. The remaining portion of the last answer, relating to the means of transportation, &c., for the officers, their families, servants, and property, is accepted according to its terms.

The reply of the commissioners of the people of Texas to our communication of the 12th instant was deliberated on, and the following answer returned, yiz:
San Antonio, February 15,1861.
Gentlemen : In acknowledgment of your communication of the 14th instant, wherein you disagree as to certain points in our letter of the 12th instant, the undersigned have the honor to say that the conditions you prescribe for the movement of the Federal troops from Texas will necessarily check, for a short time at least, further conferences with you on that subject, inasmuch as it is one over which we have no control. The commander of the department, whoever he may be, whether -acting under his own judgment or by the advice or instructions of his superiors, has exclusive authority in such cases; and to him must we refer the present one, with a report of all our proceedings for his approval or disapproval; and in view of an immediate change of commanders of the Department of Texas, General Twiggs having been superseded by Colonel Waite, all the proceedings of the military commission appointed by the former officer must be submitted for the consideration and sanction of the latter, whose duty it will be to execute whatever measures that may be recommended and adopted under the action of that committee.
The undersigned would respectfully remark that they cannot but regret that the reasons given in objection to the relinquishment of the funds in the hands of Federal disbursing officers have not met with acquiescence on the part of your commission. They can only hope that, upon reconsideration, your views may undergo a change. Under any circumstances, we trust that the commissioners appointed by the Texas committee of safety will exercise their influence to avert violence, either on the part of any irregular forces or organized military parties of whatsoever size. Believing that everything may be done in a manner honorable to the present contending parties and for

As to the condition of surrendering the guns of the light batteries, that, you must see, would be an act which would cast a lasting disgrace upon the arms of the United States, and under no circumstances can I believe that the State of Texas would demand such a sacrifice at my hands, and more particularly so, after I have yielded so much to meet what I deemed to be due to the State, and to avoid any unnecessary collision between the Federal and State troops.

*	San Antonio, Tex., February 17, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report the political changes which will or have already closed our military functions in this department.
In the night, or a little before day, of the 16th, some 1,200 or 1,500 Texan troops, commanded by Maj. Ben. McCulloch, acting under the orders of commissioners appointed by the Convention which had passed the ordinance for the secession of Texas, quietly took possession of the arsenal and arms, quartermaster and commissary property at this depot, and demanded its unconditional surrender by General Twiggs. After a stormy conference between the department commander and the commissioners, who had been here with their demands since the 8th instant, the general has acceded to their demands, and the two companies of United States troops marched out of the town in the afternoon and went into camp until arrangements could be made to transport them to the coast.
No orders have as yet issued from the headquarters, nor is it known what disposition will be made of the remaining troops. The medical and hospital property is yet under my charge, nor has the hospital been disturbed. So soon as orders issue they will be duly communicated.

No. 4.
Report of Lieut. Gol. Wm. Hoffman, Eighth TJ. S. Infantry, of the seizure of TJ. S. property at San Antonio, Tex.
Headquarters San Antonio Barracks,
Texas, March 1, 1861.
Sir : Pursuant to the orders of the commander of the department, I have the honor to submit the following report of the taking possession of the public property in San Antonio on the morning of the 16th ultimo:
That the matter may be clearly understood, I will premise by stating that when I assumed command of this post (on the 11th) negotiations were in progress to fix the terms on which the public property would be turned over to the State authorities. Soon after the receipt of the order relieving General Twiggs, and placing Colonel Waite in command of the department, it was reported that a body of State troops were being collected to come into the town to take possession of the property by force. To meet such a state of things I inquired of the general commanding under what circumstances I should use ball cartridges. He replied, under no circumstances, and added that he would not be the first to shed blood, or to that effect. I gave orders accordingly, and directed that the arms should not be loaded; but on reflection I deemed

it best to have them loaded, and told the general 1 would understand his order to give me this latitude, the men being ordered not to fire except to resist an attempt to disarm them.
On the evening of the 15th, having what seemed to be reliable information that the troops of Texas, acting under the authority of the State commissioners, would during the night enter the town and take possession of the storehouses, I ordered that the guard at the quartermaster’s store should make no resistance to any organized force, but should report its presence to the quartermaster. I directed further that on the approach of troops, or the occurrence of any unusual excitement in the town, it should be reported to me, and that company officers and the companies should be warned to be ready for any emergency. I would have preferred to have left the depot in charge of the quartermaster’s watchman, as with these orders the guard would only be acting in that capacity; but the general thought it advisable to have the guard as security against individual depredations.
Soon after 4 o’clock of the morning of the 16th I was notified that there was some excitement in town, and on repairing to my office, adjoining the quarters of Company I, First Infantry, I heard the corporal of the guard report to the officer of the day that in consequence of a demand by a large force that he should surrender he had withdrawn his guard from the depot.
In a very short time the building used as an arsenal was taken possession of, and companies of armed men occupied the streets near where our companies were quartered, and in front of the commissary building. A thousand to twelve hundred men are reliably said to have been iu the town at the time. Things remained in this state, without any noise or disturbance of any kind, till some time after daylight, when, supposing the Texas commissioners were conferring with the general, to whom I had reported these occurrences, I returned to my quarters for a short time. In a few minutes a note addressed to the commander of the Department of Texas, from the Texan commissioners, was brought to me through a misunderstanding, which I delivered to Major Nichols, assistant adjutant-general, and I notified the commissioners that the general would be in his office after breakfast.
I had ordered that our men should not leave their quarters, but should be prepared to resist any attempt to take their arms; and between 9 and 10 o’clock, wishing to relieve them from this constraint, and to avoid any chance of accidental collision, I proposed to move the command into camp at a convenient distance from town. The commissioners objected to this arrangement, unless I would assure them that I would not move from the camp except to leave Texas by the coast. I told them I could give no such assurance without the consent of the general commanding, as I might be otherwise ordered. After some discussion of the feasibility of the plan of the troops going out by Indianola and up the Mississippi, with the approbation of General Twiggs, who was present, I gave the assurance asked for, and immediately issued the necessary orders for the companies to go into camp. The headquarters of the post and Eighth Infantry and band of the Eighth remain in town.
As required by the colonel commanding the department the reports of Major Smith and Captain King are submitted herewith. [Nos. 5 and 6-].
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Bvt. Maj. Larlcin Smith, Eighth TJ. S. Infantry, of the seizure of U. S. property at San Antonio, Tex.
Camp San Pedro, Tex., February 23,1861.
Colonel : In compliance with instructions that I should report such information as I possess on the subject of the events which transpired in San Antonio on the 16th instant, I have the honor to state as follows :
Por several days previous to the 16th there were many rumors of the formation of forces to take possession of the public property at the depots. They were not generally credited until the 14th, when more reliable information was received that a strong force of citizens was collecting from the counties to the east and northeast. This was confirmed on the 15th, and it was generally understood that several hundred men would enter the city the next morning. The orders given to the guard were, that they should not resist a large organized force, but to jjreserve the public property from depredation by individuals or any mob, as usual. The troops, consisting of Company I of the First, and A of the Eighth Infantry, were to form at quarters and await further orders in case of the approach of any considerable force.
At fifteen minutes of 4 o’clock on the morning of the 16th, I received a message from the officer of the day that a large armed force was entering the city. 'Repairing to my company quarters, a low, one-story building, marked B on the accompanying plot,* situated in the yard used as a depot for ordnance, the men were formed, and ordered to remain at their quarters. I then proceeded to the Army offices in the building marked A, where officers were awaiting developments rather than orders, it being understood that no resistance would be made. A few minutes after, some eighty armed citizens took position across the street at the point C, and another party in the lot at H. Returning towards my company quarters, I found a strong party on the street leading to the plaza, some of them ascending the stairs to the second story of the ordnance building, D. Approaching them, I was accosted by two persons, who seemed surprised at being observed. One of them was announced as Colonel McCulloch. I informed him that the house on the corner was occupied'by soldiers. He said he could not help that. I asked, u Perhaps you will tell me what you intend to do,” to which he replied that his force was in commanding positions, and would take possession of all the public property, after which, if anything was wanted, it would have to be asked of the commissioners, and that the persons of my men were secure, and would not be molested. During this conversation, he gave me to understand that the force on the east side of the river served to prevent my company and that of the First Infantry at F from uniting. In the mean time his people were mounting to the roof of the ordnance building, of the house adjoining-on the south, and of the Masonic Hall at G. About one hour after this conversation, having heard that it was intended to demand the arms in the hands of our men, I sought Colonel McCulloch, and asked him if I had understood him rightly that the persons of the soldiers would not be molested. He answered, uYes.” I stated that they would consider their j>ersons very much molested if their arms were interfered with. He replied, u That is a question for the commissioners
Omitted.

to determine.” I added that such an attempt would be followed by serious consequences, which would be painful to all concerned, and suggested that he would confer with his commissioners on that subject if he had not been instructed upon it. He signified his intention to obey their instructions, whatever they might be, at any cost, and added: “ Some of you had better arrange this matter quickly, or my men will do it for you,” thus intimating that they might not be controlled.
Near 7 o’clock Colonel McCulloch came to me with a letter, addressed to the commander of the Department of Texas. I informed him that I was not the officer, and referred him to you as commanding the post. These matters were all reported to you.
At 10 o’clock I particularly reported the situation of my company, in contracted quarters, and so completely surrounded and commanded by the citizens’ force that no man could move without having several hundred guns pointed at him, at the option of that force, and that they had been in this situation nearly six hours. You notified the department commander of this. It seemed to be of consequence, in yielding to the Texas commissioners, that these two companies should leave the State “by the way of the coast.” On this point you are better informed than I am; my knowledge of it is incomplete. I understood, however, that our troops would not be permitted to leave their quarters if this demand was not acceded to, and that it was the one measure to restore quiet.
About 11 o’clock the order was given to prepare to go into camp, and at 3 p. m. the two companies marched out of the city, and formed their camp at this place.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Capt. John U. King, Eighth U. S. Infantry, of the seizure of TJ. S. property at San Antonio, Tex.
Camp San Pedro, Tex., March 1,1861.
Sir : By your order I report to you that I was on duty as officer of the day at San Antonio Barracks on the 15th ultimo. At night the guard at the Alamo had orders not to load their muskets, and not to resist in case an armed force attempted to seize the public property. Some time before daybreak the corporal at the Alamo reported to me that the citizen troops we had been expecting for a day or two had arrived in the city. Our soldiers were notified of it, and the sentinels withdrawn from their posts.

Reports of Col. C. A. Waite, First U. 8. Infantry, of eventsfrom February
19 to April 23, 1861.
Headquarters Department of Texas,
8an Antonio, February 26, 1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to report that in compliance with Special Orders No. 22, Adjutant-Generafs Office, Washington, January 28,1861, I assumed command of the Department of Texas on the 19th instant.
I send herewith, by Bvt. Lieut. Col. D. T. Chandler, XL S. Army, a communication, dated the 19th instant, of Brevet Major-General Twiggs, giving a full account of the forcible entry into and occupation of this city by the troops of this State, on the 16th instant, together with the proceedings of the military commission therein referred to, and the pa pers connected with it.#
On my arrival in San Antonio, I found the city filled with armed men. The public property, including the funds in the hands of Captain Key nolds, assistant quartermaster—some ten thousand dollars—had been seized by an armed force under Col. Ben. McCulloch, who was acting under the authority of the commissioners on behalf of the Convention of the People of Texas, and that General Twiggs had already entered into an agreement with said commissioners, in which he stipulated that all the posts should be evacuated, the jmblic property surrendered to the State authorities, and that the troops should leave Texas by way of the coast. An order for the evacuation of the posts was immediately issued by General Twiggs. The moment the secession movement commenced, the people of Texas became much excited on that subject, and immediately after the passage of the secession ordinance, several large bodies of Texans were collected and threatened an attack upon some of our posts. Their main object appeared to be the public property. No one at a distance can form a correct idea of the state of public feeling. There is a strong feeling against the General Government, and the Army, being the representative of its power, shares that dislike.
The troops in this department are stationed at different camps or posts in small garrisons, and spread over a very large extent of country. To concentrate a sufficient number to make a successful resistance, after the Texans had taken the field, was not practicable. Besides, we had no large depot of provisions to move upon, and the means of transportation at the posts were so limited that the troops could have taken with them a supply for only a few days. An attempt to bring them together under these circumstances would have, no doubt, resulted in their being cut up in detail before they could get out of the country. Under these circumstances, I felt it my duty to comply with the agreement entered into by General Twiggs, and remove the troops from the country as early as possible. With this view, arrangements are being made to bring the troops to the coast in time to meet the transports, if possible. Under this date I have made the necessary requistion for transports, and have indicated the points of embarkation and the number of the troops. The commissioners of this State will communicate with the government of Louisiana, and will endeavor to get such authority as will permit the troops, if necessary, to go up the Mississippi Biver. If such authority is granted, Colonel Chandler will be advised of it, and will give you the necessary information.

In connection with the matter of this communication, I inclose a copy of a letter I addressed to these headquarters, under date of 12th instant, whilst in command of Camp Yerde, which contains the expression of my views previous to entering upon the duties of my present position. I will add that armed bodies of men are moving upon some of the posts within this command, Camp Cooper being one of them, as you will perceive by the copy of Captain Carpenter’s letter of the 14th instant, inclosed herewith. Other posts are also threatened.

Headquarters Camp Yerde,
February 12,1861.
Major : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a circular from the headquarters of the department, dated the 4th instant, conveying the information that “the secession act has passed the Convention of this State, to take effect on the 2d day of March next.”
By this act Texas has dissolved her connection with the other States, withdrawn her allegiance to the General Government, and declared herself an independent sovereignty, so far as it is in her power to do §o. By placing herself outside the Union she has forfeited all claim for further protection by the United States troops, and unless the General Government intends to coerce the State into submission, which I cannot think possible, there does not occur to me any reason for keeping the troops in this department.
Being desirous of concentrating my regiment (the First Infantry) so as to bring the companies more under my control, I respectfully request permission to move out of the department with the five companies now serving here, and join the remainder of the regiment, which is in the Department of the West.
Many strong reasons present themselves to my mind in favor of as early a movement as practicable. It is well known that much hostile feeling exists towards the General Government, and the Army, being the representative of its power, is viewed by a certain class with much dislike. It would require but slight cause to produce a collision, the ultimate results of which no man can calculate.
There is another and, in my opinion, a stronger reason which may be urged for an early movement of the troops. I have it from a source I think reliable that the State authorities intend to require the surrender of the arms in the hands of the men before they leave the State. A demand of the kind would, of course, be resisted by the troops, and if force were used, it would lead to the most disastrous consequences. In the present highly-excited state of a large portion of the inhabitants of Texas, the first blood shed would, I fear, be the prelude to a general attack on the Army. A kind of guerrilla war would follow. The scattered condition of the troops, in small garrisons, at a considerable distance from each other, and dependent for supplies on remote depots, would render concert of action exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, and be very favorable for partisan operations against them.
If the commanding general should deem it proper to authorize the

Sir : I have just received information from a source which cannot be doubted that a force is concentrating about this post for the purpose of attacking us, and of taking possession of the public property here. This force is concentrating about the camp—coming in by small parties. An express passed thirty near here yesterday, and the herdsman saw several about the herd yesterday. I shall use what force and vigilance we can to protect ourselves and property.

Colonel: I have the honor to inclose herewith a statement of the number of troops serving in the Department of Texas, and have to request that transportation may be furnished for them from Indianola and Brazos Santiago to such points as the Lieutenant-General commanding the Army shall direct. My arrangements are that the Third Infantry and two companies of the Second Cavalry shall embark at the Brazos, and that the remaining eight companies of the Second Cavalry, the five companies of the First Infantry, and the nine companies of the Eighth Infantry shall proceed to Indianola, and take shipping at that place. I have estimated for the full allowance of officers’ servants and laundresses, not knowing the exact number there are. I have no doubt there will be the lull number of laundresses. Each transport should be supplied with a sufficient quantity of provisions, water, and fuel for the voyage, as it will not be safe to depend upon the resources of Texas for any of the articles required. It is very important that I should know as early as possible the time the transports will be on the coast, their tonnage, extent of supplies, and the number of troops that each one will be directed to receive on board, in order that I may have the troops at the points of embarkation, and may be enabled to apportion them understandingly. The difficulty of subsisting them, after a movement is commenced, owing to the limited means of transportation, renders it necessary to retain the companies at their posts as long as possible.

Colonel: Your letter of the 15th February, containing directions for the movement of the troops out of this Department in case Texas should secede, was handed to me by Lieutenant Putnam on the 1st instant. The several communications forwarded by Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Chandler, Third Infantry, which I trust will reach you by the 8th instant, will inform you of the condition of affairs in this department up to the 25th ultimo. Previous to that date the commissioners of the State demanded of me certain statements in relation to the funds in the hands of disbursing officers, the known object of which was to enable them to seize all moneys belonging to the United States for the benefit of Texas. (See paper B.) To this demand I refused compliance. (Paper marked C.) On the morning of the 25th ultimo an armed force, acting under the commissioners of the State, took forcible possession of the offices occupied by Major Vinton, quartermaster; Major McClure, paymaster; Captain Whiteley, Ordnance officer; Captain Blair, commissary of subsistence, and Lieutenant Williams, depot commissary; ejected these officers and

their clerks from their offices, and placed a sentinel at the doors. (See papers marked C1, C2, O3, C4, C5.) About the time of their taking possession of the offices they notified me that the means of transportation would be withheld, and consequently the movement of the troops prevented, until these demands were complied with. After a delay of some days an arrangement was made with the commissioners, whereby the restrictions imposed on the Quartermaster’s and Commissary Departments were removed, and the means of transportation again placed at my disposal. Major Yinton and Captain Blair are now in the discharge of their proper duties. The conditions of the agreement whereby they were permitted to again take charge of their offices will be found in papers marked D*, D2.
Previous to making this agreement it was ascertained that after expending all of the available funds on hand there would be outstanding debts to the amount of some eight thousand dollars against the Commissary Department and nearly double that sum against the Quartermaster’s Department. The offices of Major McClure and Captain Whiteley are still held by a guard, and I understand that the commissioners have referred their cases to the Convention, now in session at Austin, for further instructions.

Believing that a proper construction of the agreement referred to will not authorize the retention of the funds lately in the possession of Captain Reynolds, and seized prior to the agreement between the commissioners and General Twiggs, I have to require that they may be returned to him immediately.

P. K Luckett,
S. A. Maverick,
Commissioners on behalf of Committee of Public Safety.

San Antonio, February 22,1861.
Sir: We are in receipt of your communication of the 21st instant, in which you state that “the funds placed in the hands of Captain Reynolds, assistant quartermaster, and pertaining to his department, have been seized by an armed body of Texans, and are no longer in his possession.” You likewise state that the commissioners “ formally and solemnly agreed with Bvt. Maj. Gen. David E. Twiggs, commanding the Department of Texas,” that “the necessary means for regular and comfortable movement, provisions, tents, &e., and transportation,” shall be allowed the troops, and that “the public property at the various posts, other than that above recited,” shall be turned over to agents, &c. You further state: “ The words ‘public property7 do not include money, and certainly not money in the hands of disbursing officers,” &c. You likewise state that “a proper construction of the agreement referred to will not authorize the retention of the funds lately in the possession of Captain Reynolds, and seized prior to the agreement between the commissioners and General Twiggs,” and “ I (you) have to require that they may be returned to him immediately.”
In reply to that portion of your communication referring to our agree* ment with General Twiggs, for the comfortable movement of the troops, &c., we have to remark that our actions with reference to the movement of the troops will attest our willingness to perform our part of the agreement, and we are now, as we have been heretofore, ready and willing to carry it out according to the letter and the spirit of the engagement.
With reference to that portion of your communication relating to the words “public property, not including money,” &c., we have to say that if the word “money” was not used in our last communication to General Twiggs, it was simply owing to the fact that our communication of a previous date, as well as our original demand on General Twiggs, contained that word and its equivalents. That communication in which we agreed to the terms of the note of the 18th instant, in which General Twiggs claimed the retention of two batteries of Light Artillery, refers to our previous communications, in which we claimed all public property, and the reason is apparent. We claim no interest in or desire to meddle with private property; but we do now, as we have heretofore done, claim as public property all money belonging to or held for the benefit of the Federal Government.
Again, if it were necessary to show that nothing was withdrawn by the undersigned from their original and repeated demands, or understood to have been withdrawn on our part by General Twiggs, it will be found in the demands made by that officer and several others for trans-

portation, &c., and freely famished by the undersigned, although no reference is made in express terms to this obligation in any of the notes between General Twiggs and the undersigned, and the reference is only found in our communication of the 14th instant to the military commission. We might still further add that the military commission, as well as General Twiggs, repeatedly disclaimed any rignt on the part of the officer in command to control disbursing officers in their disposition of the'public funds. If, then, General Twiggs has acted upon portions of our answer of the 14th instant, although such portions were not set out in our reply of the 18th, it shows that he understood that the referring to that communication was a substantial embodiment of its terms in the communication in which we referred to it. A consideration of these facts will show the necessity for a complete understanding of all matters connected with or operating in any manner upon the question of our right to obtain possession of or control the funds of the Federal Government in Texas, such funds being subject, however, to the payment of all legitimate claims due either to soldiers or citizens. For this purpose the undersigned submit the following questions, to be answered by the various disbursing officers or heads of departments, and certified to, respectively, by them u on honor”:
Question 1. Please state what amount of funds, in specie, coin, drafts, or otherwise, were in your custody or under your control for purposes connected with your department in the performance of your official duties on the 8th day of February, 1861.
Question 2. Please state what portion of that amount has been disbursed or changed from its original condition between that day and the time of answering this question, and how and where was this disbursement or change made.
Question 3. Please state what amount of indebtedness exists against your department at the time of answering this question, and the persons claiming the same, as nearly as it is in your power to do.
Question 4. Please state what amount in specie or com has come into your possession since the 8th of February, 1861, and what amount has been placed to your credit or at your disposal for purposes connected with your department in other cities of the Union since the 8th of February, 1861.
Question 5. Please state the amount of funds connected with your department on hand in specie, coin, drafts, or other evidences of money or credits, and please state the amounts of the respective credits in this city, and with whom, as likewise in other cities of the Union.
It is hoped that the preceding five questions will be submitted to the various disbursing officers residing in this city, and an answer is required within the next eighteen hours.
The commissioners do not desire—on the contrary,' it is their determination that nothing shall be done by or through their agency that is likely to cause—unpleasant consequences. Our instructions and a sense of duty, however, alike demand that all measures proper and necessary for securing the public funds for the benefit of the State of Texas shall be attempted, and, if possible, carried to a successful termination.
We remain, very respectfully, your obedient servants,

In regard to the five questions proposed in your communication, and your request that the u various disbursing officers or heads of departments be required to furnish you with answers, ‘ certified to’ by them i on honor,”’ I have to state that I have no power to compel a compliance with your wishes. An order of that kind would be illegal, and they would not be bound to obey it. As regards myself, if I were to issue an order that would endanger the public funds, or cause a disposition of them not sanctioned by law, I should place my commission in jeopardy and render myself liable for the amounts involved.
In relation to the payment of the claims against the United States, I would remark that the disbursing officers by whom the debts were contracted are the proper persons to pay them, as they alone can know the amounts actually due.
I will here repeat, what I have more fully stated in a former communication, that I cannot recognize the right of Texas to claim any portion of the funds in the hands of the disbursing officers. In this view of the case I am confirmed by the most positive assurance of General Twiggs that he had not at any time or in any way consented to the transfer of the public funds to the State of Texas.
I am, gentlemen, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. A. WAITE,
Colonel, Commanding Department.

Major: On the 26th ultimo I had the honor to report, verbally, to the colonel commanding the department that I, with my clerks and messenger, had been summarily ejected, by order of the Texas commissioners, from the room occupied by me as the office of the chief quartermaster of the Department of Texas) that a sentinel from the Texas troops was placed over the room, and that all access thereto by myself and employes was thereby cut off and prohibited. I have now further to report that the commissioner who executed the order of ejectment gave no reason for his conduct; that when asked if I could have access to my papers, gave no satisfactory answer, and when the keys of my iron safe, containing a small amount of public funds, were offered to him, he declined to receive them. I have since applied to the commissioner to remove the restrictions thus imposed without success—no reply being vouchsafed. What good results they may have expected from the course they have thought proper to pursue is more than I can conjecture, but I have to complain that it has been productive of great inconvenience to the service in which I have the honor to serve. It has debarred me

from a free exercise of my functions as chief quartermaster, and has been the means of shutting up papers essential to the settlement of the accounts of officers at several of the posts requiring my action. It seems to be an arbitrary exercise of power, conceived in a spirit of retaliation for some act, of which the commander of the department may, perhaps, be more conversant than I am, or else to coerce me into acts as repugnant to my feelings of honor as they are contrary to my duty toward my Government and a proper integrity to my bondsmen—of which the commander of the department may have some conception.
I respectfully ask the mediation of the colonel commanding the department with the commissioners for the removal of the obstructions to the performance of my duties above pointed out.

About 10 o’clock a. m. an armed body of men were marched to the door of my office, where they were posted by the person in command, and instructed in an undertone. I continued discharging my duties afterward for probably thirty minutes, when one of the commissioners, Mr. P. N.

I closed the door of my safe and office, and have since been prohibited from entering the latter by the sentinel stationed there.

Bvt. Lieut. Col. D. T. Chandler, U. S. Army, will proceed to the headquarters of the Army and deliver the dispatches with which he is charged. He will travel with all possible haste, as it is important that the information contained in the communications intrusted to his charge should reach Washington as early as possible.
On arriving in Louisiana, Colonel Chandler will communicate with the governor of that State, and ascertain if a safe transit for the troops evacuating Texas will be afforded through the State of Louisiana, with permission to purchase the necessary supplies and secure the required means of transportation. For this purpose he will deliver a communication addressed to the governor of that State by the commissioners on behalf of the committee of public safety of the State of Texas. After having complied with these instructions, Colonel Chandler will return to San Antonio.
By order of Col. C. A. Waite:
W. A. NICHOLS, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Headquarters Department of Texas,
San Antonio, March 6, 1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to* acknowledge the receipt of your communications forwarded by Major Porter, assistant adjutant general, which were delivered to me on the 4th instant by Lieutenant Major, Second Cavalry. Major Porter was to leave Indianola on the 2d instant for Brazos Santiago.
The difficulty of placing provisions at Brazos Santiago for the use of the troops whilst awaiting the arrival of the transports, the collection of a large Texan force at Brownsville or in its vicinity, which would render a depot at that place insecure, and the small number of United States troops on the Rio Grande below Fort McIntosh, have induced me to change my arrangements so far as to have all the troops embark at Indianola. Should it, however, be deemed expedient hereafter to have a part of the troops embark at the Brazos, the transports can easily be ordered from Indianola to that point. I have, therefore, to request that all of the vessels sent out to take the troops may be directed to proceed to Indianola.
Two companies of the Third Infantry (Johns’ and Clitz’s) were ordered to Fort Brown from Ringgold Barracks to relieve the artillery, and as it is probable that they reached that post before the arrival at Brazos of the steamer Daniel Webster, I presume they embarked with the artillery. Major Porter wrote me that he would u make every effort to take with me [him] the garrison of Ringgold Barracks.”

As difficulties are daily occurring to retard our operations, and frequently to delay the march of the troops, I cannot feel that certainty of having them at the points selected for concentration at any given time that I should do if entirely independent of the commissioners, and free to act agreeably to my own judgment.

Colonel : The want of co-operation on the part of the commissioners, who have the entire control of the means of transportation; the great distance from this place to El Paso; the uncertainty in relation to the condition of tilings at the several posts on the .Upper Rio Grande, especially in regard to their facilities for the transportation of baggage, supplies, &c.$ and the difficulties which attend the march of troops and the movement of trains at this season of the year over a large portion of the route, have caused so many delays that I was not able until yesterday to entirely complete the arrangements necessary to bring the troops down from those distant posts.
The three companies at El Paso will probably leave that post about the 25th of this month, and, with the four companies now at Fort Quit-man, Fort Davis, and Fort Stockton, may be expected to be at the coast and ready to embark in about forty days from that date. The last returns show the strength of the several companies to be fourteen officers and about four hundred and twenty-six enlisted men, laundresses, &c. As it is not possible for the companies above mentioned to embark before the first week in May, transports for that number of troops will not be required until that time.
To a certain extent, the same uncertainty as to the time the troops can be assembled and ready for embarkation, which prevented my stating in any of my former communications the exact time the transports would-be wanted, still hangs over our future movements. This arises

from the confused condition of affairs in this department, the interference of the commissioners, and my. having but a limited control over the means necessary to move the troops.
I am now concentrating the troops at a camp established at Green Lake, some twenty miles from Indianola, the nearest point to the coast where pure water, fuel, and good grazing can easily be obtained.
By my present arrangements I think I shall be able to assemble by the 10th of April and have ready for the transports some forty-five officers and thirteen hundred men, and by the 10th of May I hope to have the remainder of the troops in a position ready to embark. All the troops will embark at Indianola.

Nichols, representing himself to be a commissioner on the part of Texas, in relation to the surrender of Fort Brown and the public property at that post.
It will be seen by these communications that a very large force was collected at Brazos Santiago, acting under the authority of the State Convention, for the purpose, it is believed, of forcing the garrison of Fort Brown to surrender or evacuate the post. The firm course pursued by Captain Hill, and their dislike to attack a post so well provided with light artillery, no doubt prevented a serious collision.
Nearly all of the State troops came from Eastern Texas via Galveston, and were raised and prepared for a movement about the time negotiations were commenced with General Twiggs. By the last information from Fort Brown, our troops hold that post, and no further difficulty was anticipated.

There is at Brazos a quantity of ordnance and ordnance stores—how much I do not know. Those stores are under the charge of an Ordnance , sergeant, who is accountable for them, and who communicates direct with the Colonel of Ordnance.
The only order I find on file in this office is the extract from Special Orders No. 51, from headquarters Department of Texas, of January 1, 1860, and what disposition the Colonel of Ordnance has directed in relation to those stores, or what quantity, if any, he has ordered to be removed to this post, I am not informed. I have understood within a few days, however, that there is a heavy brass battery there, and quite a number of heavy iron guns and carriages, and I have been led to apprehend, from some rumors that I have heard, that an attempt may be made to seize both the public buildings and stores there, and I conclude it to be prudent to send a small guard there for their protection, and a copy of the post orders to that effect is herewith inclosed.
The battery of brass guns I have ordered to be sent to this post.
Should the general commanding the department conclude to retain a command at Brazos, I suggest that it be drawn from Binggold Barracks. One of the companies constituting the garrison of this post is a light battery, and as most of the men are required for the care of the battery horses, but few are applicable to the ordinary garrison duty, and as this post is an extensive one, the duty will fall heavily on that part of my own company that remains here.

and officers of my own command, I determined to destroy all the ordnance at Brazos, in order to prevent the erection of batteries on the island, and, as far as lay in my power, to deprive any hostile force of the means of making war upon the United States. Orders were accordingly issued (copy herewith inclosed) to insure a speedy execution thereof. Lieutenant Graham and a detachment of forty men from Captain Stone-man’s command were ordered to Brazos to report to Lieutenant Thompson. Before the arrival of this detachment the steamer Rusk entered the harbor, landed her men on the island, and took possession of the public buildings and property. Lieutenant Thompson’s report is herewith inclosed.
I have, also, to inclose three communications from General E. B.

to retain those men until the arrival of the Arizona, and then to return them to camp, unless in my judgment it should b.e necessary to retain them. Accordingly, on the evening of the 20th, the Arizona having arrived, I ordered the cavalry detachment back to camp. Having heard a rumor to the effect that the steamer General Busk was en route for Brazos with several hundred men, I communicated the same by express .to the commanding officer. This express left Brazos about sunset of that day (the 20th) ,* at what hour it arrived at Fort Brown I know not. Next morning, the 21st, the steamer General Busk appeared, and anchored outside the bar. Mr. E. B. Nichols was landed in a small boat, and presented himself as commissioner delegated by the Convention of the State of Texas to receive and receipt for all the property under my charge. The conference that ensued began and ended between the hours of 12 and 2 o’clock of that day. The demand of Mr. Nichols was backed by a force of between five hundred and six hundred men. I accordingly delivered up possession of the property, and marched my detachment away from the island. Beturning to Fort Browh, I met a detachment for m y re * enforcement: also, an officer with instructions for me to destroy the property at Brazos. Both came too late for the execution of said order.

However, as no detriment to the public service can result from a conference, you are hereby informed that I shall be found at my quarters in the garrison at any hour to-day which it may suit your pleasure to appear, for the transaction of all business appertaining to my official duties.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. H. HILL,
Captain, U. S. Army, Commanding.
E. B. Nichols, Commissioner.
Brownsville, February 23,1861.
Sir : As understood by us at the termination of our interview this morning, I take pleasure in addressing you upon the subject of my mission. I am delegated by the people of Texas, in Convention assembled, at the city of Austin, on the 28th instant, to provide supplies for the protection of this frontier, and to receive all public property placed here and elsewhere on this frontier for such protection.
In pursuance of such commission, I have come with a portion of the troops for such protection, believing that the Federal troops stationed on this frontier would be immediately withdrawn upon the secession of Texas, and knowing that protection is required here at all times, and that the citizens living here, and their property being thus exposed, would not be safe for even a single day without such protection. I am therefore prepared to receive all such property as you may have in your charge, placed here for the protection of this frontier by the Federal Government, and am authorized to receipt for the same.
The Texas troops who came with me, under Col. John S. Ford, who has been appointed commander of the Military Department of the Bio Grande, came on a mission of peace, and no act of theirs or their officers shall justify a hostile collision with the Federal troops. It becomes necessary that our troops should be as soon as possible assigned to their respective stations on this frontier, in order to be efficient; therefore I will be iileased to have possession of all government property placed here for the protection of this frontier, at as early a period as may be practicable, consulting your convenience.
Texas is virtually out of the Union already, it being now about 4 o’clock in the evening, and the destiny of this State has been fixed by the people in their sovereign capacity at the ballot-box, and no one who knows anything of the sentiment of this people can doubt for a moment that this is now a sovereign and independent republic. As such the United States troops placed here for our protection are not needed by us—are upon foreign soil. They, therefore, have no further duty to per-

.form here; therefore I presume they will soon be removed (though we do not object to their presence among us, for we regard them as friends), and that the property now under their charge at this place, placed here for the use of the State of Texas, becomes the property of the republic of Texas upon the separation from the Federal Government, and ought to be delivered to the properly constituted authorities of Texas.
As my business calls me back to Galveston at an early period, in order to receive and forward the balance of the troops destined for the protection of this frontier, I will be pleased to receive an early answer from you, that I may carry back with me to my people the gratifying intelligence that there will be no acts of hostility between the United States authorities here and the Texas troops.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. B. NICHOLS,
Commissioner.

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this date. It would be impossible, without instructions from my Government, to accede to your request to deliver into your possession the public property, or any portion thereof, at this post. In assuming that this property, u placed here,” as you say, “for the use of the State of Texas, becomes the property of the republic of Texas upon the separation from the Federal Government,” you have raised a question upon which my Government will doubtless take action in due season, but which meanwhile cannot affect my military duties or responsibilities.
I take pleasure in reciprocating personally the courtesy and good will implied in your assurance that “no act of the Texas troops in this vicinity shall justify a hostile collision with the Federal troops.” Further than this, that assurance has no official weight or application, inasmuch as the said Texas troops, numbering several hundred, have already committed an act of hostility against the United States in seizing the public property at Brazos Santiago, dispossessing therefrom a guard of twelve United States soldiers, placed there for its protection.

entered into an agreement to evacuate their posts and surrender the public property, on the conditions and in accordance with the stipu-* lations of the agreement entered into by General Twiggs and the commissioners on behalf of the committee of public safety.
It is now known that some time previous to the commencement of the negotiations with General Twiggs a large force was collecting in the northern counties of the State, for the purpose of capturing some of the remote posts and seizing the public property. This force consisted of several hundred residents of the northern part of Texas, and several companies of troops which had previously been mustered into the service of the State. This gathering of so large a force appears to have been the spontaneous movement of the border population, with no other incentive than a desire of plunder. There is no doubt that these movements were known to and sanctioned by the convention, immediately after it assembled at Austin, on the 28th January, and it is now known that the persons calling themselves commissioners acted under instructions from that body. I would here remark that there is not a post in Texas which has the slightest defensive arrangement. They are generally camps or open cantonments, and not tenable against a large force. Such, I understand, was the condition of the posts above mentioned.
I also inclose copies of letters written by or addressed to Captain Johnson, Second Cavalry, which will show the course pursued by the State officers, and the difficulty of communicating with the different posts.*

.of the Federal property intrusted to our protection. This attempt, if made, will be by the identical persons whose lives and property the Government have sent us here to defend. Every incentive to patriotism, and the fulfillment of our individual sworn obligations, prompt us, in such an event, to sell our lives at the dearest possible cost. The defense of our own honor, and that of our country we iare sworn to protect, demand this of us*
The spirit that would commit this outrage is not engendered by any love of State or country, but springs from the despicable promptings of individual ambition of distinction in what they hope soon to be a dismembered limb of our glorious country.
Should their number be a thousand to one, their cause, when compared to ours, will be more than that odds against them. In a strife like this we have but one course to pursue, for each would rather lay his corpse to molder upon the plain he defends than to drag it hence to be the laugh and scorn of every honest lover of his country’s glory.
The commanding officer has every confidence in the patriotism of the men of his command, and is satisfied that his promptings will be sufficient to induce, upon the part of all, a loyal discharge of duty. But, if other motives are wanting, they are found in the fact that our individual security and subsistence depend upon our defense, as the only property we have are commissary stores, means of transportation, and our arms. Deprive us of these, we are powerless in an enemy’s country.

Camp Cooper, Tex., February 19,1861. .
Sir : Your letter of the 18th instant, informing me that the armed body of men encamped in this vicinity were State troops and armed citizens under your command, has been received. I have also received your letter of this date, demanding, in the name of the State of Texas, a surrender of this camp. Until the reception of your first note I was satisfied, from all the information I could obtain, that I was threatened with an attack by an unauthorized force, and accordingly took such measures as were necessary for my defense. My reply to your demand, notwithstanding it is made in the name of Texas, and by an officer holding a commission from its governor, as commanding officer of the Federal troops stationed at this camp, could be no other than an unqualified refusal; but in the present agitated political condition of our country I feel compelled to regard, in connection with this demand and its refusal, the perilous consequences that must result to the whole nation. The policy of the administration and the wisest statesman of the land is to avert, if possible, the shedding of blood, and while I have before me this fact exemplified at Forts Sumter and Pickens, and especially in the case of the Star of the West, and also the fact that the arsenals throughout the South have been yielded to State authorities without a struggle, I do not feel justified to act from the promptings of a soldier.
It haatters not that this camp from its position is incapable of a prolonged defense; it matters not that your force is now far superior in numbers to my own and is daily increasing; it matters not that by reliable information I am positively assured that this whole community is arming for the purpose of retaining in the State all the property of the Federal Government now in Texas, I would be actuated by the same motives which now control me in every-day events, provided the consequences of my refusal to your demand were to be the inauguration of a civil war that must eventually involve all the States in fraternal strife.
Guided, then, by a spirit of patriotism and loyalty to the Union, and by what I conceive to be the counsels of the most enlightened of statesmen of the nation, and also by what I understand to be the policy of the general commanding the department, after due consultation with the officers of my command, I have determined to surrender this camp to the State of Texas, and if you will submit to me the terms upon which you desire to receive for the State the camp and Federal property in my charge, I will then give them an early consideration.

The inclosed papers give a full account of the transaction, and show the demands I made for the recovery of the money. The letter marked 7 is the only written communication I have received from the commissioners on this subject. I understand that in several instances where the sutlers at the posts have paid the troops, the commissioners have refunded the amount so advanced. These are the payments, I presume, to which they allude. Their retaining the money, and making the payments themselves, is for the purpose of securing any balance of the $30,000 which may remain. It is not probable that they will pay out more than three or four thousand dollars.
Major Maclin now holds an appointment under the State of Texas, and has, I believe, taken the oath of allegiance to that State. I am informed that he entered on duty as Chief of Ordnance on the 4th instant.
I also inclose a copy of a letter from Capt. A. W. Reynolds, assistant quartermaster, by which it will be seen that the commissioners have returned a portion of the money they seized when they took possession of his office. The amount retained by them is $2,943, as shown by the receipt, [No. 8.]

Gentlemen: I have heen informed that Lieutenant Jones, Eighth; Infantry, who was sent to New Orleans for funds to pay the troops,, arrived here yesterday with $30,000, and that it has been siezed by an armed force acting under your direction, and is now in your possession.
My views in relation to the seizure and retention of moneys belonging to the United States are fully expressed in my communication of the 21st ultimo, to which you are respectfully referred. This case, however, presents some different features. The funds alluded to did not arrive within the limits of the State of Texas until the 24th ultimo^ several days after the agreement entered into by General Twiggs to* deliver up the public property, &c., was signed and went into effect. That agreement is limited strictly to the property then within the borders of Texas; consequently it cannot by any possible construction include money or property subsequently brought into the State.
I have, therefore, to require that, the $30,000 above mentioned may be immediately returned to the United States authorities.

A strict and close watch was kept up during the entire night over all the entrances, but nothing of interest transpired until about 8-| o’clock on the morning of the 3d, when two ambulances were discovered approaching the city, and were seen to enter the yard of Major Maclin’s (U.

The same was immediately reported, when I was ordered to make a detail of twenty-five men from my company (armed), and to proceed to the residence of Major Maclin, when Dr. Luckett stepped forward and demanded the funds in the name of the State of Texas, and after a few minutes’ consultation they were delivered up and conveyed to the office of the commissioners on behalf of the State of Texas, and were said to be over $30,000. Having performed the duty assigned me, my men were dismissed, and returned to their quarters.

In addition to the above, I remark that the seven boxes mentioned in the affidavit contained three thousand dollars each.
Immediately after the money arrived at my house the boxes were thrown out of the ambulances in the back yard. Before they were moved the commissioner of the State of Texas demanded them. In reply to the demand, I declared that if 1 had the force he should not have a dollar of the money. The soldiers then took possession of the boxes. The commissioner then made a further demand for the gold, which was also taken possession of. As far as I am informed, the money is still remaining in the hands of the authorities of the State of Texas.
I have neglected to say that Lieut. Thomas M. Jones proceeded to New Orleans, under the orders of Maj. Gen. D. E. Twiggs, and procured the money from the assistant United States treasurer, on a check drawn by me on the 9th of February, 1861.

Army, for keeping the United States funds in his charge, were forcibly taken possession of by the forces of the State of Texas, the chest aforesaid with its contents being taken by order of us, the commissioners, acting for the State under the authority of the State Convention; and we moreover certify that the chest aforesaid has this day been turned back to the possession of Captain Reynolds with the same contents, except $2,943, which amount had been taken by us for the use of the State, and the receipt thereof is hereby acknowledged.

Sir : In case the difficulty between the General Government and the seceding States should result in hostilities, there is reason to apprehend that an attempt may be made to prevent the embarkation of the troops and to detain them as prisoners of war. This can only be effected by their seizing and removing all lighters, preventing transports of light draught entering the bay at Indianola, and by cutting off our supplies of provisions, &c. To avoid an attempt of that kind, and to be prepared to meet it if made, I am concentrating the troops at the camp near Green Lake as rapidly as possible. This camp is full twenty miles from Indianola and is the nearest place to the coast where fresh water can be obtained. The difficulty, amounting almost to impossibility, of supplying the troops with water at Indianola, prevents my moving them down to that place. Not a line has been received at these headquarters from the headquarters of the Army, or from the War Department, since I entered upon duty as the department commander, except unimportant matters, and I am inclined to believe from inspection of the envelopes that they

Colonel : I have the honor to report that three companies of the First Infantry, four companies of the Third Infantry, two companies of the Eighth Infantry, and six companies of the Second Cavalry have already passed through this place on their way to the camp near Green Lake, and that probably before the end of the present month four additional companies will arrive here on their way to their camp. These nineteen companies amount to some thirty officers, and about twelve hundred and seventy five enlisted men, which with the laundresses, officers’ servants, &c., will swell the number to near thirteen hundred and fifty persons.
The remainder of the companies in this department will reach Green Lake by the 15th or 20th of April, except the seven companies of the Eighth Infantry, stationed at Forts Bliss, Quitman, Davis, and Stockton, which cannot be at the coast and ready to embark before the first week in May.

Sir : This morning I had the honor to receive, by Lieut. C. R. Collins, Topographical Engineers, a communication from the General-in-Chief, dated Washington, March 19, 1861, and a few hours after, by the hand of Lieut. W. Jones, First Infantry, a duplicate of the same, with the addition of a postscript in relation to the concentration of the troops at Indianola, &c., for the purpose of giving aid to the Union party in Texas.* Yesterday I received from Governor Houston, through the agency of an influential Union man, a note dated at Austin, the 29th ultimo, and one of the same date from F. W. Lander, a Government agent who recently visited this State, which are herewith inclosed. By these communications it will be seen that Governor Houston not only declines all military assistance from the United States, but strongly protests against a concentration of troops, or the construction of fortifications, within the borders of Texas. He also earnestly requests that the troops may be moved from the State at the u earliest day practicable.”
So far from there being any body of men collected for the purpose of sustaining the governor in the exercise of his official functions, nothing of the kind, so far as I can learn, has ever been contemplated. The

policy of the Union party is to effect a peaceable change in the views of the inhabitants of the State, and that object they intend to accomplish, to a great extent, through the agency of the press and ballot-box. I think I am authorized in saying that, in the opinion of the leading men of the Union party, a few thousand dollars employed in the support of newspapers, in different parts of the State, would in a short time effect a complete revolution in public sentiment. It is in this way, and in this way only, they intend to carry out their views.
Under present circumstances, my only course appears to be to embark the troops as directed in instructions from the headquarters of the Army, under date of the 12th ultimo.* One transport, carrying nearly six hundred officers and men, has already left for New York, and another, with about an equal number of persons, will soon sail. The officer in command of the first transport has been directed to leave two companies of the First Infantry at Key West.
The funds and artillery referred to in the letter from the General-in-Chief will not, under present circumstances, be wanted. I deem it proper to state that the communication from the General-in-Chief of the 19th ultimo, and also the duplicate of the same, were opened at Indianola by Captain King, First Infantry, and at Green Lake by Bvt. Maj. L. Smith, Eighth Infantry, and I fear that other persons were made acquainted with their contents. I immediately wrote to Major Smith to take measures to prevent a knowledge of these instructions being made public. Captain King sailed in the first transport for New York.

Dear Sir : I have received intelligence that you have, or will soon receive, orders to concentrate United States troops under your command at Indianola, in this State, to sustain me in the exercise of my official functions. Allow me most respectfully to decline any such assistance of the United States Government, and to most earnestly protest against the concentration of troops or fortifications in Texas, and request that you remove all such troops out of this State at the earliest day practicable, or, at any rate, by all means take no action towards hostile movements till further ordered by the Government at Washington City, or particularly of Texas.

request of the Secretary of State, and indorsed by the President, allowed me to peruse your late instructions brought on by Lieutenant Collins. The object of these instructions was directly connected with my mission. They necessarily fail, from the determination of Governor Houston to protest against such military aid being rendered him. If, consistently with your own views, you can await further instructions from Washington prior to making the intrenched camp at Indianola, or, in fact, taking any step which will lead the secession party of Texas to imagine that the Government proposes to coerce them, I should regard it a high act of patriotism, and, under the present information, of duty. General Scott’s letter clearly states,66 until the people of Texas have seceded,” &c. It also states, uif five hundred men can be concentrated.” Any practicable reason which may prevent your action toward making an intrenched camp until I reach, and you can hear from, Washington, I know will be regarded sufficient. I could only take this peculiar liberty under the absolute change of circumstances, which renders nugatory the action at Washington, and requires my immediate return there.

Sir: I have the honor to inform you that a force of Texas State troops is now assembled in this city, and I have this evening learned that the officers, &c., here stationed will be arrested to morrow, and held as prisoners of war. Two transports have sailed with troops, and it is hoped and expected that the third, the Star of the West, will sail in a day or two with the whole force now in camp at Green Lake. There will then remain seven companies of the Eighth Infantry, numbering, say, 370, the headquarters of that regiment, and the headquarters of the department. The Eighth Infantry will not reach Indianola before the 10th of May, if permitted to proceed to the coast. This, of course, requires that a fourth transport should be sent out for the embarkation of these troops.

Bvt. Maj. J. T. Sprague, Captain, Eighth Infantry.
Lieut. E. L. Hartz, Eighth Infantry.
Lieut. E. W. H. Bead, Eighth Infantry.
Maj. D. H. Vinton, Quartermaster’s Department, was subsequently arrested, and is now on parole.
On being arrested, the officers were told that they must remain in confinement under a guard, or give their parole not to take up arms or serve in the field against the Confederate States, during the existence of the present hostilities, unless exchanged.
After mature reflection, and a careful examination of the peculiar circumstances under which they were placed, the latter alternative was accepted.
The main reasons which induced the officers to come to this conclusion were, that in their then condition they could perform no duty, nor be of the least service to the Government. By rejoining the Army they could be assigned to many Important duties, the performance of which would not be incompatible with their parole, and thus still render some service to their country.
. In justice to the officers, I must here state that great exertions were made and the most flattering inducements were held out by agents of the Confederate States for them to resign and enter that service. These officers having resisted these temptations, to which so many others yielded, is strong proof of their devotion to their country, and merits the favorable consideration of the Government.
I have reliable information (not official) that seven companies, under Major Sibley, Third Infantry, viz, two companies of the First, thre.e companies of the Third, and two companies of the Eighth Infantry, were captured on the 23d ultimo off Indianola, and were immediately paroled and permitted to sail for IsTew York. There are six companies of the Eighth Infantry, under Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Reeve, which it is believed have also been captured. The last information (official) received from them was dated the 10th of April. At that time they were near Fort Lancaster. The impossibility of sending an express through the country for several weeks previous to my leaving San Antonio prevented my having more definite information in relation to this command.
Letter marked A will indicate the course adopted towards the captured troops, and documents marked B and C will explain the circumstances under which we were made prisoners.
In conclusion, permit me to express the hope and anxious desire of the officers on parole that they may be exchanged as early as practicable, and may be permitted to take an active part in the military operations.	•

Memorandum relating to the arrest of Colonel Waite, U. S. Army, and the officers of the Army on duty at San Antonio, Tex.
San Antonio, Tex., April 23,1861.
Captain Wilcox (with his sword, commanding Texas troops). Good morning, colonel. (At Colonel Waite’s quarters, Colonel Waite and Major Sprague only present.)
Colonel Waite. Good morning, sir.
Captain Wilcox. I have come to request you to go over to Major Maclin’s office.
Colonel Waite. For what purpose, sir?
Captain Wilcox. As a prisoner of war.
* Colonel Waite. What authority have you?
Captain Wtilcox. I have authority from Major Maclin.
Colonel Waite. Who is Major Maclin?
Captain Wilcox. An officer of the Confederate States.
Colonel Waite. I do not, sir, recognize any such authority. Have you the authority ? I should like to see it.
Captain Wilcox then took from his pocket an order from Major Maclin, which Colonel Waite read, directing him to proceed with his company and arrest the officers of the United States Government in San Antonio.
Colonel Waite. I protest against any such act, and will not obey the order, except by force. Have I committed any offense?
To which Captain Wilcox replied, “None that I know of.” “It is, then,” said Colonel Waite, “a most unwarranted act of usurpation, and in violation of the modes and customs of civilized warfare, and a gross outrage upon my individual rights. I protest against it in the name of my country. Your authority I do not recognize, nor will I obey any order from you. Nothing but the presence of a force greater than I cap overcome will cause me to relinquish my personal freedom. There is nothing in history to equal this usurpation.” Thereupon Captain Wilcox said, “ I have the force,” and started for the public storehouse, and immediately returned with thirty-six footmen, Texas troops, armed with rifles and saber bayonets. The command was halted in front of Colonel Waite’s quarters, when Captain Wilcox entered the house. Colonel Waite then walked to the door, and upon looking out, remarked, “Is that your guard, sir?” “Yes, sir,” replied Captain Wilcox. “These

are more men,” remarked Colonel Waite,“ than I can resist, and I again protest, in the name of my country, against this gross and unwarranted act of usurpation, and the violation of personal rights. Where do you wish me to go, sir? ” “To the ordnance office, sir,” said Captain Wilcox.
Colonel Waite then took his hat and passed to the front of the guard, when arms were shouldered, and the crowd proceeded through the public street. As Colonel Waite was passing into the custody of the guard, Major Sprague said to Captain Wilcox, “Do you consider me as one?” “Yes,” he replied; “come along.” “Then,” said Major Sprague, “I concur fully in every word uttered by Colonel Waite in regard to this outrage.”
Major Sprague then joined Colonel Waite, and proceeded amid a crowd of boys. Arriving at the building where the public offices are, the command halted, and Captain Wilcox ordered the other officers, viz, Maj. W. A. Nichols, assistant adjutant-general of department; Maj. Daniel McClure, Pay Department; Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Chandier, Third Infantry; Capt. K. Garrard, Second Cavalry; Dr. E. H. Abadie, Medical Department; Dr. Joseph R. Smith, Medical Department; Dr. E. P. Langworthy, Medical Department; Capt. A. T. Lee, Eighth Infantry; Lieut. E. L. Hartz, Eighth Infantry; Lieut. E. W. H. Read, Eighth Infantry ; and Capt. R. M. Potter, military storekeeper, who had been previously arrested, and were within the building in charge of a sentinel, to proceed. The officers in a body, under the guard, proceeded to the office of Major Maclin. After a few moments* silence Major Maclin said:
“ Colonel Waite, it becomes my duty to arrest you and the other officers as prisoners of war.”
“By what authority, sir?”
“That is my business, sir, not yours,” responded Major Maclin.
“ But,” said Colonel Waite, “ I should like to know by what power I am deprived of my personal rights.”
“ I have the power from the President of the Confederate States,” answered Major Maclin.
“ Such authority I do not know, nor shall I obey it,” said Colonel Waite. “Have I or my officers committed any offense? Did we not come here as friends, and have we not been such to all the interests of Texas? More than that, is there not an agreement with the Texas commissioners, guaranteeing to the men and officers—my entire command—to go out of Texas unmolested? That, sir, has been carried out faithfully on our part, in every respect. By what right am I to be restricted of my liberty? And by what authority>am I and my officers made prisoners of war ? I protest against it.”
“ There is no use of protesting,” said Major Maclin. “ I do not wish to hear any protest; it is unnecessary. I have my orders.”
“But 1 will protest,” replied Colonel Waite. “In the name of my Government I protest. I denounce it as an act of unwarranted usurpation, and against the custom of war, and in violation of my personal rights. I suppose you intend to regard the rights and customs of civilization. I know no war. We have been acting as friends. We are not here in a hostile attitude. We came into the country as friends, and are going out as such.”	'
“ Yes,” responded Major Maclin; “I have my duty to perform, and shall do it.**
“ I repeat,” said Colonel Waite, “it is gross, unheard-of, unwarranted, and treacherous. Nothing but the presence of a force requires me to

listen to such measures, much more obey them. Had I the means it would be quite different. I would resist until death.”
“ I am aware of that,” answered Major Maclin. “ I have as much confidence in the courage of your officers as you have.”
“ What do you propose ?” inquired Colonel Waite. “ I am, obliged to consider myself a prisoner, and should like to know the future.”
“ I have here, sir,” replied Major Maclin, “ paroles [handing a manuscript to Colonel Waite], which the officers are at liberty to avail themselves of.”
One of these was then read by Colonel Waite.
“ Such a paper I shall not sign,” said Colonel Waite, indignantly 5 “it is highly objectionable, and I shall remain a prisoner.”
“ Very well,” answered Major Maclin; “ these paroles will not be presented to you again, without you request it.”
“ What rank do you hold, sir ? ” inquired Colonel Waite.
“ I am a major.”
“In the Provisional or Eegular Army, sir*?” inquired Colonel Waite. “ In the Eegular Army, sir.”
A general conversation ensued among all parties, in which there was much angry excitement. Major Maclin improved the first opportunity to speak, and remarked that he should send the officers to Victoria, one hundred miles distant, to Colonel Van Dorn’s headquarters, and desired to know how soon Colonel Waite could be ready, and suggested to-morrow, even intimated to-day, whereupon Colonel Waite and the officers present said it was impossible to arrange their family affairs in so short a time.
“ How long a time, then,” asked he, “ do you desire % One, two, or three days'?”
“ I presume we can have transportation,” suggested Colonel Waite.
“ There will be transportation for you, sir,” responded Major Maclin, with emphasis and anger.	N
Again a general conversation took place; still much excitement evinced among all parties. The inquiry was made of Major Maclin if he had any discretion in the matter. He replied that he had none. The character of paroles and the rights of prisoners then became a general subject of conversation. Each officer present said he desired at least twenty-four hours to consider the subject, as it was of great importance. Colonel Waite asked for one of the manuscript paroles, when Major Maclin, in a very offensive manner, declined, saying he had use for them. This again caused much evident excited and indignant feeling.
“ It is my desire,” said Colonel Waite, “ to put some officer in charge of our soldiers to be left here as prisoners, should I accept a parole, to attend to their personal rights, police, and comfort.”
“ You need have no concern about that, sir,” responded Major Maclin; “we will save you that trouble. We will attend to that. No officer will be permitted to have anything to do with them. You will not be allowed to give any orders here.”
Colonel Waite, in answer: “ It is your wish and object to corrupt them, and to force them into your service; but they won’t stay with you; they will desert.”
“Your language, sir,” said Major Maclin, “is offensive. I cannot permit it.”
Colonel Waite replied: “The facts, sir, are doubtless offensive. My language is not intended to be offensive. I will talk and state the facts.

I also claim the right to send an officer to my Government with sealed dispatches on parole.”
“ That, sir,” replied Major Maclin, “ will not be allowed.”
“But,” said Colonel Waite, “ can I not make my official report? To send an officer to headquarters after important events is the custom of all armies and troops among civilized people.”
“Perhaps it is, sir,” replied Major Maclin.
After a long conversation, and the excitement somewhat abated, Major Maclin was asked if he would grant to each officer twenty-four hours to consider upon the subject, when they would report to him in person their determination. To this he agreed, and permitted each officer to take one of the manuscript paroles for consideration. The guard at the door was then dismissed, and the officers retired.
Wednesday, April 24, 1861.
The officers assembled at 12 m. to-day at the office of the commanding officer, Major Maclin, as agreed upon yesterday. ~No further modification could be had other than the terms offered yesterday, excepting a provision for exchange as prisoners of war, and the privilege to Colonel Waite to report the facts and past transactions to his government. They now were offered the acceptance of the paroles, or to be considered close prisoners of war. There was no alternative but to be subjected to the rabble; to crowds of undisciplined troops, regardless of authority or control; to the vindictive and active prejudices of men in temporary authority, swayed by spleen and disappointment, as well as infidelity to the General Government in former commissions, who had already stipulated terms, or take the paroles offered and ask safe-conduct out of the Stare. The latter was determined upon as the only method which could secure safe egress or escape, and place us within the authority of the United States Government. Each officer took his parole under the protest made by Colonel Waite the day previous.

On the morning of the 23d of April, 1861, about 12 o’clock m., Captain Wilcox, commanding a company called the Alamo Rifles, entered the office of Colonel Waite, U. S. Army, and inquired for Colonel Waite. He was informed that he was at his quarters. Captain Wilcox then said to the officers present, viz, Lieutenant-Colonel Chandler, Captain Garrard, and Assistant Surgeon Smith, “ Gentlemen, I am directed to arrest you, and take you over to Major Maclin’s quarters.” Colonel Chandler inquired, “ By what authority, sir ? ” Captain Wilcox replied, “ By authority of the Confederate States,” and offered to show his order directing him to make the arrest. Colonel Chandler then said, “ How do you arrest us; as prisoners of war! ” Captain Wilcox replied, “Yes, sir, as prisoners of war.” Colonel Chandler then replied, “ I do not recognize your authority, sir, and refuse to obey your orders. I decline going to Major Maclin’s office unless you have an armed force with you.” Captain Wilcox answered, “ I have a force, sir,” and pointed out of the window to a detachment of about thirty-six armed infantry. Colonel Chandler then said, “ I surrender myself to you as a prisoner of war, reserving to myself the right of protesting against these proceedings.” The other officers present, when called on by Captain Wilcox, replied, “ Sir, we surrender on the same terms.” Captain Wilcox then said,

u Gentlemen, will yon go over to Colonel Waite’s quarters with me!” Colonel Chandler replied, u We are your prisoners, and will go if you order us.” Captain Wilcox then said, u You remain here.” He then left the room, and the officers remained in it, under charge of a guard, until Captain Wilcox returned after arresting Colonel Waite, when they were marched, under charge of the guard, to Major Maclin’s office, in company with other officers who had been taken prisoners.

Headquarters Fort Chadbourne, Tex.,
February 28,1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to report to you, that in compliance with General Orders No. 5, dated Headquarters Department of Texas, February 18, 1861,1 have this day entered into a written agreement with Col. H. E. McCulloch (commissioner on the part of Texas for this district), to deliver to him the public property at this post, when and as soon as transportation can be sent here to move this command to the coast. I therefore earnestly request that you wiU cause to be dispatched for this purpose twelve wagons, if the supplies have to be transported the whole way ; but if drawn at San Antonio, or other points on the route, ten wagons in addition to the three now at the post will answer. Even this may be considered an unusual allowance of transportation; but if it is considered that there are to be moved one lieutenant-colonel, one captain, one assistant surgeon with the rank of captain, one second lieutenant, one chaplain, and their servants, consisting of one man, four women, and three children (slaves), Company G, First Infantry, laundresses and children belonging to it, together with a detachment of Company I, First Infantry, with laundresses of same company, and the hospital matron and stores, as also the records of the post, the requisition cannot be deemed extravagant, or more than is required to move the command as stipulated by treaty. The treaty in question does not state which party shall furnish the necessary transportation to enable the troops to vacate Texas, and I therefore make this requisition on the commander of the department, and the commissioner has agreed with me to make the same requisition to the commissioners on the part of Texas at San Antonio.

Report of Capt. JEJ. Kirby Smith, Second TJ. S. Cavalry, of the evacuation of
Camp Colorado, Tex.
Camp near Fort Mason, Tex.,
March 1, 1861,
I have the honor to report the arrival this day of my company (B, Second Cavalry) at Fort Mason, Tex., where it awaits the orders of the colonel commanding the department.
Camp Colorado, Tex., was evacuated by my command on the 26th February, 1861, under Department Orders Ko. 5, of February 18, 1861, under the following circumstances:
Col. H. E. McCulloch arrived at Camp Colorado, Tex., on the 22d of February, and presented his papers, deriving from the convention and legislature of Texas authority as commissioner on the part of Texas to treat for the surrender of the public property at Colorado, Chad-bourne, and Cooper. Under instructions from the same authority, Colonel McCulloch demanded the surrender of the arms, equipments, horses, &c., in the possession of the troops under my command, together with all the public property at the post. Colonel McCulloch presented his commission as colonel of cavalry in the service of the State of Texas, and enforced his demand by the presence of several companies of State troops encamped in the vicinity.
These demands met with an unqualified refusal, and in my interview with Colonel McCulloch on the 22d, my reply was that Icouldnever, under any circumstances, give up my arms and horses, or negotiate upon terms that would dishonor the troops under my command, and that, were such a demand persisted in, I would mount my command, and endeavor to cut my way through any force opposed to me.
Terms were agreed upon between Colonel McCulloch and myself for the surrender of the public property at the post, but before their signature, on the 23d, the circular of the commissioners at San Antonio, with General Twiggs7 order thereon, was received.
The inclosed is a copy of the document, signed by Colonel McCulloch and myself, in which we stipulate to be governed by the agreement entered into at San Antonio by General Twiggs and the commissioners on the part of the State of Texas.
Duplicate invoices and receipts were made and taken of all the public property turned over to Colonel McCulloch, the commissioner.
The post was evacuated on the 26th, and the troops marched out with their arms, equipments, horses, ten days7 rations, and all the transportation in the possession of the A. A. Q. M. Owing to the want of transportation, private property and clothing belonging to officers and men were abandoned and sacrificed.
The evacuation of the post was hastened, as the presence of the undisciplined troops of the Convention, with the irritable feelings of our men under their unceremonious removal, might soon have occasioned a collision.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : I have the honor to report that I have this morning surrendered this battalion, consisting of two companies of the First Infantry, with the adjutant and non-commissioned staff and band of the same regiment, three companies of the Third and two companies of the Eighth Infantry, including nine officers, to the forces of the Confederate States under the command of Col. Earl Van Dorn.
Two unsuccessful attempts have been made by me to escape with this command, the Star of the West (transport) having been captured before we were able to reach her anchorage, off Matagorda Bay, and on the night of the 24th of April three steamers, having some eight hundred men and some pieces of artillery on board, coming down the bay, and taking up such a position as to prevent our retreat in the two small schooners in which we were endeavoring to make our escape, and a fourth steamer, with some four hundred men, one 24 and two 6 pounder pieces of artillery, having early in the morning of the 25th taken up a position to x> re vent our escape by running out of the bay, I was obliged to capitulate under the most favorable terms which I could obtain.

The shores of this bay are extremely low and partially inundated, and the channel seems to be nearly one mile from the land. The pilots have constantly refused us both information and material assistance.
It is extremely unfortunate that the steamer Mohawk had left the coast at this time, as its presence might have saved us from this humiliating disaster.
It affords me pleasure, great pleasure, to state the officers and men of my command have shown the most unwavering loyalty to the Government, the men, with two exceptions, having taken the oath necessary for their return to the United States.

Sir : Having already made a brief report of the capture of this command, I have now the honor to submit the following additional particulars connected with the embarkation of the troops and the capitulation in Matagorda Bay on the 25th of April.
Of the seven companies comprised in this command, the three companies of the Third Infantry arrived at Indianola on the 13th of April, at which date I relieved, Lieutenant Colonel Backus in the command, and encamped in rear of the town to await the arrival of the troops designated as a part of the complement number for embarkation on the steamer Star of the West, then lying off the coast near the mouth of Matagorda Bay. On the 17th these troops, consisting of the adjutant and non-commissioned staff and band, and two companies of the First Infantry and two companies of the Eighth Infantry, arrived at my camp, when I immediately marched with the whole command to the wharf at Indianola, where the baggage, camp and garrison equipage, and stores, were stowed on two small steamers, which had been engaged as lighters to convey the troops to the Star of the West. The troops slept on the wharf on the night of the 17th, and, embarking early in the morning of the 18th, the steamers got under way, and proceeded down the harbor. On arriving at the designated point, it was found that the Star of the West had disappeared from her anchorage, and I was reluctantly compelled to return to the camp previously occupied near Indianola. During the 19th and 20th I made unsuccessful efforts to obtain some other means of transportation, and on the 21st I succeeded in chartering two small schooners—the Horace, of one hundred and sixty -eight, and the Urban a, of one hundred and thirty-eight tons burden. The latter not h aving discharged her cargo we were obliged to unload it, the parties working during the day and most of the night of the 22d, and on the 23d we again proceeded down the bay, towed by the small steamer Fashion. The weather was extremely unfavorable, the wind blowing from the northeast across the bar, and on the 24th the master of one of the schooners reported that it would, under the circumstances, be absolutely impossible to manage his vessel at sea, there being at this time more than two hundred persons on board, including some thirty-five women and children, together with the subsistence stores and property. I was, therefore, compelled to seek for an additional transport, and Captain Bowman, of the Third, and Lieutenant Greene, of the First Infantry, with a detail of thirty-four men, taken from all the companies, were dispatched on the Fashion to endeavor to obtain another vessel, which was understood to be lying at the port of Lavaca. During the afternoon of the 24th we obtained with the small boats an additional supply of

brackish water from the marshy lands at Decklas Point, and by night, nothing having been heard of the detachment, some suspicion of the seizure of this party and of a movement to cut us off was entertained on the schooners, but we could not get out across the bar. The easterly winds which prevailed, and the refusal of the pilots along the coast to come to our aid, had completed our disaster. The night was cloudy and dark, but about 11 o’clock three steamers were visible within a short distance of our anchorage to the windward. Lieutenant Hopkins, of the Third, was sent off in a small boat to obtain some information in regard to these steamers. He could get no answer from them, and returned to the schooners. At daylight, on the morning of the 25th, it was observed that these steamers had on board some eight hundred or one thousand troops, effectually protected with tiers of cotton bales on both decks. It is supposed these steamers had several pieces of artillery.
Colonel Van Dorn sent a messenger, requesting an interview, which, after consultation with the officers, was granted, and at this time a large steamer from Hew Orleans came over the bar and took up a position below us. She had on board two 24-pounders and two field pieces, and probably five hundred troops. There being no further hope of our escape, I was obliged to accede to the requirements of Colonel Van Dorn, and surrender my command as prisoners of war.
On the 28th the brig Mystic arrived off the port of Saluria, bringing Lieutenant Greene and the detachment sent up on the 24th. They had been captured at Indianola. The command was then divided; the battalion of the First Infantry being assigned to the schooner Horace, that of the Eighth to the schooner TJrbana, and that of the Third Infantry to the brig Mystic. The two first named were towed over the bar on the 30th, and proceeded to sea. The brig was unable to pass the bar until the 3d of May, owing to the low water. The two schooners arrived in the harbor oi* Hew York on the 31st of May, and the brig on the 1st of June, after a rough passage of a month from the coast of Texas.
It is not necessary to speak of the accumulated hardships to which the troops have been necessarily subjected, crowded as they were upon these inconvenient, open transports, and I again take occasion to remark upon the high-toned, unwavering spirit of the officers, and the fidelity and good conduct of the enlisted men of this command. I inclose herewith a copy of the articles of capitulation;* also, copy of a letter from Maj. Larkin Smith relative to the embarkation of the troops [A]; the official report of Lieut. J. B. Greene, First Infantry [C]; a field return of the command on the 25th of April;! a copy of the parole of the officers,* and a copy of the oath taken by the enlisted men [Bj.

Sir: In compliance with verbal directions from you, I left the command on the 24th of April, then on two schooners anchored just within the bar of Passo Caballo, and with a party of two non-commissioned officers and twenty-three privates, under the command of Capt. A. W* Bowman, of the Third U. S. Infantry, proceeded to the wharf at Pow-derhorn. We left the command in the morning in the steamer Fashion, and arrived in the afternoon at the wharf at Powderhorn. Captain Bowman told me nothing as to what his orders were, but shortly after arriving at Powderhorn he directed me to proceed, in company with Lieutenant Whipple, to Lavaca, and endeavor to secure the brig Mystic, which brig had already been hired for the transportation of the command by Lieutenant Whipple, but for some cause had been kept back.
Lavaca is distant from Powderhorn sixteen miles. We left at about 6 in the evening, and returned at about 12 the same night, without being able to effect anything definite, and I learned afterwards that the brig had been seized by a band of armed men, although at that time I knew it not.
On my return to the Fashion, at about 12 at night, I was informed of the existence of a rumor that our command was to be taken prisoners. I could not find the origin of the rumor satisfactorily, and on consideration of the compact between the State of Texas and General Twiggs concerning the exit of the United States tfoops from the State, I thought the rumor an idle one. Nevertheless, willing to err on the safe side, if at all, I determined to get up steam on the Fashion and return down the

bay to the schooners. On examination I discovered that the fireman and all the hands of the steamer, as well as the engineer, had left the boat. Early the next morning I discovered a steam propeller coming down the bay, and when it came nearer I discovered that it was filled with men, surrounded by a barricade of cotton bales. I immediately * informed Captain Bowman of this fact. The steam propeller came down to the pier-head below where we were fastened, and made fast. Shortly after, a party of men, consisting of one hundred or more, came to the shore end of the pier. Captain Bowman left the steamer and went on shore. After remaining on shore about two hours or more, he returned with a paper containing a written agreement, by which the troops on the steamer were to deliver up their arms and surrender themselves “prisoners of war/7 to be at liberty to go where they chose, after swearing not to bear arms against the “Confederate States of America,77 during the now existing war between the Confederate States and the United States, unless exchanged or released. I immediately had the arms stacked, and read the agreement to the men of the command; told them they were at liberty to leave the vessel and go where they chose, as far as I was concerned, and left the ship myself.

Report of Corporal John C. Hesse, Company A, Eighth U. S. Infantry, of the rescue of the colors of his regiment, at San Antonio, Tex.
Washington, D. C., September 6,1864.
Sir : Believing that I am entitled to receive a “ medal of honor,77 as provided by the resolution of Congress under date of July 12, 1862, to provide for the presentation of medals of honor to enlisted men of the Army and volunteer forces who have distinguished or may distinguish themselves in battle during the present war, I have the honor to make the following statement:
At the outbreak of the rebellion the headquarters of the Eighth U. S. Infantry were stationed at San Antonio, Tex. 1 was a corporal of Company A of that regiment, and detailed as clerk at its headquarters. On the 23d of April, 1861, the officers and a lew enlisted men at that time present at San Antonio were taken prisoners by the rebel troops under the command of Colonel Yan Dorn. All the officers, with the exception of Lieut. Edward L. Hartz, adjutant Eighth Infantry, left a few days afterwards for the States. A few days subsequent, upon going to the former office of the regimental headquarters, the building being then in possession and under control of the rebels, I met there Lieutenant Hartz and Serg. Maj. Joseph K. Wilson, Eighth Infantry (now second lieutenant, Eighth Infantry). Our regimental colors being in the office, Lieutenant Hartz proposed to us to take the colors from the staffs, conceal them beneath our clothing, and try to carry them off. We did so. J took the torn color which the regiment had carried through the Mexican war, put it around my body under my shirt and blouse, and passed out of the building, which was strongly

guarded by the rebels. Fortunately the rebels did not suspect what a precious load we carried concealed with us, for if they had our lives would not have been worth much. We put the colors in one of Lieutenant Hartz’s trunks, and next day left San Antonio for the North. On the route we guarded the colors with our lives, always fearing that the rebels might find out what we had taken away and come after us \ but they did not, and we arrived safe with our colors on the 26th of May, 1861, in Washington City, and turned them over to the regiment.
Under these circumstances i think that I am entitled to the honor of receiving a medal, as I believe that Congress intended to award them to enlisted men who have done acts similar to mine. I therefore very respectfully request that I may receive one, believing that I have performed one of the highest duties of a soldier, having saved the colors of my regiment, and it will always be a happy day for me if I can see my regiment marching with their colors flying, and can say, u That color I have carried on my body, and have rescued it from the hands of the rebels.”

S. Army) and the State of Texas, to the effect that the

troops should leave the State, were met by a force under command of Col. Earl Van Dorn, of the Southern Confederacy, and made prisoners of war. This occurred on the 9th instant, at San Lucas Spring, fifteen miles west of San Antonio. The force under my command, comprising the garrisons of Forts Bliss, Quitman, and Davis, amounted to an aggregate, when leaving the latter post, of 320. This embraces ten officers, two hospital stewards, and twelve musicians. Colonel Bomford, Sixth Infantry, was also with the command. On the day of surrender my command numbered 270 bayonets, being thus reduced by sickness, desertions, and stragglers (some of whom have since joined) * who remained at Castro ville from drunkenness or other causes. The force opposed to me numbered, as (then variously estimated at from 1,500 to 1,700 men) since ascertained to be, was 1,370 aggregate, the total being 848 cavalry, 361 infantry, and 95 artillery, with six field pieces.
When the demand for a surrender was made, I was told that the force opposed to me was “overwhelming.” I had halted in a good position for defense, and could have been overpowered only by a greatly superior force; and as none such was before me, I declined to surrender without the presentation of such force. It was on the march, and soon came in sight, but I was not satisfied of its strength until an officer of my command was permitted to examine and report to me the character and probable number of the forces. Upon his report I deemed resistance utterly hopeless, and therefore surrendered. My command is now encamped near the head of the San Antonio River, awaiting the orders of President Davis, to whom a messenger has been dispatched by Colonel Van Dorn. The officers on duty with the command were Captain Blake, Lieutenants Bliss, Lazelle, Peck, Frank, Van Horn, and W. G. Jones, Eighth Infantry ; Lieutenant Freedley, Third Infantry, and Assistant Surgeon Peters, Medical Department. A more detailed report will be made as soon as practicable.

Sir : In connection with the report which I have this day forwarded, relating to the surrender of the battalion of the Eighth Infantry under my command to the forces of the Confederate States of America, near this place, I also present the following details of the latter part of the march, and the circumstances which determined that surrender.
This report was not transmitted with the other, as it is extremely uncertain whether any reports of an official character are permitted to pass through the post-office here or those elsewhere in the South.
On leaving Fort Bliss sufficient transportation could be procured to carry subsistence for only forty days, in which time it was expected the command would reach San Antonio, making some little allowance for detentions by the way.
At Forts Quitman and Davis stores were taken to last the commands from those posts to San Antonio, not being able to carry more with the transportation at hand. From Camp Hudson to Fort Clark persons were occasionally seen on the road who appeared to be watching our movements, but they said they belonged to rangers who had been on a scout.	'

REPORTS.

At Fort Clark, where I arrived on the 2d of May, I learned that the mails had been detained for several days to prevent me from receiving information. It was reported by a stage passenger that the officers at San Antonio had been made prisoners of war. On all these subjects there were contradictory reports, and no information could be obtained which would warrant any hostile act on my part. Such supplies as were called for were readily furnished, and offers of services were proffered by the commanding officer. This did not look much like hostility, nor did I really suspect any. The garrison had been re-enforced (being about 200 men), the post fortified to some extent, guns loaded and matches lighted on our approach; yet there did not appear any hostile intent towards us, as the explanation for all this was, that they “had heard that I had orders to attack and take Fort Clark.”
From this point rumors daily reached me, but so indefinite and contradictory as to afford no sure ground for hostile action on my part; and by taking such I could not know but I should be the first to break the treaty under which we were marching.
On reaching Uvalde on the 5th (near Fort Inge), I felt more apprehension of hostility, though rumors were still very contradictory. To attempt, from this point, to return to New Mexico for the purpose of saving the command, would have been impracticable, for I had but five days7 rations, and our transportation was too much broken down to make the march without corn (which could not be had), even if everything but subsistence and ammunition had been abandoned. Behind us was the mounted force at Fort Clark, and a large mounted force said to be at San Antonio, reported to be from 700 to 2,000. At this time the only other method of escape left was to cross the Bio Grande, this being easy of accomplishment, but of very doubtful propriety, particularly as it was yet uncertain whether we should not only break Jbhe treaty with Texas, but also compromise the United States with Mexico by crossing troops into her soil.
On the 6th, while continuing our march, we heard that those companies at the coast had been disarmed, and that in all probability we would be also on our arrival there) that there would be a force of from 2,000 to 6,000 men against us. We then had no course open to us but to proceed, and, unless overpowered by numbers, to endeavor to fight our way to the coast, with the hope that some way of escape would be opened to us. On the 7th we heard that there were not more than 700 men in San Antonio, and such a force I knew would not be able to overpower us; and still with strong hope that we might be able to advance successfully, I purchased (cn the 8th) at Castroville a small additional supply of subsistence stores (all I could), enough for two days, which included the 12th instant, but could have been made to last several days, had I a reasonable prospect of seizing more in San Antonio. Before reaching Castroville I learned that there were troops encamped on the west side of the Leon, seven miles from San Antonio; that there were cavalry, infantry, and artillery, with four guns. I encamped on the 8th on the east side of the Medina, opposite to Castroville. Late that evening I heard that the enemy would march to surround us in our camp, and I had before heard that a section of artillery was on the way down from Fort Clark, following on our rear; and there was further report that it would pass us that night on the way to San Antonio. To avoid surprise and be in possession of plenty of water, I marched that night at 12 o’clock to reach the Lioncito, six miles east of the Medina, and on my arrival there, finding no signs of the advance of the enemy, I marched on three miles farther to a point suggested

[Chap. VII.
and brought to my memory by Lieut. Z. B. Bliss, Eighth Infantry, called San Lucas Spring. There is quite a high hill a few hundred yards from the spring, having some houses, corrals, &c., which, together with the commanding position and a well of water in the yard, rendered this point a very strong one for a small command. This place is known as Allen’s Hill. It is eight miles from where the enemy was encamped, and there I made a halt to await his advance, and parked the wagon train for defense; all of which preparations were made a little after sunrise on the 9th.
About 9 o’clock two officers approached, bearing a white flag and a message from Colonel Yan Dorn, demanding an unconditional surrender of the United States troops under my command, stating that he had an “ overwhelming force.” I declined to surrender without the presentation of such a force or a report of an officer, whom I would select from my command, of its character and capacity of compelling a surrender. The advance of the enemy came in sight over a rise of ground about a mile distant, and as the whole force soon came in sight and continued in march down the long slope, Colonel Yan Dorn’s messenger returned to me with directions to say that “if that display of force was not sufficient I could send an officer to examine it.” I replied that it was “not sufficient.” I directed Lieutenant Bliss to proceed, conducted by the same messenger, to make a careful examination of the enemy. He was taken to a point so distant that nothing satisfactory could be ascertained, and he informed his conductors that he would “make no report upon such an examination.” This being reported to Colonel Yan Dorn, he permitted as close an examination as Lieutenant Bliss desired. The enemy had formed line on the low ground some half-mile in front of my position, perpendicular to and crossing the road, and neither force could be plainly seen by the other in consequence of the high bushes which intervened. Lieutenant Bliss rode the whole length of the enemy’s line within thirty yards, estimating the numbers and examining the character of his armament. He reported to me that the cavalry were armed with rifles and revolvers; the infantry with muskets (some rifle) and revolvers ; that there were four pieces of artillery, with from ten to twelve men each; that he estimated the force at 1,200 at least, and there might be 1,500 (since ascertained to be 1,400). With this force before me, an odds of about five to one, being short of provisions, having no hope of re-enforcements, no means of leaving the coast, even should any portion of the command succeed in reaching it, and with every probability of utter annihilation in making the attempt, without any prospect of good to be attained, I deemed that stubborn resistance and consequent bloodshed and sacrifice of life would be inexcusable and criminal, and I therefore surrendered.
Colonel Yan Dorn immediately withdrew his force, and permitted us to march to San Antonio with our arms and at our leisure. We arrived there on the 10th, and on the 11th an officer was sent to our camp to receive our arms and other public property, all of which was surrendered.
I will state here that we have been treated, in the circumstances of our capture, with generosity and delicacy, and harrowed and wounded as our feelings are, we have not had to bear personal contumely and insult.

REPORTS.
571
Kankakee City, III., June 18,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report my arrival at this place yesterday, the 17th instant, having come from San Antonio, Tex., with as much dispatch as the means of travel and communication would permit, leaving that place on the 4th.
I inclose herewith a copy of my report made under date of May 12,* fearing that that report did not reach your office in consequence of the disturbed state of the country and the uncertainty of the mails. I also inclose a detailed report of the latter portion of the inarch and surrender, to which reference was made in my former report. This latter report could have been long ago made had there been any reasonable prospect of its reaching you. This is the first point, where I have been able to stop, from which letters could be forwarded with safety.
I hereby report further how I happen to be here. After surrender the troops were paroled—the officers to the limits of the Confederate States of America, and the men placed under oath not to leave the county of Bexar, Texas. Up to the 4th of June Colonel Yan Dorn was expecting orders to grant unlimited paroles to the officers, and told me that he had no doubt such would be granted on return of his messenger from Montgomery. The 1st instant I received the sad, crushing intelligence of the death of my oldest daughter, and Colonel Yan Dorn at once ottered me the privilege of coming home. I availed myself of his generosity, both with the view to make arrangements for the care of my remaining children and to communicate with the War Department, in the hope of being of some service to the prisoners of war in Texas by representing their true state and condition, Kot knowing whether my reporting in person would be either desirable or proper, 1 send the following brief statement:
Up to the time I left San Antonio the troops were in quarters, and under the care and control of their own officers. They were allowed the usual subsistence and all the clothing necessary; had no restrictions as to limits, except attendance on retreat roll-call, and could be permitted to go anywhere within the county upon a written pass signed by their own officers. With the exception of some five or six they remained faithful to their Government, and refused all otters and inducements to join the Confederate service. The day before I left Colonel Yan Dorn informed me that they would be moved into camp some five miles from town, and placed under charge of Confederate officers, who would attend to their wants, thus separating them from the care of their own officers. In all this they have been as well if not much better treated than is the usual fate of prisoners of war. Their peril consists in the fact that they are retained as hostages against the rigorous treatment of any prisoners who may fall into the power of the United States. Colonel Yan Dorn does not regard the parole which is given to the officers as revocable by his Government, and their peril is not, therefore, the same as that of the men in his view of the case; therefore it is not easy to see, in the same view of the case, any good reasons for restrictions as to limits being made in the parole. The officers are furnished with quarters and board at the expense of the Confederacy, at least while they remain in San Antonio.
I shall be in Dansville, in Yew York, in a few days, where communications will reach me. Hoping that I may be justified in the course I have pursued, as represented in my reports,
I remain, sir, yours, very respectfullv,

Reports of Col. Earl Van Born, C. 8. Army, of the surrender of the JJ. S. troops in Texas, awd o/ his subsequent operations.
Headquarters Troops in Texas,
/Sow Antonio, Tex. j May 10, 1861.
General : I have the honor to report that I met the last column of the United States troops in Texas yesterday at noon, on the El Paso road, about thirteen miles from this city, and that Colonel Reeve, the commanding officer, being satisfied of my greatly superior force, surrendered unconditionally. There were ten officers and three hundred and thirty-seven men, including thirty men who were captured some time since in San Antonio, by Capt. James Duff, which I have heretofore neglected to report.
My command consisted of Colonel McCulloch’s cavalry, viz: six companies, Captains Pitts, Tobin, Ashby, Bogges, Fry, and Kelson ; a squadron of Colonel Ford’s State troops, under Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor’s command, viz, Captains Walker and Pyron; a battery of light artillery, Captain Edgar; a section of artillery, Captain Teel; two small detachments of horse, under Lieutenants Paul and Dwyer, and an independent detachment of cavalry, Captain Goode. All these troops I placed under the command of Col. H. E. McCulloch. In addition to these there was a battalion of infantry raised for the occasion in San Antonio, under command of Lieut. Col. James Duff, Captains Maverick, Wilcox, Kampman, Kavarro, and Prescott, Maj. John Carolan, in all about thirteen hundred men. I have been actuated in this instance by the same motive which induced me to bring an overwhelming forcG against the United States troops at Indianola, viz, a desire to arrest and disarm them without bloodshed.
All the arms and other public property are now being turned over to officers appointed to receive them, and the officers and men are in camp at the San Pedro Springs near this city.
Having in consideration the proclamation of the President of the United States declaring certain persons u pirates ” under the laws of the United States for seizures of vessels or goods by persons acting by authority of the Confederate States, I have determined to hold these prisoners of war until I receive further instructions from you. If the officers prefer it I shall allow them to proceed to Montgomery on parole, to report to you for your decision.
I would not do justice to the troops under my command-if I failed to report to you the admirable manner in which they conducted themselves throughout the expedition; the cheerful obedience to the orders of the officers elected over them; the discipline that was maintained in their camp, where judges, lawyers, mechanics, and laborers could be seen walking post as sentinels on the same rounds, all willing to do duty in a good cause, and at the close there was the delicacy of brave men, of soldiers, which checked everything like exultation over an unfortunate enemy whom a stern necessity had caused us to disarm. It was gratifying to me, as it is a pleasure to me to report to you, that the whole expedition passed off without one unpleasant incident.
The gentlemen who were at headquarters with me, to whom I am indebted for services cheerfully and promptly rendered, for which I owe them my thanks, were, Col. P. K. Luckett, quartermaster-general of Texas, Maj. G. J. Howard, Mr. J. T. Ward, General James Willie, Dr. H. P. Howard, Mr. R. A. Howard, Mr. D. E. Tessier, Judges Fred. Tate

General: I have the honor herewith to report my operations as commander of the troops in Texas for the last part of April and the month of May 5 also to inclose you copies of all orders issued by me, and of all letters of instructions given to officers under my command.
I respectfully refer you to my reports of the 17th and 26th of April* and the 10th of Mayf in regard to the seizure of the Star of the West, the capture of the United States troops at Saluria, under Major Sibley, and of those under Colonel Reeve, near this city, the latter now held as prisoners of war, and subject to your orders.
Col. H. E. McCulloch, in command of his regiment and a battery of light artillery, marched from this city on the 29th, under Orders No. 8, from these headquarters, and letters of instructions herewith inclosed. Five companies of Colonel Ford’s regiment, recently mustered into service, marched this morning for the torts on the Upper Rio Grande. Two more will march to-morrow for Forts Clark and Camp Wood. The dispositions of this regiment will be seen in General Orders No. 8 and letters of instructions to Colonel Ford, herewith inclosed.
I have caused to be mustered into service a company of light artillery, composed of old soldiers. The battery (four guns) is in good working condition, with an excellent, energetic, and intelligent officer in command. It is under Colonel McCulloch’s command, on Red River, to be in readiness for an emergency in that direction. There should be one also at Fort Inge, near the Rio Grande, and I shall put one in the field as soon as I can.
In view of the large number of United States troops in New Mexico and Mesilla, I have also mustered into service a company of foot artillery, composed of old soldiers, under a good officer, and put them at Fort Bliss, with instructions to throw up a small field-work, and to defend it with the six pieces of artillery now there. A company of infantry is also ordered there, besides two companies of cavalry. Colonel Ford is authorized to concentrate the troops on his line of defense. I have ordered Captain Moore, at Galveston, to muster into service a company of troops, to man and to guard the batteries at that place. One disaffected citizen, as they now stand, might spike the guns. They should be ready at all times. For the same reasons a company will be mustered into service at Pass Cavallo, near Indianola. Six pieces of heavy artillery are now on the way there from Fort Clark. It will be necessary to have quite a large infantry force on the Lower Rio Grande, especially at Fort Brown, where there are many heavy guns and a large quantity of public property, as well also as the military necessity of a force in that section of the State. I shall muster into service one regiment of infantry, including the infantry companies already mentioned and one stationed at Camp Verde.

The staff officers are doing all that can be done without money to keep their respective departments in working condition, but very soon everything must stop, unless money is received. Small sums have been borrowed from individuals from time to time, but it is now becoming absolutely necessary that the staff officers should be provided with funds.
Colonel Reeve’s command (prisoners of war) are now quartered in this city, but I shall move them into camp in a few days. They are quite an expense to us. Will you please give me some general rules in regard to the allowances, &c., of prisoners of war ?
I do not know whether or not it was the intention of the War Department that I should be continued in command in Texas. I have executed my orders in regard to the capture of the United States troops, and, at the same time that I do not wish to be considered as shrinking from any duty that may be imposed upon me in times like these, I must say that I would prefer being where I might have active service, suitable to my age and inclinations. My duties here now are entirely in the office, where an older man would be infinitely more efficient than myself.

I.	Two lines of defense for the western frontiers of Texas are hereby established: the first line to extend from Red River to the junction of the North and Main Conchas; the second line from Fort Inge to Fort Bliss. The first line will embrace the following military stations, viz: A camp on or near Red River, opposite Forts Cobb and Arbuckle, Ind. T. ; Camp Cooper, Fort Chadbourne, Camp Colorado, and camp at the junction of the North and Main Conchas. The second line will embrace the following military stations, viz: Fort Bliss, Fort Quitman, Fort Davis, Camp Stockton, Fort Lancaster, Fort Clark, Fort Inge, and Camp Wood. The first line will be garrisoned by the First Regiment of Texas Mounted Riflemen and Edgar’s battery of artillery, and will be commanded by Colonel McCulloch. The second line will be garrisoned by the Second Regiment of Texas Mounted Riflemen, Teel’s company of artillery, McCallister’s company of infantry, and a battery of artillery, and will be commanded by Colonel Ford.
II.	For the present the following assignment of troops is ordered, viz: First line, four companies of cavalry and Edgar’s battery of artillery at the camp at or near Red River,* two companies of cavalry at Camp Cooper; two companies of cavalry at Fort Chadbourne; and two companies of cavalry at the junction of the North and the Main Conchas. A detachment of cavalry from Fort Chadbourne, to consist of one lieutenant and twenty men, will be stationed at Camp Colorado, and the same number from the camp on the Concha will be stationed at Fort Mason.

ton; one company of cavalry at Fort Lancaster; two companies of cavalry at Fort Clark; one company of cavalry and a battery of light artillery at Fort Inge; one company of cavalry at Camp Wood; and one company of cavalry will be stationed at Fort McIntosh, and will, until further orders, be included in the second line.
III. Thd commanders of these lines will be held responsible for their defense against the enemies of the Confederate States, as far as it is in their power. They will therefore select the point on their lines for their headquarters, make tours of inspection whenever they may deem it necessary and advisable, assign the companies of their regiments to posts, the field officers to their duties; and they will be allowed to concentrate their commands whenever an emergency may seem to demand it, and make such suggestions from time to time in regard to a change of posts as they may see fit.
IY. The officers of the Quartermaster, Subsistence, and Ordnance Departments will take measures to arm, subsist, and give the needful transportation to give efficiency to the troops in these lineg. Officers in command of troops will make the necessary requisitions for arms, ammunition, accouterments, and for supplies of every kind necessary to put their commands in readiness for the field. The troops for the first line will be supplied with forty days’ rations ; those of the second line with a sufficient quantity to allow them to reach their posts.
Y. The movements necessary to carry out these orders will be made without delay. Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor will give the necessary orders for the assignment of the companies now in this vicinity to the second line, and will exercise command until the arrival of Colonel Ford. Colonel Ford will assume at once, upon receipt of these orders, the command of the second line, placing the next senior officer in command at Fort Brown. He will, after mustering them into the C. S. Army, assign the three companies of his regiment now on the Bio Grande to the following posts, viz: One to Fort McIntosh, one to Fort Clark, and one to Fort Inge, until otherwise directed. Colonel Ford will also continue in command of the troops on the Lower Bio Grande.

In passing through Camp Colorado you will order the company stationed there to join you, leaving in charge of that post a lieutenant and twenty men until you return. You will also direct the troops of your regiment at Fort Chadboume and Camp Cooper to join you, leaving a commissioned officer and twenty men at each of those stations to guard the property.

there it is hoped that you will be strong enough to make prisoners of war, or at least to defeat and drive off, all the United States troops you may find in the vicinity of Forts Cobb or Arbuckle. You are ordered there for that purpose. It is desirable, of course, to make them prisoners of war without bloodshed, if possible 5 but it is not essential, if to do so would cause too much delay. If you should be so fortunate as to take them prisoners of war, you will put them on parole, ration them, and give them the necessary transportation to Fort Smith, Ark., sending an escort of one company with them through the Indian Territory to Fort Smith, with letters to the commanding officer of the troops there, requesting him to see them on their way out of the country.
After accomplishing these instructions please dismiss Colonel Young’s command, return to your line of defense, and make the dispositions of your command ordered in General Orders, No. 8, from these headquarters, except that, in case of yonr success, you will remove all the public property in the three forts—Washita, Arbuckle, and Cobb—to the most convenient and defensible one, and establish there the command intended for the camp on Eed River, to guard and defend it until further ordered. Please take occasion whilst in the vicinity of Fort Cobb to hold communication, if practicable, with the leading men of the friendly tribes of Indians, and give them every assurance of our friendship and good-will.
Having the highest opinion of your ability and energy, I do not deem it at all necessary to enter further into detail in this letter of instructions. The greatest latitude is given you, and if you find it advisable in your judgment to depart in any way from those already given, do so. You know the object for which you are sent.

Headquarters Troops in Texas,
San Antonio, Tcxn May 27, 1861.
Colonel : Copies of your communications to the governor and your letter to me were duly received.* I am very much pleased with all you have done on your line. I herewith inclose you a copy of General Orders, No. 8, from these headquarters, wherein you will see the disposition of your regiment and your assignment to command. You will perceive that your command extends from Fort Bliss to Fort Inge, “ and, until the regiment of infantry is completely organized,” as far as Brazos Santiago. The battery of artillery will be sent to Fort Inge as soon as it can be got in readiness. You had better send the artillery horses now with you to Inge, as they are better adapted to that service than any of those I could have selected here from the cavalry horses. Please order all the cavalry horses and equipments turned over by the United States troops on the Rio Grande to San Antonio. Please also designate some officer of experience and discretion to receipt for all the property turned over by the State to the Confederate States at Fort Brown and Brazos Santiago, and direct him to make a complete return of the same to the chief of the staff, Major Maclin, C. S. Army. Please do the same at each one of the posts of your command.
Within a short distance of El Paso or Fort Bliss there are several hundred United States troops. I have, therefore, ordered four companies there. There are five or six pieces of artillery at Forts Davis, Quit-man, and Bliss, which I have ordered to Fort Bliss. It may be found practicable to capture the United States troops. You will perceive that you are authorized to concentrate the troops on your line of defense. If the United States troops could be surprised, they could be easily taken. If they heard of your designs, they could get out of your reach by falling back into New Mexico too far to be pursued. It is possible for them to retake Fort Bliss and all the public property before our troops can reach there.
I was very much pleased to know that you were cultivating friendly feelings with our neighbors over the river. I think it is our policy to do so, especially at this time. In regard to Cortinas, you will have a force soon that will enable you to crush him and his followers without trouble. I do not feel much apprehension from such a source when we have so many young men now in arms and eager for a fight.
I hardly anticipate any trouble at Brazos Santiago now. It is too near the yellow-fever season for our enemies of the North to venture any move in that quarter. They will not do so until fall. You will not discourage your command, of course, by giving expression to the opinion. You will select your point for headquarters. I suggest Fort Clark as the most central point on your line and most convenient to these headquarters.
You will perceive that I have ordered no company to Fort Quitman, although it is mentioned as one of the posts on your line. When everything is settled at Fort Bliss you can direct one of the companies there to garrison it. Forts Clark, Inge, and McIntosh, and Camp Wood are so near Fort Duncan that it is hardly necessary to garrison that post. It is completely enveloped. I would be pleased if you will inspect your line of defense at once, and make such suggestions as may be necessary. Before leaving Fort Brown please muster into the serv-

Report of Capt. James Duff, Texas troops, of the capture of a company of Eighth U. S. Infantry near San Antonio, Tex.
San Antonio, Tex., April 23,1861.
Major: I have the honor to report that agreeably to special orders from your headquarters I intercepted, with my company of citizen volunteers, this morning, at 6 o’clock, Capt. A. T. Lee’s company of the Eighth U. S. Infantry, under the command of Lieut. E. W. H. Read, of that regiment, and in the name of the Confederate States of America demanded the unconditional surrender of the company as prisoners of war. Mr. Read asked to be allowed to consult with his commanding officer (Colonel Waite) before making answer to my demand. To this—knowing that the colonel had no troops with which to re enforce the lieutenant’s command—I agreed, and ordered Lieutenant French, of my company, to accompany him to Colonel Waite’s quarters.
On his (Lieutenant Read’s) return he complied with my demand to surrender, at the same time protesting against my action as being in violation of the treaty stipulations entered into by the authorities of the State of Texas and General Twiggs. The enlisted men of the company are now under my charge. Lieutenant Read will report in person at your office this morning at 10 o’clock.
In making this report, permit me to draw your attention to the great desire evinced by the citizens composing the company which I have the honor to command to show to the world that if we have been hitherto divided in sentiment, we are now, when danger and war threaten us, united. In proof of this I would state that within forty hours from the receipt of the proclamation of war by the Northern Government, and in obedience to a call made by Colonel Van Dorn, they had enrolled their names, organized the company by the election of officers, received one hundred stand of arms and accouterments, sworn allegiance to the State of Texas and the Confederate States of America, and cheerfully obeyed and carried out the first order issued to them as a company—the ‘disarming a company of United States troops.
I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,

In cases of political disturbance, involving local conflict with the authority of the General Government, the General-in-Chief considers that the military questions, such as you suggest, contain a political element, with due regard to which, and in due deference to the chief executive authority, no extraordinary instructions concerning them must be issued without the consent of such authority.

He has labored hard in suggesting and urging proper measuies to vindicate the laws and protect the property of the United States without waging war or acting offensively against any State or community. All such suggestions, though long since made in good time to have been peaceably and efficiently carried out, have failed to secure the favorable attention of the Government.
The President has listened to him with due friendliness and respect, but the War Department has been little communicative. Up to this time he lias not been shown the written instructions of Major Anderson, nor been informed of the purport of those more recently conveyed to Fort Moultrie verbally by Major Buell.
Probably the policy of the Government in regard to the forts and depots within the limits of seceding States will have been clearly indicated before events can have caused a practical issue to be made up in Texas.
The General does not see at this moment that he can tender you any special advice, but leaves the administration of your command in your own hands, with the laws and regulations to guide, in the full confidence that your discretion, firmness, and patriotism will effect all of good that the sad state of the times may permit.

Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia will certainly secede. As for coercion, that I consider impossible to keep them in the Union. A guard would have to be put at every house in the country, and that would not keep them in the Union. The feeling is universal, and the people are determined to secede. Coercion might have done at first; now it cannot. As soon as I know Georgia has separated from the Union I must, of course, follow her.
I most respectfully ask to be relieved in the command of this department on or before the 4th of March next. All I have is in the South, and as my health will not allow me to take an active part in the scenes that will probably be enacted, I must be a looker-on.

All is quiet in my department (except the Comanches). No attempt has been made to interfere with the public property. All that has been done has been in the Department of the East; and where was the redoubtable hero that boasted he had two hundred thousand men on hand to regulate the South? Yerily, military men should be cautious how they threaten the people. After secession I know not what will be done. I know one thing, and that is, I will never fire on American citizens.

Commanding Department of Texas:
My Dear General: The present pressure of important events necessarily induces prompt action on the part of all public functionaries. In this view of the matter I send to you General J. M. Smith, of this State, on a confidential mission, to know what, in the present crisis, you consider [it] your duty to do as to maintaining in behalf of the Federal Government or passing over to the State the possession of the forts, arsenals, and public property within this State, and also if a demand for the possession of the same is made by the executive, you are authorized, or [if] it would be conformable to your sense of duty, to place in possession of the authorities of the State the forts, arms, munitions, and property of the Federal Government, on the order of the executive, to an officer of the State empowered to receive and receipt for the same.
This course is suggested by the fact that information has reached the executive that an effort will be made by an unauthorized mob to take forcibly and appropriate the public stores and property to uses of their own, assuming to act on behalf of the State.
Any arrangements made with you by General Smith will be sanctioned and approved by me; and should you require any assistance to aid you in resisting the contemplated and unauthorized attack upon the public property, &c., and to place the same in possession of the State authorities, you are authorized to call on the mayor and citizens of San Antonio for such assistance as you may deem necessary.
I will hope to hear from you, general, through my confidential agent. General Smith, so soon as he can have the honor of a conference with you on matters embraced in the present epoch of our national affairs.
I am, general, yours, very truly,
SAM. HOUSTON.

By order of the Secretary of War:
S. COOPER,
Adjutant- General.
Headquarters Camp Verde, Tex.,
January 28, 1861.
Assistant Adjutant-General,
Department of Texas, San Antonio, Tex.:
Sir: The intelligence communicated in Special Orders, No. 10, from Department Headquarters, and the many rumors in circulation, would seem to admonish every officer who has the care of public property to adopt such measures as may be necessary to protect it from lawless violence, so far as the means at his command will permit. In this view of my duties as commanding officer of a post, and for the purpose of making some defensive arrangements, I have deemed it proper to order the remainder of Captain Brackett’s company to this place, without waiting for further instructions from your office. All the supplies for that company are drawn from this post, and the grazing in this vicinity is as good as that at Camp Ives. Captain Brackett’s company has always been under the control of the commanding officer at this camp for all military operations, and I am not aware of any particular reason for keeping it at Camp Ives.
This camp is spread over much ground, and is the most ill-chosen and least defensible site I have ever seen selected for any military purposes. It is on ground that slopes down to Verde Creek, a stream that is fordable every few yards, and every part is exposed to the high ground on the other side, which is within short rifle range, and which completely commands it. To defend this position I have a company of cavalry armed with carbines—an arm of short range and pot of much accuracy in firing. A body of riflemen, under the cover afforded on the opposite bank of the creek, a little beyond the range of our arms, could in a few hours kill a large number of our animals and inflict much injury on this command, while the troops would be comparatively powerless.
This camp can only be defended, without suffering much loss, by infantry, with the long-range musket or by having artillery. Not having infantry, I respectfully request that one or two pieces of artillery— say 6-pounders, or two mountain howitzers, with a supply of spherical-case shot, canister, and round shot, together with the necessary implements (port-fire, slow-match, &c.)—may be sent here as early as practicable.
In making this application I assume that there is a probability, or at least a possibility, that a mob of reckless men may attempt to seize the public property here, the most valuable of which consists of fifty-three camels. I persume they are worth some $20,000. Whether there are any grounds for fearing an attack you know better than myself. In this isolated place we get but lit tle ^correct information of what is pass-

ing in Texas, and many of the rumors that reach us are no doubt greatly exaggerated. In the present feverish state of the public mind, however, it is impossible to say how far men may go, especially among such a population as is to be found in Texas, and I hold it to be the duty of every commanding officer to be at all times and under all circumstances prepared as far as possible for any and every emergency. To this end he must anticipate his wants, and take timely measures to meet them; hence the main reasons for making this application. I think there never has been any artillery at this post.

San Antonio, February 4, 1861. To the Commanding- Officer of each post in the Department of Texas:
Sir : I am directed by the commanding general of the department to address you as follows:
The secession act has passed the Convention of this State, to take effect the 2d day of March next. Nothing has been heard at these headquarters as to the disposition of the troops. The general commanding has made five applications for orders or intimation from Washington as to what is to be done, but has received no answer.
You will therefore continue to do duty as usual until further orders, but prepare to move at a short notice, reducing the baggage as much as possible. If the general commanding knew at this time how the troops are to be disposed of, you would be informed, but he does not. He will, however, remain with them until something is done, and attend to their comfort as far as circumstances will permit.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. A. NICHOLS, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Col. C. A. Waite, First Infantry,
Commanding Department of Texas, San Antonio, Tex. ;
Sir : As notified the 4th instant, a steamer will sail in a few days from New York for Brazos Santiago, calling at Indianola to send you these dispatches, for the five companies of artillery serving on the Rio Grande. It is expected that all of these companies will be at the place of embarkation. On the arrival of the steamer there will be no time lost in getting the troops to their ultimate destination.
To facilitate the movement, Maj. Fitz John Porter, assistant adjutant-general, will proceed in the steamer to carry out the instructions of the General-in-Chief. He will be supplied with $40,000, to pay for the hire of lighters, &c., should it be found necessary.
The light batteries will leave their horses, but bring out their guns. A medical officer will embark with the troops.
I have, &c.,

P. S.—February 11.—Should French’s battery have been ordered to San Antonio, the steamer will not be delayed any time for it.

Preliminary thereto, you will at once concentrate the troops in sufficient bodies to protect their march out of the country at central points on the proper lines of march. The following stations now occupied seem to be the best adapted for the purpose:	'
1. Fort Stockton, on the overland mail route, where it is joined by the stage route from San Antonio, for the posts of Camps Hudson and Lancaster, Forts Davis, Quitman, and Bliss—a rendezvous of ten companies Of infantry.

[Chap. V33.
2.	Fort Clark, for Fort McIntosh, Kinggold Barracks, and other posts on or near the Lower Rio Grande—a rendezvous for some three companies of cavalry and ten of infantry.
3.	San Antonio, for the troops there in depot, and at Fort Inge—a rendezvous, as at present known, of one company of cavalry and two of infantry, but probably strengthened by additional companies from other stations.
4.	Camp Cooper, or Fort Belknap, on the overland mail route, for the troops at Forts Chadbourne and Mason, Camps Colorado and Ives—a rendezvous for six companies of cavalry and three of infantry.
The lines of march from these centers would probably all be on Fort Arbuckle, through Fort Belknap, and thence through the Indian country, and west of the State of Arkansas, to Fort Leavenworth. These lines of march will, of course, not be regarded as fixed, but be varied by you according as you may judge proper.
It is supposed that at each post there is a sufficiency of transportation for the baggage and supplies of the troops, but all the transportation within the department, including the camels, must be put in requisition to make the movement to bring out all the supplies and public property if possible. You will readily see that the private baggage of officers and men must be brought down to the lowest point. Whatever property it may be necessary to leave in the State will be put in possession of officers of the Quartermasters Department, to be shipped by water to Hew York. So far as water transportation can with safety be made available,' you will prefer it for such public property as lies convenient to the coast.	•
I have, &c.,
L. THOMAS.
P. S.—Timely measures will be taken here to meet the northern movements of troops with supplies and forage, to be forwarded from the Missouri River, in the direction of the Arkansas, say, to some point on or near the Cherokee Country.

Dear Colonel : There have been a good many rumors afloat in regard to the disposition General Twiggs intends making of the troops of this department, in the event of the secession of the State of Texas. It is possible this may have reached the War Department. These reports are to the effect that it is the intention of the commanding general of the department to turn over to the State authorities all the Federal property within the borders of the State, on the requisition of the governor, and it is stated on good authority, or what is here considered good authority, that the general has so written to the governor.

[Chap. VII.
There have also been rumors of an intended concentration of the troops at San Antonio, with a view to their disbandment. Lieutenant Graham, of my company, recently joined from leave of absence, informs me that in passing through, New Orleans he was advised by Colonel Myers, son-in-law of General Twiggs, not to join his company; that the troops in Texas would not be allowed to leave the State, and that the general had been written to, or that there was a plan to concentrate the troops at San Antonio, to give all the officers who desired it permission to leave the department, and then to notify the President that he held the Army in Texas for the Southern republic.
I have just received two orders from the headquarters of the department (of which I inclose copies, lest you should not have received them),* and these orders, in conjunction with all the reports above referred to, leave so decided an impression on my mind that some unauthorized disposition of the troops is in contemplation, that I think I will be justified in refusing to move my command from this post on the order of General Twiggs, unless I am satisfied that he is acting under the orders of the General-in-Chief or the War Department.
It will, of course, be extremely unpleasant to disobey an order from department headquarters, but you will perceive therein an intention is foreshadowed of moving the troops, and at the same time an admission that no orders have been received.
If an order is issued moving this command, I will believe that it is issued in bad faith to the Government, and I do not think I ought to hesitate to disobey it. I hope, however, that I will hear from you, either officially or unofficially. The vote in this State on the question of secession will be taken on the 23d, and it is not probable that the result of the vote can be ascertained and disclosed before six weeks. Many of the precincts, such as El Paso, are very remote, so that, until the disclosed vote of the people is ascertained, the State, although nominally out of the Union on the 2d of March next, is not really so.
I presume that the policy of the incoming administration will be developed immediately after the 4th of March, and if you will write me by the 8th of March, your letter will reach New Orleans in time for the steamer of the 15th of that month.
There are reports, too, of official letters being opened, and I would suggest that your letter be sent under an unofficial envelope.
Should it be the intention of the department to withdraw these troops, after the secession of the State of Texas, of course it is obvious that Brazos Santiago is the port where to embark.
Yery truly, yours,
B. H. HILL, Captain, First Artillery.

P. S.—The steamer Arizona has just arrived at Brazos. She brings intelligence that the steamer General Busk was about to leave Galveston with several hundred men to seize Brazos Santiago and the ordnance stores there. She was directed (the Arizona) by her owners to delay twenty-four [hours] at Indianola, in order that the Busk should reach Brazos in advance of her. I have apprehended some lawless attack on Brazos, and a short time ago sent down an officer and twelve men. There is a large quantity of ordnance stores and ordnance

there. I cannot bring it to this post at present from the want of transportation, and under all the circumstances of the case, and upon consultation with Captain Stoneman and those officers in whose judgment I have confidence, I have determined to destroy these stores. I have not time to write you officially, but this steamer brings us intelligence (unofficial) that a steamer has been sent to withdraw the artillery command 5 and to insure our communication we must have the control of Brazos Santiago. There is also a rumor that a command of Texas troops is on its march from Indianola, and it is prudent not to scatter my command ) and if the ordnance stores at Brazos are destroyed or rendered unserviceable, there will be no necessity of retaining a detachment at that point.

Sir : Information has reached these headquarters that three of the companies of the Eighth Infantry which have been serving in the Department of New Mexico (and by recent orders transferred to this department) have not left that department. In view of the present position of matters connected with this State, of which you have all the requisite information, I am directed by the commanding officer of this department to request that you will immediately communicate with the commanders of those companies, and direct them not to come within the limits of the State of Texas, but to remain within the limits of the Territory of New Mexico until they shall receive orders from higher authority. Please furnish the commander of the Department of New Mexico with a copy of this communication, and also each company commander herein referred to.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The commissioners on the part of the State of Texas having turned over to the Quartermaster’s Department twenty-six wagons and teams for the movement of the troops on the line above Fort Clark, those posts, viz, Fort Bliss, Fort Quitman, Fort Davis, Fort Stockton, Fort Lancaster, and Camp Hudson, will be evacuated by their garrisons in the following manner : The most remote garrison will move first, and the garrison of each succeeding post two days after the passage of the command which precedes it. They will direct their march upon Indianola, where transports will be in readiness for their embarkation. The troops will march with their arms and ammunition, the necessary clothing and camp equipage, and, as the means of transportation are limited, no extra baggage will be allowed. Lieut. Henry W. Freedley, Third Infantry, is appointed acting assistant quartermaster of the train. Special instructions will be given to him. Agents on the part of the State will be sent up to the several posts to receive the public property.

Major : I have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders, I forwarded General Orders, No. 5, of February 18, 1861, and the circular of the commissioners, to Camp Colorado on the 21st instant, by a corporal and three privates.
When about twenty miles from this post, they were taken prisoners by the State troops, under command of Capt. A. B. Burleson, the orders opened and read, the men dismounted, and made to walk about sixty miles out of their way, their horses being ridden by some of Captain Burleson’s men.
Captain Burleson then thought i: advisable to send the orders forward. Accordingly, he released the corporal and one private and ordered them to proceed to Camp Colorado; he, however, detained two privates as prisoners for several days, sending one of their horses to Austin, ridden by one of his men, on express.
After detaining the two men for several days, he released them. The entire party reached this post late last night.

Camp on Bichland, February 24, 1861. Captain Johnson: I send to Fort Mason this morning two of you* men that I have had in custody, and in doing what I have done 1 think I have acted right, and I think the commissioners on the part of the State of Texas are a set of jackasses in allowing the regular troops in leaving Texas with their arms; and, to be plain with you, if I had a sufficient force I would make all of you lay down your arms in short order, and if I can get men I will yet do it. One of the United States horses that I took I have sent an express to Austin on him, and when he returns I will send him to you if you have not left, and in that case I will turn him over to some of the United States officers. In conclusion, allow me to thank you for the kind treatment I received whilst at Fort Mason from you.

Headquarters Camp Colorado,
Texas, February 25,1861. Captain Johnson* Commanding Fort Mason:
Sir: I have seen a letter from Captain Burleson, Texas Rangers, to Captain Smith, Second Cavalry, of this post, saying that he had arrested your expressman en route for this place, opened the documents and letters, detained some of the property in his hands, and that he was acting under my orders. Captain Burleson was not called into the service by me, does not belong to my command properly, and I have given him no orders to interfere with any movement on this frontier. I did write to Captain Burleson to know if he would co operate with me on the frontier and in all my service, and asked him to answer me at once, which he has never done, and should he have answered in the affirmative, should have given him orders^ but certainly not to arrest the express from one of your posts to another. I regret the indiscretion of Captain Burleson very much, and am sorry to be compelled, in order to place myself right, to cast the blame upon him; but I cannot permit injustice to be done myself in order to shield another.
Captain Burleson is a young officer, and I have no doubt thought he was acting for the good of his State, and am sorry he should have been io indiscreet.
Very respectfully, &c.,

TJ. 8. Army, Commanding the Department of Texas:
Sir : If the number of troops under orders to leave Texas and not yet embarked, or, if embarked, still within your call, be sufficient, you will immediately form a strongly-intrenched camp at some suitable point-convenient to and covering the post of Indianola, of not less than five hundred, but preferably of twelve hundred, men, and hold the same against hostile Texans until further orders.
With the troops you will retain your means of transportation, with all the subsistence that can be spared from the steamers sent from New York to Texas for the reception of troops, together with one of those steamers for a time—the one on which the United States will have to pay the least damage—and discharge the other steamers. And if there be one or (preferably) two companies not needed for the above camp, you will send such company or companies by the steamers to Key West, to occupy the barracks on that island. If there be still a surplus of troops beyond those objects, they will proceed to New York in the steamers. The objects of the intrenched camp near Indianola are, first, to keep

a foothold in that State till the question of secession on her part be definitely settled among her own people, and, second, in case of conflict between them, to give such aid and support to General Houston or other head of authority in the defense of the Federal Government as may be within your power, without imminent peril to your command or to some considerable portion thereof.
This restriction alludes to advances and co-operation in the interior too far for a probable safe return to your base of operations, but it is not intended to prevent you from taking reasonable war risks in order to afibrd the permitted support.
You will communicate as freely as practicable with General Houston or other leader of the Union party, and comply with his wishes or suggestions, if practicable, within the above restriction,* of which you, on your responsibility, will be the judge.
A field battery and some heavier guns, together with subsistence and other necessaries, will be sent to you as your wants may become known.
For the use of your quartermaster and commissary of subsistence there will be deposited in time to your credit, with the assistant treasurer, New York, fifty thousand dollars, which you will draw out as may be needed by those disbursing officers.
"It is expected that you will lose no opportunity of communicating with the Adjutant-General everything of interest that may occur to your command or in connection with these instructions.
With great confidence in your zeal, energy, and judgment, I remain, yours, respectfully,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—If on the receipt of this duplicate it should be well known that neither Governor Houston nor any other executive authority of Texas has any considerable number of men up in arms in defense of the Federal Government in that State (and you may detain the steam transports some days for satisfactory information on this point), you will consider the foregoing instructions as withdrawn; all except what relates to the two companies to be landed for the occupation of the barracks on Key West.

Colonel : I have the honor to report for the information of the General-in-Chief that I arrived here and assumed command of this department on the 22d instant. I feel it to be my first duty to call his attention at once to the condition of affairs which i find existing throughout this Territory. The expeditions against the Comanches and the Navajos have caused the loss of a very large portion of the means of transportation, and the secession of the State of Texas has involved an additional heavy loss to this department of subsistence stores, of transportation, and of funds.
By the mail of to-day I have received a report from Maj. Isaac Lynde, commanding Fort McLane, a copy of which I inclose for the information of the General-in-Chief, and by the same mail I am informed of a plan1 laid by the people about Albuquerque to possess themselves of the Government stores at that depot. The people in every portion of the Territory are beginning to refuse to credit the Government. The troops are-

becoming uneasy and restless about tbeir pay, and unless they can be assured at a very early day that they will be paid off, very serious consequences may result.
The great scarcity of means of transportation and the difficulty of hiring it must necessarily cramp the field operations now commencing against the Apaches and render long marches impossible, except for a small body of troops. I earnestly request, therefore, that I may receive at the earliest possible moment the means of paying off the troops and other creditors of the Government, or instructions for my guidance, and additional means of transportation in case it may not be possible to send the funds now imperatively required.

Headquarters Department of New Mexico, Santa Fe:
Sir: I have the honor to report that the public ox-train of fifteen wagons from Albuquerque that I reported as having been attacked by Indians at Cook’s Spring arrived at this place, and after refitting left for Fort Buchanan on the 25th of February.
On the 5th of March I received reliable information that a party of desperate men from the mines, at the instigation of Mr. Kirk, wagon-master, had left for the purpose of taking the train and running it into Sonora and selling it. I have ascertained beyond a doubt that they have succeeded; that the train took the road to Janos, the nearest point in Mexico, and had crossed the line before I received the first report. I have also received information that the inhabitants of the mines have formed a plan to attack this post; to capture the public property; take all the arms, &c., from us. They hope to surprise us; but in that they will be mistaken. I shall defend the post unless overpowered by numbers. Their object is plunder, and the report states that when they have captured us they intend to take all the stock of the overland mail. I believe such an attack will be made, and they may get some of our animals, as we must send them out to graze.
I shall keep my command here, and cannot furnish escorts, as I shall have no men to spare if this attack is made with their whole force. I consider the preservation of the public property of the first importance. Very respectfully, &c.,

Hdqrs, Green Lake, Tex., April 7,1861—12 m. Richard A. Howard, Agent of State of Texas:
Sir : I have just received yours of the 6th instant. Neither General Twiggs nor Colonel Waite had any idea of embracing the company arms in their orders designating the property to be delivered to the State authorities. This I am positive is the fact. Were it otherwise, I am not the person to decide such a point. It is strange that the commissioners should instruct you to call on me with such a demand, when they have the commander of the department in their city.
General Orders, No. 5, of February 18, the circular of the Texas commissioners of same date, and General Orders, No. 8, of February 28, sustain my position. The latter also designates the place where the demand has to be made. I must answer your letter by respectfully denying your premises.

Total, 455. This number may be increased ten by the detached men and laundresses on the way.
There will be no necessity for any company here from the departure of the Star of the West to the arrival of the companies of the Eighth Infantry from the upper posts ; therefore I add my company. It may be necessary that an officer should remain to answer communications, &c. I can stay. The company had better go with Captain Jordan to New York Harbor, where I have no doubt the second lieutenant is waiting for it; but as Lieutenant Jones is here there may be no necessity for my remaining, as there will be no other arrival of troops until the last come. I suppose it will be best to dispatch the Star of the West with the troops named above. I await your answer communicating the wishes of the colonel. I repeat, I am willing to remain myself. My company going will make so much more room in the last transport. The property will all be in the hired house, where I, Lieutenant Jones, and the non-commissioned officers employed by him, can look after it. It will be secure. Captain Granger arrived this morning.

You will please explain to the chiefs that he regrets his inability to confer with them in person, but, as other important public considerations detain him here, he sends you to talk to them, because he believes they are really anxious for peace, and he wishes them to understand as soon as possible the terms upon which he is willing to suspend active hostilities, which are as follows:
I.	They must agree to discontinue their depredation upon the property and lives of the people of the United States, of this Territory, of Kansas, of Texas, and of all others entitled to the protection of the Government.
II.	That the whole nation will be held responsible for the acts of any of its members, so that when any of their bad young men steal from or molest any of the people, as above specified, under the protection of the Government, the troops will be again sent against the nation, and will attack any portion of it wherever found, unless they promptly make restitution for the property taken or destroyed and give up to the military authorities the marauders.
III.	They must keep away from the vicinity of the settlements on the Gallenos, Pecos, Red River, and all other settlements of this Territory $ and when they desire to trade or talk with the authorities they must come to Fort Union for the purpose.
IY. They must be made to understand that no persons whatever are authorized to negotiate with them about peace or war except the military commander and his officers or the superintendent of Indian affairs and his agents, and that if they listen to any other people, or act upon what they tell them, they will get into trouble by it.
Y. They must be particularly enjoined against acting in a troublesome or threatening manner towards the United States mail on the Independence roads and all pa ssengers or trains passing and repassing over those roads, and advised that it will be prudent for them to keep away from those roads as much as they can.
YI. Explain to them that the Great Father at Washington thinks of establishing a military post on the Canadian River, and somewhere in the vicinity of where you are to hold your conference with them; that he has not yet said whether it must be established there or not, but if he says so it will be done, and then that will be the place for them to come to trade or to talk with the military authorities, instead of Fort Union.
YII. If they seem honestly desirous to behave peaceably and to observe the above injunctions, you may grant them an armistice for ninety days, to enable them to prove by their acts their good intentions, and at the end of that time another talk will be held with them, provided they have acted in good faith, and peace will be made with them.
In conducting these negotiations the department commander recommends to you to confer freely with the superintendent of Indian affairs, who proposes to be present and will be associated with you in these negotiations. And he also recommends to your respectful consideration any information or opinions, as to the temper of these Indians or their relations with the people of the Territory, which may be offered to you by Lieut. A. McRae, of the Rifles, whose opportunities for observing them have been very good, while his excellent intelligence and judgment render his opinions upon all subjects valuable.

The Mescaleros have sued for peace, seem disposed to refrain from future hostilities against the settlements, and I have, therefore, suspended the further operations of the expedition, and relieved Colonel Crittenden from its command.
On the 13th instant a council was held with the Comanche chiefs near the Pecos Biver, in which the United States was represented by Capt. B. A. Wainwright, U. S. Ordnance Corps, and the superintendent of Indian affairs, as commissioners, while six of the prominent chiefs of the Comanches, including their head chief, represented that tribe. It resulted in granting an armistice of ninety days to the Comanches, at the end of which time, if they conduct themselves peaceably, another council will be held with them with a view to making a treaty of peace.
There seems no reason to apprehend any immediate disorder in this Territory. The troops are subordinate and quiet, and if I can procure their payment at an early day I shall feel no apprehension of trouble with them.
The people of the Territory continue tranquil enough. There are rumors of proposed political movements, but I do not anticipate any serious outbreak or revolution.
Notwithstanding the instructions from the Paymaster-General to Major Seward, I have felt compelled to send him up to pay the troops at Fort Stanton.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
W. W. LOBING,
Brevet Colonel, U. S. Army, Commanding Department.

Santa F:£, N. Mex., June 11,1861. The Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, City of New YorJc:
Sir : I have the honor to report that Colonel Loring, of the Eegiment of Mounted Eiflemen, in anticipation of the acceptance of his resignation, left this place to-day, after placing me in the general charge of the affairs of the department and in the immediate command of the Northern District. He has not yet formally relinquished the command, and will await at Fort Fillmore the action of the President upon the tender of his resignation.
I have no reason to apprehend any immediate political trouble in this department, and in the future this will be contingent upon the action of Missouri, with which the people of this Territory are more intimately connected in their commercial relations and associations than with Texas or the neighboring States of Mexico.
The disaffection in Arizona is, in my judgment, confined to a small portion of the people of that Territory, and the disaffected are believed to be without the means of effecting anything against the Government, as they have recently and repeatedly applied for the assistance of the troops in settling their local difficulties. A demonstration against Arizona by the people of Texas may be apprehended, and, although nothing is known here of any contemplated movement in that direction, I will take measures to increase materially the force at Fort Fillmore by transferring a portion of the troops from the interior posts, and, if possible, an additional mounted force from the upper country.
The long-deferred payment of the troops in Arizona, aided by the mischievous efforts of some individuals in that country, have created some dissatisfaction among the troops at some of the posts; but this will be removed at an early period by the payment of a portion of the arrearages now due. The funds in the hands of the paymasters will not be sufficient to pay the whole amount, but will leave from four to six months still unpaid at the posts in Arizona. It is hoped that a sufficiency of funds to meet these arrearages will soon be received. Major Eeynolds will pay the troops at Fort Fillmore; Major Seward those at Forts McLane, Breckinridge, and Buchanan; and Captain Wain-wright, Ordnance Department, those at Fort Fauntleroy.
Major Eeynolds, I think, contemplates resigning, which will leave but one paymaster, Major Seward (now under orders for Washington), in the department. It is respectfully recommended that two or three additional paymasters be sent out as soon as practicable.
I think it proper to refer to the disabled condition of the mounted companies from the want of horses, and of the Quartermasters Department from the want of draught animals. The past two years have been seasons of great scarcity, almost famine, throughout the whole of New Mexico. The scarcity of water, grass, and forage, and constant hard service have destroyed a large proportion of the animals in the service of the Government. The same causes have operated to reduce the number in the possession of private individuals, so that the supply necessary to place the troops in this department in an effective condition cannot be procured here, and I respectfully recommend that the 'estimates heretofore made for remounts and for draught animals may be filled from the East.
Yery respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,
ED. E. S. CANBY,

New Orleans, La., February 19,1861. Hon. John Perkins, Jr., Montgomery, Ala.:
Dear Sir : Availing myself of your suggestion, I will trouble you with a few lines on a subject I consider important to our President. I have a confidential communication this morning from an old classmate in Texas, the commander of a fine battery of light artillery, in high condition. He is very anxious about his status; says he can and will bring over his whole command if it will be received. A large portion of the troops in Texas, he thinks, can be relied on in the same way; but their great fear is an attempt on the part of Texas to disarm them. Wound a soldier’s honor in this way, and he will fight for it against his friends. Might they not be invited into our service*? They consider their allegiance as gone, their obligations no longer binding.
We are getting on well in our organization, and strengthening our defenses rapidly; still we are not in condition for a war; but neither are our enemies. A number of young officers of the Regular Army are coming in, and our jmudent governor is appointing them in preference. To get clear of bad subjects, who come well recommended, he allows me to bring them before a military board to be examined. The importance of this subject must excuse this hasty note, just as I am leaving to see the governor at Baton Rouge.
Yours, most respectfully,
BRAXTON BRAGG.
War Department, Montgomery, February 23, 1861.
To the Delegates from Texas to the Congress of the Confederate States:
Gentlemen : In response to the communication submitted by you to the President in relation to the military complications in your State, he has instructed me to say that he appreciates the embarrassments of your position, and in his anxiety to remove them is disposed to assume every responsibility compatible with the relations of this Government to the State of Texas; but, as you are aware, this Government has no official notification of the secession of your State from the Government of the United States, and until this occurs, however hopeful the President may be of the result of the reference of the action of your Convention to the popular vote, you will readily perceive that this Government could not assume formal jurisdiction over the questions submitted by you. The President, however, instructs me to say that he considers it due to international courtesy that the Government of the Confederate States, Texas included, after her withdrawal from the United States, should accord to the troops belonging to that Government a reasonable time within which to depart from her territory. The probability is that the Government of the-United States would not be inclined to keep these troops within your territory after the secession of your State. Should it be otherwise, the President does not hesitate to say that all the powers of this Government shall be promptly employed to expel them.
Meantime it is considered by the President, under the circumstances, that it would be proper in the authorities of Texas to suspend any attack upon the forts, arsenals, or other military occupations of the Government- of the United States within her territory, as this Government is

charged with the power to negotiate and to conduct all military operations. It may be proper to add that, deeming it probable a portion of the officers and men belonging to the Army of the United States now stationed in Texas may, after the secession of your State, consider their allegiance due rather to this Government than to the Government of the United States, and under the influence of this sentiment may feel inclined to acknowledge that allegiance by reporting themselves here, I do not doubt the disposition of this Government to receive them favorably. The special facts, however suggestive of this belief, are better known to yourselves than to this Department, and you will, I doubt not, communicate them to the authorities of your State.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.
New Orleans, February 25,1861.
His Excellency Jeff. Davis :
We have reliable information that the United States troops from Texas are to pass through this city. Shall they be allowed to land? A large number of the officers and men can probably be secured for your service. Please advise me on the subject. General Twiggs was ordered to turn over the command to Colonel Waite, a Northern man, but preferred surrendering to Texas.
BRAXTON BRAGG, Major-General, Commanding.
War Department, Montgomery, February 25,1861. Braxton Bragg, Major-General, Commanding, New Orleans:
Sir: Your dispatch of this date to the President has been received, and in reply he instructs me to say that the question submitted for consideration is not altogether free from difficulty. The circumstances of the case are peculiar and exceptional, and must be disposed of in a spirit of liberal courtesy. It seems, therefore, to the President, if there was a formal capitulation by the troops of the United States or an informal understanding with the authorities of Texas upon which they acted either in the surrender or abandonment of the forts, that they should have peaceful exit through the territories of the Government. This understanding should be carried out in good faith, upon their verbal assurance that their sole object is to reach the territory of the United States, and not to disturb the property or peace of any of the States of this Government through which they may pass, or to possess or occupy any of the forts, arsenals, or other property of this Government within these States. Should this assurance be refused, it will be your duty to arrest their progress, and keep them below Forts Jackson and Saint Philip until further ordered.
The President instructs me to add that he has entire confidence in your discretion and prudence, and feels satisfied that whilst you scrupulously guard the honor and rights of this Government, you will do no act unnecessarily to precipitate a war. Should any of the officers or men desire to enlist in the service of this Government, it would be proper and right, and altogether acceptable, to receive them.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

San Antonio, Tex., February 25,1861.
Hon. John H. Reagan:
Dear Sir: Inclosed you will find the order of General Twiggs.* I send it that you may see what sort of spirit prevails in the Army here, from General Twiggs down, with one or two exceptions. They will do nothing to benefit the South. This order itself is an insult to the commissioners and the people of the State; besides, is calculated to make a wrong impression, and mislead everybody in regard to the terms of the agreement between the commissioners and General Twiggs, which are, they are simply allowed to leave the State by way of the coast, with their arms, two batteries of light artillery being taken as the arms belonging to that branch of the service. Many of the officers, who are Southern men, say they will not serve Mr. Lincoln, yet they will neither resign nor do anything else to assist the section that gave them birth. I hope the Southern Confederacy will aid them as little in future as they are helping her now. What good will their resignations do the South after they have kept their commands embodied and turn them over with arms in their hands to Lincoln, to be placed in some Southern garrison on our coast, or otherwise used to coerce the Southern people? This force ought to be disorganized before it leaves this State. Jf the Southern Confederacy intends raising a regular army, these men ought to be enlisted into her service at once. Let recruiting officers be sent forthwith to this place, Indianola, and Brownsville, or the mouth of the Rio Grande, with the necessary funds to pay the proper bounty, and you may depend upon it Mr. Lincoln will never get many of them to leave this State. I shall urge the Convention to take prompt action to defend our frontiers. Some of the cavalry regiments would do for that service; the infantry would do for those passes on the Rio Grande; yet such men don’t wish to go into service unless it was permanently. This the State cannot offer. One year, if not sooner discharged, is the terms she will offer. It suits volunteers. The arms we get from the Federal Government are not such as will be of much use to the State, particularly in defending her frontiers. We ought to purchase some for that particular service. The Colt pistol and the Morse altered gun are the best, if we can get them. I propose, if Virginia secedes, to go at once to her and get, if possible, those Morse guns that are at Harper’s Ferry, and get them here in time to be placed in the hands of the men who have to march against the Indians.
If you think worth while, show this letter to the other delegates. I wrote Colonel Wigfall yesterday. Sergeant Spangler will make an excellent recruiting officer for Indianola. He is in the Second Cavalry, ai)d wishes to remain in the State. Money must be had to effect much with these men.
Yours, truly,

In advance of the organization of tlie regular army, the Congress of the Confederate States have passed an act u to raise provisional forces,” and to obviate the necessity of a detailed explanation of its provisions I herewith inclose you a copy of the act.
The regular army bill has been introduced into Congress, but will not pass for some days to come. But even if it were now the law, the process of enlistment, as you are aware, is never rapid, and the necessities of your defenseless frontier demand instant action.
Under these circumstances, with the concurrence of the' President, I have determined to request you to raise, without delay, a regiment of mounted riflemen, to be organized and received into the service of the Confederate States under the provisions of the act aforesaid 5 the regiment to consist of ten companies, and each company to be composed of not less than sixty nor more than eighty men.
This communication will be handed to you by C. L. Sayre, acting assistant adjutant-general, who will muster the regiment into the service of the Confederate States according to the terms of their enlistment.
You will report to this Department. In the event it should not be agreeable to you to undertake the duties of the position hereby tendered, you are authorized and requested to designate some suitable person for that duty, and transfer this communication and accompanying act to him for his guidance, and report the fact to this Department.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Braxton Bragg, Louisiana Army, to extend every facility and courtesy, consistent with the safety of our State, to the United State troops in transit through Louisiana, by way of the Mississippi River. I take pleasure in stating to you that Major-General Twiggs, late commanding the Department of Texas, was recently welcomed to Kew Orleans with civic and military honors worthy of his bravery, his talents, and his long and very distinguished services.

Dear Sir: I deem it my duty, placed as I am by the Convention commandant of Galveston, to call to your attention the situation of the port. Should it become necessary to make a defense here we will find ourselves poorly prepared. We now have six 24-pounders, two siege and four battery guns, two howitzers, and two mortars, and about three hundred ball and shell, which were brought from Brazos Santiago. We may receive more of the same kind from there.

Nature has given us very good defenses in pur sand banks, but it is important we should have heavier guns, say 68-pounders. One of the committee of the Convention (General Rogers) went to Louisiana to procure guns, but obtained none but one thousand stand of muskets, which had been altered from flint to percussion locks, and are of but little use; in fact, they are not safe. Small-arms, however, may be procured at San Antonio. I have written to the Convention on the subject. I am preparing to place In battery on the beach what guns we have, but they will be of little use against heavy metal.
Another subject I would call to your attention. I learned last evening that our Convention had passed a resolution to the effect that all vessels belonging to the Federal Government coming to our ports to convey away troops should not be molested. Of course they passed this resolution previous to receiving Mr. Lincoln’s inaugural.
The question now to consider is, whether it would be good policy to allow these troops, fully armed and equipped as they are, to go to any post they may think proper held by the Federal troops, or shall they be required to go direct to New Orleans ?
Allow me also to call your attention to Lieutenant Stevens, late of the United States Engineer Corps. He has resigned his commission, and now offers his services to the State or Confederacy. He has served upwards of ten years as lieutenant, and in 1862, by the Army Regulations, he will be entitled to a captaincy. He is now aiding me in superintending the placing of our battery.
In great haste, I am, sir, your obedient servant,
S. SHERMAN, Commandant of Galveston.
Department of State,
,	’	Austin, Tex., March 13,1861.
! Hon. L. Pope Walker :
Sir : Your letter of March 2d [1st] has been received by his Excellency. Governor Houston, and I am instructed to reply.*
The people of Texas, by their vote on the 23d ultimo, having severed their connection with the United States, Texas, on the 2d day of March, the present month, assumed once again -the position of a sovereign and independent State. No act of the people since that period, and certainly none anterior to it, has warranted the construction that Texas is other than independent. Your letter of March 2, however, informs his excellency that the President of the Confederate States u assumes control of all military operations in this State.” The inference, therefore, is that Texas is regarded as one of the Confederate States, and as such subject to the Provisional Government established for the same.
While Texas has by the vote of a majority of the people determined to resume once again the nationality with which she parted on becoming annexed to the Federal Union, her position before the world, and especially in relation to the Confederate States, seems to be misunderstood. This may arise from the fact that the Convention which assembled in Austin on the 28th day of January last, and has since reassembled, elected seven delegates to the Convention of seceding States at Mont-
* Reference is to a circular informing the governors of the several States that, •under an act to raise Provisional Forces, &c., the President of the Confederate States “ assumes control of all military operations in your State having reference to, or connected with, questions between your State and powers foreign to it,” &c. The circular and law referred to will appear in Vol. I, 4th Series.

gomery, who, on the 2d of March, as his excellency has been unofficially informed, took their seats in the Congress of the Confederate States, by virtue of which Texas was declared one of the Confederate States. Leaving out of question the fact that on the 2d of March the said delegates had no information as to the withdrawal of Texas from the Federal Union, there is no evidence that they had received any warrant from the people of Texas for the act. The Convention which elected them as delegates represented but a minority of the people of Texas. The legislature delegated to it the power to submit the question of secession to a vote of the people. Neither by the terms of the call under which the delegates were elected, the vote they received, nor the act of the legislature recognizing them to perform the function assigned, were they empowered to elect delegates to aid in the formation of a provisional government with other States, who, after creating the same, should constitute themselves members of Congress.
The object of the Convention was declared to be to provide the mode by which the people of Texas should reassume their complete sovereignty. Yet, judging from the tenor of your communication, Texas was on the day provided for declaring her independence of the United States, and before any considerable portion of her people knew the result of the vote, again deprived of her sovereignty, and, instead of an independent nation, became one of the Confederate States, subject to a government which her people had no share in making, and a constitution which but few of them had ever seen.
Admitting even that the Convention had power to elect delegates and members of Congress to the Provisional Government of the Confederate States, the facts show that even in its estimation the delegates elected were not empowered to annex Texas to said Provisional Government on the 2d day of March, and that, until official information is received that Texas has been admitted as one of the Confederate States, Texas maintains the independent position resulting from the vote of her people on the 23d of February. The Convention itself did not, until the 5th day of March, pass an ordinance ratifying the constitution of the Provisional Government of the Confederate States and instructing its delegates to apply for the admission of Texas. There can be no other conclusion, therefore, than that, at the time your communication was addressed to his excellency, Texas was not, even in the estimation of the Convention, one of the Confederate States, and, therefore, not subject to the Provisional Government or in any way under the ucontrol” of its President. Until, therefore, his excellency is informed from some official source that the people of Texas have parted with their sovereignty and becpme a part of the Government on whose part you write, I am instructed to say he cannot recognize any obligation to the same. The people alone have the right to say what form of government they will have; and while his excellency fully appreciates the fact that your communication has been addressed him with a conviction arising from the presence of delegates from Texas in the councils of the Provisional Government that the people have acted, but frankly assures you that such, in his opinion, is not the case.
It also becomes my duty to inform you that his excellency has notified the Convention, whose delegates are accredited to Montgomery, that he does not recognize it as a convention of the people of Texas, its powers having terminated with the reference of the question of secession to a vote of the people of Texas. Since the submission of the ordinance he has had no correspondence with the Convention other than to deny their authority.

His excellency had no intimation of the proposed operations against the forts and arsenals upon the frontier until after they had been taken in possession by the Convention. I feel at liberty to say, however, that none of the arms, munitions of war, forts, &c., lately held by the United States in Texas have come into the possession of his excellency or officers acting under him, except the post at Camp Cooper, which was taken possession of by Col. W. C. Dalrvmple, of the State troops. The United States cavalry, some two hundred and fifty in number, were allowed to take up the line of march to San Antonio, where all the public property, arms, &c., excepting side-arms of officers, are to be delivered to competent State authority. His excellency is informed that a number of the other military posts, with the public property thereto belonging, have fallen into the possession of agents of the Convention, who have acted without his knowledge or sanction, and still hold the same independent of his authority. He has learned that by the terms of the agreement made the troops are permitted to carry off their arms and artillery companies their field batteries.
The public property lately belonging to the United States being nearly all in the possession of the Convention, the information you desire can be obtained at its hands. I will also state that an ordinance was passed by that body on the 9th instant declaring the title to all such projjerty vested in the State of Texas.
I take pleasure in assuring you, on the part of his excellency, that nothing but a sense of the obligation he owes to the people and a desire to maintain their rights aiid interests leads him to the course indicated in this communication. The States which have formed the Provisional Government have his ardent wishes for their welfare and prosperity. The people of Texas are now bound to them in feeling and sympathy no less closely than when members of a common Union. Like circumstances induced withdrawal from the Union. Like peril and uncertainty are before them. Ko matter what the position of Texas may be, she cannot but feel that ties of no common nature bind her to those States. But however close those ties may be in feeling, there are requirements due the national pride and dignity of a people who have just resumed their nationality which do not sanction the course pursued in annexing them to a new government without their knowledge or consent.
His excellency desires me to tender you the assurances of his esteem and consideration.

E. W. CAVE, Secretary of State.

Sir: You are directed to proceed to the State of Texas and ascertain from the proper authorities of that State what portion of the property, arms, and munitions of war appertaining to the Army of the United States, recently stationed in that State, they may be desirous to turn over to this Government and make chargeable to it. Being advised upon this point, you will at once receive into your possession all such property, arms, &c., and execute to such persons as the State may designate a receipt for the same; the value of such property to be hereafter determined between the State of Texas and this Government, or this Government and that of the United States, as the case may be.
You will from time to time, as such property, arms, &c., may be turned over, make report to this Department of the character, quality, and condition of the same, and the disposition made thereof under the directions herein given, with such recommendations and suggestions in reference to the same as may occur to you. You will provide for the safe keeping of such property, arms, &c., either at the places where they may be delivered, or have them transported to places where this can be provided with greater economy and safety^ or to such points as may hereafter be designated by this Department. You are authorized to make contracts for the transportation contemplated in these instructions, and also for the safe-keeping of said property, arms, &c. Such of the property turned over, strictly perishable in its nature, as may have been condemned, or as may be, or be considered to be, unfit for use, or as may be liable to deterioration before it can be applied to use, may be disposed of as you deem best, provided that the authorities of Texas shall agree to receive the proceeds of sale, should a sale be made, and to discharge this Government from liability for the same beyond the amount for which it may be sold; but you are required at once to report to this Department the fact of any such disposition of property, with the reasons which induced it. You are authorized to employ such clerical assistance as you may require in making the returns contemplated herein, paying therefor a reasonable compensation.
After you shall have determined your route in visiting the several forts and depots, you will report such route to this Department, indicating at the same time the most convenient channel for communicating with you, as it may become necessary, from time to time.

They are ignorant yet of their destination. I have seen but two of the officers, Maj. E. K. Smith and Lieut. Thornton Washington.

administration of President Pierce, and when General Davis was Secretary of War, a high appointment in the Second Regiment of Cavalry. He is so well known to the President, however, that it would be superfluous to say anything to call his attention to his merits as an officer. If I have been appointed colonel of Cavalry, as I have heard, it would be very gratifying to me to have him appointed lieutenant-colonel in my regiment.
Lieut. T Washington has tendered his resignation, and has written to you by Major Smith, offering his services to the Southern Army. He was aide-de-camp to General Twiggs until the general left Texas, and was the adjutant of his regiment. He was also for a while the acting assistant adjutant-general at department headquarters. These positions, assigned him by his superior officers will speak more in his behalf than anything I can say. He desires an appointment in the Quartermasters Department or Adjutant-General7s Department. He is well qualified to fill either station.
I think I shall have no difficulty in securing many of the troops and officers. I leave in a few minutes for the Green Lake camp. The Army, I am told by Major Smith, is strongly for the South, and he has no doubt but that the troops would all like to go with us if they had the opportunity.

Sir : On yesterday the Convention adjourned. On Saturday last, 23d instant, the ordinance of ratification was passed—made a finality, with but one dissenting vote.
I would draw your particular attention to the state of the former 1J. S. Army within this State. An impression had grown up before my arrival that the rank and file of the Army was not desired by the President of the Confederate States, and nothing has been done to obtain their services in the Army of the Confederate States. I am satisfied from authentic sources that a large majority of the Second Cavalry could be obtained if the proper officer was here. You are aware, and certainly much better informed than I am, of the effect of discipline and the esprit de corps that exists even among the privates of any regular army. In addition to that, I am sure that our State service can afford no inducements, not only on account of the want of permanency, but really the want of respect and antagonism they feel to militia, volunteers, and uneducated officers. In addition, they feel some mortification as to their capitulation and the terms by which they feel they are expelled by State force from our territory.
I feel satisfied if Colonel Van Dorn was here holding the command, even though the necessities or requirements of the service might demand his removal within a short period, he could obtain the best men in the United States service. I would earnestly urge his being sent here immediately. They are now collecting in large numbers, and recruiting depots established at convenient points, each recruiting officer being of the former U. S. Army, and when obtainable attached to the Second Cavalry. Besides obtaining the flower of the old Army and weakening the power of our enemies, we save an enormous expense, and obtain the

best body of troops for our service. I hope this will have your most favorable consideration. In addition, there is a vast amount of arms, ammunition, transportation, horses, mules, &c., that require immediate attention.
I will further state that Maj. G. Tom Howard will furnish subsistence upon your desire for the horses and men until a definite contract can be made.
Permit me to call your attention to the application of George Fairfax Gray, who has been our State engineer since he resigned his commission in the U. S. Navy. His abilities, scientific attainments, and great experience in the management of heavy ordnance would commend him to your consideration with great force for immediate service.
Our State is gliding on quietly under the administration of Governor Clark. General Houston, since he was deposed, has sunk quietly beneath the waters and left not a rijjple upon the surface.
Yours, respectfully,
T. N. WAHL.

Hon. L. P. Walker,
Secretary of War, Confederate States of America:
Sir : As one of the commissioners for securing the property of the late H. S. Government, and also as quartermaster and commissary general of the State, I have taken the liberty of addressing you informally with reference to the property, and also with regard to the estimates for the two regiments which are being called into service in this State. Inclosed you will find an enumeration of the most important items taken from the late Government.*
I regard it as a matter of great importance that this property should be turned over to the Government of the Confederate States at as early a date as possible. I have just seen Hon. Thomas J. Devine, commissioner and prominent member of the Convention, who informs me that the Convention would have turned over the property to the Government had they not been so pressed for time. The Convention has adjourned. The legislature is in session, and I have no doubt that they would act promptly upon suggestions of President Davis in reference to this matter.
It is essentially necessary that we should have a commanding officer in this department at as early a date as possible. Colonel Maclin (formerly a paymaster, H. S. service, and now adjutant and inspector general and chief of ordnance of the State) has been performing the duties of commanding officer here. In a few days the companies which are to form the regiments authorized by the State and Confederate States will be concentrating here. You will, therefore, see the necessity of having a commanding officer here to organize and station the two regiments.
Inclosed you will find a rough estimate to enable the quartermaster and commissary to supply the two regiments for three months. I have taken Fort Lancaster as a mean distance of the various posts formerly occupied by H. S. troops, and made my estimates for that distance. The estimates would be much less for the next three months.
Owing to the immense amount of transportation taken to remove the

Federal troops, and the scarcity of grass, the mules have been greatly reduced. It will require the greatest care to have them in condition to place the two regiments at their various posts. I will remark that the State has never furnished one dollar to carry on the expenses of this whole business. I seized some thirty thousand dollars belonging to the Pay Department. There were debts due from this money, amounting to about sixteen thousand dollars. I will have on hand about ten thousand dollars at the end of this month, after paying the above debts and the necessary expenses.
I will remark that, by contracting for the transportation of supplies at the present contract prices, we can reduce transportation expenses for two regiments at least thirty thousand dollars per annum. Such was the estimate of Captain McLean, of the U. S. Army, and quartermaster at this place.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
P. N. LUCKETT,
Quartermaster and Commissary General, Texas.
Saluria, March 30,1861.
J. H. Beagan, Postmaster-General, C. S.:
Dear Sir : I returned here late yesterday evening from Powderhorn. Colonel Van Dorn has not succeeded in engaging many of the officers or soldiers to join the Army of the Confederate States.
There are some five hundred soldiers assembled here, and two men-of-war and five sea-steamer transport vessels lying outside our bar to receive the troops here and as they arrive, and the Fashion is chartered by Captain King to remain here and lighter the men to the sea vessels. I very much fear the plan of Lincoln is to delay delivering up Fort Sumter until the whole Texas Army can be concentrated for an attack on Pensacola, and by a brilliant stroke arouse Northern enthusiasm in favor of coercion.
I shall start to Austin to-day to petition the legislature to give State aid to establish a line of steamships to run on the Gulf.
Ought not President Davis to give immediate orders that all the steamships in the Gulf should be seized at the ports where they may be found upon the first spark of Avar f
Our towns are entirely undefended, and those now carrying the mails are at the mercy of an enemy having steamers that can cross our bars. Morgan and Harris are both at Powderhorn.

Sir: My brother, Maj. Ben. McCulloch, to whom your order to raise a volunteer regiment for the protection of the Texas frontier was sent, has transferred it to me, and I am now raising the troops under it, and will have them in the field with as little delay as possible.
I have just returned from my command under the authority of the State on the northwestern frontier, where I have five companies actively engaged in its ‘defense, three of whom will be mustered into the service of the Confederate States, and will not leave their posts for a day. These companies being on that portion of the frontier from Red River to the

Colorado, and having a partial'personal knowledge of that entire region of country from the Bed River to the Rio Grande at Fort Duncan, and it being fully as much territory as my command can conveniently protect, I respectfully ask to be assigned to that service, leaving the Rio Grande, including El Paso, to be protected by Colonel Ford, of the State troops. I also desire to be permitted to use some of the friendly Indians in the Indian Territory, if I can procure their services, in my scouting parties and expeditions against the hostile Indians. These people can be made of great service to us, and can be used without any great expense to the Government.
Permit me to suggest the necessity of adopting the State regiment under Colonel Ford into the service of the Confederate States, and the appointment or designation of a general officer to the command of this department, with the remark that the commanding officers of the regiments are new in the active duties of the field.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. E. MCCULLOCH.
Montgomery, Ala., March 30,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : Feeling it incumbent on us as a duty to our constituents, we take the liberty of calling your attention to the condition of the frontier of Texas, and making some suggestions which we deem worthy of consideration in providing for its defense.
Our frontier may be divided into three sections, each presenting its peculiar aspect. First, that portion bounded by the Rio Grande, from the mouth of that river to New Mexico; second, the frontier settlements in the State from Preston, Red River, to the Rio Grande; and, third, the northern boundary of the State on Red River, from the southwest corner of Arkansas up to Preston.
The first section is between one thousand and fifteen hundred miles in length, and is the boundary line between Texas and Mexico. Upon this line there should be, as we conceive, permanent military posts, occupied by troops of the Regular Army, of sufficient force to preserve good order on the line and prevent lawless incursions across it. The upper settlements on this line are exposed to Indian depredations from the wild tribes of the plains and from Mexico. To guard against that danger a cavalry force should be added to that service.
The second section or line of frontier settlements from the Red River to the Rio Grande is one of great difficulty. This line is from six hundred to one thousand miles long. For the last ten years the settlements have extended westward about fifteen miles annually. From one end of this line to the other the settlements are exposed to the depredations of the wild tribes of the plains. These Indians make their incursions in small parties, stealthily, and generally in the night, stealing large dioves of horses and killing other stock. Families exposed and unprotected are murdered; individuals are chased, and frequently overtaken and murdered. These Indians are perfect horsemen, always move with great rapidity, and are never overtaken unless the pursuit is instantaneous. If preparation is necessary before starting after their trail is discovered, the pursuit had as well be abandoned. They always avoid a conflict with a force of anything like equal numbers, and upon finding themselves pursued, scatter in all directions and conceal themselves.
You will readily perceive that a particular character of troops is

## p. 619 (#635) ############################################

﻿Chap. TIL] • CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-------CONFEDERATE.	619
necessary to guard our frontier against the incursions of such an enemy. They must be brave, good horsemen, acquainted with the country, and able to perform the most fatiguing service. They must be acquainted with the character and habits of the Indians, and always ready to mount the saddle and start in the pursuit the moment the trail of the enemy is discovered. The volunteer rangers of Texas possess all these requisites, and are better qualified for this service than any others whatever.
Permanent military posts on this line are wholly useless. The troops should be kept constantly moving and on the lookout for the enemy. They should range the whole of this line of frontier in small detachments, arranged in such a manner that a rapid concentration could be effected whenever necessary. Detachments of sufficient strength should be frequently sent high up the country to hunt out the Indians. We believe that this is the only mode in which this section of our frontier can be successfully defended against depredations.
On the third section no defenses are necessary, as our neighbors on that line are the highly-civilized and agricultural tribes of Choctaws and Chickasaws, who are in friendship with Texas and the Confederate States.
The people on this second section have for years been terribly exposed to the depredations of the Indians. Numerous families and individuals have been murdered, and thousands of dollars7 worth of property have been stolen and destroyed. The Government of the United States has not afforded anything like adequate protection. It is true that gallant officers and men have been stationed on the frontier, but they were entirely unable either to guard the country or follow up the Indians and chastise them. For such service regular infantry are wholly useless. In some instances the cavalry stationed on the frontier have met the Indians and chastised them. The destruction of life and j)roperty has been so great as almost to depopulate portions of the frontier, causing hundreds of families to abandon their homes.
The inattention of the United States Government for the last three or four years to the exposed condition of this portion of our people forced the State government to take charge of the matter and expend an enormous sum of money in giving that protection which it was the duty of the Federal Government to afford. At this time the attention of the State authorities is especially directed to the subject. In consequence of the withdrawal of the United States troops the Indians have presented themselves in considerable bodies at various points. To guard against them the legislature of the State, now in session, has provided for the raising of a regiment of mounted riflemen of one thousand men, to be enrolled for one year, unless sooner discharged, to be put into the service at once. The officers and men are to furnish their own clothing, horses, &c. The State is to arm and equip the officers and men, who are to receive the same pay as allowed in the Confederate States. Should •the Confederate States receive the regiment as a part of their military force, it is to be subject to their orders and laws.
As the defense of the frontier belongs properly to the General Government, we respectfully suggest the propriety of receiving the regiment above referred to into the service as a part of the volunteer force allowed to be raised. We believe the force necessary, in addition to the regiment already ordered to be raised in Texas. The representatives of the people of Texas in the convention and legislature have declared it necessary by their action in ordering it to be raised. The acceptance of the

regiment by the Confederate States will give peace and quiet to the frontier, and inspire the confidence of the people in the Government.
We can assure you that nothing contributed more to destroy the bonds of affection which bound the people of Texas to the United States than the fatal disregard of the dangers to which they were exposed to the Indians, and the reckless denial of adequate protection. The people had a right to expect ample protection. It was a part of the bond of annexation as well as a duty without any express stipulation. Our people are not mercenary. Their calls for protection were misunderstood. They were forced by the Federal Government to protect themselves, while they were annually sending off $20,000,000 of exports upon which imports were returned to Northern ports, and upon which revenues were collected and distributed amongst hungry jobbers and speculators rather than expended for the protection of the people.
We have taken the liberty of making the foregoing suggestions for your consideration in providing such a system of defense* as the condition of the frontier requires.
We are, respectfully, your obedient servants,
JOHN HEMPHILL. W. S. OLDHAM.
War Department, O. S. A.,
Montgomeryj April 1,1861.
Hon. John Hemphill and W. S. Oldham, of Texas,
Montgomery, Ala.:
Gentlemen: The general subject of your letter of the 30th ultimo has specially occupied the attention of this Department almost from its organization, and your ample and precise statements increase the solicitude with which the Government has steadily regarded the exposed condition of the frontier of Texas. In evidence of the watchful interest with which the Department has viewed the subject, it is proper to state that as early as the 9th of last month (March) a special messenger was dispatched to the State of Texas bearing authority to one of her citizens to raise a regiment of mounted riflemen for the protection of the frontier, and although no official information has yet been received, it is hoped that the regiment is in rapid process of formation. ’
Again, an officer of the Confederate Army has been detailed, and is now in Texas, with orders to muster into the service of this Government, if it can be done, the troops of the United States recently stationed there, and another has been sent to Saint Louis to intercept such as may return through Kansas from New Mexico. It is thought that in this way a regiment of these troops may be raised, and when so raised it is the purpose of the Department to send them to the Rio Grande.
In conclusion, gentlemen, I repeat the assurance that this Department will exert all its energies and exhaust all the means at its command to. secure the citizens of Texas against Indian and other depredations. It has so far acted fully up to the measure of its ability, and as its capacity and resources are increased it will continue to augment and perfect the system of frontier defense.
With high consideration, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER, Secretary of War.

Executive Department, * Austin, Tex., April 4,1861.
His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Confederate States:
Sir: This communication will be handed to you by General J. H. Rogers, who goes to your Government as the accredited agent of Texas. He is fully authorized for the purposes of his mission, which are to negotiate for the reception into the service of the Confederate States of the regiment of cavalry recently raised by Texas.
This regiment was authorized by an ordinance of the Convention of Texas for the purpose of defending our suffering frontier from the depredations of hostile Indians and the possible invasion of Mexican guerrillas. The provision was made during our transition state, before we had a right to expect the protection of your Government, and before you could have afforded us any security. It was an act of immediate, imperative necessity. Having 1,700 miles of frontier, with the ungoverned Mexicans on the west, who bear no love to us, and the Indians on the north and west, who are our perpetual foes, we were forced to take some steps for immediate protection. Now, however, that we are under the guardianship of the Government of the Confederate States it is right that the defense of our frontier (which is its frontier) should not be assumed by this State, but should be sustained by that Government upon which devolves the military defense of the entire country.
It is more than probable that an effort will soon be made by the submission party of this State, with General Houston at its head, to convert Texas into an independent republic, and one of the most effective arguments will be that the Confederate States have supplied the place of the 2,800 United States troops formerly upon our frontier with only a single regiment, and that Texas has at her own cost been forced to bring another regiment into the field, and to bear the burden of its maintenance. The people of this State have been positively assured that their protection would be far more perfect under the Government of the Confederate States than it was under that of the old United States, and upon this assurance they now rely. Hence I cannot too urgently press upon you the policy and equity of accepting the regiment of mounted volunteers which Texas has ordered out. Our protection properly devolves upon y ou, and if we receive it, Texas will not only be secured against a spirit of dissatisfaction and dissension with the Confederate States, but there will be given an eternal quietus to that spirit of opposition which is always grumbling in our midst.
Our situation in detail will be unfolded to you by General Rogers, who was one of the committee on public safety, and has familiarized himself with all the facts.
Yery respectfully,
EDWARD CLARK.

Sir : Resuming the general subject in part discussed in my letter of the 1st instant to Hon. W. S. Oldham and yourself—I mean the frontier defense of Texas—I have the honor to submit to you the following views and propositions:
The Department has considered the question of the military necessities of Texas with the deliberation its importance demanded, and hold-

622	OPERATIONS IN TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO.
ing jbliat the settlers of the frontier of that State are entitled to the most favorable regard of this Government, it has sought to make its action conform to their wishes as well as to their pressing needs. In proof of this disposition of the Government I need hardly remind you of the fact, well known to the authorities of Texas and yourself, that the Department of War, within a very few days after its organization, transmitted orders to Texas by a special agent for the raising as rapidly as possible of a regiment of mounted riflemen for this Government, to be assigned to service on the northwestern and northern frontiers of the State. This at the time was a measure fully commensurate with the ability of the Government, then, as now, charged with duties of the gravest responsibility, involving not only the expenditure of great sums of money, but the far higher consideration of giving protection to such of our cities and their populations (alike entitled with the people of Texas to that protection) as were in the actual presence of the enemy. If I refer to these facts (which have doubtless been fully weighed and nicely appreciated by so close an observer as yourself of public affairs) it is that I may ask your State authorities and yourself to concede to this Department a just allowance for the embarrassments growing out of the importance and the multiplicity of the business which was suddenly devolved upon it when this Government came into power.
The question now specially before the Department is whether, in addition to the regiment ordered to be enlisted for the defense of Texas, a second regiment of mounted men authorized to be raised by the Convention of your State can be received into the service of the Confederate States. The Department has most maturely and with a warm desire to protect fully the interests of Texas and to accommodate itself to local ideas of the necessities of the case considered this question, and it has arrived at the conclusion that the vast expense of maintaining mounted troops on your border ought (for the present and until a smaller force shall have been demonstrated to be insufficient) to prevent the acceptance by the Department of a second mounted regiment ; but at the same time it is deemed expedient to receive this second regiment into the service, if the State should acquiesce, as a regiment of infantry, to be assigned to the defense of the line of the Rio Grande. The orders necessary to carry this determination into effect, if it be agreeable to the authorities of Texas, will be immediately issued.
While the character outlie war, if it can be called so, on your borders continues merely predatory and incursional, and carried on only by roving tribes of Indians, it is believed by the Department that quite effectual protection can be secured to the settlers by a regiment of mounted riflemen, which, upon occasion, may be divided and subdivided, as the necessity for aiding different points may appear. Together with a regiment of infantry for the Rio Grande, subject to the same disposition, it ought to avail at least for all except very extraordinary demands.
The excessive cost of transportation, forage, &c., in the frontier service, especially for cavalry, furnishes just reason why this Government should only on demonstration of its necessity incur addition to the enormous expense of two regiments so situated; but I beg to assure the authorities of Texas and yourself that when that necessity shall have proved itself, this Government will, at whatever cost, place on your exposed lines whatever force and of whatever description the exigency may require.
With great consideration, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

You are charged with the important duty of making the necessary arrangements to intercept and prevent the movement of the United States troops from the State of Texas, and for this purpose you are authorized to call into service such amount of volunteer force from Texas as may be necessary, in your judgment, to accomplish that object. The whole of the United States force, both officers and men, must be regarded as prisoners of war. Such of the men as may be disposed to join the Confederate States Army you are authorized to take into service; those not so inclined must be held as prisoners of war, at such place as may be judged to be most safe. The commissioned officers may be released on parole, and in special cases, of which you must judge, the men may be released on oath not to serve against the Confederate States.

Dear Sir : In stirring times like these I deem it proper to advise you of the state of things here. The Mohawk, the Empire City, and the Crusader—I believe those to be the names of war vessels and sea transports lying at Saluria this morning. The Fashion, chartered by the United States Government, brought in about 12 o’clock to-day stores from the Empire City. There are nine companies concentrated here and at Green Lake, about twenty miles distant, for embarkation, mostly here. There is a strong wind blowing, which will prevent, till it ceases, their embarkation, and has already delayed it four days.
The Arizona is at Brazos with three hundred troops, which were embarked three days since for this place to join the troops here, but she is yet detained outside the bar by heavy weather.

Sir : This Department has been duly informed by its authorized agents in Texas, through letters bearing date the 5th and 6th of April, of the seizure of a train of wagons, under charge of I. Francis Davis, loaded with supplies for the troops of the United States in New Mexico, purchased in part by Pierce & Bacon, of Boston, Mass., for William S. Grant, of Tucson, N. Mex. I have to thank your excellency for your judicious and prompt action in this business. Whether the goods so seized be paid for or not by the Government at Washington does not alter the case under the state of war existing between this Government and that at Washington. They are goods for provisioning the forces of the enemy, and are contraband of war. You will therefore oblige me by duly transferring this property to either one of the agents of this Department now acting in Texas, to wit: Major Maclin, acting quartermaster, Captain Muihr, and H. P. Brewster, general agents, either one of whom is fully authorized to act in the premises.
Orders have been sent to our proper officers in Texas to issue supplies to the troops of the Mounted Rifle Regiment as they are mustered into service.

“News” Office, Galveston, Tuesday Morning, April 9, 1861.
Dear Sir : I write in a hurry by Major Bickley, a brother of General Bickley, the head of the K. G. C. The major has had much to do with the working of secession in Western Texas, and can give you a good deal of news. General Austin has returned at his suggestion, as no time is to be lost.
I write to say that in case of hostilities we are totally unprotected here. There are a number of pieces of artillery here, brought from Brazos, but there is no powder, no military organization, no leader, no nothing. Ail our sea coast, and consequently all our ports and harbors, will be at the mercy of any small vessel of war that may choose to appear off Galveston, Indianola, &e., and dictate such terms as may please her commander. A vessel of war can come within two miles of our island, and we could be shelled without trouble.
Your Government should take instant steps to arm the Texas harbors. A good many people begin to ask why the other ports should be put in defense and those of Texas not. The Convention did nothing for us in this respect, as they thought it the duty of the Confederate Government to provide artillery and engineers and a commanding officer for the State, &c.
You can fancy our position if our trade with New Orleans were stopped suddenly by one of Father Abraham’s war steamers. We should have a military commander for the coast, with power to organize a corps of artillery and engineers; some columbiads, powder, &c. We have several hundred well-drilled men here, but they are not organized, and without that, would be inefficient.
Captain Talbot, of the steamship Mexico, informed us yesterday that he learned the day before from Captain Murray, of the steamship Fashion (chartered by the United States officers to take the United States troops from Indianola to the transport steamships outside), that he had been told suddenly to hold off, as he would not be needed until July. He seemed to think that it was the intention to retain and concentrate the rest of the United States troops in Texas (some fifteen hundred) at or near Indianola.
We have published letters from Brownsville, Austin, and Washington that show it was Houston’s design, in case his late appeal to the people took effect, to call on the United States troops to back him.

Executive Department, Austin, Tex., April 17, 1861.
His Excellency Jefferson Davis :
Sir: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following facts.
On the 3d instant Maj. Thomas G. Rhett, paymaster in the U. S. Army, and lately stationed at El Paso, in Texas, arrived in San Antonio.
Previous to his arrival it had been ascertained that there was in his possession a considerable amount of United States funds at the time that the United States property in Texas was surrendered to this State. According to the construction placed on the stipulations entered into between General Twiggs and the commissioners of the State of Texas, it is held that money is Government property. Therefore, the authorized official of this State, acting in San Antonio, formally demanded of Major Rhett all the public funds under his control. Major Rhett complied with this demand by giving to the agent of this State an order on Judge S. Hart, of El Paso, with whom he had left all the public funds under his control, for all money subject to his (Rhett’s) order. In compliance with an act of the recent legislature, all the property in Texas lately owned by the United States Government is transferred to the Government of the Confederate States. Hence I have given instructions that the money received from Major Rhett remain in its present possession until disposed of by your Government.
I will direct your attention to a single fact in relation to our coast defense. The town of Indianola, at once one of the most important and most exposed of our seaboard towns, has not one piece of ordnance for its defense. There are at Fort Clark, distant more than two hundred miles from the sea coast, several heavy guns, which are utterly useless at that point, and which, if transported to Indianola, would enable its fortification to be rendered quite effectual.
Does not prudence suggest that the Confederate States Government issue the necessary orders for having these guns immediately conveyed to Indianola?

I may add that the amount to be received from Major Rhett is probably $20,000.

Hon. L. P. Walker,
Secretary of War, Confederate States of America:
Sir : The news by mail this morning indicates clearly that war exists between onr Government and that of the United States. The commissioners of Texas agreed with General Twiggs that the United States troops then in Texas might pass out of the State with their arms. At that time war did not exist. Things have changed. There are seven companies of troops still in Texas, and some of them may be now on their way from El Paso to this point. Is it proper and right now to permit them to pass through this portion of the territory of the Confederate States with their arms, embodied as United States troops, when their Government is at war with ours ? In a few days more I will have six companies of troops here ready for the field, anxious to render service to their country, and with your permission—yes, without I receive orders to the contrary from your Department—with the lights now before me, think I shall require them to surrender their arms and disperse. It will be several days before they will be able to reach this place, and it would gratify me much to receive the information by telegraph through New Orleans that I have the consent of the Government to pursue the course I have indicated.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
h. e. McCulloch,
Colonel, Commanding.
Montgomery, Ala., April 20,1861. The Honorable Secretary of War :
Sir : The frontier defenses of Texas geographically divide themselves into the line of the Bio Grande and the line of the western frontier—the first, from the m.outh of the Bio Grande to Fort Duncan, some three hundred and fifty miles ; the second, from the Bio Grande to Bed Biver, some five hundred miles. Brownsville, Binggold Barracks, Forts McIntosh and Duncan, commanding the lines of communication with Mexico, are the important points on the first line of defense. Brownsville and Binggold are on the direct line of communication with Monterey and Victoria, and would be the base of operations for an enemy operating from Mexico. Fort Duncan, within a radius of forty miles, includes some flourishing Mexican towns, a good corn-producing region, and is on the direct line of communication from Chihuahua to San Antonio.
The line of the Bio Grande is alone exposed to Indian depredations from its upper or northern extremity. The absence of grass renders the subsistence of cavalry on this line extremely difficult, and should the supjfiy of corn from Mexico be intercepted, almost impossible.
The points indicated on the line of the Bio Grande should, therefore, be occupied by infantry and artillery. Regulars or well-disciplined troops should alone be employed, that amicable relations may be maintained with Mexico.
If the line of the Lower Bio Grande is to be maintained, Fort Brown should be fortified and batteries thrown up at Brazos Santiago and the mouth of the Bio Grande. These works can be of a temporary nature-field works. Besides the artillery companies for the works at Fort Brown and the mouth of the river one regiment of infantry, distributed as follows, should be sufficient for the defense of the line of the Bio Grande:

## p. 628 (#644) ############################################

﻿628	OPERATIONS IN TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO. IChap. TO.
Two companies at Duncan, one at McIntosh, two at Ringgold, and five at Fort Brown and the mouth of the river.
In considering the defense of the line of the western frontier of Texas our relations with the civilized Indians north of Red River are of the utmost importance. Numbering some eight thousand rifles, they form a strong barrier on the north, forcing the line of operations of an invading army westward into a region impracticable to the passage of large bodies of troops. Regarding them as our allies, which their natural affinities make them, the line of the western frontier reduces itself to the country between the Rio Grande and Red River.
Two regiments of mounted troops are necessary for the defense of this line. Inge, Yerde, Mason, Colorado, and some point near Belknap should be occupied, and the cavalry collected at few points can be more readily concentrated, and will more effectually protect the frontier. One company of infantry should be stationed at each of the above points.
The remaining five companies of the regiment can occupy the El Paso road. If our communications with New Mexico are to be preserved, one additional regiment of infantry should occupy Forts Bliss, Quitman, Davis, Stockton, and Hudson.
By the above estimation two regiments of cavalry and three of infantry will be required. It presupposes the line of the Rio Grande and the line of Red River secured by friendly relations with Mexico and the civilized Indians.
These regiments, as far as practicable, should be regulars, or called into service for the war, or for a period of service not less than three years. All our experience has shown that volunteers are more expensive than regular troops, and their cost is at an inverse ratio with their term of service.
The regiments not regular troops called into service should as far as practicable be armed by the Confederate Government,, that their arms may be of the same pattern and their supply of ammunition be secured. Their commissariat should be on the same footing with the commissariat of the Confederate troops. No soldiers called into service can find their own supplies and be efficient. They will be found without provisions when a movement is ordered. The two systems will not work together.
In addition to the five regiments called to the frontier, measures should be taken for a thorough organization of the militia of the State, which should be put immediately upon a war footing. The five regiments would constitute a nucleus round which the militia of the State could rally in the event of an invasion.

His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Southern Confederacy:
Dear Sir: At a large meeting held in this city on the 27th instant, the undersigned were appointed a committee on the public safety, thereby being invested with full power and authority to provide means, adopt measures, and to do all things necessary to secure protection for the citizens of this place and its immediate vicinity. Our exposed position must be apparent to every one. The city of Corpus Christi being situated on the seaboard, accessible from the ocean by two passes, neither of which have any fortifications or other military defense, are liable at any time to be entered by the enemy, while on our rear we are exposed to Indian depredations, besides being threatened with another predatory war by Cortinas. The people here are all united in the great cause of the South. Since the first gun was fired at Fort Sumter, differences of opinion in this city have ceased to exist. Our citizens are all united, and are determined to resist Northern aggressions at all hazards. We are all ready and willing to fight and defend ourselves; but we are destitute of arms and munitions of war. Under these circumstances the undersigned, composing the committee on public safety, have been instructed by the meeting to communicate to the President of the Confederate States our exposed and defenseless condition, and to solicit at the same time such aid in arms and munitions of war as will be necessary to enable us to protect ourselves until such time as peace may be restored or other military defenses established by the Government. Our citizens are now enrolling themselves into three military companies, viz, artillery, infantry, and cavalry. Now, to

enable them to be of any permanent service to the country, they must have ordnance, arms, and munitions of war, and these can only be obtained through your Government.
The latest intelligence received here from the West reports that the Black Republicans have landed upon our soil, their object, no doubt, being to recapture all the forts heretofore held by the old United States, and for the purpose of coercing Texas back into the old Union, or they design to encourage the Mexicans to commence a predatory war upon our frontier. Our position is peculiar and critical. We therefore strongly urge that the necessary orders for ordnance, arms, &c. will be immediately issued by your excellency, requiring the same to be forwarded to this place at the earliest opportunity. We have learned that at San Antonio there is an overplus of ordnance and arms, while here we have none, except what can be gathered from private sources. If the Government has no way or mode of transportation, if we receive the orders for artillery and other arms and munitions of war, the citizens of this place will furnish transportation, &e. Your earliest attention to the above will be highly appreciated by your numerous friends in this portion of Texas.

Colonel : The governor of Texas has, in a communication to the Secretary of War, suggested the importance of defending the harbor of Indianola by the removal of some heavy guns left at Fort Clark, where they are not needed, to the former place. The Secretary of War has informed him that you will be instructed in relation to the feasibility of removing the guns to the place assigned for their use.

You will see by this arrangement that a

regiment of State troops will be in the field furnished from the stores and supplies now under your control, but subject to the above-named requisitions.
In order to avoid any conflict in the military command in the State the governor is exceedingly desirous that you should accept the above-named regiment into the service of the Confederate States. It will also avoid all complication of accounts, and give you full control of all the military stores and provisions lately in the possession of the State.
At one time the Government at Montgomery refused to accept the State regiment. At that time we were at peace. War now exists, and I assure you that from my long experience on the Bio Grande I believe we have every reason to fear that serious raids, similiar to the Cortinas raid, will take place, all of which could be prevented by making use of this regiment.
Colonel Ford’s regiment is partly in the field—three companies on the Eio Grande, i. <?., Davidson’s, Nolan’s, and Littleton’s) Walker’s and Pyron’s are here, and five more are to rendezvous here on the 10th of the month. This regiment was called into service under peculiar political state of affairs. They have entered the service at great inconvenience and sacrifice, and it would be a great hardship were they not continued in service. Under these circumstances, if consistent with your views, I would recommend most earnestly that you receive them into the service of the Confederate States.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

No. 4.	f	San Antonio, Tex., May 3,1861.
The colonel commanding the troops in Texas acknowledges with pride the valuable services of the volunteers called out by his orders to arrest the United States troops at Indianola. With short notice they sprang to arms, and joined him at Victoria with a celerity amounting to eagerness, that will ever stand as a proof that the State of Texas has nothing to fear from invasion from any quarter. With the fatigue of forced marches, night watches, exposure on the crowded decks of the transports in Lavaca and Matagorda Bays, and scanty provisions, there was no murmur of dissatisfaction and no unwillingness manifested to obey any order. The aged man and the youth without beard, the father and his sons, the heroes of San Jacinto and the rangers who became veterans in the Mexican war, were seen side by side in the ranks, with faces expressive of that determination to win or die that ever gives assurance of success, and which gave success.
The companies which reported at Victoria on the 23d and 24th of April were—
Captain Herbert’s company, Colorado ; Captain Scarborough (Davis Guards), De Witt 5 Captain McDowell, Lockhart; Captain A. C. Horton, Matagorda; Captain W. R. Friend, De Witt Rifles; Captain Hampton, Victoria; Captain Upton, Colorado; Captain Holt, Fort Bend; Captains Jones and Harris, Colonel De Witt’s command, Gonzales; Captain Williams, Lavaca County; Captain Fulkrod, Goliad; Captain Kyle, Hays County; Captain Stapp, Indianola; Captain Searcy, Colorado; Captain Phillips, Lavaca Town; Captain Finlay, Lavaca Town; Captain Pearson, Matagorda; Captain C. S. Olden, Texana; Captain Barkley, Fayette ; Captain Gordon, Matagorda County.
In addition to the above, there were many companies who reached Victoria too late to participate, and were turned back without reporting. Nevertheless, they are entitled to all honor for their zeal and patriotism.
The command of Col. H. E. McCulloch, consisting of five companies of cavalry, under Captains Pitts, Tobin, Ashby, Bogges, and Nelson, and the battery of light artillery, under Captain Edgar, from San Antonio, made extraordinary exertions to reach Victoria on the day specified for the rendezvous, for which the greatest praise is due them, and, although they were not enabled to reach Lavaca in time to participate in the maneuvers on the bay (as the movement was made before the time appointed), they proved that they could be relied upon in any emergency.
The colonel commanding desires also to acknowledge the services of Judge Hawes, of Saluria, who promptly secured two pieces of artillery, unavoidably left on this wharf on the night the Star of the West was seized, and who tendered the hospitalities of his house during the drawing up of the agreements between the commanding officer of the United States troops and the colonel commanding.
Captain Chubb, of the Royal Yacht, from Galveston, did material service in giving facilities of communication between the vessels in the bay, and afterwards in transporting arms and munitions of war (taken from the United States troops) to Indianola and to Galveston, free of charge, for which he also deserves, and has, the thanks of the colonel commanding.

Sir : I have the honor herewith to inclose a report of Major Maclin, quartermaster, in regard to the seizure of a train of wagons and subsistence stores intended for the United States troops in Arizona, together with some correspondence, &c., on the same subject, given to me by Colonel Luckett, quartermaster of the State of Texas. I am unable to determine whether or not the wagons and teams should be kept as lawful prizes, and must refer the matter to you for the decision of the Secretary of War. There are dues to the teamsters and other employes belonging to the train. In case the decision should be in favor of retaining the property, the employes should, I presume, be paid by the Confederate States Government. The correspondence on the subject and the report of Major Maclin make it unnecessary for me to enter into the details of seizure. .

Colonel : In obedience to your order, I have the honor to report that on the 20th of last month Col. P. IN’. Luckett, quartermaster-general of the State of Texas, seized, under the order of the governor, a train of forty-one wagons and four hundred and nine oxen. This train was claimed by Mr. Francis Davis, agent of W. S. Grant, as private property. I have no evidence in my possession determining the legal character of the property, but it was admitted by those in charge of the train, as I understand, that the wagons were loaded with subsistence stores for the United States troops, and that the oxen were to be turned over to the commissariat of the U. S. Army in Arizona. It was admitted, therefore, by the agent of WT. S. Grant, the contractor, that he was engaged in transporting subsistence stores to our enemies through our own territory. Thus, by necessity and usages of war, the subsistence stores, wagons, and oxen were forfeited to the Confederate States of America. In order, however, that this matter may be properly adjudicated, it is referred to you for your consideration—more especially as to the right to retain the wagons and oxen, as I apprehend the other part of the subject cannot admit of a doubt. I have neglected to state that all this property is now in our possession by order of the governor of the State.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Galveston, Tex., May 7,1861.
Memorandum for Lieut Col. L. A. Thompson.
The service upon the northern and western frontiers of Texas is needed almost entirely by mounted troops.
There are now in the arsenal at San Antonio some four thousand stand of muskets and rifles, which were taken by Col. Ben. McCulloch from General Twiggs ; besides, there are about one thousand stand, of the same description of arms in the hands of the citizens of San Antonio belonging to the Government, they having been loaned to the mayor of that city by General Twiggs previous to his surrender.
Colonel Van Dorn has taken from the troops at Indianola upwards of five hundred stand of arms, and he expects to capture some eight hundred stand more from other troops now approaching the coast for embarkation. Of these parcels of arms a large quantity are not suitable for the service needed upon our frontier, therefore they are remaining in store at San Antonio to rust and spoil, unless otherwise appropriated. There are likewise several light batteries of artillery at San Antonio more than are necessary for service there, and likewise a large amount of transportation material.
The available force embraced in the military command of Galveston amounts to twenty-five hundred men and upwards. Fully fifteen hundred of these men are without arms. The commanding officer of this post has, therefore, thought proper to ask of the Confederate Government at Montgomery a requisition upon the quartermaster or military storekeeper at San Antonio for such arms and munitions as are not needed for the service in the interior and are so much needed at the post of Galveston, together with transportation for the same. Understanding that the same shall be held subject to the order of the Confederate Government and deliverable on call, this request is made in view of the very defenseless condition of this important post unless arms can be procured.

It is the pleasing duty of the colonel commanding to thank the volunteer troops of Texas for the valuable services they have again rendered to the Confederate States. Being called upon at short notice to take the field, they responded with that promptness which proved how high is the military spirit of the State, and how ready her people are to seize up arms in defense of her honor and in vindication of their rights. It was not the wish of the volunteers of Texas, however, to fight against those troops of the United States who had been defending their frontiers for years, and who found themselves on their soil in the attitude of enemies only because of political changes which they did nothing to bring about, many of whom had been personally endeared to them by long association and by their gallant deeds (well remembered) as their old comrades in the war with Mexico. With the true spirit of brave men who know how to appreciate a soldier's honor, they marshaled in such numbers before them that the rugged necessities of war might be accomplished without bloodshed and without the loss of reputation to

their gallant opponents. There was no exultation over the surrender of the troops of the old Eighth Infantry. This would not be the case were the volunteers of Texas called out, under arms, to contend with an invading force sent against them from the North; far from it. There would then' be no regrets, no affection, and no disparity of numbers, and u death to the foe and victory after the fighti” would be the object and the aim of every true Texan.
Colonel Van Dorn feels proud of the command the President has assigned him. The troops to whom these commendations are due were H. E. McCulloch’s command, consisting of Captains Pitts’, Tobin’s, Ashby’s, Bogges’, Nelson’s, and Pry’s companies, of McCulloch’s regiment; Captains Pyron’s, Walker’s, and Hardeman’s companies of Ford’s regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor; Captain Edgar’s battery of light artillery; three small detachments of cavalry, under Captain Good, Lieutenants Paul and Dwyer, and a section of artillery under Captain Teel; and Lieutenant-Colonel Duff’s battalion of infantry, consisting of Captains Wilcox’s, Maverick’s, Navarro’s, Kampman’s, and Prescott’s companies, from San Antonio, Maj.

Sir : I have the honor herewith to inclose a copy ot a communication received this day from his Excellency Henry M. Eector, governor of the State of Arkansas, and also a copy of my reply to his excellency’s communication.
Please submit both these communications to the Secretary of War for the decision of the President of the United States, with the request that instructions be sent me as to my future action in the premises. I also request that means and money may be sent me to carry out the orders I may receive.
I forward, in the same mail with this, copies of the communications, herein mentioned, to the general commanding* the Department of the West. I deem it necessary in this connection respectfully to inform the authorities concerned that, in my opinion, most positive and unequivocal instructions are called for, in order that I may not mistake the intentions of the administration regarding the matter at issue. I believe there is trouble ahead for this command, and that by the 4th day of March coming decided action will be absolutely imperative in the officer who may then command this arsenal, and, if left to his own discretion, he may not in everything correspond with the wishes of the Federal authorities.	.
Whatever orders may be given, I respectfully ask that they may be sent by a reliable agent, and not by the mails, as there appears to be some reason in believing that they are not entirely trustworthy at present. I would not myself, in the present instance, trust to this doubtful medium of communication if I had means at my disposal of sending an officer to Washington, and, indeed, if I can procure the necessary funds, I may yet forward copies of the various communications now inclosed by such an agent as indicated.

Any assurances that you maybe able to give touching the observance of these two latter conditions will greatly tend to quiet the public mind,

Sir : I have to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 28th instant, which was handed to me this morning by your aide-de camp, J. J. Gaines, esq., and in answer thereto, to say to your excellency that my understanding leads me to believe that the troops under my command were ordered here at the request of some of the members of Congress from this State, and several good citizens also, for what reasons, if any, I have not been apprised.
As you will readily understand, I cannot give your excellency any assurances as to what instructions may in future be issued regarding this arsenal and the Federal troops now" stationed here, but I can assure you that, so far as I am informed, no orders, such as you refer to in your two propositions, have been issued, nor do I believe, privately and unofficially, that any such orders will be given by the Federal Government. I have furthermore to remind your excellency that as an officer of the Army of the United States, my allegiance is due to that Government in whose [service] 1 am, and that I act by its authority and 'permission, and until absolved from that allegiance my honor is concerned in the faithful performance of what I may conceive to be my duty.
I shall forward your communication to the Secretary of War to be laid before the President of the United States, and ask instructions relative to the matter contained in it, and, if not prohibited by these authorities, I will cheerfully inform your excellency what these instructions are.
In the mean time let me say, in conclusion, that I most cordially concur with your excellency in the desire to avoid collision between the Federal troops under my command and the citizens of Arkansas, and shall do everything in my power which an honorable man in my position can or dare do to prevent so deplorable an event.

Sir : I have the honor herewith to inclose a copy of a communication just received from H. M. Rector, governor of the State of Arkansas, demanding the surrender of this arsenal to the State authorities.
As I have already written and telegraphed you for the information of the President, I am perfectly in the dark as to the wishes of the administration, from the want [of] instructions how to meet such a crisis as at present. If I had positive orders to cover the case in point I should obey them implicitly; but I have nothing whatever, within my knowledge, indicative of the course the Government wishes its agents to pursue, and I am therefore left to act as my judgment and my honor as a Federal officer dictate under the present trying circumstances.
I inclose also copies of certain resolutions, passed by the citizens of Little Rock, and of the common council of said city, explanatory of the circumstances under which the matter above referred to had been brought about.

Sir : There is now in this city a considerable number of the citizens of this State who have come here, under arms, with the avowed purpose of taking possession of the U. S. Arsenal.
Reliable information has been received that a large force of citizens are on the march to this place for the same purpose. This movement is prompted by the feeling that pervades the citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this State, to interpose my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command.
I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next. This course is the only one which can possibly prevent the effusion of blood and the destruction of the property of the citizens and the Government. I beg leave to assure you that the steps which the citizens have seen fit to take is not prompted by any personal distrust of you, but the jealousy which naturally exists towards the authorities of the United States under the present unhappy condition of the country.
This communication will be handed you by T. D. Merrick, general of First Division of the Arkansas Militia, who will call on you personally, accompanied by his staff, and who will receive from you your response.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Resolved as a sense of this council, That if there be any impending danger or necessity which requires the seiziire of the IT. S. Arsenal at this place, it would become the duty of the governor, as the executive head of the State, to order such seizure to be made by the organized military power of the State.
But that all unauthorized attempts to seize the arsenal by persons without orders from the governor is an insult to his station and authority, and deserves the reprehension of all our people, and calculated to injure the cause of States rights, and we earnestly recommend the governor to interpose his authority to check any such movements if unauthorized by him.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be immediately communicated to the governor, and that a committee, to consist of the whole council, be appointed for that purpose, and the same committee to communicate with the leaders of such movement.

The following preamble and resolutions were introduced by Alderman Geo. C. Watkins:
“ Whereas an armed force of about four hundred men from different parts of this State are assembled at Little Rock for the purpose of seizing the IT. S. Arsenal at this place, under the apprehension that the arsenal and the arms and the munitions of war stored therein may at no distant day be used to the injury of the people of this State, and it is reasonably certain that such force will soon be increased to one thousand men, or to five thousand, if necessary for the purpose designed;
“And whereas the governor of the State has on this day officially assumed the responsibility of said movement, and has made a demand in the name and by authority of the State upon the officer in command of the arsenal to surrender the same to the authorities of the State;
“And whereas the arsenal is so located that any attack or defense of it would involve the destruction of much of the property of private citizens of Little Rock, and the loss of many lives of our citizens, and the probable sacrifice of the officers and their command in charge of the arsenal: Therefore,

“Resolved, That this council do. earnestly deprecate a hostile collision in their midst between the forces of the State and the United States troops stationed at the arsenal, and hope that the same may be avoided if it can possibly be done consistently with a proper sense of duty and honor on the part of those upon whom rests the responsibility of a collision and the deplorable consequences that would inevitably result from it.

“Resolved, As the opinion of this meeting, that it is the duty of the governor to assume the responsibility of this movement or to interpose his authority and influence to prevent it.
“Resolved further, That in case there be, in opinion of the governor, any danger or necessity for seizing the arsenal, we earnestly recommend him, as the only way to prevent the effusion of blood, to order the same to be done in his official capacity and in the name and by authority of the State, and to that end that he make an official demand upon the officers in charge of the arsenal to surrender the same to the State authorities.
“Resolved further, That in our opinion the governor, as the executive head of the State, may rely upon the sympathy and co-operation of all good citizens in what he may do by authority of the State and her organized military power.

Sir: In the present trying circumstances by which the undersigned finds himself surrounded, as a Federal officer, he is anxious to learn officially from your excellency, before answering your demands for the surrender of the U. S. Arsenal at this place, the following important points, viz:
1st. If this arsenal and all the munitions of war stored therein are left intact as at the hour of 3 o’clock p. m. to-morrow, by the United States forces now in charge of them, will the governor of the State of Arkansas officially take charge of said arsenal and munitions of war in the name of the United States Government, and hold them in that light until future circumstances shall legally absolve him from the responsibility!
2d. If the United States forces now garrisoning Little Bock Arsenal evacuate said post, and leave the munitions of war intact as at the hour of 3 o’clock p. m. to-morrow, will the governor of the State of Arkansas officially guarantee to said forces an unmolested passage through the State in any direction the officer commanding said troops may elect, and guarantee, moreover, to said forces the right of carrying with them all the public and private property they brought with them to said arsenal, all which has been purchased for or by them, and all which has been sent to them since stationed at said arsenal, consisting of ordnance and ordnance stores, clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and barracks and mess furniture, as also provisions and all their individual or private property.
3d. If the arsenal and munitions of war stored therein are left intact as at the hour of 3 o’clock p. m. to-morrow, will the governor of Arkansas, in his official capacity, guarantee to the United States forces now in charge thereof the right of marching away from said place with all the honor due to them as Federal officers and soldiers who do not surrender their trust, but simply evacuate a post for want of instructions from their superiors in office, and in doubt as to the propriety of bringing on civil war among their fellow-countrymen ?
Explicit and detailed answers to each and every one of these questions, will have great influence upon the undersigned in his answer to the communication of the governor of Arkansas, which is promised by 3 o’clock p. m. to-morrow.

After mature reflection I propose to accept your first, second, and third propositions, with the following understanding: That being informed your command brought no cannon with you—so none are to be taken away.

Memorandum this day made and signed by James Totten, captain of Second Artillery, in the Army of the United States, and Henry M. Rector, governor of the State of Arkansas.
This paper, marked A,* signed by us, is the demand made by the governor upon Captain Totten for the delivery of the U. S. Arsenal at this place to the State authorities. The paper marked B, signed by us, is a copy of the response of Captain Totten to that communication. The paper marked C, signed by us, is the response of the governor accepting, as therein stated, the terms of the paper B.
It is further witnessed, that on this day, at the hour of 12 m., said Captain Totten, with his command, doth retire from said arsenal, and deliver the same, with all its stores, arms, and munitions of war, intact, to the governor of Arkansas, pursuant to the tenor and purport of said papers A, B, C. And the said Capt. James Totten protests that he has thus acted because in the presence of a greatly superior armed force, and which he became satisfied would soon become overwhelming by reenforcements in case of resistance, involving the sacrifice of his command, without regard to the probable loss of life on the part of the assailants; because any defense of the arsenal in the city of Little Rock, whether successful or unsuccessful, would necessarily involve, to a greater or less extent, the destruction of property in the city, and the loss of lives of the peaceful citizens and families dwelling therein; because, being without instructions from his Government, he took, of necessity, the responsibility of doing what he thought proper and best under all the circumstances, desiring to avoid cause of civil war in this Government, by the first instance of a hostile and bloody collision, yet

Sir : I have the honor herewith to inclose for the information of the President copies of four distinct papers relative to a solemn and ever-to-be-regretted act which has been forced upon me through the necessities of the circumstances surrounding me. The papers marked A, B, C, and D explain the whole sad affair from beginning to end, in connection with information previously communicated, and comment on my part, therefore, seems unnecessary at present. I have been forced, as the inclosed papers will show, to retire with my command from Little Rock Arsenal, and yield my charge into the hands of Henry M. Rector, governor of the State of Arkansas, who has taken charge of the same in the name of the United States, to hold it in that light until legally absolved from the trust.
I hope I have acted in the whole matter in a manner which will meet the approbation of the Federal authorities. My object throughout these trying circumstances has been to avoid bringing about bloodshed and civil war in this immediate vicinity among peaceable, law-abiding, and loyal citizens of the United States. In doing so, I sincerely believe, in the absence of all instructions, I have only done what appears to be the course indicated by the present administration in its past course, so far as I am informed. It gratifies me beyond measure to be able, on this occasion, to bear honest testimony to the honorable, high-toned, loyal, and law-abiding action taken by the great majority of the most respectable citizens of Little Rock. From the richest to the poorest, I am happy to say, there was but one sentiment, and that was in opposition to the course of the governor and those who counseled and aided him in the deed done.

I therefore start to-day down the river to meet them, hoping that I can get on the boat, and, by advising with the captain, avoid points and escape excitement.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel: I received an invoice of stores (year’s supply) from Major Waggaman on the 18th, and fearing, from information on the river, that some unauthorized person might interfere with them, I came down to meet them. On arriving at Little Eock I found military preparations made to intercept all boats loaded with U. S. stores. The steamboat Sky Lark had just passed, after having been boarded and the U. S. stores taken from her at Pine Bluff. I learned (from the paper and otherwise) that the Silver Lake, No. 2, would be seized if not taken at Pine Bluff (cannon were stationed for that purpose and cannoneers ready). I called upon some prominent citizens, heretofore Union men, who advised me to see the governor. I called, but did not find his excellency at home. I very soon discovered that the revolution was general. Troops were enrolling to march on Fort Smith. The steamboat I came down on was chartered. When I arrived at Pine Bluff I found the Silver Lake, No. 2, tied up and strongly guarded. The crew had left, the stores were placed in different houses in town, and the steamboat was to transport troops to Fort Smith.
I learned from Mr. Bell, the agent (I believe) of the governor, that he had instructions to cause the stores to be sent to Little Eock, part of them to be used in the expedition to Fort Smith, for which 5,000 troops were called out.
I am on my way to Saint Louis to report to the commanding officer of department, and advise, in concurrence with Colonel Emory, that stores be sent at once from Leavenworth, via Forts Scott and Gibson, to Washita.

Report of Lieut. Col. William IT. Emory, First U. 8. Cavalry, of the abandonment of Forts Arbuckle, Cobb, and Washita, Ind. T.
Headquarters Troops in the Indian Country,
West of the Arkansas River, May 19, 1861.
Sir: I had the honor to receive the instructions of the General-in-Chief, dated April 17,1* by the hands of Lieutenant Averell, of the Bides, two days’ inarch from Washita.
The. seizure of supplies for this command, which I suppose was known sooner at Washington than it was to me; the known fact that it was only supplied to the 31st of May, and the failure of the command at Arbuckle and Cobb to concentrate as directed, caused me to anticipate the instructions of the General-in-Chief, so far as withdrawing the troops from Washita in the direction of Arbuckle and Cobb.
The day after I left Washita [April 16J the Texans occupied that place in force. The troops at Arbuckle and two companies from Cobb joined me dve miles from Arbuckle, on the east bank of the Washita River, May 3. I then marched to relieve Cobb, taking the road which lies on the open prairie to the north of the Washita River, so as to render the cavalry available.
On the 5th, finding myself followed, I halted, and sent Captain Sturgis with his company and Lieutenant Averell to the rear, to bring into my camp the advance guard of the pursuing forces, which*,he did happily without having to shed blood. The same day Arbuckle was occupied by a large force of white people from Texas. (See letter of Sergeant Campbell.) [Report No. 11.] The next morning the above-mentioned guard, mostly composed of gentlemen acting under erroneous impressions, retraced its steps, and I followed my course to relieve the command at Cobb, for the safety of which I had reasons to entertain serious apprehensions, and which I had ordered to meet me.
On the 9th I found the command from Cobb (two companies of foot) thirty-five miles northeast of that post, and on the same day I took the most direct course to Leavenworth that the nature of the ground would permit. I am now in Kansas, on the north side of the Arkansas River, with the whole command—eleven companies, 750 fighting men, 150 women, children, teamsters, and other non-combatants. Nothing has been lpft behind but what would have been left in time of peace. Contracts were made to bring such stores as were left and were worth transporting (chiefly clothing of soldiers and officers’ baggage), but I understand the clothing has been seized. If this be the fact, these soldiers, who have not mixed in the politics of the country, who stand to their colors, and do their duty faithfully, should be reimbursed.
It is my duty to call attention to the unworthy conduct of the gov- . ernor of the Chickasaw Nation, wThich country, I apprehend, he too faithfully represents. He busily joined in an attempt to disarm and disgrace the soldiers, whose only occupation for years past was to defend the rights and property of the people he represents and who were, to my own knowledge, invited by the agent and representatives of this people to re-enforce Fort Washita.
There is no money with this command, which has been a source of great embarrassment; and I beg to call attention to the estimates, and request that funds be immediately sent, to enable me to discharge use-

While I am writing the depot yard and grounds are filled with men, who are rapidly removing the ordnance and ordnance stores from the post. Having no means of resistance, my protest against~tlie forcible and unlawful seizure of the public property was of no avail, and I was informed that all the military stores would be taken.
I send this to Saint Louis by boat to be mailed, and so soon as it can be done a detailed report of all the facts, so far as they can be ascertained, will be forwarded.
Very respectfully, I am, sir, your obedient servant,

Fort Smith, Ark., April 24, 1861.
Colonel: I have the honor to report that a body of tiwps of the State of Arkansas, under the command of Col. S. Borland, entered and took possession of the post of Fort Smith last night, Captain Sturgis, of the First Cavalry, having evacuated it but a few hours previous. Being on a visit at the post at the time, I was made a prisoner of war by the authority of his excellency the governor of the State, but permitted to go at large upon giving my parole not to fight against the State of Arkansas or the Southern Confederated States during the pending difficulties between the latter and the United States, unless exchanged.
In a conversation with Colonel Borland to day I am given to understand that the governor is acting as though the State had already seceded; that last act in the drama being only a question of a few days’ time. #

Report of Maj. Samuel D. Sturgis, Fourth U. S. Cavalry, of the seizure of

Camp on Walnut Creek, Kans., May 21,186L Sir: I avail myself of the first opportunity which has occurred since leaving Fort Smith, Ark., to inform you that I evacuated that post at 9 o’clock p. in. on the 23d ultimo, and marched with my command for Fort Washita, where we arrived on the 30th ultimo, and reported for duty to Col. W. H. Emory, First Cavalry. All the available transportation at the post, amounting to some twenty wagons and teams, was taken along. The ordnance sergeant, hospital steward, chief bugler, sick, and laundresses were left at the post, to be shipped to Jefferson Barracks by Capt. A. Montgomery, A. Q. M.
The causes which induced me to evacuate the post I presume are known to the department commander from general notoriety. After the supplies were cut off by the State of Arkansas the post, of course, became untenable, and we could have occupied it in any case but a few more days. One hour after we left, two boats arrived with three hundred men and ten pieces of artillery. To have contended against this force with two companies of cavalry, and that, too, while the entire population of the surrounding country were ready at a moment’s warning to take up arms against us, could only have resulted eventually in

Fort Smith, Ark., April 24,1861.
Captain : I have the honor to report that the companies of cavalry under command of Captain Sturgis, First Cavalry, withdrew from this post yesterday evening and marched in the direction of Fort Washita. I inclose a copy of an order he issued immediately before leaving, directing the entire evacuation of the post.
About two hours after his departure a body of troops under the com: mand of Col. Solon Borland, aide-de camp to his excellency the governor of the State of Arkansas, accompanied by the adjutant-general of the State, arrived in steamers and took possession of the post, making me a prisoner of war, under authority and by direction of the governor of the State. Maj. R. C. Gatlin, Fifth Infantry, who happened to be in the garrison at the time on a visit, was also made prisoner of war. On giving our parole that we would not tight against the State of Arkansas or the Southern Confederate States during the existing difficulties between the latter and the United States, unless exchanged, we were permitted to go at large. The force under Colonel Borland consisted of 235 men, rank and file, with battery of artillery. Colonel Borland demanded and has taken possession of all the public property at the post and in its vicinity, inventories of which will be forwarded to the proper bureau.
For the information of the friends of the parties. I beg leave to state, that Major Brown, paymaster, and Captain Burns, C. S., were absent from the post at the time of its evacuation. Major Brown, returning from Fort Arbuekle, received information at Scullyville that I had been made a prisoner of war, and immediately turned back and joined Captain Sturgis’ command. Captain Burns had gone down the river to look after certain subsistence stores, which it was feared would be seized by the State authorities.
The movement of Captain Sturgis was necessitated by the limited sui>ply of provisions on hand and the intelligence received a short time before he left that all the public stores on the river in transit to this post had been detained or captured by the State authorities. He was1 also aware that the governor of the State had dispatched a force, with artillery, to demand possession of the post, and possibly to capture his arms and horses. It was not expected that any orders had been given to make prisoners of war.

Colonel : I regret to report that this jjost was this morning taken possession of by a portion of a large force of Texans, who are marching in the rear of your column (report says two thousand men). The officer commanding demanded me to give np to him, in the name of the Southern Confederacy, the whole of the United States property in my charge, which I complied with, as I could offer no resistance, my command being disarmed previous to leaving their companies. He has promised to myself and command a safe passage with our families and private property from further molestation until we get to Fort Leavenworth. Only for the interference of Mr. Myers he would have made us prisoners of war. I hope the colonel will order Mr. Myers, the contractor, to convey my command and our families to our destination as soon as he can get his train together, and also furnish us with rations when the quantity we have how in possession gives out.

Bonham, Yai/ 14,1861.
Dear Sir : I hereby inclose an inventory of all the goods and property found and taken at Fort Arbuckle, all of which I turned over to the Chickasaw Indians, by order of William C. Young, who is State regimental colonel. Said Indians are at present taking care of said post and all property therein contained. The United States Government troops under Emory had abandoned said fort a few days previous to my entering and taking command of the same. I am solicitous that you send ipe a captain’s commission to occupy said post as one of the posts belonging to the Southern Confederacy. I have a company of cavalry in readiness for that post or any other that it may please your honor to assign us. Fort Washita and Fort Cobb, both being situated in the Chickasaw Nation, were also abandoned, leaving considerable property in each.
Colonel Young has formed a treaty of peace with the Reserve Indians, conditioned that the Southern Confederacy feed and protect them, as heretofore done by the United States Government at a very heavy expense, and that, too, without the approval of but very few of the people in this State. It is considered by the sovereigns here as a worse than needless expense.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain, with respect, vours, &c.,

The troops will bring with them as much of the public property as the means of transportation wdl permit, excepting any surplus subsistence stores, which will be sent to the nearest post in the Indian country west of Arkansas.
As the authorities of the State of Arkansas have seized the public property, it will not be safe to send supplies of any description up the Arkansas River, and all the posts in the southern part of your department must therefore be supplied via Fort Scott from Saint Louis or Fort Leavenworth.

Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a letter from the headquarters of the Army by Lieutenant Colonel Lay, aide-de-camp, dated the 13th instant, in which my attention is called to the subject of the defense of the Saint Louis Arsenal.
The considerations presented in that communication have not been overlooked by me, but believing from all the information I have been able to gather (and I have been favored with the advice of persons whose judgment I have considered as perfectly reliable) that the apprehensions which have been entertained of a demonstration against the Saint Louis Arsenal have not been well founded, and that such an attempt has not been at any time seriously contemplated, it has not appeared to me that the safety of the arsenal required that. I should call up any considerable portion of the troops from Jefferson Barracks. Moreover, the secession party is in a decided minority in Saint Louis, and there is every reason to suppose that in the event of a movement from any quarter upon the arsenal its garrison would be promptly succored by an overwhelming force from the city. At any rate such is the prevailing opinion in the community, and in the existence of the sentiment may, it is thought, be found a sufficient warrant for the belief that the arsenal is not at this time in danger.
The Saint Louis Arsenal is, however, being put in as complete a defensive condition as possible. Major Hagner, in whose judgment I have the most entire confidence, advised me, even before the arrival of Captain Lyon’s company, of the Second Infantry, that he considered himself strong enough to defend his position successfully. He has recently, in obedience to the orders of the General-in-Chief, been re-enforced by some three hundred recruits from Jefferson Barracks, and his command now numbers nine officers and four hundred and eighty-four men.

Colonel : I have the honor to report for your information that since my report of the 7th instant the following additional troops have been joined to my command :
February 16, three officers and two hundred men; February 19, one officer and one hundred and one men. Our aggregate this morning is four hundred and eighty eight.
I have thrown up held works on all sides of our main cluster of buildings, and provided them with guns commanding the interior faces of our inclosing wall and all approaches to the main square. We are perfectly secure, therefore, against any infantry attack and watchful against surprise.
I am sorry to say that the small pox and measles have appeared within the last forty-eight hours, and a few cases have developed; but I have opened a separate hospital in the laboratory buildings for such cases, and have authority from the general commanding the department to send patients to Jefferson Barracks as often as may be necessary. The cases were brought here.
Notwithstanding the large force and the few conveniences for them upon their arrival, I think they are well cared for, and all essentials for health and comfort provided. The arrangements made still permit all the arsenal duties to proceed regularly without inconvenience to the shop work in hand.*

We, the undersigned, citizens of Arkansas, learn with deep regret that the post of Fort Smith is to be abandoned by the General Government. It is fair to suppose that this order has been determined upon in consequence of the actions of a mob in Little Rock and the unfortunate course of the governor in demanding from the United States officer the arsenaL The late decision of the people at the ballot-box has proved beyond question the almost unanimous voice in the counties adjoining Fort Smith for Union as against violence, mob law, and secession.

The interests of the United States are paramount to those of the friendly Indians on the reservation near Fort Cobb, but good faith requires that notice shall be given them of the withdrawal of the troops, that they may have a chance to move temporarily to the vicinity of the posts to be occupied, for the purpose of protection against wanton attack from any quarter.

S. WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Saint Louis Arsenal, March 19,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. 8. Army, Washington City:
Colonel: I received to-day through the department headquarters Special Orders, No. 74, from your office, assigning the command of the troops and defenses at this post to Capt. N. Lyon, Second Infantry.* This order I am informed has not been accompanied by any explanation, but I have since received from the department headquarters a copy of the instructions sent to Captain Lyon, directing him “not to regard the officers and men of the Ordnance Department as forming a part of his command.”
Having been assigned to the command of this arsenal, by telegraphic orders, at a moment of great excitement and anxiety for its safety, and every requirement of the law having been fulfilled to enable me to exercise command over troops of the line stationed here at the time of my arrival, and subsequently confirmed in the command (after Captain Lyon’s arrival) by the terms of your telegraphic dispatch, dated February 11, 1861, stating “the command of the mixed troops belongs to Major Hag-ner,” I need not tell you with what surprise this order was received. As it comes after all excitement in this community has been allayed; after all the necessary defenses for the arsenal have been long since arranged and completed by me in a manner so imposing as to impress all visitors with the conviction of our thorough preparation against illegal attempts, and without one word of explanation to save the pride of a soldier of twenty-five years’ active service from the reproach implied by being displaced by a junior in years, in length of service, and in Army rank in the command of the defenses of his post, you cannot doubt, sir, that the surprise is accompanied by great mortification.
If the command of mixed troops belonged to Major Hagner on the 11th of February, and any course of argument has since proven to the satisfaction of those in authority that that command no longer belongs to him, I appeal to the high sense of justice of the General-in-Chief, to his own well-deserved and well-known soldier’s pride, whether it was not due to me that that fact should be stated in orders if it induced my displacement. Had any personal impeachment been urged, ought not my long service and hitherto good standing in my profession have secured me a hearing before condemnation ? Should it now be that my relatives and friends, in and out of the Army, should be left to dread that one who has, on more than one occasion, received the praise of the General-in-Chief, has now done something or omitted to do something forfeiting his good opinion for competency in the performance of a trust committed to him ? May I not hope, therefore, that some explanatory statement shall be published in this case ?
I have been informed by Captain Lyon to-day that he has used efforts or made application to obtain this command from me. What kind they have been I do not know, but as no communication has passed through his commanding officer, as prescribed by Army Begulations, and no previous whisper of the use or contemplated use of such efforts has reached

[Secretary of War:]
The letter of Hon. Charles B. Mitchell, U. S. Senator from Arkansas, dated the 17th instant, in relation to the military posts in Arkansas, having been submitted to Lieutenant-General Scott, he has the honor to report, speaking not from documentary information but rather from oral testimony, as follows:
Fort Smith is an old established post, from which the troops had been for a time withdraw n, but which has been lately used as a depot to supply the advanced posts soon to be named.
The honorable Senator proposes that the troops at Fort Smith shall be transferred to a point called u Frozen Bock,” about fifteen miles southeast of Fort Gibson, on the Arkansas Biver, which is said to be a suitable position for a post. If this idea is to be entertained, a preliminary examination of the site should be made by a competent officer, and the title to the land, the sources of supply, lines of communication, &e., should be ascertained. By act of March 3, 1859, “ No permanent barracks and quarters shall hereafter be constructed unless detailed estimates shall have been previously submitted to Congress, and shall have been approved by a special appropriation for the same.” Until these previous steps are taken, no movement can be taken to transfer the troops from Fort Smith.
Fort Washita, also an old-established post, is about 160 miles from Fort Smith. It is a highly important military point. The public buildings are good and in repair. Orders were given Lieutenant-Colonel Emory, First Cavalry, the 18th instant, to proceed there and establish his headquarters as commander of his regiment, with discretionary power .to concentrate at or in the vicinity of the post two companies

## p. 660 (#676) ############################################

﻿660	OPERATIONS IN ARK., IND. T., AND MO. [Chap. VIIL
of cavalry and five of infantry, now at Forts Arbuckle and Cobb, in addition to the two companies of cavalry already at Fort Washita. Orders were transmitted the same day, by telegraph and express, to move in advance one company of infantry from Fort Arbuckle to Fort Washita, in consequence of a report, dated the 3d instant, from the commanding officer of the latter post, referring to rumors of a contemplated attack from Texas.
Fort Arbuckle, about 60 miles west, a little north of Fort Washita, has a garrison of two companies of cavalry. It is of no importance as a military point, and will, no doubt, be broken up under the discretionary orders to Lieutenant-Colonel Emory.
Fort Cobb, about 160 miles northwest of Fort Washita, was first occupied by troops October 1,1859. The site is on a portion of the Choctaw country, leased as a reserve for several detached bands of Comanche and other Indians, which were moved there from points within the limits of Texas. This arrangement was made for the convenience of the State of Texas, and Fort Cobb was designed for the double purpose of protecting these friendly bands against incursions from the hostiles of their own tribes and to restrain the latter in their descents upon Texas. The attitude now assumed by Texas changes the relations of Fort Cobb to that State, whilst present maintenance is no doubt necessary for the protection of the Indians of the reserve. But in connection with this point must be considered the safety of the garrison in case of attack by a superior force and the possibility of supplying it. The post is at such a distance from the base of co-operation as to leave it unsupported; the retreat of its garrison would be easily cut off; hence it requires a powerful garrison, if any. The supply trains must pass over a section of country so open to incursions from Texas as to make strong escorts necessary to guard them. Subsistence and forage are said by the chiefs of the staff departments to be difficult to obtain and very high.
These are the main subjects for the large discretion devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Emory, and it is not doubted he will appreciate them and decide with judgment.

John A. Kasson:
Dear Sir : I arrived home yesterday, and would have telegraphed you at Saint Joseph had I dared to do so. There are men from secession military companies formed at Saint Joseph for the purpose of capturing the troops from Fort Bandall. They will be down about May 1, on the Omaha, and they propose to take boat, arms, &c. I have several letters from steady Union men in Saint Joseph, and I shall board the boat as she comes down. My information is such that there is no doubt about the matters, and a telegram from the proper source to the officers on the boat would cause them to take the proper action. This letter will reach Washington before the troops reach this place.
Union men are leaving Missouri in swarms, and unless matters change within a week a reign of terror will exist about Saint Joseph.
I am, truly,
G. M. DODGE.

Sir: The department commander directs that you transfer to Capt. N. Lyon, Second Infantry, commanding the troops at the Saint Louis Arsenal, all the mounted artillery at that place available for service, and understood to consist of two 8-inch howitzers, six 12-pounder howitzers, and four 6-pounder guns; also, the implements required to render the same effective for service, together with fifty rounds of fixed ammunition for each piece. Captain Lyon is also authorized by the department commander to throw up such defenses of earth at the arsenal, and to occupy such of the out-buildings with a night force, as in his judgment security of the place may call for.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Fort Smith, April 6,1861. To the Commanding Officer, Fort Cobb:
Sir: In pursuance of special instructions, dated Headquarters U. S. Army, March 18 and 21* (copies of which are inclosed), you will direct two companies of your command to march immediately to Fort Washita, and two companies to remain at Fort Cobb until further orders. For this purpose additional transportation will this day be sent you from the quartermaster’s depot at this place.
You will take great pains to give the Indians the notice required by the instructions of the General-in-Chief, and offer to such Indians as may choose to retire within the protection of the camp at Washita the privilege of moving under the protection of the troops destined for that place, but you will observe the offer was directed to be made before the intention was entertained of leaving any troops at Fort Cobb. The ordnance stores will be moved with the troops, except such ammunition as may be required for the use of the companies left behind.
Any surplus means of transportation will be used in transferring the other property to Fort Washita which may not be required at Fort Cobb—such as cavalry clothing and surplus forage.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Fort Smith, April 10,1861. To the Commanding Officer, Fort Cobb :
The instructions to give authority to move to the Indians, under your protection* were based, as you were informed by me, on the idea that the post was to be entirely abandoned. Since it is determined to retain two companies at that post, and I am informed by the Indian agents here it will give great dissatisfaction to the Choctaws to bring those Indians to Washita, within their territory, I deem it proper for the present to suspend so much of the instructions of the 6th of April (sent from here only yesterday) as authorizes you u to offer to such Indians as may choose to retire within the camp at Washita the protection of the troops destined for that place.” I have been expecting Colonel Leiper, the agent of the Cobb Indians, now on his way here. He is no doubt detained by high water on the road. In his absence I have consulted the superintendent of Indian affairs and the contractors, Johnson and Grimes, who inform me the Indians are hutted and planting and without means, and could not move at this time if allowed by the Choctaws and Chickasaws to come among them.
In reference to your supplies, I am furnished a statement by Captain Burns, showing you to be supplied up to the 31st of May. The withdrawal of two companies will therefore leave the remaining two full supplies up to the 30th of June. Captain Burns has been notified of this, that you may be supplied thereafter.
In view of any prompt movement that may be required, I respectfully

Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, directing the movement of six companies of artillery-three from Fort Bidgely and three from Fort Bandall. The order for the movement from Fort Bandall has been sent by telegraph to Council Bluffs, to be forwarded thence by special messenger. The steamer Omaha has been chartered by the assistant quartermaster here to convey the troops from Fort Bandall to Saint Joseph, the terminus of the railroad. The Omaha is now at Saint Joseph, and instructions have been sent to that point by telegraph for her to leave for Fort Bandall without delay.	*
The orders for the movements from Forts Bidgely, Bipley, and Abercrombie were transmitted by telegraph to Saint Paul, to be forwarded thence by special messengers to the several posts concerned ; but since they were issued I have received a copy of your dispatch of the 6th instant to Major Morris, commanding at Fort Bidgely, requiring him to proceed at once with his command, save a small detachment, to the city of New York, instead of waiting to be relieved by a company of the Second Infantry, as at first directed. I have therefore recalled by telegraph my own order to Major Morris.

Fort Smith, April 13,1861.
Lieutenant-Colonel Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters U. 8. Army :
Sir: Before starting to Washita, and preliminary to a request, I desire to give a brief account of what has been done. I found the infantry already at Washita, and the cavalry from Arbuckle on the move to the same point. Upon the earnest appeal of the Indian agent, and the objection which it is understood would be made by the Choctaws and Chickasawsto bringing the Cobb Indians to Fort Washita, within their territory, from which all persons are excluded by treaty, I have sus • pended the invitation to them to follow the troops to Fort Washita, and have left two companies instead of one at Cobb. On an appeal from the same quarter, I have suggested to the department commander that two companies of cavalry from Fort Wise might be usefully employed by passing the summer near Fort Cobb, where there is a large depot of corn not easily removed. The usual supply of ammunition for this post, Cobb, Arbuckle, and Washita has been reported seized at Napoleon, and I have suggested to the department commander to send a supply overland. There are but two company officers with the four companies of cavalry concentrating at Washita, and I have asked that officers be sent forthwith to those companies, particularly the newly-appointed captains.
I have communicated so much of the General-in-Chief’s instructions to the commander of this post as refers to it, and directed him, as soon as this State (Arkansas) secedes, to retire within the Indian country to the point on the Arkansas Biver where the high road from Fort Washita to Fort Scott, Kans., crosses it.

## p. 666 (#682) ############################################

﻿666	OPERATIONS IN ARK., IND T., AND MO. [Chap, m
Major Sacket and Captain Prince both made earnest appeals not to abandon Arbuckle. I have forwarded those appeals and dissented from them. The reasons for this dissent will, I hope, satisfy the General in-Chief that no change should be made in his instructions. They are, in my opinion, precisely those best calculated to fend off impending troubles, and, if those troubles should occur, to u preserve the safety of the troops.” Without reference to the course the Indian nations will adopt, I wish to call attention to what will be the position of the troops amongst them in regard to supplies if Arkansas goes out. They have heretofore been supplied from Texas, but principally by transportation through Arkansas. In the event contemplated, those lines would be closed, and the only one left would be the old military road from Kansas City via Ports Scott and Gibson. This road runs parallel and near to the Arkansas boundary, and supplies over it would be constantly exposed to seizure.
Having stated all I know affecting the honor and safety of the troops and the interests of the United States, and what has been done in the execution of the orders of the General-in-Chief, I now come to the object of my letter. Owing to the turn affairs have recently taken, the position of an officer from a Southern State out here on duty has become extremely embarrassing ; so much so as to impair his efficiency. Therefore, I urgently request I may be allowed to turn over this command, with my instructions, to Major Sacket, or such other officer as may be selected, and that I may be permitted to return to Washington City, where I can explain my reasons for the step. If those reasons should prove unsatisfactory, I am prepared to resign my commission.
I respectfully suggest it has never been the policy of any government to employ officers to-operate against their own section of country.

Headquarters of the Army, City of Hew York:
Sir : In the present state of affairs in this quarter, I deem it to be my duty to make a special report with reference to the Saint Louis Arsenal. The arsenal buildings and grounds are completely commanded by hills immediately in their rear and within easy range. I learn from sources which I consider reliable that it is the intention of the executive of this State to cause batteries to be erected on these hills and also upon the island opposite to the arsenal. I am further informed that, should such batteries be erected, it is contemplated by the State authorities, in the event of the secession of the State from the Union, to demand the surrender of the arsenal.
The command at the arsenal at the present consists of nine officers and about four hundred and thirty enlisted men, made up of a detachment of ordnance, Captain Totten’s company of the Second Artillery, Captain Lyon’s company of the Second Infantry, and Fourth Artillery, and general-service recruits. While this force would probably be able to resist successfully an assaulting party greatly superior to itself in numbers, it could not withstand the fire of the batteries situated as above indicated.

Captain Lyon, Second Infantry, commanding the troops at Saint Louis Arsenal, wouid respectfully submit to his Excellency Richard Yates, governor of Illinois, that in view of imminent danger of an attack at this point by the secessionists upon this arsenal, the custom-house, treasury, and post-office in Saint Louis, it would be well to communicate with the authorities in Washington for the purpose of holding the six regiments called for from his State in readiness for service here. At Jefferson Barracks, ten miles below, quarters for three thousand men could be had, and some one thousand or two thousand could be quartered here. A sufficient excuse also exists in the fact that the four regiments called for from this State cannot be had. As the arms of this arsenal are the main object of attack here, it might be well for Governor Yates to make requisition for a large supply of arms, and get them shipped from here to Springfield.*

General Cameron, Secretary of War;
Dear General: I send inclosed for your information three letters just received from Saint Louis. The writers were not aware of some important measures for their safety which you have already taken. A great handle is made (and with wonderful success) of the false idea that the efforts of the administration are directed not to national defense, but to the subjugation of the South. All this does but impose upon us the more stringent necessity to make sure of Saint Louis and Cairo. The fact is indisputable. The how is not for me, and I do not choose to trouble you with details. I beg pardon for so often obtruding myself upon you in regard to this particular subject, but my anxiety about it is extreme.
Your friend and obedient servant,

Saint Louis, April 22,1861.
Dear Sir : Permit me respectfully to express an idea in relation to our adverse circumstances as a nation, referring, however, more particularly to the circumstances of the times in Missouri. I beg leave to state that treason and revolt are becoming rampant in Missouri, and even in Saint Louis. Rumors of the Government sending twenty-five thousand men from other States to protect the arsenal here have produced immense excitement, and if such order should be issued I should apprehend much danger would arise, and perhaps the State would be led into the vortex of secessionism. I therefore suggest, with all deference, that if Major Anderson be sent here, and a portion of the Regular Army, as they arrive from the West, be placed under his command, all excitement would subside, and our State be preserved in the Union and under “ our fathers’ flag.” The Saint Louis Republican of this morning, in an editorial article, thinks there is no danger to the public property to be apprehended, provided no increased irritating causes may arise. I fear nevertheless that there are secret associations actively employed here to take advantage of any and every occasion which may arise in order to impel the State from the Union. No doubt such persons and associations are regardless of human life, and under the influence of disorganizing and, I may say, satanic passions. Every true patriot here is endeavoring to use his influence to preserve our institutions and to regard the allegiance we owe to the General Government, in the hope that when Congress is convened some plan may be adopted to calm and bring into order and reinstate fraternal good feeling in our convulsed country. I pray to the great Ruler of all, that His gracious Spirit may guide our rulers to wise and kind counsels and decisions.
It appears that Mr. Howard has been appointed collector of the customs at Saint Louis. While I should have preferred Capt. Barton Able, yet it is a matter of congratulation that the infidel Boernstein has not been appointed. I regret, too, the appointment of Dr. Hammer as physi-

cian for the marine hospital, for he is also an avowed infidel. Permit me, in conclusion, to earnestly recommend a good man, and one who has been most actively devoted to your party, for appointment to some good office, such as paymaster in the Army. He has lost his situation as secretary of the school board purely on account of his Republican partyism. Personally nine-tenths of the members of the board would have voted for his re-election were he not objectionable as a member and leader of the “ Wide Awakes.” He is, I think, a most trustworthy man, faithful to all his engagements. I have hastily written the foregoing amidst the pressure of several cases.
Most respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,
W. W. GREECE.
Saint Louis, April 22,1861.
Hon. Edward Bates:
My Dear Old Friend: I have this moment returned from a visit to Captain Lyon at the arsenal. I find matters there in confusion as to the command, and that the force is inadequate to the defense of the place. It seems Captain Lyon is in command of the troops, and Major Hagner of the ordnance $ that General Harney has to be in many matters consulted. I think this should be remedied at once, by placing somebody in the supreme command in all respects.
Captain Lyon has only about three hundred a id sixty men in all, and of these about thirty are sick and thirty others are prisoners. The walls are long, and cannot be lined with so few men. Captain Lyon has received no authority to accept and arm volunteers. There are plenty of good men in the city, ready and anxious to volunteer at once. This should be attended to immediately.
The secessionists here have changed their tactics completely. Such is the excitement created here by the calling out of the militia, that they are confident the people of this State will vote her out of the Union, and they have good grounds to think so. They are, therefore, for leaving everything to the people, and committing no violence. They have substituted the false charge that Mr. Lincoln intends to subjugate the South in lieu of their own lawless acts, and have suddenly become the most law-abiding citizens. If the State goes out, they expect the public property belonging to the United States to pass ipso facto to them. This is my own inference as to their plans, but I think it is correct.
Captain Lyon agrees with me that both the arsenal and barracks are untenable as military positions. It therefore requires a large force to maintain the rights of the Government. To send the militia from any non-slaveholding State would be in my opinion most injudicious. It would inflame the popular mind to a very dangerous degree. What I ’ propose and earnestly recommend is to enroll volunteers of this State, purging them all with an oath, to the number of three, four,.or five thousand men. This number can be easily obtained if it be understood they are not to leave the State. It would place Saint Louis in the hands of the Union men, and thus give them courage, which they now lack, and it could excite but little jealousy. It would also show that there were Union men in Missouri, which is important at this time. The Government would lose nothing in permitting them to remain here, for I think they should be kept here at all events. They would not lose their citizenship by being enrolled. There is much talk in certain quarters of u superseding ” the convention, and we may need all our citizens here.
Permit me also to suggest that it would be well to quietly remove a

great portion of the arms and munitions of war now at the barracks to Cairo, with the avowed purpose of arming the troops to be there mustered into the service. One great point to be gained by the secessionists in capturing the arsenal is to get the arms for the State, which is now almost wholly without arms of any kind. I will be here ten days or perhaps two weeks, and any service I can render the Government will be cheerfully done.
Your sincere friend,
C. GIBSON.

Dear Sir : The trying times in which we And ourselves demand that every lover of his country and constitutional liberty should speak out, and in this communication I desire to state my views and offer a few suggestions. I am in hopes that the administration will not desert us in the hour of peril, and allow the Union men in this city to be bound hand and foot by our secession governor and his minute-men. There is a desire on his part to get the State in antagonism to the Federal authorities by means, first, of an arming of our State, and then when all is ready we will be turned over to the South. I desire to call your attention to the latter clause of the inclosed slip, taken from the Evening News of yesterday. It shows the immense importance of this city in the coming contest, and demonstrates to me that it should be in the possession of the Government represented by the old flag. For this purpose I would suggest that the Western volunteers be rendezvoused at their respective capitals, which are in connection with Saint Louis by rail, and at a given time they be sent to Alton, and moved to Saint Charles, in our own State. By this means we have communication cut off by the river and North Missouri Bailroad. Then a portion of this command can be moved to the Maramec Biver at Glencoe, and the communication is cut off by the Pacific Bailroad; and then with the barracks, which are in our possession, we are masters of the position, with free intercourse with Saint Louis. Then we have a rallying-point for our Union men in this State. We of Saint Louis have borne the burden and heat of the day, and we now ask that a sufficient force for our protection be sent to our city. With this city in the possession of the United States forces the State cannot be armed, and we are saved to the Union. These are the sentiments of all the unconditional men that I have spoken to, and I offer them for what they are worth.
With respect, I remain, your friend,
CHABLES WIGGINS.

OUR LEGISLATURE.
Governor Jackson has ordered the legislature of Missouri to convene in extra session on next Thursday week, the 2d of May, u for the purpose of enacting such laws and adopting such measures as may be deemed necessary and proper for the more perfect organization and equipment of the militia of this State, and to raise the money and such other means as may be required to place the State in a proper attitude of defense.”
In assembling in this extra session, the legislature, we trust, will exhibit less of bigoted partisanism and a livelier regard for the true 43 R R	.

interests of the State than it manifested at the last session. This hour of gloom and danger is no time for flippancy or trifling—no time for displays of personal vanity or partisan spite—no time for the exhibition of seetionhl bigotry and malevolence. The common welfare and the interests of our State—nay, the very existence of our beloved commonwealth—may be at stake, and the crisis demands not only the highest human wisdom, but the greatest forbearance and concession.
We want no hostility between the city and the remainder of the State. The interests of the two are one, and the effort for the maintenance of those interests*should be united. Acting separately, we would only fall a prey to enemies. Acting together, we can defend our rights, maintain our individuality, and assert a dignity which our enemies as well as our friends will be bound to respect.
The sentiment in the city is in favor of neutrality, and this is the policy demanded by the interests of the State. If the legislature resolves to arm the State, let it be understood and declared that it is to be an arming purely and solely in defense of neutrality; an arming in defense of our soil; an arming to protect all Federal property, and to maintain all Federal institutions in the State; an arming for the protection of every citizen, high or low, great or humble, in the enjoyment of his rights.
On such a basis the State and the city, we believe, may act harmoniously together, and acting thus in concert, they may defy all enemies and invaders. The city can furnish money, can cast cannon, can manufacture muskets and cartridges, and provide the munitions of war. It can concentrate the supplies for an army, manufacture clothing for troops, and, with its vast means of transportation, bear an army with all necessary material and supplies to almost any point within the State. All this the city can do, and will do, if it has assurances that its contributions will be used only in legitimate defense, and for the maintenance nf peace and the laws.

Capt. Nathaniel Lyon,
Commanding Department of the West:
Sir : The President of the United States directs that you enroll in the military service of the United States the loyal citizens of Saint Louis and vicinity, not exceeding, with those heretofore enlisted, ten thousand in number, for the purpose of maintaining the authority of the United States; for the protection of the peaceable inhabitants of Missouri; and you will, if deemed necessary for that purpose by yourself and by Messrs. Oliver T. Filly, John How, James O. Broadhead, Samuel T. Glover, J. Wilzie, and Francis P. Blair, jr., proclaim martial law in the city of Saint Louis.
The additional force hereby authorized shall be discharged, in part or in whole, if enlisted, as soon as it appears to you and the gentlemen above named that there is no danger of an attempt on the part of the enemies of the Government to take military possession of the city of Saint Louis, or put the city in the control of a combination against the Government of the United States; and whilst such additional force remains in the service the same shall be governed by the Buies and Articles of War, and such special regulations as you may prescribe. I shall like the force heretofore directed to be enrolled to be under your command.
The arms and other military stores in the Saint Louis Arsenal not needed for the forces of the United States in Missouri must be removed to Springfield, or some other safe place of deposit in the State of Illinois, as speedily as practicable, by the ordnance officer in charge at Saint Louis.

Saint Louis Arsenal, April 30,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington:
Sir : I am accepting all the troops that offer, and at this time some 3,300 have offered, and 3,082 are armed. Deeming the emergencies pressing, and fully requiring the Government to avail itself of all available resources, I shall still accept these volunteers till countermanding orders are received. This is unavoidable, both because the Government needs the services of these men, and because of the fear of State tyranny to force them into the secession ranks. No doubt 10,000 men can be raised here, and indications are that they will be needed, sooner or later, to meet the determined purpose of the State authorities to overturn the authority of the General Government, which, if true to herself, can maintain it here.
I suffer much the want of proper facilities. I am often in want of means to send a reliable messenger speedily to some point in the vicinity, and should have some horses for the purpose. The State is doubtless

getting ready to attack Government troops with artillery. The Government should put the artillery here in condition for active service, and some fifty horses are needed at once. I have appointed a citizen to act as quartermaster and commissary, but, as before reported, he has no funds at his command, though this difficulty is somewhat avoided by referring certified accounts to Major McKinstry, but the want of experience in these matters on the part of this appointee is badly felt. A little experience, however, may measurably remove this difficulty* Camp equipage much needed. Every building is occupied to its greatest capacity, and many are now out of doors. I have sent some six hundred to the marine hospital, and three other volunteer companies, together with Captain Totten’s company (F, Second Artillery), to occupy buildings outside the arsenal, hired for this purpose, both to give them shelter and occupy commanding positions, which the secessionists had intended to occupy themselves, and upon which they openly avowed they would plant siege batteries to reduce this place. This exasperates them, and has given rise to a singular correspondence, which, when convenient, 1 will lay before the War Department. Unless otherwise ordered, I shall proceed to execute the foregoing views, so far as in my power, towards securing the Government interests here. An armed steamer is needed to ply from Alton to Cairo and in connection with this place. As soon as possible troops will occupy Jefferson Barracks, but in view of impending emergencies this will be but temporarily.

Hdqrs. Fort Leavenworth, Kans., April 30,1861. Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen.,	*
Headquarters Army, Washington, D. G.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that I arrived at this post with my headquarters, band, E and F companies of the Second Infantry, from Fort Kearney on yesterday, having marched from Fort Kearney to Omaha in eight days and a half, a distance of one hundred and eighty-five miles, crossing by Deep Ford the Platte, and by ferry the Pawnee Loup Fork 5 the command consisting of one colonel, one adjutant, one regimental quartermaster, one captain, two first lieutenants, and one hundred and sixty-one rank and file.
1 was delayed at Omaha four days waiting the arrival of a boat. While there I received telegraphic dispatches that the citizens at Saint Joseph intended to obstruct my passing, and also to prevent the command from Fort Randall from passing. I also was shown a dispatch from the president of the Saint Joe and Hannibal Railroad that that command could not pass over that road without meeting with resistance, and that for fear of injury to the road he declined to transport them. Hearing at this time General Harney had left Saint Louis and the department, I immediately assumed the authority to issue to the commander of the troops from Randall the inclosed order, Ko. 1, and wrote to him the inclosed communication, which I hope will meet the approval of the Lieutenant-General commanding the Army.
I also made arrangement with a patriotic merchant at Omaha, by the name of McCormick, to hire wagons, advance subsistence, and such funds as may be required for this command, taking sight drafts on the

commissary and quartermaster at Saint Louis, Mo. Please give orders to have these drafts met.	'	✓
The distance from Omaha to Marengo, where the railroad terminates, is one hundred and seventy-five miles, and which ought to be marched in eight days. The hire of the wagons will be from $3.50 to $4 per day.
On descending the Missouri the captain of the steamer received a dispatch from the owner or agent of the line at Brownsville that the military at Saint Joe consisted of a battery of four cannon and about two hundred arm ed infantry ; that if I attempted to pass Saint Joe I would be fired on and the boat injured; that he must land the troops at Belmont, five miles above, and I could march four miles to Palermo, nine miles below Saint Joe. I determined to do so to save the boat, but on arriving at Belmont an express arrived from the agent that the Missouri troops had relinquished the idea of attacking me, and that I would be permitted to pass unmolested,” which I did without any demonstration whatever, having my men formed, muskets loaded, bayonets fixed, ready for any emergency.
On my arrival at this post I found Captain Steele, Second Dragoons, had taken into service parts of three volunteer companies from Leavenworth City, under Captains McCook, Cozzens, and Clayton, numbering one hundred and twenty, rank and file. These troops I shall discharge to day, believing my force at present sufficient to guard the public property at this post against any rabble or detached secessionists formed or forming in this vicinity.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
D. S. MILES,
Colonel Second Infantry, Commanding.
Albany, May 1,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir: I wish to call your attention to certain matters connected with the affairs of the State of Missouri, and particularly as regards the arsenal at Saint Louis.
1st. There seems but very little doubt at the present time, particularly in Illinois, as regards the secession of the State of Missouri from the Union. The secession movement in Northern Missouri and along the line of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Bailroad is scarcely stronger in any Southern State.
2d. Judging from what has been done elsewhere by the various seceding States, one of the first acts of secession by Missouri would be the seizure of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Bailroad, the interruption, if not the entire suppression, of Government and free State transportation and travel over it, and, if the contest continues, in the entire confiscation of the road and its property, as far as concerns Northern and Eastern interests.
3d. I also think that it is of vital importance to the Government that the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Bailroad be preserved to its owners, and that its free and uninterrupted use be maintained at all times and at ail hazards. It furnishes the only accessible and speedy route by which the Government can communicate with Kansas, Nebraska, and Utah, or with its military posts along the Western and Northwestern frontier to the foot of the Boeky Mountains, and, if allowed to fall into and remain in the hands of an enemy, it is easy to see how difficult and well-nigh impossible in such an emergency it would be for the Government topre-

OPERATIONS IN ARK., IND. T., AND MO.
serve its Western Territories and military posts, for tlie danger to which they would be exposed would indeed be serious, and they could only be supported at immense expense and loss both of time and of means.
4th. Quincy, in Illinois, which from the course of the Mississippi River projects into the Missouri at a distance of sixty-five miles west of Saint Louis, presents immense advantages as a military post, and as such should be occupied by the Government. By merely looking at the map you can see what an important position is Quincy. It is the key to [Northern Missouri, Kansas, Utah, Nebraska, California, and Oregon. Missouri once against the Federal Government, the only present feasible and expeditious road by which troops, munitions, provisions, transportation, and general travel can pass is the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad, over Northern Missouri, between those Western sections and the country east of the Mississippi River. The forces to be placed at Quincy should be placed there at once, to keep open the communication by way of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad.
5th. To further strengthen the Government position at Quincy as a key to the Western section, I should strongly urge the removal of the arsenal now at Saint Louis to Quincy. The‘disadvantages of the present locality are manifest. Situated in what may soon be a disaffected country, it is at any moment liable to attack, and even at the present moment has been threatened. Saint Louis in itself commands nothing—is in reality a key to nothing. The site of the arsenal is disadvantageous, as it can readily be commanded from adjacent heights, and its original location was probably on account of its vicinity to a large city, whence supplies could easily be obtained. The present difficulties show that such a vicinity for Federal property only renders more liable to attack. As to the supplies, they are in a great degree derived from Illinois, and not a small part of them from that part of Illinois which finds its outlets at Quincy.
At Quincy, with its eighteen thousand inhabitants, and to which one of the finest sections of the Western country is tributary, an arsenal could be furnished in all abundance, and cheaper than at Saint Louis. But the great public commendation for the establishment of an arsenal there is that it could and should be made an all-important auxiliary in securing the command of this very much needed and useful key to our Western communication. The facilities possessed by the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad for the transportation of munitions of war, troops, &e., are very great, and the speed and easiness of communication by that route with the Western posts cannot be too much valued. I would strongly urge upon you the necessity of your immediate attention to this jnatter, as I deem the change of the arsenal from Saint Louis to Quincy and the protection and preservation of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad as of immense importance to the country.
I remain, yours, very truly,
ERASTUS CORNING.

Hon. Secretary of War:
Sir: Mr. J. L. Bittinger, recently appointed postmaster at Saint Joseph, Mo., arrived here yesterday, and gave me information in regard to secession movements in that State, which I take the liberty of conveying to you.
He states that while descending the Missouri River he met with a Mr. Jeff. Thompson, who iriformed him, not supposing that he was in favor

of the Union, that Lieutenant Cooke, now at Fort Leavenworth, had told him (Thompson) confidentially that the dragoons stationed at that post had pledged themselves to co-operate with the secessionists in whatever schemes they might determine upon, and he remarked that he himself—their commander—intended to head them in the project. Lieutenant Cooke further observed that it was his determination, in case Missouri seceded, to do all he could to transfer the Government property in his charge to the State authorities, and in the event that Missouri did not secede, that he would resign his commission and offer his services to the South.
Mr. Bittinger says that the disunionists in Saint Joseph are organized, have possessed themselves of Government arms, and are meditating the capture of Fort Leavenworth. There are now in Saint Joseph, he states, three hundred and seventy-four Union men, who form four companies, which will placed at the disposal of the Federal administration. They have no arms, however, although they have applied for some—to Major Tan Yliet, I believe; but they were refused on the ground that the persons applying had no order from the Secretary of War. The Union volunteers of Saint Joseph beg that you will give them such written authority as will enable them to procure the necessary arms and equipments without any further delay.
Having fulfilled what I deem my duty in imparting to you the above information, I have the honor to be, sir, vour obedient servant,
JOHN R. ATKINSON.
Saint Louis, May 4,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War: *
Dear Sir : Our regiments have been mustered into service now nearly two weeks, and requisitions have been sent to Philadelphia and other points for accouterments, blankets, haversacks, tents, clothing, and other articles absolutely necessary for the health, comfort, and efficiency of the men, and as yet we have not even received a reply. Our men have enrolled under the most trying circumstances, in the very face of armed enemies, with no State government to back us and furnish us with necessaries until the ordinary machinery of the Federal Government can be brought to our assistance, nor a city government or rich men in a unanimously loyal community to advance money for our assistance and comfort, as is the case with all the regiments now being raised in the free States. We have, by being mustered into service and standing underarms naked and without clothing, saved millions of dollars of Government property, chiefly munitions of war, and as soon as we shall be suitably equipped are ready to take the field and confront the enemies of the Government wherever it may be your pleasure to send us. Under these circumstances I appeal to you to give the necessary orders on the quartermasters at Philadelphia and at other points to fill the requisitions which I send you by this messenger to furnish the quartermaster at this post with the funds necessary to maintain the troops here in comfort so long as it shall be your pleasure to keep them at this post.
I understand that some of the accouterments usually furnished by the Ordnance Department, such as cartridge boxes and bayonet scabbards, and some other small military stores, such as buttons, ordered by the officers of the regiments on private account, have been seized by parties in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. It is bad enough to face our enemies in this outpost of danger in the condition we find ourselves, but it is

too bad to be robbed by our friends. If you can apply any corrective to this I shall feel under great and lasting obligations.
Respectfully,

P. S.—The service cannot be anticipated by requisitions. Authority . must be given to the quartermaster to draw for money, say for $100,000. McKinstry is heartily disposed to do all that he can for the maintenance of the Government, and there is no ground for the nonsense that has been put afloat by those who want his position here.

The aggregate of the quota of militia called out from Missouri under the first proclamation of the President is 3,123 men. To arm and equip that number orders have already been issued to the United States mustering officers to make requisitions from the arsenals at Saint Louis and Pittsburgh. So also camp and garrison equipage have already been ordered to be furnished for that number of men. Fatigue clothing of the description now given to volunteers in the service here can be provided in a short time if desired, or, at all events, as soon as the troops in this city and those under the command of Generals Patterson and Butler are supplied. It will be impossible to furnish clothing to your troops promptly. In New York and Pennsylvania their troops have either furnished themselves or been furnished, relying for reimbursement of the expenditure hereafter by the General Government.

Resolved by the General Council of the Choctaw Nation assembled, That we view with deep regret and great solicitude the present unhappy political disagreement between the Northern and Southern States of the American Union, tending to a permanent dissolution of* the Union and the disturbance of the various important relations existing with that Government by treaty stipulations and international laws, and portending much injury to the Choctaw government and people.
Resolved further, That we must express the earnest desire and ready hope entertained by the entire Choctaw people, that any and all political disturbances agitating and dividing the people of the various States may be honorably and speedily adjusted; and the example and blessing, and fostering care of their General Government, and the many and friendly social ties existing with their people, continue for the enlightenment in moral and good government and prosperity in the material concerns of life to our whole population.
Resolved further, That in the event a permanent dissolution of the American Union takes place, our many relations with the General Government must cebse, and we shall be left to follow the natural affections, education, institutions, and interests of our people, which indissolubly bind us in every way to the destiny of our neighbors and brethren of the Southern States, upon whom we are confident we can rely for the preservation of our rights of life, liberty, and property, and the continuance of many acts of friendship, general counsel, and material support.
Resolved further, That we desire to assure our immediate neighbors, the people of Arkansas and Texas, of our determination to observe the amicable relations in every way so long existing between us, and the firm reliance we have, amid any disturbances with other States, the rights and feelings so sacred to us will remain respected by them and be protected from the encroachments of others.
Resolved further, That his excellency the principal chief be requested to inclose, with an appropriate communication from himself, a copy of these resolutions to the governors of the Southern States, with the request that they be laid before the State convention of each State, as many as have assembled at the date of their reception, and that in such as have not they be published in the newspapers of the State.
Resolved, That these resolutions take effect and be in force from and after their passage.

To His Excellency John Ross,
Principal Chief Cherokee Nation:
Sir : It may now be regarded as almost certain that the States having slave property within their borders will, in consequence of repeated Northern aggressions, separate themselves and withdraw from the Federal Government.
South Carolina, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana have already, by action of the people, assumed this attitude. Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland will probably pursue the same course by the 4th of March next. Your people, in their institutions, productions, latitude, and natural sympathies, are allied to the common brotherhood of the slaveholding States. Our people and yours arc natural allies in war and friends in peace. Your country is salubrious and fertile, and possesses the highest capacity for future progress and development by the application of slave labor. Besides this, the contiguity of our territory with yours induces relations of so intimate a character as to preclude the idea of discordant or separate action.
It is well established that the Indian country west of Arkansas is looked to by the incoming administration of Mr. Lincoln as fruitful fields,

We hope to find in your people friends willing to co-operate, with the South in defense of her institutions, her honor, and her firesides, and with whom the slaveholding States are willing to share a common future, and to afford protection commensurate with your exposed condition and your subsisting monetary interests with the General Government.
As a direct means of expressing to you these sentiments, I have dispatched my aide-de camp, Lieut. Col. J. J.

Sir: In reply to your inquiries in regard to the policy of,this Government on the subject of accepting military aid from Southern States which are not yet members of the Confederacy, and especially as to Arkansas, I beg leave to state that thus far this department has thought proper to decline for the present all tenders from those States, simply because the forces easily and rapidly raised in convenient proximity to the scenes of operation have been ample for all the needs of the country.
Since the forced surrender of Fort Sumter to the forces of the Confederate States, followed by a most warlike proclamation from the Exec-

utive of the Washington Government, the probability that serious and perhaps long-continued hostilities will ensue is greatly increased.
If the war shall be commenced with the spirit which seems to animate our enemies, there is every reason to anticipate the operations of both the belligerents will be conducted on a much more imposing scale than this continent has ever witnessed f and I may add that the general opinion preponderates strongly in that direction.
While this Government has an unfaltering confidence in the means and resources, pecuniary, moral, and military, of the Confederate States, as they now exist, to defend themselves against all assaults and to repel all their enemies, it yet by no means undervalues the assistance which it is in the power of the border slave States to render ; and of these latter there is no one to which the people of this Confederacy have looked with more undoubting confidence for cordial sympathy and support than the State of Arkansas.
It is not possible yet to state absolutely that this Government will be in condition to need forces drawn from any State not in the Confederacy, but it is extremely probable that in the event of war (now, in its widest sense, apparently inevitable), which shall continue through the approaching summer, a brigade organized in conformity to the act of Congress u to provide for the public defense,?? will be gladly accepted at an early day in the next fall—say about the middle or last of August. Such a military organization, if required, as I think it will be, would be composed of* course, as similar, organizations will be, Horn the several Confederate States. It would be expected to elect its own officers, but would be subject to the control of such field officers as the President of the Confederate States might place over it.
All the signs of the times, as I view them, so conclusively favor the belief that war in its sternest phase is upon us, that I have not hesitated to intimate how strongly we rely on your State for active co-operation in what is, after all, a common defense. That she will prove true to herself, and so prove true to this Confederacy, I never for a moment have questioned.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKEB.
War Department, C. S. A.,
Montgomery, April 17, 1861.
His Excellency Governor Bector^ &c. :
Sir: War existing between this Government and that at Washington, forced by the perfidious conduct of the last, preparations are being made on both sides for the most active hostilities. Under these circumstances it is not improbable that forces will be sent from the North along the Ohio and Mississippi Bivers to burn our cities and devastate our country. It becomes, therefore, the imperative duty of this Government to guard against these possible results by every means in their power. The defenses of the Mississippi require the erection of at least four additional batteries at eligible points along the banks of that river. It is proposed to construct one of these batteries at or near Helena, in the State of Arkansas, and I trust your excellency will grant permission for the work to be done. I have the less hesitation in making this ap-jilication to you, because I feel assured Arkansas will be identified with the States of this Confederacy, and that the danger which threatens is common to her as well as to ourselves. It cannot be that Mississippi,

Louisiana, and Texas can be assailed in their political and material rights and interests without Arkansas being sensibly affected.
I trust, therefore, that through due regard to the exigencies and necessities of the times, the comity existing between Arkansas and the States of the Confederate Government, as well as their joint welfare and future relations, your excellency will promptly accord to me the privilege of erecting, arming, and manning the battery to which I have referred at or near Helena. Events are hastening to a bloody issue, and there is no time to be lost in our movements.
I have the honor to be, with the highest consideration and respect, your obedient servant,
L. P. WALKER.
Kashville, April 21,1861.
General Walker, Montgomery:
Dear Sir : I arrived here to-day from the Arkansas River, and it is with pleasure that I report a complete revolution in public sentiment since I left. Tennessee is with the cotton States, and you may now consider the slave States a unit. 44 Armed neutrality” has no advocates, not even the authors of that card, which was conceived in error. The patriotism which would stand by unmoved and witness the murder of your neighbor’s wife and children, because of an imaginary line, is not the growth of Tennessee, nor of any State where the rays of a genial sun shine.
The legislature meets next Thursday, and the plan is to pass the ordnance of secession and let the people ratify it, arm the State, and stand ready to march South or Korth.
Arkansas will go out 6th of May before breakfast. The Indians come next. Companies are forming rapidly, and I expect both my sons to go whenever the insolent invader shall tread a hostile foot upon our soil. The slave States a unit are omnipotent in defense.
Arkansas and Tennessee are wild with indignation at the insolence and usurpation of the buffoon at Washington City. They are ready for the fight, every man, white and black. The blacks in Arkansas would be entirely reliable, if necessary, in defense. I know the fact is so. They are more obedient and loyal than ever before. When the fight is over, a separation of the free blacks from the slaves is the true plan to protect and guard the institution. It is one of the domestic relations that I have studied with much care.
I indorse without a proviso every act in the cotton States, done separately or together, by President, Congress, and Cabinet, and am ready to aid in all that may be necessary to accomplish what has been undertaken.
The stores for troops at Fort Smith were seized as they went up the Arkansas River and stored in Pine Bluff, one mile from my plantation. Flour and bacon chiefly.
I think Arkansas, Virginia, and Tennesse will be represented in your next Congress, called for the 29th instant.
I don’t think there is any danger of an overflow. The Mississippi is level full, but not against the levee above JSTapoleon. The Arkansas has a 10 foot bank, and falling, when I came out a few days ago. The prospect for a com crop fine. I planted one hundred acres for your army. The cotton crop is just coming up and promises well.
With streamers gay push forward with sanguine cheer. The God of

Executive Office, Little Rock, Ark.y April 22, 1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron,
Secretary of Wary Washington City:
In answer to your requisition for troops from Arkansas to subjugate the Southern States, I have to say that none will be furnished. The demand is only adding insult to injury. The people of this commonwealth are freemen, not slaves, and will defend to the last extremity their honor, lives, and property against Northern mendacity and usurpation.
H. M. RECTOR,
Governor of Arkansas.
Montgomery, April 22,1861. Gov. Henry M. Rector, Little Rocky Ark. ;
Sir: Your patriotic response to the requisition of the President of the United States for troops to coerce the Confederate States justifies the belief that your people are prepared to unite with us in repelling the common enemy of the South. Yirginia needs our aid. I therefore request you to furnish one regiment of infantry without delay, to rendezvous at Lynchburg, Ya. It must consist of ten companies, or not less than sixty-four men each. The regiment will be entitled to one colonel, one lieutenant-colonel, one major, one adjutant from the line of lieutenants, one* sergeant-major from the enlisted men. Each company is entitled to one captain, one first lieutenant, two second lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, and two musicians. The officers, except the staff officers, are to be appointed in the manner prescribed by the law of your State. Staff officers are appointed by the President$ the term of service not less than twelve months, unless sooner discharged. They will be mustered into the service at Lynchburg, but transportation and subsistence will be provided from the point of departure. They will furnish their own uniform, but will receive its value in commutation. You have arms and ammunition with which to suppJy them. Answer and say whether you will comply with this request, and, if so, when.
L. P. WALKER.
Little Rock, April 23,1861.
L. P. Walker:
You may be assured of the immediate action of Arkansas in joining the Southern Confederacy) but I have no power, I regret, to comply with your request. Our convention assembles bn the 6th of May. Then we can and will aid.

Montgomery, Ala., April 23] 1861. His Excellency 0. F. Jackson, Governor of Missouri:
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge yours of the 17th instant, borne by Captains Green and Duke, and have most cordially welcomed the fraternal assurances it brings.*
A misplaced but generous confidence has, for years past, prevented the Southern States from making the preparation required by the present emergency, and our power to supply you with ordnance is far short of the will to serve you. After learning as well as I could from the gentlemen accredited to me what was most needful for the attack on the arsenal, I have directed that Captains Green and Duke should be furnished with two 12-pounder howitzers and two 32-pounder guns, with the proper ammunition for each. These, from the commanding hills, will be effective, both against the garrison and to breach the inclosing walls of the place. I concur with you as to the great importance of capturing the arsenal and securing its supplies, rendered doubly important by the means taken to obstruct your commerce and render you unarmed victims of a hostile invasion.
We look anxiously and hopefully for the day when the star of Missouri shall be added to the constellation of the Confederate States of America.
With best wishes, I am, very respectfully, yours,
JEFFERSON DAYTS.

In view of this gratifying fact, those among you sympathizing with our cause would do well to organize military companies, battalions, and regiments, and hold them in readiness for action against our incendiary foe, equally hostile to the entire South.

Sir : Yours of 26th ultimo via Louisville is received. I have no legal authority to furnish the men you desire. Missouri, you know, is yet under the tyranny of Lincoln’s Government, so far, at least, as forms go. We are wofully deficient here in arms, and cannot furnish them at present ; but so far as men are concerned, we have plenty of them, ready, willing, and anxious to march at any moment to the defense of the South. Our legislature has just met, and I doubt not will give me all necessary authority over the matter. If you can arm the men they will go whenever wanted, and to any point where they may be most needed. I send this to Memphis by private hand, being afraid to trust our mails or telegraphs. Let me hear from you by the same means. Missouri can and will put one hundred thousand men in the field, if required. We are using every means to arm our people, and, until we are better prepared, must move cautiously. I write this in confidence.
With my prayers for your success, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Your favor of the 25th ultimo has been received, and I am thankful for your courtesy. I hope, and have reasonable expectations now, that Missouri will soon wheel into line with her Southern sisters, in which case I and my men will be needed here at home. I believe that this portion of Missouri (north of the Missouri Biver) will be the principal battle-ground between the North and the South, as Saint Joseph, with its railroad connections, is the key to Kansas, New Mexico, Jefferson, [?] and Utah, and we have already been notified that the North has determined to hold this portion of the State, even though they lose all the rest of the slaveholding States, and they will either cover it over with dollars or blood, and the choice is for us to make. I have eight companies here in a camp of instruction, by order of our governor, and can assure you that they are all Blue Cockade boys, and if our leaders are disposed to sell this territory for money, our blood will remain at your service.
Yours, most respectfully,

Gov. 0. Harris :
To-day we have information that Arkansas, in Convention, has seceded, by a vote 69 to 1. Tennessee has also seceded, and made large appropriations and ordered an army of 50,000 men.
Arkansas has for several days past been in arms on this frontier for the protection [of] citizens, and the neighboring Indian nations whose interests are identical with her own.
I have news through my scouts that the U. S. troops have abandoned the forts in the Chickasaw country.
Under my orders from the commander-in-chief and governor of Arkansas, I feel authorized to extend to you such military aid as will be required in the present juncture of affairs to occupy and hold the forts.
I have appointed Col. A. H. Word, one of the State senators, and Captain Sparks, attached to this command, commissioners to treat and confer with you on this subject. These gentlemen are fully apprised of the nature of the powers intrusted to myself by the governor of this State, and are authorized to express to you my views of the subject under consideration. I ask, therefore, that you express to them your own wishes in the premises, and believe, my dear sir, that Arkansas cherishes the kindest regards for your people.
I have the honor to subscribe myself, with sentiments of regard, your excellency’s friend and servant,
