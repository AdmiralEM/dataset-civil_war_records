﻿PREFACE
By an act approved June 23,1874, Congress made an appropriation “ to enable the Secretary of War to begin the publication of the Official Becords of the War of the Rebellion, both of the Union and Confederate Armies,” and directed him “ to have copied for the Public Printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order”
Appropriations for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16,1880, has provided “ for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10,000 copies of a compilation of the Official Becords (Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year”; and that “of said number, 7,000 copies shall be for the use of the House of Representatives, 2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, and 1,000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments.”
This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.
The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:
The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence,' orders, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed, is to be accompanied by an Atlas.
In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &c., not embraced in the “reports” proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate) in chronological order.
The 2d Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners.

PREFACE.
The 3d Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specially to the subjects of the first and second series. It will set forth the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in-Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities.
The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union* and Confederate authorities given in that series.

Sir: I have the honor to inclose a copy of a report from Major Lynde, Seventh Infantry, commanding at Fort Fillmore. This report is in all respects unsatisfactory, and subsequent rumors, not yet confirmed, give a still more unfavorable complexion to the state of affairs in the South. These rumors, although so circumstantial as to give them an air of probability, seem incredible. If true, Major Lynde’s abandonment of his position and trusts exposes the command from Arizona and the posts of Forts Stanton and Craig to great danger, if attacked by a superior force. The commanders of these posts are confident of their ability to hold their positions. The regular troops at both posts are under orders to withdraw as soon as the troops from the South have passed up. I have confidence in the commanders of both posts and of the four companies (Captain Moore, First Dragoons) now on the march from Arizona.
At my instance the governor of the Territory will call out the militia of the Territory and will furnish an additional force of mounted volunteers. I hope soon to be able to restore the Territory to its normal condition. This news has roused the people of New Mexico from their apathetic condition, and I have now no doubt that the organization of an efficient home guard and the completion of the volunteer troops that have been called for will be speedily effected.
No official reports of events subsequent to the 26th inst. have been received, but I hope to obtain authentic information before mail leaves. Mery respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

the Southern District, and the second from Captain Gibbs, Mounted Eities, and commander of the mounted force of the immediate command of Major Lynde at the time of his surrender. These reports embody substantially all the information that has yet reached me in relation to this disaster. As Major Lynde’s conduct will be made the subject of judicial investigation, I do not think it proper to express an opinion in advance of that investigation.
I have no later information from Captain Moore’s command. He will have, however, about 300 men, and is fully prepared to defend himself, and is no doubt warned of recent events by the couriers that have been sent to him from Fort Craig and Fort Fillmore.
Fort Craig is in a position to resist attack, except by a very considerable force provided with artillery. The present garrison is three companies of regulars and two of volunteers. It will be re-enforced in two or three days by six companies, four of regulars and two of volunteers. Lieutenant-Colonel Roberts, Mounted Rifles, is in command of the troops in that quarter.
Fort Stanton has been abandoned, and its garrison reached Albuquerque on the 8th and 9th instant.
The intrenchments at Fort Union are now so nearly completed that it can now be defended against a very large force. It is better provided with artillery than any other post, but there is not in the whole department sufficient for a single post of the size and importance of this post.
The greatest exertions are being used to organize a respectable volunteer force, but the progress does not meet my expectations. Seventeen companies have been mustered in. Two companies are expected in a few days from Colorado Territory, and several companies of mounted volunteers are promised by the end of this week.

The colonel commanding the department has learned with great gratification that certain reports and statements with regard to the troops included in the surrender of San Augustine Springs are unfounded and slanderous, and that, notwithstanding the difficulties in which they were involved and the seductions with which they were assailed, they have proved themselves, with a few dishonorable exceptions, loyal and faithful soldiers of the Union.
He sympathizes with them in their misfortune, and trusts that they will bear it with patience and look forward with hope to the period when it will be removed, and San Augustine be remembered only as a watchword and an incentive to renewed exertions for the honor of their, country and its fiag.

Reports of Maj. Isaac Lynch, Seventh TJ. S. Infantry, commanding captured forces.
Hdqrs. Southern District New Mexico,
Fort Fillmore, A. Mex., July 26, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on the night of the 24th instant a deserter from the Texas troops was brought in by our picket, and he informed me that a large body of mounted men, between 300 and 400, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor, Texas troops, were moving up the river, and that he left them at Willow Bar, about 12 miles below the post. Presuming their object to be an attack on the post, I immediately ordered in the two companies of the Seventh Infantry from San Tomas, and kept the garrison under arms until after daylight, when mounted parties were sent out to reconnoiter. In the mean time the enemy passed up the opposite side of the river through the town of San Tomas, where they captured 7 men of my command left behind by the battalion of the Seventh Infantry in the hurry of departure. After extracting from them what information they could in reference to the probable time of the arrival of the troops of Forts Breckinridge and Buchanan, they were released, and joined the post. All property, public and private, belonging to the command was seized and carried off or destroyed.
About 4.30 o’clock p. m. yesterday I moved in the direction of the town of Mesilla, where the Texas troops then were, with six companies of the Seventh Infantry, one acting as artillery, with the howitzer battery of the post and two companies of rifles. One company of infantry, with the band and convalescents, were left to garrison the post, under Lieutenants Stivers and Byan, Seventh Infantry. Dr. Alden also remained behind. My command numbered about 380 men.
About 2 miles from Mesilla I sent Lieutenant Brooks, Seventh Infantry, A. A. A. G., forward with a white flag to demand the surrender of the town. He was met by Major Waller and Colonel Herbert on the part of the Texans, who replied that if I wanted the town I must come and take it. 1 moved the battery forward, and fired two shells at long range, but they burst in the air short of the object. The command continued to advance slowly towards the outskirts of the town, while the battery, which had to be moved by hand, was working through the heavy sand. From a corn field and house on the right we received a heavy fire of musketry, wounding 2 officers and 4 men and killing 3 men. As night was coming on, and the fields and houses on both sides of the road were filled with men, and the howitzers useless, except as a field battery, owing to the difficulty of moving through the sand, I decided to withdraw my force and return to my post. The march back was uninterrupted, and to-day I am fortifying with sand bags, &c., in anticipation of an attack. I have sent an express to Captain Gibbs, directing him to return to Fort Craig with his command, as he cannot join this post now. They have possession of the road above. Orders will be sent, if possible, to the commanders of the troops from Forts Breckinridge and Buchanan to take the nearest route to Fort Craig from a point where the orders reach them.
A re-enforcement of 100 men joined the Texans from Fort Bliss last night. Their force at present, ,with the addition of the citizens of Mesilla, is nearly 700 men. I am hourly expecting an attack. The

Sir: I have the honor to report that I arrived at this post to-day with three companies of the regiment Mounted Rifles on parole. I shall send my official report as soon as I can complete it, which I have not yet been able to do. The express is waiting, and I have not time to write more.
Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,
I. LYNDE,
Major, Seventh Infantry.
To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters DepH Hew Mexico, Santa Fe, H. Mex.
Fort Craig, N. Mex., August 7,1861.
Sir : On the 26th of July I had the honor to report the fact of an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the Texan troops from the town of Mesilla, since which events of the greatest consequence to my command have occurred. They are now prisoners of war.
On that day 1 had reliable information that the enemy would in the course of the night receive a battery of artillery, and if I moved to intercept it with a sufficient force for the purpose they were ready to attack the fort in my absence, and, as I have previously reported, the fort is indefensible against artillery, being perfectly commanded by sand hills for at least half the circle, and the only suppiy of water at the distance of one and a half miles. Other officers, with myself, became convinced that we must eventually be compelled to surrender if we remained in the fort, and that our only hope of saving the command from capture was in reaching some other military post. I therefore ordered the fort to be evacuated, and such public property as could not be transported with the limited means at the post to be destroyed as far as time would allow, and at 1 o’clock a. m. on the 27th of July I took up the line of march for Fort Stanton, which was believed to be the most practicable point to reach, and was reported to be threatened by the enemy. I had no personal knowledge of the road, but it was reported to me that the first day’s march would be 20 miles to Saint Augustine Springs, where there would be abundance of water for all the command.
Until daylight the command advanced without difficulty, but when the sun arose the day became intensely hot, and soon after the men and teams began to show signs of fatigue, and I found that the distance was greater than had been represented. About 6 miles before reaching the Springs commences a short ascent to a pass in the Organ Mountains, and here the men and teams suffered severely with the intense heat and want of water, many men falling and unable to proceed.
Up to this time there was no indication of pursuit. I now determined to push forward with the mounted force to the Springs, and return with

[Chap. XL
water for the suffering men in the rear. When I had nearly reached the Springs word was brought me that a mounted force was approaching in our rear ; but it was believed to be Captain Gibbs, R. M. R., with his command, and soon after that supposition was confirmed by another express.
O11 reaching the Springs I found the supply of water so small as to be insufficient for my command. After procuring all the water that could be transported by the men with me I started back to the main body. After riding some distance I became so much exhausted that I could not sit upon my horse, and the command proceeded without me, under the command of Lieutenant Cressey, R. M. R., and I returned to the Springs. Soon after it was reported to me that a part of the teams had given out and could not be brought up, and that large numbers of the infantry had become totally overpowered with the intense heat. At this time an express from Captain Gibbs reported that eight companies of mounted men, supported by artillery and a large force of* infantry, were approaching our rear guard. I had the u Call to arms ” sounded, and found that I could not bring more than 100 men of the infantry battalion on parade. Captain Gibbs, with a mounted force, now rode into camp, and stated to me that eight companies of mounted Texans (supported by a regiment of infantry, more or less) were approaching ; that they had driven in or captured our rear guard (composed of three companies of infantry) and the men that had given out in the rear. Three of the four mountain howitzers that we had with us were with the wagons in the rear and were captured. They were guarded by one company of infantry acting as artillery. Captain Gibbs also reported that his company, men and horses, had been without water for twenty-four hours.
Under the circumstances I considered our case hopeless; that it was worse than useless to resist ; that honor did not demand the sacrifice of blood after the terrible suffering that our troops had already undergone, and when that sacrifice would be totally useless. A body of mounted Texans followed Captain Gibbs to the vicinity of the camp, when a parley was held, and I surrendered my command to Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor, of the C. S. Army.
The strength of my command at the time of surrender was, Mounted Rifles, 95 rank and file and 2 officers. The infantry I have not the means of stating the exact number, but there were seven companies of the Seventh Infantry, with 8 officers, present. Since I have been at Fort Fillmore my position has been of extreme embarrassment. Surrounded by open or secret enemies, no reliable information could be obtained, and disaffection prevailing even in my own command, to what extent it was impossible to ascertain, but much increased, undoubtedly, by the conduct of officers who left their post without authority. My position has been one of great difficulty, and has ended in the misfortune of surrendering my command to the enemy. The Texan troops acted with great kindness to our men, exerting themselves in carrying water to the famishing ones in the rear; yet it was two days before the infantry could move from the camp, and then only by the assistance of their captors. The officers and men who chose to give their parole were released at Las Cruces, 1ST. Mex.
Inclosed is a copy of the terms of surrender.

Officers, after giving their parole, can elect which route they prefer in leaving the Department of New Mexico to go to any part of the United States.
The enlisted men of the command will be disarmed, and given the liberty of the post of Fort Bliss until instructions can be received from General Yan Dorn, O. S. Army, as to their future disposition.
To all which the commanding officer, J. B. Baylor, lieutenant-colonel, C. S. Army, agrees.

Reports of Captain Alfred Gibbs, Third U. 8. Cavalry.
Fort Craig, August 6,1861.
Colonel : In obedience to orders No. —, of July 15, from your headquarters, I left Albuquerque on the 18th ultimo, and arrived here on the 22d. I started the next day with 100 head of beef cattle for Fort Fillmore, and arrived at the Point of Rocks, 27 miles from the Rio Grande, on the 26th ultimo. I here met Lieutenant Lane, with Company A, Mounted Rifles, and Dr. Steck, Indian agent, who informed me that the Texans were in force at La Mesilla, and would prevent my junction with Major Lynde. I hired a guide, and, turning oft* the road, proceeded that night to pass behind Las Cruces and Doha Ana, hojung to get into Fort Fillmore in rear, and thus to avoid capture. On arriving at San Augustine Springs, or rather the Pass of La Cueva, 5 miles this side, 1 found Major Lynde’s command in full retreat for Fort Stanton. I reported myself, with 35 men of Company I and 10 of Company G, Mounted Rifles—the last the escort to the mail I met upon the road, and which I ordered to join me—to Lieutenant Brooks, Major Lynde’s adjutant, and with him proceeded 5 miles to the front, to report myself to Major Lynde, as directed in your instructions. I also reported to the major that I had seen a force of Texans approaching, and that I thought they would molest our rear. Major Lynde asked what force I had, and I replied 70 men, all told. He said that there were two companies of infantry on rear guard in addition, and that would be sufficient. He then turned back and returned to San Augustine Springs.
It will be well here to mention that the infantry had been marched up to noon 20 miles without water, and that under the bushes by the side of the road over 150 men were lying, unable to rise or to carry their muskets, and useless and disorganized in every way. This was the rear guard on which I was ordered to rely. Major Lynde had not seen it

for several hours. On arriving at the mouth of the canon I assumed command of the cavalry force, consisting of Companies F, B, and I, and a part of G, Mounted Rifles—70 men strong. The Texans, under Colonel Baylor and Major Waller, and about 320 strong (all cavalry), with some dismounted men, and what seemed to be a couple of pieces of artillery, at this time debouched from behind the point of the hill below me to the left, and captured the beef cattle and my two wagons. I deployed 50 men as skirmishers, with 20 men as a reserve; but finding that I was entirely outflanked, I formed column of sections and prepared to charge with drawn pistols.
Before doing this I sent back word to Major Lynde, by an intelligent man, the exact state of affairs. He brought back word to protect the wragons, if possible, and then to fall back on the main camp. As most of the men had thrown away their muskets and gone to the front, I retreated slowly and in good order, forming in line three times, arid keeping the Texans in check by causing them also to form line. Oil arriving at the crest of the Pass I galloped into camp and reported myself to Major Lynde as ready for action, and asked where I should take position. Part of the infantry companies were already formed and men were rapidly falling into ranks. Major Lynde told me to dismount and water my men and horses. As we had been twenty-four hours without water I did so, and was ready in fifteen minutes for duty.
The Texans then began to form on the plateau a quarter of a mile in our rear, and I saw Lieutenant Brooks ride out towards them. Major Lynde at this time sent me word that I could leave for Fort Stanton, but before I could get a sack of flour and a side of bacon as rations for my men Colonel Baylor had arrived, the surrender had been agreed upon by Major Lynde and himself without consulting a single officer, and I was ordered by Major Lynde not to attempt to escape. Upon being informed of the surrender, every officer in the command protested against it; but it was of no avail, and the command of seven companies of the Seventh U. S. Infantry and three companies of Rifles were voluntarily surrendered without striking a blow. After great suffering for want of water we were marched to Las Cruces, when our horses, arms, transportation, &c., were turned over to the Texans.
We left Las Cruces on the 2d instant and arrived here this morning. The Seventh Infantry were to leave on the 3d, and will probably be here to-morrow. I respectfully state that charges against Major Lynde, under the fifty-second and ninety-ninth Articles of War, have been preferred, and are now in the hands of Captain Potter, commanding Seventh Regiment.

25tli instant, and in reply beg to state that I herewith inclose a list of the men and officers included in the surrender, as requested by you, by name, with explanatory remarks.* The number of horses and mules surrendered by me was 100 horses and 2 mules. In addition, 8 horses were stolen. The number of sets of arms and equipments corresponds with the number of men.
In the order directing the paroled men of the Bifles to march into the States, dated the 25th instant, no mention is made of the disposition to be made of the four officers with them or the paroled men of Companies I and G included in the surrender, and now here under my command. I should like to be informed of this at once, and if they are to be embodied in Company F. There will then be three first sergeants with the command. How are they to be disposed of With regard to the books, records, and property pertaining to Company I, Mounted Bifles, a part was kept in Albuquerque, to be forwarded by Captain McFerran to the ordnance officer here, a part is now here in daily use by the whole command, and the balance will be sent, as directed in your letter, to Santa Fe by the first opportunity. I shall be compelled, however, to retain the tents, as the depot here is entirely stripped of them. As soon as the muster rolls are completed, Private Marius, of Company I, not paroled, will be sent to Santa Fe to report, as directed.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Company I, 35 men, mounted. On the night of the 23d reached Point of Rocks, 80 miles, without water. On the morning of the 26th met Captain Lane, Mounted Rifles, from Fort Fillmore, with a train of fifteen wagons, commissary stores, who asked me to stay by him that day, as [he was] afraid of being attacked by the Confederate forces. He advised me not to go to Fort Fillmore, as I was certain to be cut off by their troops. Staid by him all that day. Started at sunset, and turned off the road to the left to avoid the rebels. Made for San Augustine Springs, 45 miles, without water, intending to come in behind Fort Fillmore, and thus avoid the enemy and carry out my instructions.
At noon on the 27th, when within 5 miles of the Springs, met Major Lynde’s command, which had abandQned Fort Fillmore the night before. Rode forward and reported to Major Lynde’s adjutant, Lieutenant Brooks, who told me that Major Lynde was encamped 5 miles in advance, at the Springs. Rode forward with the adjutant, and sent on an express that a party of the enemy were approaching from the rear. Came up to Major Lynde a quarter of a mile this side of the Springs with Lieutenant Cressey, returning to the rear with 40 men of the Mounted Rifles. Reported to Major Lynde and asked for orders. He told me that there were two companies of the Seventh Infantry in rear guard, and that they, with the Rifles, would protect the rear. Filled my canteen at the Springs; rejoined Major Lynde about 2 miles from it, returning to the front without his escort, which had gone to the rear. He told me to protect the rear with the infantry rear guard and the mounted force as long as I saw fit, and then to return to the camp at the Springs. Rejoined the mounted force, then consisting of 70 men, and formed at the foot of the hill in front of the enemy. I found that the infantry rear guard was completely broken down by their long march and want of water; that I had nothing but the mounted force to rely upon. Four of Major Lynde’s baggage wagons, filled with stores, and women and children, completely blocked up the road.
I requested Lieutenant Brooks to try to get a couple of the 12-pounder mountain howitzers that were fastened behind these wagons, and gave him men from my command for that purpose. It was found that the ammunition for these pieces was not in the wagons to which the pieces were fastened, and the effort failed. Finding that my force of 70 men, armed with rifles and pistols only, was opposed to the enemy’s force of 300 men, similarly armed, with the addition of sabers, [which] was rapidly approaching, and the ground was favorable only for a single charge, I sent another messenger to Major Lynde, telling him of the enemy’s near approach and their strength. In order to gain time, I kept deploying into line, and by rapid formations gaining ground by our superior drill, to allow the main force in camp in front to form before I reached them. I then rode rapidly to the front, and reported to Major Lynde with my command that the enemy were about 2 miles in the rear and rapidly advancing. I asked him where I should take up my position. He told me that I might water my command and horses. Time, 20 hours without water. The Springs being made, while I was doing so Major Lynde sent me an order not to move. While watering, Major Lynde sent me word that I could leave for Fort Stanton if I chose. Before I could mount I received another order not to move from camp. I went towards him, distance about 100 yards, and saw him in conversation with two mounted officers, whom I did not know. The enemy at that time were in line of battle about a quarter of a mile to the rear. I heard Major Lynde say, u I agree to these terms,” and I called to some of the officers to come up. When we came up, all the officers being present, I think, Major

Lynde said: u Colonel Baylor, to avoid bloodshed, I conditionally surrender this whole force to you, on condition that officers and their families shall be protected from insult and private property be respected.77 Nearly every officer protested earnestly, and even violently, against this base surrender; but Major Lynde said: UI am commander of these forces, and I take upon my shoulders the responsibility of my action in the matter.77 The altercation by Major Lynde’s subordinates became so violent that Colonel Baylor asked who was commander of that force and responsible for their action, when Major Lynde again repeated as above. The adjutant then read aloud, by Major Lynde’s order, the terms of the surrender as made by him, when I insisted that the officers and men should be allowed to select any route they might choose in leaving the country, and this was readily granted.
We remained where we were during the night, suffering greatly for want of water. The next day we marched to Las Cruces, on the Bio Grande, 20 miles distant. The following day (the 29th) all the public property in our charge was turned over to the rebel forces. On the 1st of August the oath was administered to all the men and officers.

Report and statement of Asst. Surg. J. Cooper McKee. JJ. 8. Army.
Albuquerque, N. Mex., August 16,1861.
Sir: I hereby inclose, through you, to the honorable Secretary of War, my parole of honor, given at Las Cruces, N. Mex., to the commanding officer of the Texas troops, after the base surrender of our forces by Major Lynde, of the Seventh U. S. Infantry (on the 27th July, 1861).
I also inclose a copy of an order to destroy my property. I made the destruction as complete as possible without the aid of fire. This I was forbidden to use. I am unable to make out any return of my property, as in the confusion my retained copy of last year’s return was lost. I will be under the necessity of waiting until my arrival in Washington.
I also report that my hospital steward, Charles E. Eitzwilliams, chose to remain with the Texans as a prisoner of war. All paroled troops, officers and men, are ordered to Fort Union, preparatory to leaving for Fort Leavenworth, Kans.
I would be under deep obligations to the Surgeon-General if he would have me exchanged immediately, as I am anxious to be again in active service.
I am unable to express to you the deep grief, mortification, and pain I, with the other officers, have endured from this cowardly surrender of a brave and true command to an inferior force of the enemy, without having one word to say or firing a single shot. I, among other officers, entered my solemn protest against the surrender, but we were peremptorily told by Major Lynde that he was the commanding officer. To see old soldiers and strong men weep like children, men who had faced the battle’s storm in the Mexican war, is a sight that 1 hope I may never again be present at. A braver or truer command could not be found than that which has in this case been made the victim of cowardice and imbecility.
The number of women in this command should receive the rigid scrutiny of the War Department, as five officers had their wives and

children at this post (Fort Fillmore, N. Mex.). The camp women and children I will not pretend to enumerate. Yet all these were kept in the garrison to paralyze us when in presence of the enemy, seemingly preparing for the result—a surrender. Major Lynde was warned of this repeatedly, but was too weak to act. This has been one of the causes why I and others are now prisoners of war.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. COOP Eft McKEE, Assistant Surgeon, U. 8. Army.
To the Surgeon-General, U. S. A., Washington, D. G.
Statement of Asst. Surg. J. G. McKee, TJ. S. Army.
Dr. McKee agrees with McNally [No. 5] so far as his deposition. He adds to this that if Lynde had laid down [?] in and given the word forward they would have taken the town.
Before going into town asked Major Lynde if he could take a house for his wounded. He said certainly—to take the first. Went forward with Lieutenant Brooks, who requested him to go with a flag of truce, and Brooks demanded an unconditional surrender (this before the fight). Major Waller’s reply was, after riding back and seeing his colonel (Baylor), to come and take it. Lynde then ordered his forces forward, cavalry in front and artillery in the road. Ordered the battery to fire into a group on the right and scattered them. The men cheered with enthusiasm. Advanced, throwing infantry to right and left in line of battle; cavalry in front and artillery in road advancing through a corn field towards the town. After advancing towards town the enemy were concealed in two corn fields) no scouts out.
The firing commenced by the enemy. One of the Eifles killed (Private Lane) and other casualties. Lieutenant McNally dangerously wounded. Two men were killed of Lieutenant Crilly’s command in charge of battery. The fire was so hot on the battery that Crilly ordered his men to lie down. After this Major Lynde rode up and told Dr. McKee that he wanted him to prepare his wounded for retreat. Dr. McKee asked him, “ftetreat where, sir?” He said to Fort Fillmore. Got out his stretcher and carried his wounded in. Arrived about 10 p. in. That night he passed in attending to his wounded. Next morning no orders; all confusion 5 no one knew what was going on. Captain Potter came, and said he was going to put up a howitzer on Dr. McKee’s kitchen. It was taken down in the morning. About 2 p. m. the adjutant (Mr. Brooks) gave the doctor an order to destroy his public property. He refused to obey orders. It was a written order which Brooks gave. An order was issued about 3 p. m. to retreat at 10 p. m., or thereabouts. Turned to and destroyed all my property. Asked Major Lynde’s permission to apply fire, and was forbid.
Did not, however, get off until 2 a. m. Were ordered to march to San Augustine Springs, 25 miles. Marched the greater part of the men on foot. On getting within 6 or 7 miles of the Springs the Texans were reported in the rear. Ascending to the summit of the pass, asked Dr. Alden, of the Army, “ Shall we go forward and try and bring back Major Lynde because the Texans are in our rear, or shall we stay back with our wounded and be taken prisoners?” On consultation, we concluded to go forward and tell Major Lynde, and try and get him back and protect his command. There was then but one company in the rear. Concluded to go after him.

Drove after Lynde 6 miles in a buggy with two horses on a full run. He was then 5 or 6 miles ahead of his whole command, with a company of Mounted Rifles under Mr. Cressey. Reported to him the Texans on our rear. He grinned in an imbecile way and said, “Ah, indeed!” and ordered the troops back. Drove back after him. Then I heard that Captain Gibbs was coming with a company of cavalry. McXally and his ambulance came up at this time. Order was then given to move into camp. (Lynde was at the Springs when McKee came up, and went back on a slow walk—the d—dest kind of a slow walk.)
Went back to camp, Captain Gibbs protecting the rear. He came up on our left, and but for him every man would have been taken belore we reached camp. After getting into camp at San Augustine Springs, asked McKally and the sergeant (wounded) what they wanted—if he should hang out a hospital flag to protect him, thinking there was to be a fight. They both requested him to put out a flag, which he did on his buggy.
Just after that Captain Potter came to the medical camp and said, “It’s no use; we are all surrendered; that d—d old scoundrel has surrendered us! I am going up to protest against it. Who’ll go along?” I said, “ I’ll go.” McKally, with his bloody shirt on, said he would go with Dr. McKee and Lieutenant Ryan (he thinks). Dr. Alden and the officers around said they would go too. Went up together, and found Lieutenant Brooks writing out the terms of a surrender. Major Lynde was present, and Colonel Baylor, Texan forces, and Major Waller, second in command of Texans, and the Texan forces were brought up on horseback 300 yards in the rear, about 300 strong. They had no artillery. As we approached, Major Lynde said to Colonel Baylor, “ To prevent the effusion of blood, and on condition that private property shall be respected, I surrender the whole of this command unconditionally.” Dr. McKee stepped in front of him and said, u Major Lynde, I protest against this surrender.” The adjutant (Mr. Brooks), not minding this protest which came from the officers, at the same moment was writing the terms on his knee, looked up in the major’s face and asked him what next he said.

Statement of Capt. C. U. McNally, Third U. S. Cavalry.
Fort Fillmore, 45 miles from El Paso, 6 miles opposite Mesilla; Las Cruces 8 miles above, on same side; Dona Ana 6 miles above Las Cruces, same side. I consider 300 men could hold against 3,000.
Major Lynde arrived at Fort Fillmore and took command last of June—three companies of Seventh Infantry, and he brought four; also Lane’s company of Rifles, 42 men. McKally came down with 32 and Cressey with 25; McKally’s and Cressey’s alone mounted.
McKally and Dr. McKee insisted upon Lynde’s sending away the women and children, 103 in number, from the fort. He had an opportunity of sending them away, but refused. After this they insisted upon his occupying Mesilla. He declined doing so, because he said it would bring on a collision between him and the rebel forces. They also insisted upon his taking possession of Doha Aha, a point he could hold against any number of men; then to send all his provisions, &c., to the rear, where they could fall back and hold them. These measures provisional, because Fort Fillmore is surrounded and commanded by hills, in case of accident.

Twice McNally induced him to give the order to haul down the secession flag in Mesilla; twice^he gave the order; twice McNally was saddled up, and twice he rescinded it. The second time his adjutant, Mr. Brooks, (who had previously resigned,) came to McNally and told him that he had prevented his going to Mesilla, as he thought, it best not to bring on a collision with the Texans. The first time he would have gone, but he (Brooks) prevented it.
The Texans were then at El Paso, 45 miles below. This was from the 4th to 25th July. They were always urging him on. The night of July 24 or 25 the Bifle picket, stationed 7 miles below, brought in a Texan prisoner, who stated that the Texan forces were coming up and within an hour’s march of the fort. The long roll was beaten and our men fell in promptly. There they stood until daylight, except that 25 Rifles went out to call in Potter and Lieutenant Hancock, leaving the San Tomas road open for the Texans, by Major Lynde’s orders. At daylight McNally went to Major Lynde, and asked him to let his company of 32 men, and Cressey’s of 22 men, go over to Mesilla and see if the Texans were there. He said: u Yes; mount your command and go, and give me all the information you can collect.” I took the command, crossed the Rio Grande, and went over as fast as possible to Mesilla, halted the command, gave it to Mr. Cressey, and rode into the town with three men, first sergeant, corporal, and a private. Gave orders to Cressey, if we were not back by a certain time, either to take the town or send back for re-enforcements, as he saw fit. Rode through the town; found everything quiet; the flag was not flying. Went back and reported to Major Lynde no Texans present, and everything appeared to be quiet. Then McNally mounted his 32 men; again started out with Dr. McKee to find their trail. Found their camp within 2 miles of Fillmore, about 300 or 400 men, who had left shortly before and crossed the river to Mesilla. Went back and reported to Lynde. They had gone in by the San Tomas road, abandoned by his order the night before. Lynde told him to dismount his men and put his horses in the stable.
This was at 9 a. m. on the 25th. At the same time positive word was brought back that the Texans were in the town of Mesilla (by Captain Potter). After that we laid quietly in garrison until 4 p. m., when he moved the whole forward, putting McNally, with 22 men, in front, with the order to go on and feel the way. He had four 12-pounder mountain howitzers. He first fired two shells at long range. Ordered McNally to form and go ahead. McNally kept ahead until he got within GO or 70 yards of the Texans. Halted, and reported in person that they were there in the jacals and corn fields. First McNally knew they fired one shot, that cut away his saber; the second struck him. Then fired a volley of about 80 shots. (They confessed to 70 men.) They had no artillery. McNally dismounted, and fired at random. They fired another volley. Remounted, not being supported. Sent to Major Lynde, who could not be found, and not being supported by infantry or artillery, ordered his men to retreat. In this fire one sergeant and one corporal were wounded and one man killed. In retreating, the Seventh Infantry fired into us. I retreated behind the battery, and found the infantry still in the rear. There McNally fainted from loss of blood, and was carried from the field. The last he heard w as an order from Major Lynde to retreat.
N. B.—Before Brown, the prisoner, was brought in, a Mexican came in and reported the Texans in force, and Lynde never sent out a scout.
The command reached Fillmore about 10 p. m. on the 25th.

Too much praise cannot be given to the officers and soldiers under my command, and especially to Captain Hardeman and company, who were the only part of the command engaged with the enemy.
I have thought proper to release upon parole the entire command of officers and men, as I could not, with less than 300 men, guard over GOO and meet another force of 240 of the enemy that is looked for daily.
I have the honor to be, respectfully,
JOHN E. BAYLOE,
Lieut. Col., Comdg. Second Regiment Mounted Rifles, C. S. A.
Headquarters,
Dona Ana, Ariz., September 21, 1801.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the engagement at Mesilla on the 25th of July; the capture of the United States forces the day after the next succeeding at San Augustine Springs, in the Organ Mountains, Territory of Arizona, and of my operations in the Territory up to the present time:
On assuming command at Fort Bliss I ascertained that the United States forces were concentrating in strong force at Fort Fillmore, and from the proximity of that post I supposed that the object of the enemy was to attack the forces under my command at Fort Bliss. I was satisfied that if I permitted them to concentrate, my command was too weak to maintain my position. 1 therefore determined to attack the enemy in detail, and prevent, if possible, the contemplated concentration. For that purpose 1 sent a detachment, under Major Waller, to reconnoiter Fort Fillmore and see the position of the enemy’s pickets, also whether the fort could be approached without discovery. The report of Major Waller satisfied me that I could easily in the night gain a position between the fort and the river (Bio Grande), and cut oil' the animals as they went to water; then the enemy would have to attack me in a strong position, thus rendering the protection afforded by the fort of no use. I accordingly took up the line of march in the night of the 23d of July with 258 men, and in the night of the 24th succeeded in taking a position on the river near Fort Fillmore. The surprise of the enemy would have been complete but for the desertion of a private from Oapt. T. F. Teel’s company, who reported to Major Lynde our strength and position. The long-roll was distinctly heard, which apprised us that our approach was known to the enemy.
On the morning of the 25th I determined to occupy Mesilla, and prevent, if possible, the enemy from getting a position there, as it was one that would be easily held, and would enable them to hold the country. I reached Mesilla in the afternoon of the 25th, and was soon informed that the enemy were marching to attack us. I posted my men in position and awaited the arrival of the enemy. At about 5 o’clock I discovered their cavalry approaching the town by the main road, and soon alter the infantry came in sight, bringing with them three howitzers. They formed within 300 yards, and were, as near as I could tell, about GOO strong. A flag was sent in to demand the u unconditional and immediate surrender of the Texas forces,” to which I answered that u we would fight first, and surrender afterward.” The answer was followed by the enemy opening on us with their howitzers. After four or five rounds of bombs, grape, and canister, the cavalry formed and marched up within 250 yards, preparatory to making a charge. Captain Hardeman’s company, being in position nearest the enemy, was ordered to 2 R R—YOL IY

open on them with his front rank, to see if they were within range of our guns. The fire was well directed and proved effective, killing 4 of the enemy and wounding 7. The cavalry was thrown into contusion and retreated hastily, running over the infantry. In a tew moments the enemy were marching back in the direction of their fort; but supposing it to be a feint, intended to draw me from my position, I did not pursue them, but kept my position until next morning, the 26th, expecting that they would attack us under cover of night.
The enemy not appearing, I sent my spies to reeonnoiter, and discover, if possible, their movements. The spies reported the enemy at work at the fort making breastworks, and evidently preparing to defend themselves. Upon hearing this, I sent an express to Fort Bliss, ordering up the artillery to attack the fort on the arrival of my re-enforcements.
On the morning of the 27th, a little after daylight, my spies reported a column of dust seen in the direction of the Organ Mountains, distant 15 miles, on the Fort Stanton road. I could from the top of a house with a glass see the movements of the enemy. I immediately ordered the command to saddle and mount, for the purpose of intercepting them at San Augustine Pass. I had reached the river, distant 1 mile, when I received intelligence that a messenger* had arrived from the fort, and stated that the enemy had fired the buildings ; that it had been extinguished, and that but little had been destroyed. I at once ordered Major Waller to take a detachment of men and go to the fort, and save, if possible, the property therein, and to leave men enough to guard the post, and then overtake me as soon as possible. On reaching the foot of the mountain, distant about 15 miles, I could see the rear of the enemy, composed chiefly of famished stragglers, endeavoring to make their way to water. I disarmed and collected a number of them, and finding most of them dying of thirst, we gave them the water we had, and were compelled ourselves to go to a spring in the mountain for water. Lieutenant Baylor and Mr. Barnes, a citizen of Las Cruces, who acted as guide, found 24 of the enemy at the spring, who had from exhaustion gone to sleep, whom they captured.
After getting water for my men I started in pursuit of the enemy, who had passed through San Augustine Pass. I was delayed for some time here waiting for Major Waller, who, mistaking my orders, had carried with him the whole command, except Captain Hardeman’s company, to Fort Fillmore. So soon as they joined me I started in pursuit, and found the enemy’s cavalry drawn up to cover the retreat of the infantry through the Pass. These I charged with Captain Hardeman’s company. They retreated in haste, leaving behind them their wagons and artillery and all their supplies. Upon gaining the summit of the Pass, a plain view of the road to the San Augustine Springs was presented. The road for 5 miles was lined with the fainting, famished soldiers, who threw down their arms as we passed and begged for water. At the Springs the enemy had drawn up in line of battle some 200 or 300 strong. I ordered Major Waller to charge with Captain Hardeman’s company until he reached the end of the line of straggling soldiers, then to form and cut them olf from the main body. I followed, disarming the enemy, and as fast as our jaded horses could go. On reaching Captain Hardeman’s company, who were formed, I saw Major Waller and Captain Hardeman riding into the enemy’s lines. I was in a few moments sent for by Major Lynde, who asked upon what terms I would allow him to surrender. I replied that the surrender must be unconditional. To this Major Lynde assented, asking that private property should be respected. The articles of capitulation were signed, and the order given for the enemy to stack arms.

﻿Chap. XL] SURRENDER AT SAN AUGUSTINE SPRINGS, N. MEX.	19
Major Lynde’s command was conqiosed of eight companies of infantry and tour of cavalry, with four pieces of artillery, the whole numbering nearly 700 men. My own force at the surrender was less than 200. I regret to report that the regimental colors were burned by the enemy to avoid surrendering them.
I was delayed at the place of surrender for two days on account of the condition of the enemy and the want of transportation. As soon as possible I marched them to Las Cruces and there paroled them, as I was informed that Captain Moore w as en route for Fort Fillmore, fiom Fort Buchanan, with 250 men. I could not guard the prisoners I had and meet the. coming forces. Being desirous, too, to afflict the enemy in every way, I considered that it was much better for them to bear the expense of finding the prisoners than for me to do so.
After getting rid of the prisoners I immediately selected a strong position near the village of Picacho to await the arrival of Captain Moore’s command. Here I was joined by Brig. Gen. A. S. Johnston, with a party of officers of the U. S. Army, who had resigned and were en route for Richmond, Va.; also a party of Californians, under Capt. Alonzo Ridley. I tendered to Brigadier-General Johnston the command of my forces, believing that the best interest of the service required that L should relinquish the command to an officer of his rank and distinguished ability, which he did me the honor to accept, and remained in command until there was no further necessity for his services. He sent Captain Coopwood’s spy company to meet the enemy and send him word where they were, and to watch their movements and prevent any communication with them. The spies discovered them on the Miembres, and reported them moving carelessly, evidently not suspecting danger. On the night of the 6th of August an express reached Captain Moore from Fort Craig, telling him of the defeat of Major Lynde’s command, and ordering him to burn up his transportation and supplies, and make his escape to that place. This was done. The jaded condition of our animals alone prevented us from capturing them.
The accompanying abstracts of quartermaster’s, subsistence, medical, and ordnance stores will show but a part of the property captured, much of it having been stolen and destroyed while I was awaiting the enemy at Picacho and some since I have left the command to Major Waller. A number of muster rolls are lost, the remainder only showing about half of the prisoners captured; also the correspondence with the commanding officer in reference to his regimental colors was lost. I regret the loss of these papers, but in the hurry and excitement it was unavoidable. I can only give the number of the enemy as it was reported to me by the officers captured.
On the 10th of August an express reached me from Fort Stanton, stating that the news of the capture of Major Lynde’s command had created a stampede among the United States troops, who hastily abandoned the fort after having destroyed a considerable portion of their supplies and Government property of all kinds, and all would have been destroyed but for a storm of rain, which extinguished the fire intended by the enemy to destroy the fort. The few citizens living near the fort took possession of it, and saved a valuable lot of quartermaster’s and commissary stores. The Mexicans and Indians in large numbers demanded the right to pillage the fort, which wTas granted. The citizens, being too weak to resist, not knowing that they would get aid from me or not, were forced to abandon the fort to the Mexicans and Indians. Captain Walker’s company, on the receipt of the express from Fort Stanton, was ordered to that post, and he succeeded in recovering

a portion of the property stolen. For particulars of his operations I refer you to his report. I sent a train to bring from Fort Stanton all the property and stores of value. The invoices will acquaint you with the property recovered from the post. I will mention, among other things, four pieces of artillery, two of which are uninjured and two so much injured as to be of no use.
Believing that the interest of Arizona demanded imperatively some form of government, I issued my proclamation, of date 1st of August, 1861, to the people, a copy of which 1 forward you.
I cannot conclude this report without alluding to the courage, fortitude, and patriotism of the officers and soldiers of my command and to those citizens who participated with us All did nobly their part. I cannot make distinction between men so willing and ready to do their whole duty. To the courage of my officers and men the country is indebted for the success of our arms and the acquisition of a Territory valuable in many respects.

from Fort Buchanan to Fort Fillmore, succeeded by ignominious flight in making their escape. On the night of the 7th instant an express reached them trom Fort Craig, when they immediately burned all their transportation and supplies, and fled in great disorder and haste, saving nothing but their arms and animals.
By express from Fort Stanton I learn that upon the receipt of the news that Major Lynde had surrendered, Colonel Roberts, in command of that post, fled in haste, leaving the post on fire, which was extinguished by a storm of rain. Most of the commissary and quartermaster’s supplies were saved and a battery. On the receipt of this intelligence I sent Captain Walker’s company to occupy Stanton, and will send a train for the commissary and quartermaster’s stores, leaving only two months’ supply for the troops now there. The families there were at the mercy of Indians and Mexicans, and I thought it proper to garrison the post, at least until I could learn the wishes of the Government. I have also established a Provisional Government for the Territory of Arizona, and made the appointments to fill the offices necessary to enforce the laws. I have proclaimed myself the governor, have authorized the raising of four companies to hold the Territory and afford protection to the citizens, and extended the limits of the Territory to the parallel of 36° 30') thence due west to the Colorado, and down that stream to its mouth.
The vast mineral resources of Arizona, in addition to its affording an outlet to the Pacific, make its acquisition a matter of some importance to our Government, and now that I have taken possession of the Territory, I trust a force sufficient to occupy and hold it will be sent by the Government, under some competent man.
I urge the acceptance of the companies I have raised, as they are composed of the very best material, and are invaluable as soldiers. Captain Coopwood’s company especially has been of great service to me, as spies cannot be supplied.
I have acted in all matters relating to the acquisition of Arizona entirely upon my own responsibility, and can only refer the matter, through you, for the approval of the Government.
Inventories of all property captured from the Army will be sent to you as early as possible. I regret to say that a good deal has been stolen by both prisoners and Mexicans, but in the excitement of the time I could not avoid such acts, my time being occupied with other matters. The arms and ammunition are valuable, and many that are broken and injured by the enemy can be repaired; I will send them down to the arsenal by the first opportunity. The artillery (twelve pieces) can be used by mounting them again, as no damage wras done to the guns except spiking them.
I cannot conclude without alluding to the manner in which my men have conducted themselves in this short campaign. They have endured hunger and fatigue without complaint, and for a week did not eat more than a meal in twenty-four hours. For four days they did not unsaddle their horses, and during the whole time behaved in a manner worthy of veterans.
Yours, very respectfully,
JOHN R. BAYLOR,
Lieut. (7o?., Comdg. Second RegH Texas Mounted Rifles.

Sir : I have the honor to report the capture of a detachment from Fort Craig of 9 men and a Captain Hubbell, of the Uew Mexico volunteers. From them I learn that there are now at Craig 350 regular troops and 180 JSew Mexico volunteers. There is no artillery at Craig, and 1 could easily take the place but for the jaded condition of my horses, many of which are unfit for service. I would suggest that a strong force be stationed here, as I can do nothing towards ridding the country of Indians while the United States troops occupy ISTew Mexico, as my force is too weak to divide.

Stanton, If. Mex.
Report of Lieut. John R. Pulliam, C. S. Army.
Fort Stanton, Ariz., August 25 [?], 1861.
Sir: Captain Walker having left post this morning for Fort Bliss, I came in command. The condition of the country being such as to render it necessary to keep out spies in the direction of Forts Union and Craig, have thought it a matter of precaution to have men on the lookout to prevent a surprise from the Federal troops, who were concentrating at the before-mentioned forts. The following dav I detailed four men to march to the Gallinas Mountains, distant about 75 miles, in a northwestern direction, where they could obtain a position commanding a view of all roads leading to Fort Stanton by which an enemy might approach.
August 29.—Dr. R. H. Dryden, in company with McComb and Hall’s train, arrived. The former was furnished quarters, and took his position as post surgeon. Orders were issued calling for suplus stores over the company’s rations for two months. The train was loaded, and started for Fort Bliss the following day.
September 1.—Last night a spy party returned, and reported having seen no indications of any advancing enemy. At sundown detailed 4 men—T. G. Pemberton, Joseph Y. Mosse, Joseph Emmanacker, and Floyd A. Sanders—to proceed to the Gallinas Mountains. My instructions were, in consequence of the situation of the water and dangerous proximity of hostile Indians, very explicit. My orders were to reach the water on the morning of the second day, water the horses, fill up canteens, leave the spring, and noon at a safe and sufficient distance away; but on account of feeling convinced that there was no danger there, the men, contrary to orders, camped at about 100 yards above the spring in a grove of pine trees, where they and their fire were visible to any person going to the spring from the road. While in the act of cook-

ing breakfast three Indians were seen running over an adjoining hill. The men immediately saddled up their horses, and while in the act of doing so they were assailed by a shower of arrows, and found themselves totally surrounded by an overwhelming force, who poured in an incessant fire. Each man took up his position behind a tree, and on their attempt to tire their rifles, to their horror found that they would not go off. Revolvers were immediately drawn, and after several shots had been fired the men were dislodged from their positions. Every tree shielded an Indian for considerable distance on all sides. The tight, which was a running one, was continued for nearly two hours, when Emmanacker, Pemberton, and Mosse having fallen, Sanders took his horse, and putting spurs to him, galloped down an almost perpendicular mountain, and amidst a shower of arrows escaped to tell the fate of the horrible massacre of his three comrades. He reported having been followed for 10 miles by the Indians, and had his horse not been fleeter than the Indian ponies lie would certainly have shared the fate cf his comrades.
The same evening that Sanders returned I ordered fourteen men, accompanied by three citizens, who volunteered to accompany the command, to proceed to the scene of the unfortunate encounter, and at sundown they left the fort. Shortly before night Captain Walker arrived and took command.
September 8.—Since the captain’s return preparations have been made to evacuate the post. About noon the scouting party returned, and reported having seen no Indians. They were at the Gallinas Mountains; saw evident marks of the poor fellows who were killed having fought with bravery and a determination to sell their lives as dearly as possible, as almost every tree was marked by blood shed by the inhuman savages, who, when they outnumbered our men ten to one, attacked them, and were able to carry oft* their scalps as laurels of victory. The bodies of Pemberton and Emmanacker were found, and buried as wrell as circumstances would admit, with a salute fired over their graves, and a cross cut in a tree to indicate the spot. Mosse’s body was not found. His fate seems to be doubtful, although Sanders says he saw him shot through the head and fall dead before he left the ground.
The same evening word was brought into the fort that the Indians had attacked the Placito, a Mexican settlement 10 miles below the fort. I was ordered to take fifteen men there and protect the citizens; did so; had an engagement with them (the Indians), and killed five. Returned to the fort amidst a pouring rain at 2 a. m. The next morning we started from Fort Stanton, and arrived at Doha Ana, Ariz., September 21,1861.

Sir : The picket skirmishing referred to in my last report of the 29th ultimo resulted in the capture of the captains and lieutenants, 9 men of Captain Minks’ company of mounted volunteers, 3 wagons, and 18 mules. The first lieutenant and the remainder of the company made their escape with their arms and all the horses of the company. The guard duty was negligently performed and the party was completely surprised; no one killed or wounded. Captain Morris, Third Cavalry, with 109 men of that regiment, was sent in pursuit of the Texans, and after a rapid march of 80 miles found them strongly posted and protected by a barricade of fallen timber. A short skirmish ensued, which lasted until Captain Morris had exhausted his ammunition, when he withdrew his command and sent back for ammunition. The Texans availed themselves of this opportunity to make their escape. Their captain, 10 men, and 22 horses were killed, 30 men and a large number of horses wounded. In Captain Morris’ command 3 men were wounded. The pursuing troops left Fort Craig hastily, and with only the ammunition in their cartridge boxes. With the exception of this oversight the allair was conducted with judgment and skill, and Captain Morris compliments the officers and men tor great gallantry. The parties engaged were about equal in strength.

No. 2.
Report of Capt. John II Minis, of sldrmish at Canada Alamosa.
Dona Ana, N. Mex., September 29,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that, in pursuance to Order No. —, from the commanding officer at Fort Craig, I proceeded with my company about 40 miles southward from Fort Craig to a small town called Canada Alamosa, in order to establish a camp there, &c., leaving behind only 10 men as an escort for a train to Albuquerque, and 5 sick in the hospital at Fort Craig. On my arrival at Canada Alamosa I at once took the necessary steps to secure men and horses against a sudden attack, but I was not able to accomplish the work in one or two days as it ought to have been done, on account of my time being occupied in purchasing forage and making many necessary preparations in my camp to enable me to keep out constantly several small scouting parties. The operations were also retarded on account of the unwillingness of some of my men to use the spade and the pick ax.
Before i had finished my corral and breastworks, September 24, at about 5 p. in., I received information that mounted men had been seen in a southern direction from our camp. I immediately ordered 6 men, already in the saddle, to scout in the direction of Laguna, in company with a Mexican well acquainted with the topography of the country, to start and bring more positive information. They returned and reported the said men to be a scouting party from Captain Hubbell’s company, in command of a certain Colisnara, who had come over on the right bank of the river to pasture their horses. Well aware that this was only an excuse for having abandoned their post on the Jornada, my intention was to arrest the party next morning and send them to Captain Hubbell. At a later hour the same evening similar information was received of having seen mounted men, but, as I considered this already explained, I only cautioned my men not to leave the camp and to keep silence during the night, so they could always hear my voice and be at all hours ready to repel a night attack. The teamsters, who were to start the next day, were ordered to leave early, at. 3 o’clock in the morning, for Fort Craig. I sat up writing until 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning before I retired. I was soon aroused by one of my sentinels reporting that he had heard a noise in the direction of the town. I gave the alarm to my men, who were immediately under arms.
The night at that hour was very dark; nothing could be seen. I ordered my men to saddle their horses, which were picketed in front of our line between the town and the camp, but before I could see what it meant they had disappeared in the darkness. Some of my men say they fired into our camp. I did not see or hear it, though at this time our horses stampeded. I ordered 8 or 10 men to bring them back or to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but more than 30 men went off before I could prevent it, on account of the darkness. At this moment a terrible Indian yell was heard from the town. I thought for a while the Indians were attacking the town, and, with more than 40 of my men, was prepared to march to the rescue of the inhabitants, when we heard distinctly cavalry coming down on us, arid a voice near our line hallooing out: u Here’s their camp; give them hell!” The firing now commenced, and the enemy fell back into the town. I then knew that they were Texans, and that it was not an Indian yell I had heard a few moments before. I nevertheless thought the force could not be a large one; that the firing on their side would

﻿28	OPERATIONS IN TEX., N. MEX^ AND ARIZ. [Chap. XI.
be brisker, and came rather to the conclusion that they were only an advance picket of 12 or 15 men, who were trying to rout my camp by frightening us under cover cf night, and who would retreat before daylight, satisfietl to have a big laugh at us.
I had already sent an express (Lorenzo Tobats and Felis Gallegas) to Fort Craig, and determined to make a stand. I fell back behind some houses and fences, ceased firing at random, and, no shots being fired by the enemy for some time, I thought they had perhaps already retreated. I then tried to bring some of my men back, and used all kinds of means to prevent the enemy finding out the real number of my men on hand. I went on foot with a few others into the town, in order to find out something about the number and doings of the enemy, penetrating from house to house. Nothing could be seen. I thought the enemy must either have evacuated the town or it was a ruse to bring us out. I did not deem it prudent to go any farther; went back to my camp, where I found that the number of my men had again diminished. I ordered Lieutenant Sanches to bring some of the men back, if there was any possibility to do so before daybreak, and called on volunteers to ride with me into the town to drive the enemy out if they were only few in numbers, or to set fire to some of the small outside houses, from which the enemy could fire at us, and which, at all events, would break the eternal darkness. Provided with matches and some dry wood, in company with Lieutenant Medina, Sergeant Mennett, and a few others, mounted and advanced towards the town, where, to our great surprise, we were received by a pretty smart musketry. We soon found out that vTe had made a wrong calculation as to the strength of the enemy, and in less than ten minutes were again at the very spot from whence we had started. At this hour of the morning a portion of the enemy took position at an elevated place to our right, near the road leading to Fort Craig, so that a retreat en masse would have been observed, and provoked the enemy not only to pursue us, but also those of my company who had gone after their horses, and, doubtless, well mounted as the ' enemy were, wTould have overtake]! most of our horses and men in, less than half an hour. At this time (nearly daybreak) I found my whole force reduced to 10 men. Nothing else could then be done but entertain the enemy and prevent the pursuit of the main body of my company. This was done by loud commands, as if the whole company were still present, and occasional firing for more than an hour, with the loss of only one teamster (John Morrin), wounded in the leg.
Seeing at last, by aid of my spy-glass, that the enemy were more than 60 horsemen strong and preparing to charge us, that retreat wTas utterly impossible for the few still with me, and further resistance would only lead to a useless butchery, I surrendered between 7 and 8 a. m., after having saved nearly all the men, horses, and arms of my company, but bound to lose 3 wagons, 12 mules, and a few horses, about 15 arms (carbines and pistols), besides all our camp equipage, one and a half boxes of cartridges, rations on hand, and a small lot of old saddles and blankets, which were mostly all destroyed by the enemy. The enemy had one excellent horse killed and a few others wounded.
After my surrender I found the enemy’s forces consisted of Captain Coop wood’s spy company, 45 men strong, a detachment of Captain Pyron’s company, 45 men strong, and 24 men more, detached from another company. Total, 114 men. They say that some of my men were killed, but I am not aware of this, although I took, before wre left Alamosa, great pains to ascertain this fact. It may be possible that I have on this occasion committed some errors. I am aware that I have,

but for others it is an easy thing to find fault when it is too late to do any good. If I had sent my wagons off* and divided my company into four or five spy parties, and had them out only one day before, no loss, or very little loss, would have been experienced, and in all probability I would not be a prisoner now. The word uif?? is a great word. If Captain Coopwood had delayed his attack until the next morning, cutting off' our retreat, which he could have done, not a horse or man of mine could have escaped. He nevertheless had plenty of good reasons to act as he did.
Not being permitted to report the further movements of the enemy, I only state that my second lieutenant, M. Medina, was badly wounded in the upper leg the next day by our own men; the bone is probably hurt, but the wound will not prove fatal; Mr. Peter Dens, of Las Cruces, an old friend of mine, has taken care of him. John Morrin, the teamster before alluded to, is in the hospital at this place, doing well. I am under parole not to leave the headquarters of Colonel Baylor without his permission. We are all well treated so far; receive our rations, and up to this hour have not heard a single unkind word from officers or men, although they have to deplore the loss of two of their best men killed in the action whicli took place the next morning (September 26), when our troops overtook the same party about 30 miles below the Alamosa, and, furthermore, have about seven wounded in the hospital.
I submit this report to the kind consideration of the colonel commanding, and have the honor to be, most respectfullv, your obedient servant,

Fort Thorn.
Fort Craig, N. Mex., September 29,1861.
Captain : In obedience to your verbal order given me at 9 a. m. on the 25th instant, I moved with Companies C, G> and K, Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, to the relief of Captain Minks7 mounted volunteers, at Canada Alamosa. 1 reached that point at 4.30 p. in. I should state that I ordered Captain HubbelPs company to join my command from their camp opposite Panago, which was under the command of Lieutenant Hubbell, the first lieutenant.
Arriving at Canada Alamosa, I found that a number of ponies were too wearied to proceed at any gait. I therefore left Lieutenant Brady (who was too sick to proceed) in charge of the camp, and resumed my march with 101 rank and file on the trail of the Texan force which had captured Captain Minks, marching until 3 a. m. of the following morning, rested until daylight, then proceeded on the trail.
Lieutenant Cooley, of the Second Volunteer Regiment (who acted as my aide de camp), riding in advance, discovered the Texans encamped. 1 then formed my command to charge, but upon examining their position I saw it was futile to attempt it at that time.
To test their strength I ordered Lieutenant Treacy with his company

(C) to take position on their right flank and attack them, whilst I moved forward to attack them front and left. Taking up my position, a single shot was fired. I immediately dismounted and went into action, which lasted an hour and forty-two minutes.
My ammunition running low, I retired a half mile as a feint to draw them out from tlieir intrenchments, but’without success. I then turned their right and camped 2% miles from them, where I remained till 5 p. m.; then I moved up the creek and encamped, where I remained until dark, and then moved back on Canada Alamosa with my wounded, which place I reached at 4 a. m. on the 27th instant.
Although it may appear invidious to mention names where all behaved so coolly and with unflinching bravery, I will state that Dr. Sylvester Rankin and Lieutenant Cooley performed their appropriate duties to my full satisfaction. To the riflemen engaged I cannot but say that they proved themselves by their coolness and bravery men who will sustain their regimental flag under any circumstances.
Lieutenant Treacy’s conduct on the field elicited my highest approbation. *

I have been compelled to abandon Fort Stanton, as my force is too weak to divide.

During his progress had two engagements with the enemy; the first in the town of Alamosa, in which he dispersed a New Mexican volunteer company, taking the captain, lieutenant, and several others prisoners.

Report of Capt. Bethel Coopwood, Confederate forces.
Dona Ana, Ariz., September 29, 1861.
Sir: In obedience to your order of date September 18, 1861, I started from Camp Robledo on the 22d instant to make a reconnaissance of the country around Fort Craig with a detachment of 112 men, including officers, detailed from Captain Py roll’s company, B, and Captain Stafford’s company, E, Second Texas Mounted Rifles, and my spy company, as shown by lists from the different companies, hereto annexed ; also one man, the Rev. William J. Joyce, of Captain Hardeman’s company, A, Second Texas Mounted Rifles.
Having obtained reliable information that a company of IT. S. volunteers had started from Fort Craig to occupy the town of Alamosa, 35 miles from Fort Craig, I marched with all precaution to that place, and on the morning of the 25th instant succeeded in getting between that place and Craig without being discovered. I immediately marched my force into town, and after some skirmishing captured Capt. J. II. Minks, Second Lieut. Metiaze Medina, and 23 privates and non-commissioned officers. In the skirmish 4 of the enemy were killed and 6 wounded. The remainder of Captain Minks’ company fled early in the action, and escaped by crossing the river and taking to the mountains.
In the camp of Captain Minks I found an amount of public property, and immediately appointed Lieutenant Poore to take charge of the same: and the duplicate of his inventory, hereunto annexed, exhibits the amount of property taken, except four Sibley tents and a number of saddles and other articles of small value, winch were burned by my order, not having transportation for the same. Not having transportation for the prisoners, E administered to 22 of them a strong oath, binding them not to take up arms against the Confederate States during this war unless exchanged, &e., and then set them at liberty without arms; but I held Captain Minks and Lieutenant Medina and one sergeant as prisoners, and deliver them to you to abide your order.
From Alamosa I marched along the river road with the property taken to the place known as E Company Grove, and encamped for the night. On the morning of the 27th, wiiile at breakfast, I was informed that my tuckets were running into camp, and, rising to my feet, I saw

the enemy pursuing them. In less than ten minutes my camp was surrounded by U. S. troops, numbering about 190. None of the ordinary ceremonies of attack were performed. There being no misunderstanding, we at once commenced business. The tiring commenced at 7 o’clock and ended at 11 a. m. The enemy began to retreat before 11, and about that hour fled from the field. I lost 2 men killed, and had 2 severely wounded, each in the arm, besides 6 others slightly wounded, all of which will more fully appear from the list hereto annexed. The enemy removed their dead and w7ounded as they retreated, so as to evade a discovery of their losses; but, from the number of horses led away with bodies apparently lashed across them, there were 12 or 13 killed, but the number of their wounded could not be ascertained.
The principal portion of the battle was fought with the enemy’s force formed in two lines, forming the angle of a square, and my forces formed the same way inside of theirs, my lines being much the shorter. One of my lines was composed of the detachment lrom Captain Pyron’s company and a portion of the detachment from Captain Stafford’s company, under the immediate command of Lieutenant Poore, Sergeant O’Grady, and Sergeant Browne. My left line was composed of the detachment from my company and a part of the detachment from Captain Stafford’s company. This line was under the immediate command of Lieutenant Sutherland, being divided into two platoons, one led by Sergeant Coulter, and the other by Private Tevis, who wras named for the special occasion.
I remained upon the field till 10 o’clock a. m. the next day, but was prepared to receive another attack should the enemy return re-enforced. In relation to the men and officers under me I would say to you, sir, that I have not witnessed such a display of manly courage and perfect order during my experience in wars. Each officer and man conducted himself as though he thought the destinies of himself and his country were depending upon his action on that occasion. The wounded would not even utter a cry, lest it would be injurious to the cause. A remarkable instance of this was displayed in the case of Sergeant O’Grady. After being severely wounded, and after having fallen to the ground from loss of blood, lie continued to cheer his men and encourage them to fight, telling them not to cease firing until they had avenged his blood. This kind of courage was also displayed by others whose wounds were not so severe. Sergeant Quinn, Sergeant Robinson, and Antonio Lambert, after having each received a wound, continued to fight, if possible, with more courage and determination. The officers and men paid strict attention to every order, and acted more like veteran troops than volunteers. I cannot with words express the esteem I have for all who were with me. Nothing short of witnessing a similar occasion can impress you with an idea of the value of such troops and the credit due them/or what they have already done. I here with annex a list of the names of all who were with me, that you may know that number of men by name who will not flinch under the most trying circumstances.
Regretting much that some of my esteemed fellow soldiers have suffered the fate of w7ar on this scout, I most respectfully submit to you this report of the same.
I am, sir, your most obedient servant,
BETHEL COOPWOOD, Captain, Commanding Scout,
Lieut. Col. John R. Baylor.

Report of Capt. P. Hardeman, C. S. Army.
Camp Eobledo, Aeiz., October 8,18G1.
Sib: I have the honor to report to you, in obedience to General Orders, iNo. 1G, issued at headquarters, San Antonio, August 21, making it the duty of officers of scouting parties to forward reports of their operations to headquarters through their respective commanding officers, that, in obedience to your order, I, with a detachment of 25 of my men, accompanied by Captain Frazier, took up the line of march on the 30th ultimo en route to the Upper Eio Grande, to see if I could make any discoveries of the enemy in that portion of the country. After passing up the Jornada road some 50 miles I directed my course westward, to intersect the road running up the river by old Fort Thorn. Before reaching that road I came across an Indian trail with a large flock of sheep. The trail being fresh, I thought proper to pursue them. After crossing the river and trailing about 10 miles northwest the trail then turned a due west course for 15 miles across a level plain to a very rough, mountainous country. Here the trail turned nearly due north through the chain of mountains. I followed them across the headwaters of the Eio Miembres, and thence to the tributaries of the Gila Eiver. Not being able to overtake them at this point, and some of my horses becoming very tender-footed from traveling over the rocky country without shoes, and having started from camp with only three days’ rations, and being entirely out at this time, I thought it prudent to abandon the chase and return to camp, which we did without having the pleasure of capturing the red rascals, and arrived in camp on the 7th instant, having been out four days without any rations or anything to eat except a few wild grapes which we were lucky enough to And in the mountains.

Sir : According to orders received from you I started on the evening of the 11th instant with a party of fifteen privates and two non-commissioned officers in pursuit of a band of hostile Indians, taking with me four days’ rations. Upon arrival at the scene of depredations I was informed that the Indians had taken the direction of the Nueces Eiver. I immediately started out in pursuit, and encamped that night on the Eio Frio. Next morning early we struck the trail between the Frio and the Leona, and continued to follow it until dark that night. On the morning of the third day I again took up the trail, running in the direction of Fort Yulee, hotly pursuing it until sunset. That night (the 3d) two mules and two ponies came into camp with several arrows stuck into them. The animals died shortly after they were discovered. On Monday morning I again started on the trail, following it for about half a mile, when I lost it. After some time I discovered that the Indians had retraced their steps in the direction of the Eio Grande. That day the Indians crossed and recrossed the Barosito Creek several times. Some of our horses in pursuing them, so boggy were the crossings, sank in the mud and had to be pulled out by lariats, causing great delay and wetting our sharpshooters and ammunition. The same evening, about sunset, upon arrival in a small clearing, we were suddenly attacked by the Indians, who sprang out from the surrounding scrub. The Indians (Lipans) were in large numbers. It seemed to be a head camping ground. As soon as attacked the men unslung their carbines and prepared for action, but upon attempting to discharge them not one in a half dozen would go off, although four or five caps were used on each piece •, the arms and ammunition being completely unfit for use from the soaking they had received during the day. I may here say that it rained incessantly that day from sunrise until sunset. The men who could not use their carbines drew their sabers and commenced using them. Three men who happened to have dismounted engaged the Indians hand-to-hand, killing several. I am sorry to say that the three men were also killed; that, along with 1 man and 4 horses wounded, was the only loss on our side; on the Indian side, about 10 killed and several wounded. The fight lasted about half an hour. As it was getting dark, having no pistols, and the Indians being too numerous—they were gaining strength every minute—I gave the command to retreat. On Tuesday morning we started for home, and arrived here this evening.
In conclusion, allow me to say that the men under my command behaved admirably.

NOVEMBER 1, 1861.—Skirmish with Indians on the Peosi River, Texas,
JReport of Col. II. F. McCulloch, C. S. Army.
Galveston, Tex., November 30,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that Capt. J. B. Barry, of my regiment, writes me that he attacked a party of Indians on Peosi River, a branch of the Red River, on the first day of this month, and killed ten of them dead on the field, and wounded two others severely, if not mortally.
He reports that he carried but ten days’ rations, was out on the scout twenty-two days, during which time his command suffered greatly, but never murmured. The fight was a running one of several miles, consequently only a portion of his men could get up with the Indians; that six of his command overtook and engaged twelve Indians, keeping them from proceeding and holding them at bay for fifteen or twenty minutes until several others of his command came up; that during this time the fight was close and severe, the Indians fighting desperately, and apparently having the advantage of the fight at times, but finally gave way, and all of this twelve was killed or wounded, while he only sustained a loss of two men wounded, which he thinks will soon recover, and one horse shot with an arrow, which he thinks will probably not be of any service to his owner in future.
This is the first decided victory that has been gained with any loss to the Indians by our troops during the present service that has come to my knowledge, and I earnestly hope that it will be followed up by like brilliant and decided successes in the future.

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt on the 14th instant of special orders from the Headquarters of the Army of the 17th ultimo, directing the movements of troops, recruits, &c.
The preparatory arrangements for tiie movement of the troops from the department are being made with as much rapidity as possible, but the scarcity of transportation (both public and private) in this country will occasion some delay. The companies at the interior posts that can be spared before the volunteers are mustered into the service have already been ordered in. Those of the Fifth Infantry will be concentrated at Albuquerque and Fort Union until transportation for the

march can be provided, and those of the Seventh Infantry at Fort Fillmore.
Since my report of the 11th instant * information has been received here giving greater consistency to the rumored invasion of this Territory by the people of Texas, and I have in consequence taken measures to hasten as much as possible the concentration of troops at Fort Fillmore, and hope in a few days to have a sufficient force at that point to secure the interests of the United States against attack from any quarter. The headquarters of the Seventh Infantry will be temporarily established at that post, and the troops in that quarter placed under the orders of the senior officer (Major Lynde, Seventh Infantry), with such instructions as will enable him to meet any emergency. This information applies also to the trains on their way to this country from the Missouri frontier, and I have given instructions to prepare a mounted force to move in the direction of the Arkansas Biver for the protection of these trains. If necessary I shall anticipate the orders of the War Department, by calling for a portion of the volunteers immediately, for the purpose of replacing the troops detached on this duty.
The commanding officers at Fort Wise and Fort Larned will be furnished with the information in relation to the anticipated movements of the Texans, in order that they may be on their guard.

Bvt. Lieut. Col. B. S. Boberts, B. M. B.,
Commanding Fort Stanton, N. Mex.:
Sir : Information from private sources indicates the possibility of a demonstration by Texas troops against the posts and public property in or en route to this department. The particular objects of this demonstration can of course only be conjectured, but the lieutenant-colonel commanding directs me to advise you of the facts, in order that you may be on your guard and prepared to resist attack from any quarter. He desires that you will as fully as possible keep yourself advised of any movements of the Texas troops in the direction of Hew Mexico, and particularly that you will take measures for watching the approach from that State by the Pecos route. This should be done as quietly as possible, and by Mexicans or friendly Indians, if you can secure the services of men that are perfectly reliable. With the ostensible object of trading with the Indians they would be less liable to attract observation than parties of troops. In carrying out this object you are authorized to employ 15 or 20 Mexicans or Indians as spies and guides, &c. They will be required to furnish their own animals and arms, but will be supplied by you with subsistence and ammunition. The rate of compensation will be the same as has heretofore been authorized by department orders for similar services.
It is important, of course, that no unnecessary alarm should be created among the inhabitants in the neighborhood of your post, and you will accordingly take your measures with as much secrecy as possible, and conceal the real under some other plausible object.

The lieutenant-colonel commanding does not wish to trammel you by specific instructions, but trusts entirely to your judgment and discretion for the adoption of such measures as will best secure the interests of the United States and maintain the honor of its flag.
I am directed also to put you on your guard against any attempts to tamper with the enlisted men of your command similar to"that which is disclosed by the copy of a letter which I send herewith..
Please advise the department commander as soon as possible what effective force (volunteer) can be raised in the neighborhood of your post, and the amount of transportation that can be obtained there by purchase or by contract.

Sir : I inclose a copy of instructions to Major Lynde, Seventh Infantry, to meet a contingency of which you are already apprised. If the necessity for an immediate concentration of troops at Fort Fillmore should exist, you will, without waiting for the instructions of Major Lynde, take such measures as you to ay consider expedient to facilitate the movement of the troops from Fort McLane.

Headquarters,

Maj. I. Lynde,
Seventh InfGomdg. Southern Mil. List, of A. Mex., Fort McLane: Sir : Information from private but reliable sources indicates the possibility of a demonstration by the people of Texas, aided perhaps by some disaffected individuals in Arizona, against the posts and property of the United States in that Territory,, and Colonel Canby desires that you will at once concentrate such a force at Fort Fillmore as will enable you to resist an attack from any quarter.
To do this Fort McLane will at once be abandoned, and the troops and public property transferred to Fort Fillmore. The transportation at both posts and any that can be hired in the neighborhood of either will be employed for this purpose. When the concentration is effected it is believed that you will have under your command a sufficient force to prevent or defeat any attempt of this character. If satisfied of your ability to do this, the transfer of the companies of the First Dragoons to Fort Buchanan will proceed as indicated in Special Orders, No. 85, of the 14th instant, the four companies constituting the garrison of Fort Buchanan until further orders ; but if these posts should be threatened by a force which in your judgment cannot be resisted, you will take such measures for abandoning them as will best subserve the interests of the Government, transferring the troops and -property to other posts in this or in the Department of California (Fort Yuma), as may be determined by circumstances. It is of course important that

both troops and x>roperty should be transferred to Fort Fillmore or bther posts in this department if it can be done without endangering the loss of one or both, but in no event will st ores of any kind be allowed to fall into the hands of the invaders if it be possible to remove or destroy them.
It is understood here that Mr. Grant, late a contractor for supplying the posts in Arizona, has a train of wagons at Tucson, which may probably be hired or purchased if these movements become necessary.
It is probable that Fort Buchanan is the only post in the interior of Arizona that w ill be retained, and the effort to maintain that will be contingent upon the loyalty of the neighboring population.
You are desired to keep yourself as fully informed as possible of the movements of the Texas troops at and below Fort Bliss, the strength of the garrisons at that post and Fort Quitman, of any re-enforcements that they may receive, and any movements that may be made in the direction of any post of New Mexico, keeping these headquarters advised as frequently and as speedily as possible.
The extent of the disaffection in the Mesilla Valley is not fully known here, and probably will not be fully developed there until the civil authorities enter ux>on their duties. The action of the civil authorities will not be anticipated by the military authorities, but any active opposition to the Government of the United States, any measures that would be likely to endanger the safety of your command, or any efforts to furnish assistance to Texas by raising troops or sending supplies of any kind will be quietly but effectually frustrated.
Efforts have been made, and wTill no doubt continue to be made, to induce the men to desert, and to carry writh them into Texas public property of every description, and particularly arms and ammunition. Every effort will be used to defeat these attempts, and particularly to prevent the transfer of arms and ammunition into Texas.
It is stated here upon good authority that the collector of customs at Las Cruces, who is also the sutler at Fort Fillmore, has openly expressed his determination to turn over the funds of the United States in his possession to the State of Texas. It will be the duty of the military authorities to prevent this and similar thefts of public funds and property by every means that may be in their power.
Colonel Canby desires that you will not consider yourself trammeled by instructions, but will do whatever in your judgment v7ill best secure the interest of the United States and maintain the honor of its flag, and he wishes you to feel assured that you will be supported by every means in his power.
A copy of this communication will be sent to Major Paul, at Fort Fillmore, for his information, and for such action as may be necessary before your arrival at that post.

to leave tlie country unmolested 5 also the invasion by Texas militia of the Indian Territory, and the occupation by them of Forts Washita and Arbuckle, and again the expected occupation of Fort Bliss by four companies of Texas militia, renders this frontier peculiarly important.
In connection with the above it may be proper to state that a Convention was held in Mesilla on the 16th of March, 1861, purporting to be a u Convention of the people of Arizona,?? acting separately from the government of the Territory of New Mexico, repudiating the United States, and attaching themselves to the Confederate States. I considered the whole transaction as a farce, and treated it with silent contempt, determined, however, if they attempted to carry out any of their resolutions by resisting or interfering with any of the United States civil officers, that I would protect the latter and punish the former.
Yesterday Mr. L. Labadi, the United States agent for the Indians near Tucson, showed me a paper (a copy of which is inclosed), saying that it was handed to him by Mr. Kelly, editor of the Mesilla Times, who was accompanied by three other citizens of Mesilla, who threatened to tar and feather him if he attempted to exercise the duties of his office. I promised Mr. Labadi military protection should any attempt be made against his person.
The paper referred to is the sixth resolution of the Convention, in which they do not recognize the United States Government, and bind themselves to resist any officer appointed by said Government with whatever means in their power. The signatures of the document are also appended to the petition to the governor of New Mexico begging him to use his influence to have United States troops stationed in Mesilla for the protection of its citizens. Now that their fears are allayed with reference to an alleged invasion from Mexico, they are secretly engaged in fomenting opposition to the United States, and when the four companies of Texas militia reach Fort Bliss difficulties may be reasonably apprebended, and I therefore recommend that a stronger force be stationed here to overawe any attempt on this post. Two additional companies would probably be sufficient.
I think it proper to state that inducements are held out to our men to desert, with their horses, arms, &c., by secret agents of Texas. They are told that it is not desertion to quit the United States Army and to join the South, and that they will be paid all arrearages due them, &c.
Thus far I am happy to report that there has been no discontent among the men, and the discipline of the command is perfect. They are now engaged in target practice.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commanding Officers, Forts Wise and Lamed, Kans.:
Sirs: It is stated here that a considerable body of Texas troops are being organized for a special service, and that one of the presumed objects of this organization is an attempt upon the trains now on their way to this country from the Missouri frontier. Much of this is no doubt conjectural, but I have thought proper to advise you of it, in order that you may put those passing your post on their guard. Will you do me the favor to give me any information that you may possess in relation to the trains now on the road ?
Very respectfully, sirs, your obedient servant,
ED. U. S. CANBY,
Major Tenth Infantry and Bet. Lieut. CoL, U. S. Army.
Headquarters Department of New Mexico,
Santa Fe, A. Mex., June 19, 1861.
Bvt. Lieut. Col. Wm. Chapman,
Major Second Infantry, Comdg. Fort Union, A. Mex.:
Sir: The lieutenant-colonel commanding desires that you will organize a small party of spies, for the purpose of watching the road from Fort Smith to Anton Chico, and another for the purpose of watching the country east of Fort Union and south of the road to the crossing of the Arkansas. These parties should be comi>osed of Mexicans or Indians, if reliable men can be found, as under the ostensible object of trading with the Indians they will be less likely to attract observation t h an parties of troox>s. They will be required to furnish their own animals and arms, but will be furnished by you with subsistence and ammunition. The compensation will be the same as has heretofore been allowed by department orders for similar services. It is important that the parties should be organized as quietly as possible, apd that the real object of the service should be cloaked under some plausible pretext. They should be advanced so far in both directions as to be able to give you timely information of any movements being made in the direction of the frontier or against the trains on the road.
Arrangements are being made by the War Department for guarding the line of communication between the Missouri frontier and this country. The extent of these arrangements is not fully known here, but no apprehensions are entertained except for the trains that may now be between your post and the crossing of the Arkansas. If you should apprehend any danger for them, you will, without waiting for instructions, make the best arrangements that may be in your power for their protection. If it be necessary, in order to replace any portion of your command that may be detached for this purpose, you are authorized to call into the service two or more companies of volunteers to strengthen your command. These companies, if called for, will be regarded as a part of the two regiments to be raised in New Mexico, and their organization will conform to the minimum organization prescribed in War Department General Orders, No. 15, of the 4th ultimo.
On the 14th instant two companies of the Fifth Infantry were ordered from Fort Fauntleroy, for the purpose of strengthening the depots at

Albuquerque and Fort Union, but it will be some time before the company intended for your post can reach it, and in the mean time the lieutenant-colonel commanding does not wish the strength of the garrison at Fort Union to be reduced below 200 men without calling for the volunteers.
You will please report as early as possible any information that you may obtain in reference to the state of affairs in the country to the east and south of your post.
Three or four Indians will be sent from this place to Lieutenant Walker’s party, at Hatch’s ranch, to be used for the same purpose as those you are authorized to employ. Instructions in regard to their employment similar to the above will be sent from these headquarters to Lieutenant Walker.
Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,
A. L. ANDEBSON,
Second Lieutenant, Fifth Inf, A. A. A. G,
Headquarters Department op New Mexico,
Santa Fe, N. Mex., June 20, 1861.
To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, I). C. :
Sir : I have the honor to submit for the consideration of the General-in-Cliief the following statements and suggestions in relation to the service of this department, basing them upon the supposition that it will not ouly be necessary to protect the inhabitants of New Mexico from Indian hostilities, but to defend the country against invasion and to guard our communications with the East—at least as far as the crossing of the Arkansas.
In this view Fort Fillmore, or preferably Fort Bliss, on the south, and Forts Union and Stanton, on the east, will be important strategical points, and should be strongly garrisoned with, if possible, a large portion of each command—regular troops, both infantry and cavalry. Fort Garland and Fort Craig are of subordinate importance, but their garrisons should be determined by the same considerations. The principal depot (Albuquerque) should also be guarded by regular troops.
Fort Fillmore, Fort Stanton, and Fort Union are at remote and exposed points, and it will not be well to trust either entirely to new and undiscix>lined troops. Seven-tenths of the population and resources of the Territory and all the military supplies (in depot) are north of Fort Craig 5 hence the necessity for a strong and reliable garrison at that point, for the purpose of keeping open the communication with and supporting the posts in the South. Fort Garland, commanding the route to Colorado Territory, will be important in the event of political troubles in this country. This contingency is not anticipated, but it will not be wise to disregard it entirely. The contemplated change of the depot at Albuquerque, and the consequent abandonment of Fort Union, would remove the necessity for a separate garrison for the depot, but under existing circumstances it wall not be prudent to establish it at a point w here it would be exposed to the danger of being broken up by the operations of a war.
To distribute the regular force left in the department at the points above indicated would leave no reserve, and would disseminate them so widely that they could not be concentrated to meet any emergency.
From a full consideration of the subject, it is my opinion that one of

## p. 42 (#50) ##############################################

﻿42	OPERATIONS IN TEX., N. MEX., AND ARIZ. [Ciiap. XI.
the infantry regiments (Fifth or Seventh) should be retained in this country at least until the volunteer regiments have attained some degree of instruction and discipline, and that some portion of this (volunteer) force should be mounted ; and I have the honor to recommend that the force to be retained in the department may be 1 regiment (10 companies) of regular infantry, 1 regiment (10 companies) of regular cav-. airy, 2 battalions (16 companies) of foot volunteers, and 3 squadrons (6 companies) of mounted volunteers 5 in all, 42 companies, or an increase of 8 companies over the force authorized by the special orders of May 17, 1861.
If it should be found that the volunteer force authorized for this Territory will draw too heavily upon its population, it is respectfully suggested that a part of it be drawn from Colorado Territory. It would be appropriate and politic to draw from that Territory the volunteers that will be needed within its limits.
Many of the duties of escort, spies, scouts, &c., can be performed very efficiently by mounted volunteers, and the substitution of mounted for a portion of the foot volunteers authorized is suggested, for the purpose of relieving the regular cavalry from a part of these duties and husbanding their horses (which cannot be replaced in this country) as much as possible.
A heavy harnessed battery (four 12-pounder guns and two 24-pounder howitzers) is greatly needed in this department. There are two 24-pounder howitzers at the depot, but I have just learned from the military storekeeper that the carriages are unserviceable. The battery-wagon is also unserviceable.
I have also the honor to invite the attention of the General-in-Chief to the number of officers now absent from the mounted companies to remain in this department, and to request that as many as possible may be ordered to join their companies as soon as practicable. Lieutenant Averell, of the rifle regiment, although unfit for service in the field, may be usefully employed at one of the depots, and his services would be especially important when so many inexperienced officers are -about to be called into the service.

Sir: In consequence of impending difficulties with the Comanche Indians, and the insecurity of the trains on the road from the crossing of the Arkansas to Fort Union, I have the honor to call for three companies of infantry volunteers, to aid in the protection of the eastern frontier of this Territory and guarding the trains on the routes from the Arkansas to this department. As three companies will jirobably form an integral portion of one of the regiments to be mustered into the service of the United States from this Territory, they should be raised in conformity with regulations prescribed in General Orders, No. 15, of May 4, 1861, and until otherwise directed by the War Department the organization of the companies should be the minimum prescribed by

that order. The services of these companies will he needed immediately, and it is respectfully recommended that they be raised in San Miguel County, or as near Fort Union as possible, and be ordered to rendezvous at that post at as early a period as may be practicable. Instructions will be given to the commanding* officer at Fort Union to muster these companies into the service of the United States, to arm them fully, and to equip them, as far as the means in the department will permit.

Sir : The bearer of this communication, First Lieut. Donald C. Stith, of the U. S. Army, has been commissioned by me to visit your excellency, for the purpose of asking your assistance in effecting the restoration of a train of wagons and a large quantity of stores, the property of the Government of the United States, .which were carried into the State of Chihuahua in the month of March last, by William D. Kirk, then a wagon master in the U. S. Army. This flagrant robbery and breach of faith will be fully reprobated by your excellency, and I have the fullest confidence that you will at once, in the exercise of your powers, direct the restoration of the public property and the delivery of the robber (Kirk) into the hands of the accredited agent of the United States. Lieutenant Stith takes with him, for the information of your excellency, a full statement of the circumstances connected with this robbery, so that you can see at once the true history and merits of the case. He will also take inventories of the stolen property, in order that everything may be verified. When this property is restored to Lieutenant Stith I have the honor to request that your excellency will cause him to be furnished with any assistance that may be necessary to facilitate his return to this department, and if it should be needed that you will direct the train to be escorted to the frontier of Chihuahua, where an escort fVom the troops of this department will meet it. I beg to assure your excellency that the action that you may take in this matter will be fully recognized and appreciated by the Government of the United States.

Headquarters Department of New Mexico,
Santa Fe, A. Mex., June 23, 1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir: Since my report of the 16th instant the statements in relation to a contemplated invasion of the Territory appear to be confirmed by information received from various sources, and it is positively known that a considerable force of Texan troops is now on the march for El Paso or that neighborhood, with the ostensible object of garrisoning Forts Quitman and Bliss. I feel assured, however, that a sufficient force will in two or three days be concentrated at Fort Fillmore to render that portion of the country entirely secure, and enable the commanding officer to repress any revolutionary movements that may be set on foot by the people of the Mesilla Valley.
I hope, too, that Major Lynde will find himself in sufficient force to reoccupy Fort Bliss and recover the public property now at that place. Two mounted companies have been ordered to report to him at Fort Fillmore as soon as practicable, and he has been authorized to call for volunteers if he should find it necessary.
The next point in inqjortance is Fort Union, and to enable the commanding officer of that post to guard the depot, protect the trains on the road, and watch the approach by the Canadian I have called upon the governor of the Territory for four companies of foot volunteers, who will rendezvous at that place in two or three days. Four companies of foot volunteers have also been called for the purpose of relieving the companies of the Fifth Infantry now at Fort Fauntleroy. They will rendezvous at Albuquerque. One company of foot and one of mounted volunteers will rendezvous at Fort Stanton, and one company of foot and one of mounted volunteers at Fort Craig, making in all ten companies of foot and two of mounted volunteers. These requisitions have been made in anticipation of the orders of the War Department calling them into the service, and for the purpose of defending exposed points and facilitating the concentration of the regular troops that are to leave the department.
Our Indian relations are still unsatisfactory. The Apaches of Arizona are still actively hostile, and have committed many depredations during the past month, and the Comanches are openly at war with us.

His intimate knowledge of the people in that part of the country will enable him to indicate to you those upon whose fidelity you can rely, and this, at the present juncture, will be a matter of the utmost importance.

Maj. Isaac Lynde,
Seventh Infantry, Comdg. Southern District,
Department of New Mexico, Fort Fillmore, A. Mex.:
Sir : I am instructed to say that your communication of the 14th instant and Major Paul’s report of the 16th instant, in relation to affairs in the Mesilla Valley, have been received. The orders and instructions heretofore given you anticipate the recommendations made by Major Paul and yourself. Duplicates of these orders and instructions will be sent herewith. I am instructed to state, for your information, that your command will be re-enforced by two mounted companies: one from Port Craig and one from Port Stanton. A requisition has been made upon the governor for volunteers to strengthen the garrisons at Forts Stanton and Craig, and keep open the communication between these posts and Port Fillmore.
You are authorized, if you should consider it necessary, to call into the service of the United States two or more companies of volunteers from the neighborhood of your post. Three hundred rifles and muskets and 12,000 cartridges will also be sent for the purpose of arming any volunteers that you call for. Twenty thousand rations of subsistence have been ordered from the depot at Albuquerque for the use of your force. Assistant Surgeon Alden will be ordered to report to you for duty with your command. You are requested to transmit, at as early a period as possible, your requisitions for any supplies that may be needed for your command, basing them upon the supposition that there will not be less than 2,000 men to be provided for, in order that arrangements may be made for filling them as rapidly and as fully as possible.
It is impossible, at this distance, and with the imperfect knowledge of passing events in your neighborhood, to give you definite instructions, but the lieutenant-colonel commanding relies upon your zeal and judg. ment to give the greatest effect for de tense or for offense to the means that will be under your control. The present strength of Fort Bliss and the period of the expected arrival of the re-enforcements from Texas are not known here, but it is scarcely necessary to suggest to you that the frontier in charge could be more permanently secured from invasion by the seizure of that post and the property of the United States now

there than by any other course and before the re-enforcements have arrived. You must judge whether the means under your control will be sufficient to accomplish this object without hazard to the more important object of maintaining your position at Fort Fillmore.
It is represented that there are many loyal men in the Mesilla Valley who would really volunteer their services, and as the organization of volunteer companies in their midst would tend greatly to paralyze the disaffected, this course is suggested in calling for any volunteers you may consider necessary.
The promotion of Major Paul to the Eighth Infantry has been received here, but as his services will be necessary in organizing and mustering volunteers into the service of the United States, you are authorized to retain him for the present, and will please give the same directions at other posts within your district where the immediate change would leave a company without an officer or occasion other serious embarrassments to the service.

Capt. R. M. Morris,
Commanding Officer, Fort Craig, N. Mex.:
Sir : For the purpose of strengthening your post and enabling you to furnish escorts of sufficient strength for public property that may be sent to Fort Fillmore and other posts in the South, a requisition has been made upon the governor of the Territory for one company of mounted and one company of foot volunteers, to be mustered into the service of the United States at Fort Craig.
Mr. Robert H. Stapleton, who lives near your post, will be authorized by the governor to raise the mounted company. Col. M. E. Pino, appointed by the President to the command of the Second Regiment of New Mexican Volunteers, will designate the foot company. The mounted company will be mustered into the service as ail independent company and for the period of three months. The foot company will be one of the companies of the Second Regiment, and will be mustered in for three years, unless sooner discharged. The organization in both cases will be the minimum prescribed by General Orders (War Department), No. 15, of 1861. You are charged with the duty of organizing, inspecting, and mustering these companies into the service, and you will be governed in this duty by the instructions of the War Department of June 12, 1818, as modified by General Orders (War Department), Nos. 15 and 25, of 1861, and the General Regulations of 1857.
It is supposed that a copy of the instructions above referred to will be found with your company records. For fear that it should not, extracts that relate to the muster into the service will be sent to you. The General Orders, Nos. 15 and 25, are inclosed herewith. There are no blank muster rolls on hand, and it will be necessary to muster on manuscript rolls. A form is sent herewith. The oath of allegiance to the Government of the United States must be taken by all who enter the service, and the refusal to take it will be an absolute cause of rejection. The oath of the commissioned officers of the company will be attested by a civil magistrate and sent to this office by the mustering

officer. To the non-commissioned officers and men it will be administered as prescribed by the instructions of 1848, paragraph 104.
As soon as mustered, these companies will be armed and equipped for immediate service. Arms, ammunition, and camp and garrison equipage will be issued upon requisitions approved by you, but no clothing will be issued without further orders. If you have not on hand a sufficiency of camp equipage (tents, axes, spades, camp-kettles, and mess pans), you will make your requisitions upon the department quartermaster at Albuquerque, who will be instructed to fill them without reference to department headquarters.
The mounted company will be armed with rifles and the foot company with muskets. The arms for this purpose and the necessary ammunition have been ordered to be sent you from the depot at Fort Union. If they should not reach you in season, you can probably obtain for temporary use the arms in the possession of the volunteers in the neighborhood of your post, to be returned when the regular supply is received. A list of these will be sent to you herewith.
The action of the State of Texas and of the people of the Mesilla Valley make it necessary that your post should be strengthened, so as to enable you to keep open the communication with the posts in the South. Your own company, the company (F) of the Seventh Infantry, and the two companies of volunteers will probably be sufficient for this purpose.
Your views in relation to this are invited, bearing in mind that strong escorts will be required for all trains going South, and that it is known privately that a movement against New Mexico is being organized at Fort Bliss, and, if not frustrated, will take place soon after the Texan troops reach that post. They are expected about the first of next month.

least 100 mounted men and two companies of New Mexican volunteers, the whole to be under the command of Captain Duncan, Mounted Rifles, for the protection of the trains on the road from the crossing of the Arkansas to Fort Union. The command will move as lightly equipped as possible, and will take with it rations for thirty days. As the service will be performed on or near the road, wagon transportation will be used, but a few fresh mules should be taken to meet the contingency of temporary detachments if it should be necessary to make any. A party of ten spies and guides will be attached to the command, and particular care should be taken in selecting them. You will please indicate to Captain Duncan that the lieutenant-colonel commanding trusts entirely to his discretion for the protection of the trains, and that he will take such measures as may, in his judgment, be most necessary to accomplish this object. He thinks proper, however, to suggest that the command should be kept as compact as possible; that no detachments should be made if it is possible to avoid it, and the country in his front and dank should be thoroughly searched by the spies attached to his command.
The commanding officer at Fort Larned has been requested to advise trains passing that post to keep up the Arkansas and come into New Mexico by the Raton route.
Captain Duncan will be relieved in season to return to Fort Union at the expiration of thirty days for which provisioned, if it should be found necessary to keep out a command for a longer period.

If the abandonment of Fort Buchanan has not yet been completed, it will be hastened as much as possible. The command will move in one body, if it be possible to procure the necessary transportation for the whole command, and prepared to resist attack from any quarter. Your artillery may possibly be needed, and should be put in a condition for service. If there should be any loyal citizens in the neighborhood of your post that wish to occupy the improvements that have been made at Fort Buchanan, you are authorized to turn it over to them.
At this distance, and under the circumstances, no special instructions can be given to you, but you will exercise your own judgment in carrying out this object in the manner that will best subserve the interests of the United States. This communication will be sent to you by express from Fort Craig, and you will please advise the commanding officer of the receipt by the return of the expressman.

Headquarters Department of New Mexico,
Santa Fe, N. Mex., June 30, 1801. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir: Since my report of the 23d instant positive information has been received of the contemplated movements of the Texans against the interests of the Government in this Territory. This whs naturally to have been expected, and measures were taken at an early period after Colonel Loring left this place to concentrate a sufficient force at Fort Fillmore to defeat any measures of this kind and to cover the movements that would be necessary in withdrawing the troops from the interior of Arizona. Several resigned officers who have left the Territory through Texas have aided and counseled in these contemplated movements, and my information implicates one or more who have not yet left the department. The commanders interested have been warned, and if the mischief has not already been accomplished it will be prevented.
Major Paul’s report of the 22d instant undoubtedly chronicles one of a series of robberies that have for some time been in contemplation, and I cannot comprehend how the officers at Fort Fillmore can still place any faith in the protestations and disclaimers of the Texan authorities at Fort Bliss. It is notorious that for two months past they have been tampering with the enlisted men at the posts in the South and offering them large bribes to induce them to desert.
Indian depredations still continue; one near Socorro of some magnitude. The others are generally of but little importance. Several ] proved upon investigation to have been committed by citizens, several of whom have been caught by the troops and are now in jail at this place.
The most assailable point in this department is the approach from Arkansas and Texas by the Canadian, and rumors indicate the probability of an invasion from that quarter. If it should be made in large force, serious difficulties may be apprehended, as the Mexican population will not furnish, for some time at least, a reliable force to resist invasion. To meet this possibility I am hastening as much as I can the organization of the volunteers called for, in order to concentrate as large a force of regulars as possible.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

Sir : Major Paul’s communication of the 22d instant, reporting the loss of 41 horses, of Company A, Mounted Bides, and other communications from Fort Bliss in relation to the same subject, have been received, and I am instructed to say there is sufficient evidence here to show conclusively that this robbery was not the unauthorized act of a band of robbers, but was planned at Hart’s Mill as early as the 10th or 12th of this month, and is only one of a series that will be undertaken if prompt measures are not taken to defeat them. The horses were stolen for the purpose of mounting one of the companies of Texas troops now on their way to Fort Bliss. The reward offered by Magoffin and

the disclaimers of the Texan authorities are mere blinds, to throw you off your guard and keep the troops inactive until Fort Bliss is re-enforced. When this object is secured there will be demonstrations against your post, the trains that supply it, or against Fort Stanton. .
The movements of the Texans at Fort Bliss have been watched, and although the precise object and the details of their contemplated movements cannot be ascertained, it is positively known that movements against New Mexico are on foot; that officers who recently left the country by that route have aided and counseled in the plans, and it is alleged that others still in the service are implicated in these transactions. There is no doubt that these movements will be undertaken the moment that the instigators feel assured of a probability of success. The leading secessionists in Mesilla are apprised of these plans, and to the extent of their ability will assist in carrying them out.
The State of Texas is avowedly at war with the Government of the United States. The character of the enemy you have to deal with has been fully exhibited in the last few months, and they now expect to be able in a few days to carry the war into New Mexico. It is hoped that before this time you have a sufficient force under your control to make them feel that the war is not to be entirely upon one side.
The surplus horses at Fort Craig will be sent down as soon as possible to Fort Fillmore for the purpose of remounting a part of Company A, but it will be very difficult to procure a sufficient number in the department to remount the whole company. As many as can be procured will be sent.
Orders have been sent direct to-day for the abandonment of Fort Buchanan) the garrison to report to you at Fort Fillmore as soon as possible.
The lieutenant-colonel commanding directs me to repeat his assurance that you will be supported in any measures that you may undertake by all the means that he can control, and that there is no intention of withdrawing any portion of the regular force under your command until the affairs within the limits of your command are placed upon a satisfactory footing. He desires that you will keep him fully advised of matters that transpire in your neighborhood, and that you will keep the commanding officer at Fort Stanton advised of any matters that may affect his post.

Sir : I am instructed by the lieutenant-colonel commanding to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 24th ultimo, and to say in reply to your application for re-enforcements that one company of the Fifth Infantry from Albuquerque has been ordered to proceed at once to your post; that a requisition has been made upon the governor of the Territory for additional companies of volunteers, one of which will be sent to you as soon as it can be organized, and that a company of your regiment will be ordered from Fort Union to report to you as soon as a company of mounted volunteers can be organized for service at that post.

More definite information from Texas indicates that the people in the neigh borhood of Fort Bliss will not be in a condition to make important demonstrations against New Mexico before the arrival of the Texan troops at that post. These troops are not expected before the 10th of this month. It is believed that if any demonstrations are made before that time they will be confined to marauding expeditions, for the purpose of stealing your horses or disabling your command by driving off your means of transportation. It is known that movements of this kind are in contemplation, and will be undertaken as soon as the instigators find themselves sufficiently strong to hope for success, audit is believed that Fort Stanton is one of the points at which they will be aimed. The lieutenant-colonel commanding therefore desires that you will at once put your post in the best condition for defense that it is capable of, and that every arrangement that your experience and judgment may suggest should be brought into requisition. It is to be hoped that you may be able to pacify the Apaches without the necessity of making war upon them, as any difficulty of this kind would be productive of great embarrassment, and at all events they will be of subordinate importance until the arrangements for resisting invasion are complete. It is not intended to withdraw any of the means of transportation at your jiost. The .-object of the inquiry was to ascertain the amount of transportation that could be procured in the neighborhood of your post for general purposes. If you should find it necessary before the arrival of the volunteers referred to in my communication of the 26th ultimo, you are authorized to muster into the service any volunteers that can be obtained in the neighboring country.
Nothing has yet been heard from Colonel Pino, or of the company of mounted volunteers called for your post. It is hoped, however, that they will soon arrive there. The operations of Lieutenant Howland were executed with such judgment and energy as to entitle his command and himself to warm commendation. You are regarded as the commanding officer of the Rifle Regiment, but considerations enumerated in my communication of the 22d instant render it advisable to defer the transfer of the headquarters at present.

Washington, D. 0., July 3,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : The President informed me last evening that you had completed your report, and advised me to call on you in reference to the troops about to be raised in New Mexico.
Advices from Governor Stanton and Judge Watts urge the importance of having three regiments, two of them to be mounted, and, in viewT of threatened aggressions in the northern as well as the southern portion of the Territory by the domestic foe, immediate action in the premises is deemed absolutely necessary.
I have seen Adjutant-General Thomas, and he concedes the propriety of having some cavalry, and is willing to recommend the addition of one regiment of mounted men to the two regiments already authorized; but it is almost unanimously agreed by officers of the Army and civilians wTho are acquainted with the character of the country, its wants, its population, and the existing emergency, that there should be at least three regiments, and that a majority of them should be cavalry. Every man will furnish his own horse for the mounted service, and thus a heavy preliminary expenditure will be avoided by the Government.
Major-General Fremont and Colonel Blair, whom I had the honor of meeting at the President’s, fully concur in the opinion that infantry troops are not well adapted to active service in the held in New Mexico, and the experience of those gentlemen in the country in question invests their opinions with the weight of high authority. The zeal I have manifested in this matter is prompted by no interest beyond that which every patriot should feel in his devotion to the integrity, the honor, and the flag of his country.
If you would most effectually strengthen the Government of the United States, physically and morally, in that recently conquered and imperfectly loyalized region of our country; if you would plant most deeply in the soil of New Mexico and in the hearts of her people the staff* from which floats the “flag of the free,” you must show the good faith of giving them ample protection, alike against the marauding savage and the rebellious domestic foe.
Earnestly hoping, my dear sir, that you may find it consistent with your sense of public duty and congenial with your well-known patriotism to give us the three regiments, two of them cavalry, and that in view of the exigencies you may immediately give the order to that effect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant, .

The reclamation of persons who have been enrolled in the volunteer companies mustered into the service of the United States will no doubt be raised at your post; and I am instructed to state for your information that no discharge for this cause will be ordered at department headquarters; consequently, that the only resource of the persons claiming such service will be by the writ of habeas corpus from the United States courts in the Territory. The local courts of the Territory have no jurisdiction, and their writs will not be respected.

Headquarters Department of Xew Mexico,
Santa Fc, A. Mex., July 7, 1861. Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters of the Army:
Sir: Xo information, except the special orders of May 17, has yet been received in relation to the volunteers to be called into the service in this department, and as the organization of the regiments cannot be postponed without delaying the concentration of the regular troops or hazarding important interests, I have informed the governor of the Territory that, in addition to the requisitions that have already been made, I would at once accept and muster into service the companies that are required to complete the organization of Colonels St. Vraiifs and Pino’s regiments.
The organization of the companies already called for progresses very slowly, and I entertain such serious doubts of the ability of the Territory to furnish all, that I have made a requisition on the governor of Colorado Territory for two companies of infantry for the garrison of Fort Garland. The state of affairs at the South and the increasing Indian hostilities will render it inexpedient to detach any of the force now in this section.
Fort Bliss has been re-enforced by four companies of Texas troops. The movements of these troops have no doubt been hastened for a special purpose, in connection with enterprises against this department. Colonel Loring left the department on the 23d instant, but I had previously, for reasons that have already been assigned, exercised the command of the department without reference to him. There is reason to

fear that his influence, coupled with other causes, may have been productive of evil in that quarter, but I hope that a sufficient force was concentrated at Fort Fillmore in season to counteract the designs of the Texans upon that post. Major Lynde, with a portion of the command from Fort McLane, was expected on the 5th instant, and I think that there are by this time eight or ten companies at that post, which will be sufficient, I think, to resist the threatened invasion, and give time and cover for any movements that may be necessary to protect the interests of the United States in that quarter.
A command of about 300 men, regulars and volunteers, will be detached from Fort Union for the protection of the trains coming into this country from the Missouri frontier. This force will be sufficient to secure them against the attacks of Indians or marauding parties, but not against a large organized force from the frontiers of Arkansas or Texas.
The inclosed papers will give the General-in-Chief some idea of the state of affairs in the South, but I hope that the measures that have been taken and are in progress will be sufficient to defeat these designs.

Hart’s Mill, El Paso, Tex., June 12,1861.
Col. W. W. Torino:
My Dear Lorino : We are at last under the glorious banner of the Confederate States of America. It was indeed a glorious sensation of protection, hope, and pride. Though its folds were modest and unpretending, the emblem was still there. The very Southern verdure and familiar foliage, as we progressed on our journey, filled us with enthusiasm and home feeling.
We shall have no trouble from here down to San Antonio. The stage runs regularly semi-weekly, carrying five passengers and a reasonable amount of baggage, reaching San Antonio in six days $ thence to Berwick Bay in stages, and to Sew Orleans by rail.
Van Dorn is in command at San Antonio. He has ordered four companies of Texas troops to garrison this post. They cannot be expected to reach here, however, before the 1st proximo. Meanwhile, Colonel Magoffin, Judge Hart, and Crosby are very much exercised and concerned on account of the public stores here in their present unguarded condition.
There are full supplies of subsistence and ammunition here for two or more companies for twelve months.. The loss of these supplies by capture or destruction would occasion serious embarrassment to the cause. The gentlemen I have named have applied to me for advice in the premises. I have promised to hasten on from below by forced marches the cavalry force en route here. Meanwhile you may, by delaying your own departure a week or two, add much to the security of this property.
I regret now more than ever the sickly sentimentality (I can call it by no other name) by which I was overruled in my desire to bring my whole command with me. I am satisfied now of the disaffection of the best of the rank and file in New Mexico, and that we are regarded as having betrayed and deserted them. I wish I had my part to play over again; no such peace scruples should deter me from doing what I considered a bounden duty to my friends and my cause. I do not advocate the meeting of duplicity and dishonesty by the like weapons, but

if I capture tlie treasury buildings I shall certainly not send back to my enemy the golden bricks.
Should you be relieved from command too soon to prevent an attempt on the part of your successor to recapture, by a coup de main, the property here, send a notice by extraordinary express to Judge Hart. Your seat in the stage may at the same time be engaged.
Movements are in contemplation from this direction which I am not at liberty to disclose. You will arrive here in time for everything and to hear everything.

La Mesilla, H. Mex., June 23, 1861.
Hon. John S. Watts:
Sir : I came up here two days ago hoping to meet you. I assure you that I find matters here in a most deplorable condition. A disunion flag is now flying from the house in which I write, and this country is now as much in the possession of the enemy as Charleston is. All the officers at Fort Fillmore, except two, are avowedly with the South, and are only holding on to their commissions in order to embarrass our Government, and at the proper time to turn over everything to the South, after the manner of General Twiggs. The Mesilla Times is bitterly disunion, and threatens with death any one who refuses to acknowledge this usurpation. There is, however, a latent Union sentiment here, especially among the Mexicans, but they are effectually overawed. Give them something to rally to, and let them know that they have a Government worthy of their support, and they will teach their would-be masters a lesson. The soldiers also, in defiance of the teaching of their officers and the offer of gold from Hart, are yet faithful, and if a second lieutenant were to ask them to follow him, they would tear down this flag and throw the Times office into the river in one hour. Fifty of them could now go to Fort Bliss and bring up all the Government stores from that place, but instead of this a few thieves came up from El Paso a few days ago and stole 40 of the horses belonging to the mounted company at Fillmore. Ho effort was made to retake these horses, although the soldiers plead with their officers to allow them to follow the thieves. If Colonel Boberts, from Stanton, or any other faithful officer, would come here and take command, all would be right in three days. About 300 Texas troops are expected at Fort Bliss in about two weeks from this time, and if something is not done before that time Fort Fillmore will be surrendered. I have yet faith that this will be prevented. The only reason why I do not go immediately to Santa Fe is that I think I can be of some service to you here when you come to hold jour court, and I claim it as my right to take part in the fight here, if fight it must be. I go to El Paso to-morrow, but will return in A few days to await coming events. I hope to find a letter from you at El Paso. I have nothing late from the States or from my brother.
Hoping that you will excuse my great haste, I am, very respectfully,

in this Territory, at the head of which are Magoffin, Hart, and Crosby. Sibley is also said to be associated with them. It is alleged that Colonel Loring is in communication with these parties, and that he will remain in the department long enough to prevent any measures, being taken to frustrate these designs. When Colonel Loring left this place every officer here had implicit confidence in his integrity, but I am sorry to say that some information received since he left has shaken that confidence.

Sir : I had occasion on the 24th instant to put you on your guard against the alleged complicity of Colonel Loring in the treasonable designs of the Texas authorities at Fort Bliss. I now send a copy of one and extracts from another letter, sent to me after the arrival of the mail yesterday, which fully confirm all the information I had previously received. Although Colonel Loring was still in the department, I have not hesitated, since this information was communicated to me, to exercise the command and to give any orders or to take any measures that I considered necessary to protect the honor or the interests of the Government.
Sibley’s letter shows the Texas authorities at Fort Bliss count upon Colonel Boring’s aid in furthering their plans, and indicates the manner (by delaying his departure) in which this aid is to be rendered. Colonel Boring’s resignation was tendered on the 13th of last month, and has doubtless long since been accepted; but this is not material, for any failure to act at once, or any hesitancy in acting, may be in the highest degree disastrous. In this case, then, as in all similar cases that may occur, you will at once arrest the implicated parties, and hold them securely until their guilt or innocence can be determined by the proper tribunals. No considerations of delicacy or of regard must be permitted to interfere when the honor of the country and the safety of your command are involved.

Col. E. R. S. Canby,
Commanding Department, Santa Fe, N. Mex.:
Colonel : I received your dispatches yesterday by Lieutenant Hall, and was very much astonished to receive such proofs of treachery against Colonel Loring. I had always believed him to be a man of the most unflinching honor and integrity. I was not so much disappointed in Major Sibley. I think the extracts inclosed do great injustice to the officers at this post. I fully believe that every officer at this post will do their whole duty as long as they retain their commissions in our Army, though some may intend to resign soon. I believe that if the post had been attacked before my arrival, Captain Garland would have fought with his command to the last extremity.
This fort is very badly situated for defense. It is placed in a basin, surrounded by sand hills, at least half the circumference of the circle, and they are covered by a dense growth of chaparral. These sand hills completely command the post, and render it indefensible against a force supplied with artillery. A force of a thousand men could approach it within 500 yards under perfect cover.
As yet I have not been able to make myself acquainted with the surrounding localities, but I am- now of the opinion that if Texas should make a strong effort to overcome Arizona, it would be policy to withdraw our force beyond the Jornada to Fort Craig, as I do not think this post or the valley worth the exertion to hold it. If no more troops reach Fort Bliss I do not think they will attempt any aggressive movement against this Territory other than theft or robbery, yet I shall be on my guard at all times. I shall make an effort to raise a company of volunteers, but am not able to say with what success. I presume you are informed before this of the departure of Colonel Loring prior to my arrival.

fantry, and found that no demonstration from Texas had been made on this post. The remaining companies of the Fort MeLane command, viz, B and I, Seventh Infantry, will be here to-day. I shall then have very little fear of the result of any attack that will be likely to be made from Texas. From the best information that.I can obtain, there are four companies of Texas troops at Fort Bliss, with two 18-pounders and four or more small guns. It is .stated that they are fortifying tor their own defense. It is probable that there are two companies now at Fort Stanton.

Sir : I have the honor to report that there has been no material change in the state of affairs in this department since my report of the 7th instant.
The garrison of Fort Fillmore has been increased to seven companies of infantry and two of rifles, relieving the anxiety that had previously been felt for the security of that post. Under cover of this force the troops and public property in the interior of Arizona are now being withdrawn. Arrangements are being made as rapidly as possible for the withdrawal of the regular troops and disposition of public property, as required by the special orders (Headquarters of the Army) of May 17 and June 12, 1861. The organization of the volunteer regiments, particularly the Second (Colonel Piuo’s), progresses very slowly.

While on my way to Chihuahua, in pursuance of instructions from the department, having proceeded as far as 1 mile beyond the town of Guadalupe, Mexico—which place is about 40 miles distant from the town of El Paso, Mexico—and while encamped, a party of men from 12 to 15 in number came up; and one, representing himself to be Lieutenant Adams, told me he had orders to arrest me and take me to Fort Bliss.
I asked him by what authority he did so. He replied, “By authority of the Southern Confederacy.77 I told him I did not recognize any such power, and that it was a violation of the law of nations—my [I] being

on the soil of a foreign power. He replied that he was acting under the orders of his commanding officer, Colonel Baylor.
As 1 had not sufficient force to resist him, I obeyed the order under protest, and was brought to this place, together with those who had accompanied me the whole way from Fort Fillmore, which we reached on the morning of the 18th instant.
I was brought into the presence of Colonel Baylor, who told me that I wtis a prisoner of war. I told him in substance the same I did Lieutenant Adams, saying that I acknowledged no such power as the Southern Confederacy, and that it was a violation of the soil of Mexico. He replied that he had not given any orders for my arrest, but that as long as I had been brought to the garrison, he did not see fit to release me; he, however, acknowledged that his command had exceeded their authority in arresting me on the soil of Mexico. He then ottered me a parole, which I signed, the only alternative being close confinement.
I have given the full particulars of the matter, with my regret that my mission has been so abruptly terminated. I beg leave to state that I have been treated by Colonel Baylor and his officers with the utmost kindness and consideration.

Sir: Since my last weekly report no material change has occurred in affairs at this post or in this valley. Scouting parties from Fort Bliss penetrate this country as far as the Cottonwoods (22 miles below this place), and on one occasion I detached a column of infantry for this side and a column of rifles for the other side of the river, to capture or drive back a party said to be at the Mesa, a town 10 miles below this post. The command returned without finding any suspicious bodies of men. On the 18th instant, I detached twro companies of infantry, under command of Capt. J. H. Potter, Seventh Infantry, and occupied the town of San Tomas, on the opposite side of the river, and distant about two and a half miles. From its location, the town commands the road from El Paso to Mesilla. A series of lagunas between the town and hills prevent the passage of artillery or wagons, and only horsemen could pass over the lava ridge in rear of the town. A detail of 1 noncommissioned officer and 10 mounted men is sent to Captain Potter daily, for such service as may be necessary.
Information has reached me that ammunition is being sent from Fort Bliss to Mesilla. I have accordingly ordered all wagons from that direction to be stopped and searched.
The Apaches have commenced operations in our immediate vicinity. On the night of the 19th instant they killed 2 persons 2 or 3 miles in rear of the post, and stole a pair of horses and the harness, and the next morning killed 2 men and drove off over 2,000 sheep. Application was made to me for mounted troops to pursue them. I declined furnishing any, but stated that when the volunteers called for were forthcoming I would then assist them as far as was in my power.
In compliance with instructions received yesterday from department

headquarters the enlistment of volunteers is suspended. About 50 names were on the list up to that time.
Oapt. J. M. Jones, Seventh Infantry, is still absent. Contradictory rumors are in circulation as to the number of troops at and en route to Fort Bliss. From the best information I can obtain, the number all told will not exceed 500. The effective force at present under my command %is 450, exclusive of sick (38). There are 98 iqen on detached service, nearly all of whom will join within a week. Nothing has been heard of the troops from Forts Buchanan and Breckinridge since the reception of the order requiring the abandonment of both posts.

To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington:
Sir : 1 have the honor to report that thus far only twelve of the volunteer companies called for in this department have been organized, and that the enrollment of the others is progressing very slowly. It is certain that a sufficient force cannot be raised to hold the posts in Dona Ana and Arizona Counties, and it is questionable whether Fort Stanton can be retained. The withdrawal of the regular troops will leave the lower counties entirely exposed to Indian and Texan depredations, and the upper country to invasion by two routes that are now covered by Forts Fillmore and Stanton. My opinion of the result of such an invasion, if opposed only by New Mexico volunteers, has already been communicated through Captain Wainwright.
The troops from the most distant posts are being withdrawn as rapidly as the circumstances of the country and the slow organization of the volunteers will permit, but a strong force will be kept at Fort Stanton and Fort Fillmore until the troops have been withdrawn and the public property removed from the most exposed points.
The disturbed state of the lower country and the difficulty of procuring transportation will delay these movements, but I expect that the first column (six companies of infantry and four of cavalry) will be in readiness to march from Fort Union by or soon after the middle of next month.
Indian depredations, particularly in Arizona, continue to be very frequent. In other respects the state of affairs has not materially changed since my last report.

The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended in order to enable every commander to guard against the treasonable designs of persons disloyal to the Government of the United States, particularly agents and spies, persons engaged in furnishing information to, or in other treasonable correspondence with, the enemy, or in inciting insurrection or rebellion.
Care will be taken to guard against any abuse of this power by unauthorized arrests or by annoyances to peaceable and well-disposed citizens, and, except in the case of overt acts, arrests will only be made by the superior commander of any district, post, or body of troops in the service of the United States, and only upon probable cause of suspicion of being dangerous to the public safety.
When arrests are made, the person arrested will immediately be examined, and if there be no ground for suspicion, will be released; if otherwise, held in confinement until his case is disposed of by the proper authorities. If there be evidence of treason or misprision of treason, he will be turned over to the civil courts for trial.
In the execution of these duties the troops will at all times unite with and assist the civil authorities in maintaining order throughout the country.

Headquarters Western Department, St. Louis, Mo.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of General Orders, No. 1, of the 25th ultimo,t and to submit for the information of the commanding general a summary statement of the affairs of this department.
Colonel Loring, late commander of the department, left this post on the 11th and the department on the 23d of June last. On the 14th of that month the instructions of the General-in-Chief to withdraw the infantry force from the department were received, and measures were immediately taken to bring them in from the interior and most distant posts. By the same instructions the commander of the department was instructed to post the regular troops remaining in the department and such volunteers as would be presented to him so as to best protect the United States. No instructions were then or have since been received in relation to the volunteers, and the agent, who it was understood had been appointed for the purpose of organizing them, did not reach this country until last night. Eequisitions were, however, made upon the governors of this and of Colorado Territory for such volunteers as were required to replace the troops to be withdrawn.
As the southern part of the Territory was in a very disturbed condition in consequence of Indian hostilities and the revolutionary efforts of a few individuals, it was considered necessary to establish a strong force (one mounted and seven infantry companies) at Fort Fillmore to protect the interests of the United States in that quarter and cover the withdrawal of the troops from the interior of Arizona.

It soon became apparent that the volunteer forces could not be relied on for the defense of this Territory, unless supported by a considerable force of regular troops. This fact was represented in a special report of the 20th of June. On the 12tli of July instructions were received for the withdrawal of the remainder of the regular troops, and an officer of the department staff (Captain Wainwright) was sent to the headquarters of the Army to represent that if all the regular troops were removed, it would inevitably result in the abandonment of the country and the absolute loss of the immense amount of public property already in or en route to the Territory.
In consequence of the anticipated arrivals of Texan re enforcements on the line below Fort Fillmore, that post was re-enforced by two additional companies of mounted troops, and Forts Stanton and Craig were strengthened. On the 15th of July the commanding officer at Fort Fillmore was advised that Fort Fillmore would be abandoned, and was instructed to remove the public property, so as to abandon the post as soon as the troops from Arizona had passed up; the regular troops from Forts Stanton and Craig to be withdrawn as soon as volunteers could be raised to replace them.
On the 25th of July a Texan force occupied the town of Mesilla, and after an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge it Major Lynde abandoned his post, anrl on the 27th surrendered his entire command (about 500 men) to an inferior force of Texans. I have abstained from making any comments upon this transaction, for the reason that Major Lynde’s conduct will be made the subject of a judicial investigation.
The troops surrendered were paroled by the Texans, and are now on their march for Fort CJnion. They will be sent out of the country, and may, I presume, be employed on the overland route to California.
A copy of the terms of surrender is herewith inclosed. For the purpose of supporting the troops at the South and resisting any further invasion of the country Fort Stanton was abandoned, and a part of the troops at that post and those being withdrawn from Fort Fauntle-roy were concentrated at Fort Craig. At the time of Major Lynde’s surrender two companies of the First Dragoons and two companies of the Seventh Infantry, under Captain Moore, were on their march to the river, but having been apprised by expresses from Fort Craig, destroyed a portion of his baggage, and conducting his command by a mountainous trail, reached Fort Craig on the 8th instant. Fort Union and Fort Craig are now strongly occupied, and may be regarded as the initial points both for offensive and defensive operations. The headquarters of the First Regiment of Hew Mexican Volunteers have been established at the former, and those of the Second will be at the latter, as soon as it can be organized. I have not yet succeeded in organizing a mounted force to replace the cavalry, as thus far but three companies have been raised, but I hope in a few days to have several completed and mustered into the service.
I have heretofore called the General-in-Chief?s attention to the destitute condition of this department in military resources and supplies of every kind. There is not artillery enough in the department to arm a single post properly, and the supply of ammunition, except for small-arms, is exceedingly limited. Demounts for cavalry horses and draught animals for the quartermaster’s department cannot be procured in the department, and the estimates made upon the Quartermaster-General have not yet been answered.
Ho information has yet been received with regard to the annual supply of ordnance stores required for the use of the troops in the depart-

ment. If it is the intention of the Government to retain this department, I urgently recommend that the supplies necessary for the efficiency of the troops (regulars or volunteers), and especially those already estimated for, should be furnished as soon as practicable.

Sir .* I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of General Orders,* No. 2, of the 26th ultimo, and to transmit in reply a summary statement* of the volunteer force that has been mustered into the service in this department, and will submit a more detailed statement in a few days.
The organization of a volunteer force in this department has progressed. Of the thirty-two companies that I have called for to replace the regular troops that have been ordered out of the country only nineteen have been organized, and several of these are below the minimum organizations prescribed by War Department General Orders, No. 15, of May 4, 1861.
The people of the Territory, with few exceptions, I believe, are loyal, but they are apathetic in disposition, and will adopt any measures that may be necessary for the defense of their Territory with great tardiness, looking with greater concern to their private, and often petty interests, and delaying or defeating the objects of the Government by their personal or political quarrels. I question very much whether a sufficient force for the defense of the Territory can be raised within its limits, and I place no reliance upon any volunteer force that can be raised, unless strongly supported by regular troops. The most that can be hoped from them will be the occupation of two or three important points, which may be fortified and held by them until the policy of the Government with regard to this Territory has been settled and expressed.

Washington. I know that you are well acquainted with the character of this population, and need only to inform you that the volunteers recently raised here are not composed of the rancheros, or even of the better class of Mexicans, but, on the contrary, for you to see how entirely defenseless the Territory will be if the U. S. Army is withdrawn.
I have informed the Department at Washington that abundant supplies of ordnance stores are on hand at this depot to last the troops now in the Territory for at least twelve months from this time, and I believe that this will apply to the supplies in the other departments—quartermaster’s, commissary, &c.—after the stores now arriving for them are received, so that want of supplies here cannot be advanced for the necessity of the withdrawal of the troops.

Col. E. R. S. Canby,

Sir : I have been informed that, in pursuance of orders from the Headquarters of the Army, dated at Washington, long previous to the invasion of this Territory by the Texan troops, you contemplate the marching out at an early day all of the regular troops under your command. Therefore I deem it proper to inform you that the property belonging to the United States in my charge, by the inventory taken on the 30th of June ultimo, amounts to more than a quarter of a million of dollars ($271,147.55) at Eastern cost, exclusive of the post store-houses, outworks, &c., and embraces all the fixtures for a new arsenal for the Territory of an expensive character.
A residence of twelve years among these people enables me to know, and it is the opinion of every well-informed, candid person resident among them, that without the support and protection of the Regular Army of the United States they are entirely unable to protect the public property in the Territory, or the lives of such officers, civil and military, as may be left among them after the withdrawal of the regular forces now under your command, no matter how many there may be or how well armed the New Mexican volunteers are.
A view of the present invasion by the Texan troops on the south, the threatened invasion on the east from Arkansas and Upper Texas, and the almost certain capture of all the posts and public property in the Territory, if left unguarded by the regular troops under your command, induces me to make this representation, with the hope that you will at least delay the movement now contemplated until after the present state of affairs in New Mexico is made known to the authorities in Washington, and they shall have been heard from on the subject.
A copy of this communication will be forwarded to the Hon. Secretary of War by the next outgoing mail.

Fort Wise, Colo., August 22,1861. Colonel Canby, Santa Fe, A. Mex. :
Sir : Yours of the 13th # has been received. In reply I have to state that I have been informed of three columns moving up from Texas east of the mountains in the direction of Fort Union. This news came from the Kiowa Indians.
Since then these Indians have been watching these columns, and the last two parties have reported that these columns have concentrated and turned back. This later news I cannot understand, and am waiting for further developments.
I have employed the Kiowas extensively as spies, and I think them faithful, as the Texans are their bitter enemies. I have a good interpreter.
The Kiowas are all here except those that are out on the watch. I do not think the Texans can get within 75 miles without my receiving a report of it. I would be thankful for any further news you may be able to send me with respect to the attempt to take this post.

The colonel commanding accordingly directs that you establish a camp at the most advantageous position in the neighborhood of that pass, for the purpose of watching and guarding that portion of the frontier. Instructions were sent by the express this morning to the staff officers at Albuquerque to make the necessary arrangements for supplying the subsistence and forage required for your command during its halt at that point. The infantry companies of your command will be sent to Albuquerque, where they will be halted until further orders. The instructions are sent direct, because it is apprehended that the instructions to Colonel Roberts may not have reached him in season to communicate to you.

While I do not apprehend any serious trouble in that Territory, there no doubt have been, and probably still are, combinations among lawless individuals having for their object the seizure of military posts or public property that might be left in an unguarded condition with the design of plunder or of embarrassing the operations of the Government. I shall have no hesitation in supplying, so far as I can, the means of arming a sufficient force in Colorado Territory to repress any revolutionary acts that may be attempted there, but there is now in this department only arms enough to supply the volunteer troops that have been authorized for the Territory, and if any greater force should be necessary, there will not be enough to arm them unless new supplies are received. For this reason I respectfully recommend that such supplies as may be considered necessary in Colorado Territory may be sent from the arsenal at Fort Leavenworth.

Colonel : In compliance with your requisition of July 6, two volunteer companies of infantry—Company A, Capt. J. P. Slough, 101, Company B, Capt. Sam. F. Tappan, 101—are organized and ordered to report for muster into the United States service at Fort Garland. In the event of any future call upon this Territory it will be absolutely necessary that an authorized mustering officer be present here at Denver, and that arms and ammunition be supplied here for their complete equipment. Without specifying reasons, these arrangements are an absolute necessity. The election just concluded exhibits an overwhelming popular majority in favor of the administration. It also reveals a strong malignant element essential to be controlled. The dependence exclusively of this industrial population upon supplies imported from the States over a line of communication of 800 miles, liable to be cut oil* by Indians as well as other hostile attacks, makes a complete home organization peremptory for self-defense. Have the kindness to send me for use within your military department 5,000 arms, equipments, and ammunition for infantry, and ordnance and equipments and guns for two batteries of artillery. I make this requisition perfectly understanding the existing condition of affairs both here and in all the surrounding relations, and as dictated by existing necessities, which cannot under any circumstances grow less.

nitioii in your Territory. I have just been advised by a telegraphic dispatch that two additional regiments of volunteers have been ordered for this Territory. In my judgment they cannot be raised here, and it may be necessary to ask your excellency to organize four or six companies in Colorado Territory. The specific orders will be received by the next mail, and I will lose no time in communicating with you after they have been received. If the necessity should arise, your suggestions will be met by sending a mustering officer and the necessary arms to the place of rendezvous. In order to lose as little time as possible, it is suggested that the rendezvous may be established at some intermediate point. There are at present no more arms in the department than are necessary to arm the troops that have been called for within the department. I will send your excellency’s communication to the commanding general of the Western Department, with the recommendation that arms, &c., may be sent to you direct from the Fort Leavenworth Arsenal. Fort Garland is the only post in Colorado Territory that is within the limits of this command, but your excellency may rest assured that I will not hesitate to furnish you this assistance as far as the means under my control will permit. In the mean time, should any emergency arise, the commanding officer at Fort Laramie would probably be able to supply you to a limited extent with both arms and ammunition.

The organization of the volunteer force makes very little progress, as only two companies have been added to it since my last report. In the hope of completing it as soon as possible, Governor Connelly will call out the militia of the Territory, and then force the people to do what they seem indisposed to do voluntarily.

of infantry and cavalry, is three years, but upon the representation that cavalry could not be obtained for that term of service, I have authorized the mounted companies to be blustered in for the period of six months. Of this force the regimental organization of the First (Col. St. Vrain’s) Begiment of Infantry is completed, but the companies are not yet full. It will require at least 200 men to bring this regiment up to its maximum organization. In the Second (Colonel Pino’s) Begiment only eight companies have been mustered in, and it will require at least 400 men to complete the organization of this regiment. The organization of the cavalry regiments has just commenced, and only one company has been mustered in. Four other companies are reported to be nearly ready, but it will require at least 1,000 men to complete the two regiments, or 1,200 if they are raised to the maximum. In addition to the above force, independent companies of mounted volunteers are called for, but only three have been organized. It is intended to incorporate these companies with the cavalry regiments if the men consent to that extension of their term of service. If they do not, they will be disbanded at the expiration of the present term.
To recapitulate, there will be required for the infantry regiments 600 men and for the cavalry regiments 1,000 men : total, 1,600. The necessary expenditure incurred by the Territory in the organization of these regiments will be defrayed by the Government of the United States, and, as the appropriation for this purpose has already been made, there will be but little delay in securing the reimbursements.

Sir: I liave just received a communication from the commanding officer at Fort Wise, in which it is stated that he has been advised by you that u there is no volunteer force available to relieve your (his) command or enable it to retire from Fort Wise.” The inability of your excellency to supply this force is a very great disappointment, as the regular troops at that post and at Fort Garland were relied upon as a • part of the force intended for active operations at the South. I am sorry that this determination was not communicated at an earlier period, in order that I might (more seasonably than I now can) have made arrangements to replace the troops at Fort Wise from some other quarter.

Sir : Your report of the 4th instant, communicating the decision of Governor Gilpin, of Colorado Territory, not to furnish volunteer troops for Fort Wise, has been received. You are authorized to raise four companies (two of infantry and two of cavalry) from Colorado Territory, to be mustered into the service of the United States for three years. This force is designed for service at Fort Wise, on the route from the Missouri frontier, or in New Mexico, as the exigencies of the service may require. You will please make requisitions upon the Adjutant-General of the Army for the funds necessary to defray the expenses of collecting and organizing these volunteers. If funds are needed immediately, a special estimate will be made upon this office. The names of the persons that may be authorized to raise these companies will be reported to this office. Such blanks as can be furnished will be sent you by this or by the succeeding mail. A large amount of public and private property is now on the road to this country, and you are desired to keep yourself advised of the movements of the trains, and to take such measures for their protection as may be necessary.

enough to give you timely notice of any approach from that quarter. These jiarties should be out continually, and so arranged as to leave no interruption of watchfulness. Whenever necessary, you will call upon Major Paul for any additional mounted force that you may need in addition to that belonging to your own command. Require Major Baca to make constant reports at least tri-weekly, using some of his mounted men for that purpose.

Denver, October 26, 1861. Col. E. R. S. Canby, Commanding Department of New Mexico:
Colonel : Accept my thanks for dispatches by express messenger (from Fort Garland), bearing date of the 7th and 11th instant.
I am greatly in your debt for a supply of blanks and books; an attention especially apropos at a point so utterly destitute of such essentials to public business. I will respond promptly to the request of Governor Connelly and yourself for medical men who can be found here.
I have further received notice from Capt. Elmer Otis, Fort Wise, of the arrival there of arms for four companies of volunteers. The strong and malignant element within this Territory, added to the destitution of arms and ammunition of any kind up to this time, has rendered absolutely necessary the delay to furnish a garrison for Fort Wise. The population of the Arkansas River is not numerous enough to furnish one company, and to send them from the mining region has been impossible, from want of arms, ammunition, food, clothing, transportation, or money to procure any of these essentials. I am incessantly occupied to comply with your requisitions at the earliest moment.
The malignant secession element of this Territory has numbered
7.500.	It has been ably and secretly organized from November last, and requires extreme and extraordinary measures to meet and control its onslaught. The core of its strength has at present withdrawn to gather strength from Texas, Utah, Arkansas, and from the country of the Confederated Cherokee, Creek, and other Indians. They contemplate to return with overwhelming strength and precipitate the neighboring Indians upon us. To prepare for what may be accomplished by them is my duty. This country, everywhere open to the east, can only be defended by a sufficient force to meet the enemy in the held. It also enters into "their plans to capture Forts Wise and Garland; to surround New Mexico and invade it from the north. The Indian populations west of Arkansas have united with the rebel war to the amount of
64.500,	capable of furnishing an efficient army for operations upon these Territories, familiar with this country, and allied to the Georgians, who sympathize with secession, and form a large proportion of our mining population.
You will learn that a guerrilla party has been captured by Captain Otis near Fort Wise; the captain of this band, McKee, has been in jail for several weeks in this city.
Be well assured that I neglect no resource within my reach or attainable by energy to provide for the safety of this Territory, and produce a force capable of co-operating cordially in the ox>erations in New Mexico, with which I am familiar.
Very respectfully,
WILLIAM GILPIN.

Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters Western Department, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Sir: I have the honor to report that there has been no material change in the state of affairs in this department since my report of the 20tli instant. Twelve companies of regulars (six of infantry and six of cavalry) and eleven of volunteers (seven of infantry and four of cavalry) are now concentrated at Fort Craig. With some difficulty, and by uniting two cavalry companies, a harnessed battery of four pieces (two G-pouiider guns and two 12-pounder held howitzers) has been organized, and will march for Fort Craig on the 30th instant. These preparations have been greatly delayed and embarrassed by the want of supplies and the difficulty of procuring such as could be found in the country from the want of funds. The trains en route for this country are again threatened by marauding parties from Colorado Territory, and the presence of an experienced officer at Fort Wise is so important in this connection, that I have instructed Captain Otis to remain at that post with the cavalry portion of his command until affairs in that quarter are in a more settled condition. No volunteers have yet been furnished from Colorado Territory for either Forts Garland or Wise, and very little progress is now being made in organizing volunteers in this Territory.
Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

Colonel Nineteenth Infantry, Comdg. Department.
Headquarters Department of New Mexico,

Capt. E. Otis, Fourth Cavalry, Comdg. Fort Wise, Colo.:
Sir: Your communication of the 17th instant has been received, and I am instructed by the colonel commanding to say that your action in suspending the removal of Company C, Tenth Infantry, is approved. Upon the arrival of a sufficient volunteer force to render your position perfectly secure, he desires that this company may then be sent to Fort Union. It is not his intention to give any orders in relation to your command, except such as may be necessary and incident to its position in keeping open the communication with the Missouri frontier or in carrying out the instructions of the commander of the Western Department, but will give any orders or assume any responsibility in relation to your post that you may consider necessary. Fort Wise is so important (both as regards our Indian relations and our communications with the East) that it would be unwise to hazard these interests by withdrawing you from that post, and it is his intention that your own, and probably both the cavalry companies, shall remain (even if a volunteer force is furnished by Governor Gilpin) until affairs in that quarter are in a settled condition.

Headquarters Department of New Mexico,
Santa Fe, N. Ate., November 18, 1861. Paymaster-General IT. S. Army, Washington, JO. <7.:
Sir : The military operations in this department have for several months past been greatly embarrassed, and are now almost entirely paralyzed, by the want of funds in the pay department. Many of the regular troops have not been paid for more than twelve months, and the volunteers not at all. This has occasioned a great deal of suffering and some dissatisfaction in both classes, and lias almost effectually put an end to the raising of volunteers. This condition of affairs, so far as it then existed, was officially reported by me some months since (June 13,1861), and has since repeatedly, by reports and estimates, been brought to the notice of the proper authorities.
An unsuccessful attempt was made sometime since to borrow money for the Government, and a recent attempt has been made, which promises to be partially successful $ but to insure this success, the chief quartermaster and chief commissary have united with me in promising that this money shall be repaid in Treasury notes, bearing 7.3 per cent, interest from the date of the loan 5 or, failing in this arrangement, I have personally pledged myself for the interest.
1 have the honor to request that arrangements may be made by your department to redeem this promise. I11 making this arrangement many of the leading merchants and captalists of the Territory have pledge.d their credit for the repayment of the loan.
This arrangement has been made mainly through the instrumentality of the chief quartermaster, Major Donaldson, and but for the confidence reposed in him by the community generally it could not have been made. In addition to this, $60,000 have been loaned by the quartermaster to the pay department.

Santa Fe, N. Mex.:
Sir : I have the honor to state, for the information of your excellency, that arrangements are now being made to separate the Navajoes who are known to be friendly and to have acted in good faith from the remainder of that nation, and to establish them in communities where they can be isolated and protected from the consequences of war made upon the rest of the nation. Care will be taken in the selection of these, and in posting troops in their neighborhood, that these communities shall not leave places of refuge for the ladrones. As soon as practicable, troops will be established at the points that are best calculated to watch the approaches from the Navajo country and protect the inhabitants of New Mexico from the depredations of these Indians. By these arrangements and the active vigilance of the troops, it is believed that the persons and property of the inhabitants can be rendered secure until the necessary dispositions can be made for the effectual punishment of this and other Indian tribes now at war with the people of New Mexico.

﻿76	OPERATIONS IN TEX., N. MEX., AND ARIZ. \Cuav. XI.
As pertinent to this subject, I have also the honor to call your attention to some facts connected with the Indian affairs in this country. While the difficulties with the Nava joes have existed with varying phases almost since the original settlement of New Mexico, there is no doubt that some of the most recent, if they have not been caused by, have at least been greatly aggravated by, the unauthorized and illegal acts of a portion of the Mexican population. It is known that the consequences of these acts have almost invariably fallen upon the well disposed Navajoes and upon the better classes of the Mexican people— those who had stock or other property to be stolen or farms which could not be cultivated in security—while the authors of these acts have profited by the division of their plunder and the sale of their captives. These acts and these principles do not apply to the Navajoes alone, but to all the tribes of Indians by which New Mexico is surrounded, and it is scarcely necessary to say that, if permitted, they can lead to but one result, that of converting all the Indians of New Mexico into robbers, and leading to a contest that will be as interminable as the Maroon war of the West Indies.
The policy of the Government towards the Indians is fully indicated by its laws and by the instructions to the officers of the Indian and War Departments, and it has a right to expect that all good citizens will aid in enforcing its laws and sustaining its policy. The duty of protection involves a reciprocal obligation upon the part of the people of New Mexico, and unless the illegal acts of a few vicious individuals are denounced by the moral sense of the community and enforcement of the laws aided by all, the best efforts that can be made to control the Indians and protect the inhabitants will be utterly fruitless. I will use all the means that I may be able to control to protect the inhabitants of New Mexico from depredations and secure them in the quiet possession of their property, and I ask the co-operation of your excellency and the people of New Mexico in sustaining the laws and regulations of the Government in relation to the Indians.
This policy, in my judgment, is not only the wisest, but the only one that can possibly be adopted without leading to interminable evils.

Headquarters Department op New Mexico,
Santa Fe, N. Mex^ December 1, 1861. Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters Western Department, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Sir : I have the honor to report that onr relations with the Indians in this department are daily becoming more unsatisfactory. The depredations of the Navajoes are constant. The Mescalero Apaches are becoming more daring in their inroads, and incursions have been made by the Kiowas and Oomanches, ostensibly in jmrsuit of the Utes, but their depredations have not been confined to them. Between the Navajoes and people of New Mexico a state of hostilities, with occasional intervals of peace, has existed almost since the first settlement of the country. Each party claims that the treaty of peace has been broken by the other, and it is impossible now, even if it were profitable, to inquire which is in the right. Each successive war has reduced the Navajoes in strength and wealth, and has, by reducing them to poverty, added to the strength of the ladrones, or war party. There is no doubt that many of these difficulties, if not caused, have at least been greatly aggravated, by the illegal acts of a portion of the Mexican people, and in some cases have been the direct cause of the difficulties that immediately followed them. The consequences of these acts have almost invariably fallen upon that portion of the Navajoes known as the peace party and upon those of the inhabitants who have property to lose, while the aggressors profit by the sale of their booty and captives. These acts are not restrained by the moral sense of the community, and so long as these marauders find a ready sale tor their plunder and for their captives, it will be impossible to prevent these depredations and the consequent retaliations by the Indians.
These remarks apply more particularly to the Navajoes, but they are pertinent to our relations with all the surrounding Indians; and unless measures can be adopted by which this system, encouraged by the sympathies of the people and fostered to some extent by the Territorial laws, can be broken up, the country will be involved in interminable evils. Recent occurrences in the Navajo country (see report of Captain Evans, inclosed herewith)* have so demoralized and broken up that nation, that there is now no choice between their absolute extermination or their removal and colonization at points so remote from the settlements as to isolate them entirely from the inhabitants of the Territory.
Aside from all considerations of humanity, the extermination of such a people will be a work of the greatest difficulty. The country they inhabit is impracticable and destitute of resources for military operations to a degree that can only be realized from personal observation. The Navajoes are too cowardly to fight in number, but are adroit robbers, and any operations that may be carried on against them will ultimately resolve itself into a chase of individual thieves, and will be procrastinated indefinitely. As a question of economy and expediency, I have determined, in concert with the superintendent of Indian affairs for this Territory, to establish such of the Navajoes as have heretofore acted in good faith in communities, where they can be isolated and protected until some permanent arrangement can be made by the Government. The policy of settling them on reserves, removed from the Mexican population, protecting and assisting them until they are able to sustain themselves as heretofore—repeatedly recommended by the superintendent of Indian affairs and the commanders of this depart-

ment—is, in my judgment, the only policy that gives any assurance of success. It is recommended by considerations of humanity, economy, and experience. The same considerations, with equal pertinency, apply to all the surrounding tribes ; but as the Navajoes, Apaches, and IJtes are more immediately in contact with the settlements, the policy recommended should be applied to these Indians first. These measures are of such immediate and vital importance to the Territory and to the interests of the General Government in this country, that I have the honor to request that the major-general commanding will submit it, at his earliest convenience, to the consideration of the General-in-Chief and Secretary of War.

ED. R. S. CANBY,
Colonel Nineteenth Infantry, Commanding.
Headquarters Department of Hew Mexico,
Santa Fe, N. Mex., December 8, 1861.
Adjutant-General,
Headquarters Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your instructions of November 9, and to report as follows :
First. The number of regular troops is shown by the inclosed abstract A;* the number of volunteers that have already been received by the abstract B; * the number and position of all the troops in the department by the field return C.*
Second. The regular troops are in excellent condition. They are well instructed and disciplined, zealous and loyal, and, except the want of officers and recruits to fill the companies, there are no defects of condition. The volunteer troops are improving slowly in discipline and instruction. They are not efficient, and, in my judgment, cannot be made so in any reasonable period. They are deficient in self-reliance and military spirit, and their ignorance of the English language and want of capacity for instruction are serious obstacles to a rapid improvement. For Indian or partisan warfare, and in conjunction with regular troops or volunteers of American origin, they wili make valuable auxiliaries, and their services in these respects are already of considerable importance.
Third. The regular troops have the most improved arms—the infantry the Springfield rifled musket, .08 caliber, and the cavalry the Harper’s Ferry rifle, Colt’s pistol (Navy), Sharp’s and Maynard’s carbines, and a few of Colt’s revolving rifles for experiment. The exact number of arms in the hands of the troops cannot be stated until the ordnance returns are received, but it is slightly in excess of the number of the troops. The volunteers have arms of older models—the rifled musket, .69 caliber) Harper’s Ferry rifle, calibers .54 and .58 5 the cavalry mus-ketoon, the carbine pistol, and a few companies the smooth-bore musket, .69 caliber. These arms are all in serviceable condition, but the troops are imperfectly equipped, as there is a*great deficiency of all classes of accouterments. The clothing of the regular troops is good, and there is a sufficient quantity for all their probable wants until the right period of receiving supplies. Clothing for two of the volunteer regiments has been received and distributed. It is reported to be in-

ferior in quality. For the two other regiments it is supposed to be in trains that are now near Fort Union.
The supplies in the quartermaster’s department are in good condition and, if those that are now on the road are received, will be sufficient to meet the wants of the service until new supplies can be sent out in the spring. It will be necessary, however, to receive a portion of these supplies earlier than usual, and estimates for them will be prepared and forwarded in season. There have be'en unavoidable deficiencies in the means of transportation and in camp and garrison equipage, but the first of them has been removed by the purchase of animals that have just reached the Territory, and the others will be by the arrival of trains that are expected daily. The supplies in the subsistence department are in good condition, and sufficient to last the force now in the department, and contemplated by the instructions of the Secretary of War, until June 30, 1862. Should any deficiencies be anticipated, they will be provided for by seasonable estimates. The inclosed statement (E) * shows the quantity in rations on hand at the posts and depots in the department on the loth of last month. Contracts have been made for corresponding quantities of the articles that are produced in this country. The supplies of ordnance stores are very deficient. The annual supply for this department was stopped at Fort Leavenworth. This fact was not known here until August 21, and on the 22d ultimo, in reply to a renewed application, information was received that it was impossible to send at present the ordnance stores called for. The deficiency of ammunition is being supplied, as far as practicable, from the materials that can be procured in this country.. The inclosed statement (F)# will exhibit the number of arms and the quantity of ammunition in depot.
The Confederate force in the Mesilla Talley is about 800 men of their regular troops and from 200 to 400 men organized from the floating population of the Mesilla. These troops are well armed and cavalry well mounted, but they are indifferently clothed and subsisted. They have fifteen pieces of artillery, of which two are said to be heavy—probably 18-pounders—four mountain howitzers, and the remainder field pieces, G-pounder guns, and 12-pounder howitzers. They have fallen back from their advanced position at Bobledo, and are now at or near Mesilla. The resources of the country for supplying an army are limited almost exclusively to articles of forage and subsistence. Of the first, the supply in ordinary seasons may be equal to the support of 5,000 animals, in addition to those of the country.
The horses and mules of the Territory are generally too light for cavalry or draught, and those purchased here for the use of the Army are generally brought from the East. Of subsistence, the articles that can be procured here are beef, flour, beans, and an inferior quality of salt. The cost of the first will be greater than if the cattle are purchased in the Western States and driven out. The quantity of flour that can be procured will not exceed three or three and a half millions of pounds in ordinary seasons. All the beans and salt that maybe needed can be procured.
Very great embarrassments have frequently been experienced in this department from the want of coin to meet the necessities of disbursing officers, and to obviate this difficulty. I have heretofore suggested that arrangements be made to send it out at frequent intervals and in small amounts by the express companies, instead of, as heretofore, but once

in each year, and in larger amounts. In this last case it falls into the hands of the Mexican capitalists and is exported.
In addition to what has been stated in relation to the volunteers, it is proper to say that it will be very difficult, if not impracticable, to raise the entire force authorized for this department, and I do not think it desirable that it should be done. If it is practicable, send one or two regiments of volunteers from the East to replace the regular troops when they are withdrawn. The New Mexican volunteers, without the support of regular troops or of volunteers drawn from some other section of the country, cannot be relied on to resist an invasion of the country, if one is attempted.

Sir : I have the honor to report that there has been no change in the position and number of the Confederate troops in the Mesilla Valley. The information from that quarter is as late as the 7th instant. No material changes within the department have taken place since my last report. The attitude assumed by the Indians on the Arkansas has .rendered it necessary to detach a mounted force (80 men) from Fort Union for the protection of the trains on the road to this country. The best instructed of the volunteer troops are being put in position as fast as they can be replaced by raw troops, to support the movement upon the Mesilla Valley, which I hope soon to be able to make. I shall leave in a few days for the southern part of the Territory, for the purpose of seeing that the preparations for this object are as complete and perfect as possible.
Our operations are still greatly embarrassed by the want of transportation. The arrival of mules from the East in a few days will probably enable us to overcome this difficulty.
The contractors for supplying horses for the regular and volunteer cavalry have failed entirely, in consequence of the disturbed condition of affairs on the Western frontier. New contracts have been made, and it is hoped that the contractors will prove more successful.
Detailed estimates for supplies in the different staff departments are now being prepared and will be forwarded in a few days.

Mesilla had been re-enforced by 1,400 men and that 2,000 were moving up the Pecos for the purpose of attacking the central and northern parts of New Mexico. The first part of this information is no doubt mainly true, but the second I think doubtful, and circulated by the Texans for the purpose of dividing the force at this point. It it should be true it will involve some change in projected operations, and to provide for this contingency I have directed the re-enforcement of Port Union and Santa Fe and the concentration of a large force at Albuquerque.
If the invasion of the country by the Pecos should be attempted this post will be strongly garrisoned, and I will move with the main body to the Abo Pass (in the direction of the Pecos), concentrating as I move all the available force from the upper country. Although this reported re-enforcement is larger than 1 anticipated, my greatest anxiety is with regard to Fort W ise and our communications with the East.
Governor Gilpin has repeatedly been urged to strengthen this post with Colorado volunteers, but it has not yet been done, and I have twice during the past season been obliged to make detachments to re-enforce it at times when the troops could very illy be spared.

ports in relation to the Texan forces are apparently better founded than the previous reports have been. There appears to be but little doubt that a considerable force (estimated at 1,200 men, with seven pieces of artillery) is now on the march to this place. Whether any are approaching by the Pecos is uncertain, but probable. I think it advisable that all the militia should be held in readiness to turn out when called upon, and that all the arms and ammunition should be collected and held for the use of the troops; that the citizens should be instructed through the proper officers to watch the roads and trails, to prevent the entrance of scouts, spies, or small parties who will enter the country for the purpose of cutting off our couriers, plundering trains, &c. They would be useful also in procuring information, preventing the passage of spies, &c., blocking up the roads if the Texans attempt to penetrate the country, &c. A portion of the militia should be held in readiness to re-enforce Santa Fe and another Fort Union. There are a considerable number of Territorial arms below Albuquerque, which should be collected and sent to that place to arm the militia. If powder and lead are taken from the merchants, it should be receipted for, and will be paid for by the Government if it should be used.
I will keep you continually advised of any important movement in this quarter.

The necessity for this force, and particularly for a strong garrison at Fort Wise, is undoubted, and the prompt action of your excellency will be of material assistance in defending this Territory.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

Major : The Texan force that entered Alamosa yesterday morning was about 500 men, with two pieces of artillery. The object appears to have been the surprise of the outposts at that point. Information of the movement had been received from the Mesilla, and the immediate advance of the Texans was discovered by the advance pickets in season to permit the companies to retire without molestation and without loss of any kind. Failing in their object, the Texans retired rapidly by the

same road. As soon as satisfied that this movement is not a feint, I shall move (probably this evening or to-morrow) with four companies of infantry, four of cavalry (regulars), and five of volunteers, for the purpose of opposing the reported movement up the Pecos, governing myself in the direction to be taken by information received on the road from the parties now in that direction.
I have conclusive information that this movement was intended when the Texan troops left Sail Antonio, and that a co-operating movement up the Canadian was projected, but there is now reason to believe that the Texans failed to raise so large a force as was expected, and that the expedition may be suspended for a time. In this case I will establish a reserve camp at or near Las Lunas or Peralta, with sufficient force to act upon either of the lines by which an invasion may be attempted.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
ED. R. S. CANBY,
Colonel Nineteenth Infantry, Commanding Department.
Headquarters Department of New Mexico,
Camp Connelly, A. Mex., January 7, 1862. Col. G. R. Paul, Fort Union, N. Mex.;
Sir : The field battery, the regular cavalry (except two companies of the First), and the companies of the Fifth Infantry, have been moved up from Fort Craig. Four companies of volunteers have also been brought up for the purpose of keeping open the communication between this place and Fort Craig, and convoying any supply trains that it may be necessary to send to that point.
The regular force (500 men) will be established at some convenient point within supporting distance of any point that may be threatened. It will serve as the nucleus for the concentration of the regulars and volunteers to be drawn from points that are not immediately endangered, and will enable us to organize in a very short time a very considerable and effective force to repel any invasion that may be attempted.
The garrison at Fort Craig consists of seventeen companies, of which six are regulars and nine volunteers, having a reasonable degree of instruction and discipline; a sufficient force in my judgment to hold the post against any force that can be brought against it.
It is believed that the Confederates cannot invade the country with more than 2,000 men in one body. If the invasion be by the Pecos, Fort Craig can sustain itself untii that invasion is disposed of. If the demonstration is against Fort Craig, all the available force in the department can at once be turned in that direction. It is not my purpose to employ the militia in the field, but to use them in replacing the regulars and volunteers that may be drawn from posts that are not immediately threatened.
In carrying out these arrangements, the available forces at Fort Union, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Camp Connelly will be held in constant readiness to move in any direction that may become necessary. Transportation for the movement of the troops and at least ten days7 supplies will be held in reserve, and arrangements will be made for calling into the service any additional militia force that may be needed to replace the troops that may be withdrawn.
The governor of the Territory has been requested to hold the militia in readiness for any service that may be required of them, and will furnish any force that may be required by the commanders of forts or districts.

Headquarters Department of New Mexico,
Belen, N. Mex., January 11, 1862. The Adjutant-General of the Army, Washington, D. C. :
Sir : I have the honor to report that I left Fort Craig on the 6th instant, with a light battery, three companies of cavalry, three of infantry (regulars), and four of infantry volunteers, and have established a reserve camp at this place with the regular troops, the volunteers having been sent back to Fort Craig to escort trains on the road to that place.
The valley of the Rio Grande can be reached from the Pecos by the Abo, Manzano, and Galisteo Passes. This point is above the Abo Pass, and is centrally and conveniently situated for the concentration of troops to meet an enemy approaching from the Pecos by either of the above routes, or if the main demonstration should be against Fort Craig, with the entire force in that direction.
All the different approaches to the country are closely watched by scouts and spies, and I have no apprehension of the approach of the enemy without receiving several days’ notice. The available force in this part of the department, about 1,500 men, can be concentrated at this place in about twenty-four hours.
I have left at Fort Craig nineteen companies—1,400 men—of which six are regulars, ten volunteers of several months’ instruction and discipline, one of spies and guides, and two militia. In addition to these, Colonel Roberts has subject to his call six companies of volunteers that can join him in twenty-four hours.
The most reliable accounts from the Mesilla give 2,100 men as the force of the enemy in that quarter. Our scouts on the Pecos report no force on that river within 200 miles of this place. Two regiments that left San Antonio, Tex., on the 9th and 16th of November for New Mexico not accounted for among the troops that have reached the Mesilla. This fact, more than any other, gives probability to the reported invasion by the Pecos.

Whether this report he true or not, the effect of this circulation through the country at this time will be exceedingly unfortunate, and it is greatly to be apprehended that the volunteer forces already organized will melt away by desertion, and the people of NTew Mexico will be rendered still more apathetic than they now are, even it the disaffected of both classes are not stimulated into active opposition to the Government.
The Mexican people have no affection for the institutions of the United States; they have a strong, but hitherto restrained, hatred for the Americans as a race, and there are not wanting persons who, from the commencement of their troubles, have secretly but industriously endeavored to keep alive all the elements of discontent and fan them into flames. The long-deferred payment of the volunteers has given so much plausibility and coloring to their representation as to have produced a marked and pernicious influence upon these ignorant and impulsive people.
Without crediting these reports, 1 think it proper to state that, unless measures are taken at an early period to remove these causes of dissatisfaction, the consequences will be in the highest degree injurious to the interests of the Government.

Col. G. E. Paul, Fort Union, N. Mex. :
Colonel: Your note of the 12th was received yesterday. The question you ask presents some difficulty, wffiich I cannot decide at present. I had determined some time ago that, in consequence of the scarcity of officers in the department, I should not consent that any officers of the Army should be taken from their appropriate duties to accept any appointments in the volunteers, and in refusing the action taken in Colonel Eoberts’ case and your own, I urge as a reason for refusing it that, although it would add to your duties, it wrould remove you from those that you were then exercising. The reason cannot be urged in reference to any other officer at present.
Besides this, the prejudice of the Mexican population towards the Americans is so great that if the field officers are taken altogether from the latter class, it is to be apprehended that it will delay, if it does not defeat, the organization of these regiments.
This is not, perhaps, a good military reason, but it is a necessity, from the character of the people we have to deal with.
I have also instructed two or three of the most efficient volunteer officers now in the service that, if they would induce the men of their regiments to enter the service for three years, I would recommend them for commissions as field officers. Colonel Gallegos and Lieutenant-Colonel Yaldez are among them, and until I can learn what these men are going to do, I could give no definite answer to your question, even if there were no other obstacles tc a favorable answer.
Yery respectfully, &c.,

Sir : The colonel commanding the department has learned through Captain Archer that there has been a serious revolt in two of the companies of your regiment, the men engaged in it alleging that they have not been paid and clothed as they were promised. Without stopping to inquire into the correctness of these complaints, he instructs me to say that all such mutinous conduct or tendencies must at once be suppressed by the most energetic measures, and all who have participated in the proceeding, either directly or indirectly, reduced to the most absolute subordination to law and discipline. In doing this, you should make such an exhibition of force as will prevent any attempt to resist, but if resistance is offered, force must be used to the extent that may be necessary in order to overcome resistance and compel absolute submission. Until this is accomplished, no concession or compromise can for a moment be entertained.
The colonel commanding cannot believe that so serious a revolt as this is represented to be would have been undertaken if it had not been prompted and encouraged by designing and traitorous persons opposed to the Government of the United States, but too cowardly to undertake the risk of doing in person what they have prompted others to do, and he desires that you will rigidly investigate this matter, and ascertain, if possible, who have been the ringleaders of the revolt.
Should you need any additional force to enable you to carry out your instructions fully, you will at once report by special express.

telegraphic rapidity, and the first result was a revolt in one of the companies of volunteers (militia) at Fort Union, and in two companies of the Second Regiment Volunteers at Camp Connelly, posts 200 miles distant, but occurring within very short periods of each other, and from the same alleged cause—the failing to pay and clothe them as they had been promised.
The first of these was suppressed by the prompt and energetic action and the excitement allayed by the prudent and judicious conduct of Colonel Paul. The second was not so easily managed, and about 30 of the mutineers made their escape and fled to the mountains. Measures were immediately taken to pursue and apprehend this party, and I do not think they can escape.

His Excellency H. Connelly,
Governor of New Mexico, Santa Fe, N. Mex.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 12th instant# in relation to the protection of the inhabitants of the Territory against Indian depredations.
In answering this communication it is proper to state the actual circumstances of the country as regards the threatened invasion, the Indian depredations, and our means of resisting the first and anticipating the latter.
It is known from authentic sources that three regiments were organized at and have marched from San Antonio, Tex., for the invasion of this country, and it is understood that a fourth regiment, having the same destination, was organized at Austin. Two of these regiments (Reily’s and Steele’s) have reached Arizona. The other two (Green’s and the regiment from Austin) are not yet accounted for, and are said to be coming by the way of the Pecos. This may be considered doubtful, but the adjutant-general of Texas in his official report states the force in Arizona and Few Mexico at 4,000 men, and it is safe to assume that it approximates to that number.
The Indians are numerous, but less formidable from their numbers than from their subdivisions into small jwties and the impracticable character of their country.
The plan and scope of the Texan operations admits of the concentration of their entire force in one body, and permits them to assail the Territory with the great bulk of their force at any one of several points. Our own circumstances are widely different. We have an extensive country to defend and long lines of communication to protect, and it is barely possible to keep in hand a force that will not be inferior to that which the enemy is able to send into the country. It would be exceedingly unwise, in my judgment, so to disseminate our forces that they could not be concentrated in season to meet invasion at any point that may be attempted.
I appreciate fully the situation of the inhabitants of the country, and will do whatever I can to relieve them from tbe depredations from which they are now suffering. As soon as advised of the force that you can

raise and of the points at which it can he assembled, I will detach as large an additional force as will be prudent under existing circumstances, and will make the necessary preparations for the projected operations.
I do not think it advisable to leave this section of the country, but, if you can leave Santa Fe, will be happy to meet you at Albuquerque, to consult with you in relation to this matter.
I cannot undertake to arm or clothe this additional force, to supply it with transportation, or forage, or provision it fully. Ammunition to a limited extent, transportation to the depots that may be established, and for subsistence, beef, flour, coffee, and sugar, can be furnished. The troops will be mustered into the service of the United States for the time they are engaged in this service, and will be subject in all respects to the discipline and laws that govern other troops when in the service; and it must be distinctly understood by all who engage in this service that the campaigns against the Indians must be conducted in accordance with the laws of the United States and the policy and instructions of the War Department, and the campaign is to be made for the purpose of punishing the Indians, and not for the sake of plunder or captives.

You know as well as I do that this invasion of the country has been impending for months; that it was arranged by a secretary of state of the Territory; and that it has twice failed in consequence of the pressing necessity of the Confederates in other quarters.
It is a proof of a premeditated plan to induce the removal of the troops to the South in order that this movement may he more effective at the North. 1 do not wish any questions to be parried on my account; but I wish it to be said distinctly that I will move when I get ready to move; and that will be when I know that the country behind me is secured from a revolutionary movement.

and movements of the enemy. The writer is reliable, and his information no doubt correct, so far as he had the means of acquiring it.
I also inclose a proclamation from the commander of the Confederate forces to the people of New Mexico. This paper is well calculated to exercise at this time a pernicious influence upon the least intelligent of the people. It was no doubt prepared by a former secretary of the Territory, and is part of a plan arranged before he left the country. Several of the packages intercepted are addressed to persons of influence in the Territory, who at the time Mr. Jackson left undoubtedly sympathized with this movement, but do not now.
What influence it will have it is impossible to determine yet; but I have put myself in communication with the most influential persons in the Territory, for the purpose of counteracting its effect.

General Sibley and staff arrived in El Paso about a month ago; staff officers A. M. Jackson, I. Ochiltree, Captain Dwyer, and Judge Crosby, assistant quartermaster and receiver of property to be confiscated in New Mexico. The first and second regiments are now between Robledo and Santa Barbara, and are not fortifying themselves. They have taken only four additional jneces of artillery besides those belonging to Colonel Baylor’s command (two 32-pounders). General Sibley and staff were to leave Mesilla for Fort Thorn on yesterday, the 16th instant.
The second regiment is expected next week. The troops are badly provisioned and armed; have had about 200 horses stolen since they passed here. Their only hope is to march into New Mexico in quick time, or engage in a war with Mexico (El Paso) to procure provisions. They have no money, and their paper is only taken by the merchants, not by the Mexicans. The Mexican population (El Paso, Mexico) are much opposed to them, also at Mesilla and Dona Ana. Irisana and Ambugo goods at Mesilla have been confiscated, and that is the order of the day. S. Hart has done more to aid and assist them than the balance of the capitalists have, and has gone so far as to give a list of the principal capitalists in New Mexico, to confiscate their property, and that is their aim.

Uj)on the peaceful people of New Mexico the Confederate States wage no war. To them we come as friends, to re-establish a governmental connection agreeable and advantageous both to them and to us; to liberate them from the yoke of a military despotism erected by usurpers upon the ruins of the former free institutions of the United States; to relieve them from the iniquitous taxes and exactions imposed upon them by that usurpation; to insure and to revere their religion, and to restore their civil and political liberties.

The existing war is one most wickedly waged by the United States upon the Confederate States for the subjugation and oppression of the latter by force of arms. It has already failed. Victory has crowned the arms of the Confederate States wherever an encounter worthy of being called a battle has been joined. Witness the battles of Bull Bun, of Manassas, of Springfield, of Lexington, of Leesburg, of Columbus, and the capture in the Mesilla Valley of the whole force of the enemy by scarcely half their number.
The army under my command is ample to seize and to maintain possession of New Mexico against any force which the enemy now has or is able to place within its limits. It is my purpose to accomplish this object without injury to the peaceful people of the country. Follow, then, quietly your peaceful avocations, and from my forces you have nothing to fear. Your persons, your families, and your property shall be secure and safe. Such forage and supplies as my army shall require will be purchased in open market and paid for at fair prices. If destroyed or removed to prevent me from availing myself of them, those who so co-operate with our enemies will be treated accordingly, and must prepare to share their fate.
It is well known to me that many among you have already been forced by intimidation or inveigled by fraud into the ranks of our foes. The day will soon arrive when you can safely abjure their service. When it comes, throw down your arms and disperse to your homes, and you are safe. But persist in the service, and you are lost.
When the authority of the Confederate States shall be established in New Mexico, a government of your best men, to be conducted upon principles with which you are familiar and to which you are attached, will be inaugurated. Your religious, civil, and political rights and liberties will be re-established and maintained sacred and intact. In the mean time, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the President and Government of the Confederate States I abrogate and abolish the law of the United States levying taxes upon the people of New Mexico.
To my old comrades in arms, still in the ranks of the usurpers of their Government and liberties, I appeal in the name of former friendship : Drop at once the arms which degrade you into the tools of tyrants, renounce their service, and array yourselves under the colors of justice and freedom! I am empowered to receive you into the service of the Confederate States ; the officers upon their commissions, the men upon their enlistments. By every principle of law and morality you are exonerated from service in the ranks of our enemies. You never engaged in the service of one portion of the old Union to fight against another portion, who, so far from being your enemies, have ever been your best friends. In the sight of God and man, you are justified in renouncing a service iniquitous in itself and in which you never engaged.

First Cavalry Begiment, and a light battery, to move from the southeastern frontier of this State, was immediately approved at headquarters.
The objects of the expedition you are fully aware of—the recapture of all our forts in Arizona and New Mexico, driving the rebel forces out of that country or capturing them, and opening the southern mail route. Every exertion has been and is still being made to provide your command with everything necessary to insure success, and had it not been for the unprecedented continuance of the rain, which made it impossible for the troops or wagons to move, an advance could have been made before this time.
The light artillery battery, Company A, Third Artillery, commanded by First-Lieutenant Shinn, is now at the Presidio, and will be sent to you as soon as the roads are passable. Four companies of the cavalry and seven companies of the Fifth Infantry have already been sent to your district. The remainder of the Fifth will be sent down soon.
I desire that you dispose of these troops in the manner you may deem best calculated to preserve the peace and quiet of the district. When you finally advance, the command of the district of Southern California will be devolved on Colonel Bowie or the senior officer then present.
I do not consider it necessary to be more minute in regard to the object to be accomplished or the mode of effecting it; with the first you are well acquainted, and as far as the second, I take great pleasure in assuring you that I confide everything to your well-known skill, zeal, and gallantry.

Brig. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, Comdg., the., San Antonio, Tex.:
General : Herewith you will receive a requisition for twenty companies of infantry, to be raised within the State of Texas, made by authority of the President of the Confederate States. The recent law of Congress, x>assed at Montgomery, empowers the President to receive into the service of the Confederate States for the war, unless sooner discharged, companies of men from the several States, to be organized by him into battalions, squadrons, or regiments. But this organization will not take place until the arrival of such companies at any point which may be designated by the Executive. It will therefore be understood that the first enrollment will be by companies, the officers of such companies to be elected by the men.
To carry into effect this requisition, you will, when requested by the governor of the State of Texas, order an officer of the Army of the Confederate States to act as mustering officer at such points as may be designated by the governor (not expected to be more than two), by whom the several companies, with their organizations, will be mustered into service. It is the order of the President that the companies coming from Texas shall be fully armed, four of them with rifles, if practicable.

Such as cannot be there supplied will be provided at this place or at such other point- as may be deemed important.
The organization of a company of infantry is, one captain, one first and two second lieutenants, four sergeants, four corporals, two musicians, and not more than 100 nor less than 04 privates.

His Excellency Jefferson Davis, President Confederate States:
Sir: In accordance with your direction I have the honor to submit the following memoir for defense of the coast of Texas :
For the mouth of the Sabine River, two 24-pounders and one company. For Galveston Island, four or five 8-inch columbiads, in addition to their present supply, and, relying upon the volunteers of the city, three companies would suffice. I would, however, recommend five if they could be granted. At the mouth of the Brazos River, one 24-pounder siege carriage and one company. At Pass Cavallo, three 32 pounders and two companies. At Aransas, two 24-pounders and one company.
At Sabine the town amounts to very little, but a railroad runs up the river connecting with the road from Houston to New Orleans. Sabine and Houston are now connected by rail. A battery on Texas Point, at the mouth of the river, would keep off anything that could enter unresisted and resist a boat landing successfully, as, except on the Texas Point, the ground is so soft no landing on the flanks of a battery could be made. A small party once established at Sabine City could break up all the railroad communication from Houston to New Orleans (now not complete, but expected to be soon finished).
At Galveston an enemy could have no object in coming into the harbor as a means of injury to the town. He could lay off* the Gulf beach in gunboats, shell and burn the city, unless kept at a distance by heavy guns, or might use the roadstead inside the bar for a harbor of refuge unless driven away. The number of guns proposed, with what I suppose are already in Galveston, will suffice. I would suggest that a part of the force at Galveston should be mounted.
The Brazos River is 42 miles from Galveston; is connected by canal with Galveston Bay. A large quantity of cotton and sugar is transported by that route. One 24-pounder siege carriage is all I think necessary.
Pass Cavallo, entrance to Matagorda Bay, from whence the principal roads to Austin and San Antonio start, seven to ten feet on the bar. Three 32-pounders, one on Decrow’s Point and two at the light house, will do well.
Aranzas.—The bar has seven to ten feet water. From the mainland a good road to San Antonio and Western Texas via Goliad.
Brazos Santiago, I understand from Major Marshall, is already provided for.

New Orleans, La., July 24, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have been credibly informed by gentlemen just from Galveston that the commander of the blockading ship before that place has demanded that he shall have free communication with the Union men ashore, and if denied he will shell the town. There are no heavy guns at Galveston; consequently it is at the mercy of the enemy. My aide-de-camp, Capt. E. Higgins, late of the U. S. Navy, a most energetic and accomplished officer, volunteers to take to Galveston, via Berwick Bay, one or more 9-inch guns. By placing them in battery on the island he is confident that he can drive the ship off or sink her in twenty-four hours.
I have great confidence in Captain Higgins, and but for the exigency of the case would not consent to his leaving the city. Indeed, I have so high an opinion of his experience and skill, that I would gladly see him placed in charge of the naval defenses of this coast.

Sir: I have the honor to inclose to you a copy of a communication received to-day from the War Department, by the governor of the State, who wishes it to be brought to the knowledge of General Van Dorn.# The call is not explicit as to the nature of the arm required by the President. Considering the slowness of the mails between Texas and Bich-mond, the governor cannot refer the matter to the War Department, and wishes to receive on the subject the opinion of the general, who may have received fuller instructions. Cavalry could be raised at once; it will be more difficult to raise infantry. Will one or two companies of artillery be received %
Do the words 44 These camps will be under the control of this department” mean that the troops are to be supplied and paid by the Confederate States % In view of the condition of our public treasury, the State could not bear such a burden for any length of time.
The Secretary of W7ar leaves to the governor the selection of two camp grounds for the concentration of the companies. His excellency, feeling the necessity of a harmonious action between the civil and military authorities in Texas, and considering that the general is the best judge as to the accessibility of the places and their relative advantages under the strategic point of view, desires to receive his suggestions on the subject.
I have also the honor to inclose to you a copy of Special Orders, No. 18, from this department, relative to the organization of a force under the authority of the State of Texas, to be kept in readiness to meet any emergencies on the frontiers of Missouri and Arkansas. These orders have been communicated to nobody except the officers concerned in the organization. The governor believes that they ought to be kept secret

The governor of the State, taking into consideration the gloomy aspect of affairs in Missouri, the dangers threatening the State of Arkansas and the friendly Indian nations in the territory, being firmly convinced that the integrity of our own territory depends upon the success of Southern arms in Missouri, and apprehending that this success cannot be secured without the assistance of Texas, and in the absence of any legislative enactments making provisions for or even anticipating the actual emergencies, has taken upon himself the responsibility of calling into the active service of the State an adequate force to place Texas in a proper military attitude on her northern frontier: Therefore—
I.	The regiment already raised by Col. W. C. Young, in the seventh and eighth military districts of the State, and stationed in the Indian Territory, is accepted into the service of the State. The sixth military district, composed of the counties of Kaufman, Yan Zandt, Wood, Upshur, Harrison, Henderson, Smith, Busk, and Panola, shall furnish one regiment of mounted troops, to be organized under the superintendence of Col. M. F. Locke, of Upshur, aide-de-camp to the governor. The seventh military district, composed of the counties of Lamar, Bed Biver, Bowie, Hopkins, Titus, Cass, and Marion, shall furnish five companies of mounted troops, under the superintendence of Col. W. C. Batte, of Titus, aide-de-camp to the governor. The eighth military district, composed of the counties of Fannin, Hunt, Grayson, Collin, Dallas, Denton, Tarrant, and Cooke, shall furnish five companies of mounted troops, to be organized under the supervision of Col. W. C. Young, aide-de-camp to the governor. The ninth military district, composed of the counties of Ellis, Hill, Navarro, McLennan, Limestone, Freestone, Bell, Falls, Johnson, and Williamson, shall furnish one regiment of mounted troops, to be organized under the supervision of Col. W. H. Parsons, aide-de-camp to the governor.
II.	The whole force thus organized shall constitute a division, to be known as the First Texas Division.
III.	The division shall be divided into two brigades. The First Brigade, composed of the First Begiment (Colonel Young’s) and the Second Begi-ment, raised in the seventh and eighth military districts; the Second Brigade, composed of the Third Begiment, raised in the sixth military district, and the Fourth Begiment, raised in the ninth military district. The command of the division shall be intrusted by the governor to one of the brigadier-generals, elected as follows:#

and instructions as they may from time to time receive from the adjutant-general of the State.
The governor, in making an appeal to the citizens of the State ho take arms for the protection of our territory and liberties, assures them that every exertion shall be made to secure their comfort, so far as is compatible with the resources of the country. They may have to endure the hardships and privations incident to a campaign in a sparsely-settled country; they will meet them with the patriotic abnegation which has always inspired the Texan soldier. The credit of the State will be pledged for procuring supplies until the necessary appropriations are made. There is not at present one single dollar in the treasury to pay the troops; but the governor will press the subject upon the next legislature, and knows that our chivalric soldiers will bear cheerfully with the delay in remunerating them for their services. They are not hirelings ; they rush to arms for the defense of their families, friends, and liberties.
By order of the governor:
WM. BYRD,
Adj utant- Genera l.
War Department, 0. S. A.,
Richmond, August 1, 1861.
Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch:
Sir: I am directed by the Secretary of War to invite your attention to the following suggestions contained in a letter written to the President by Chief Justice M. H. McWillie, La Mesilla, Ariz., and dated 30th of June, 1861, to wit:
Lincoln lias recently ordered the organization in New Mexico of at least two full regiments of mounted volunteers, chiefly for service in Arizona and on the Texas frontier. One of the officers, as I am informed, is none other than the infamous Salazer, of the Santa Fe prisoners notoriety in 1839. These regiments, under the command of Fred. P. Stanton, of Kansas, are to he in readiness by the 1st of August. There will be about 2,000 United States regulars. As nearly as I can learn, it is intended to concentrate all the regular forces and one regiment of volunteers at Fort Fillmore, 18 miles from the Texas border, early in the same month. As soon as the volunteers are ready the two regiments United States infantry will leave this department for the Stat es. Two regiments of rifles and dragoons will remain. The infantry, before leaving, will concentrate near Santa Fe, then take up the line of march by way of the Independence road to Fort Leavenworth. A convoy with $250,000 recently left the last-named post destined for this depot, to pay olf the troops before they leave.
Now, might it not be well, secretly of course and at an early moment, to fit out an expedition to New Mexico, under command of General McCulloch, by way of the Canadian, before Lincoln’s troops are put in motion for the States ? The stores, supplies, and munitions of war within New Mexico and Arizona are immense, and I am decidedly of opinion that the game is well worth the ammunition. This movement, if undertaken soon enough, would undoubtedly have t he effect to overawe and intimidate the Mexican element, which comprises at least nineteen-twentieths of our entire population.
It is furthermore my impression it is intended to make a descent upon Fort Bliss, in Texas, less than 50 miles distant, garrisoned by 160 infantry, Captain Teel’s company artillery, and two companies Texas cavalry. The expedition, I suggest, would relieve Texas, open communication to the Pacific, and break the line of operations, which, with Lane and Montgomery in Kansas, Stanton in our Territory, Corwine in Mexico, the blockade of our ports and complete possession of our northern frontier is designed to circumvallate the South. One regiment of Cherokees or Choctaws, well mounted, would inspire more wholesome terror in the Mexican population than an army of Americans. Such an expedition would prove a strategic movement of importance to the South.
These interests are communicated for your information.
Respectfully,
A. T. BLEDSOE, Chief of Bureau of War.

San Antonio, Tex., August 10,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I have called upon the governor of Texas for ten companies of infantry, to be stationed at Galveston, for the defense of that island and city, and that I have appointed, subject to the approval of the President, the following field officers: Capt. J. C. Moore, G. S. Army, colonel ; Mr. J. T. Ward, lieutenant-colonel; Maj. X. B. Debray, major. Colonel Moore is now in command of the defenses of Galveston and captain in the Army. Mr. J. T. Ward has been connected with the U. S. Army for six or eight years, and is well qualified for the position I have assigned him. Major Debray will hand you this letter, and you may judge for yourself of his qualifications. ,1 hope you will be pleased to approve of these appointments, as well as of my calling upon the governor for the regiment. I am so isolated from the headquarters of the Army that I am compelled to act a little independent of the usual authorities, and to assume responsibilities not given me by the Regulations of the Army.
I expect in a day or two to receive a reply to my dispatch sent to you by Mr. Sweet, of this city. If I do not, I shall call upon the governor for ten more companies, to be stationed at Port Brown. The troops now there will not muster into the service of the Confederate States for the war, and I will be compelled to replace them by others who will. It is advisable, without doubt, to have at least a regiment there. I respectfully recommend the following gentlemen to the command »as field officers : Col. P. X. Luckett, now quartermaster-general of this State, appointed by the Convention, and a u West Pointer,” as colonel 5 for lieutenant-colonel, A. Buchel, of Indianola, formerly of the army in Mexico; served under General Davis at Buena Vista; as major, E. F. Gray,formerly of the Navy, of Houston. These gentlemen I shall appoint subject to your approval.
It will be gratifying to you to learn of the complete success of Colonel Baylor’s expedition against the U. S. troops in New Mexico; 700 prisoners of war were taken, with their arms, &e. I have not as yet received the official report, but have some of the facts from eye-witnesses of the surrender.
I hear from headquarters but seldom, and am inclined to believe that my letters are intercepted. The governor of the State has received important dispatches from you in regard to the raising of troops for the Confederate service. I have received nothing.
An interchange of several shots between our batteries and the blockading vessels took place at Galveston the other day. One man, a citizen , was killed by a shell from the South Carolina. The vessels were driven off.

Bv command of the Secretary of War:
JXO. WITHEES, Assistant Adjutant-General,
Eichmond, Ya., August 28, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have the honor to report to you that I have been instructed by the governor of Texas, as his aide-de-camp, to proceed to this city for the purpose of conferring with your honor on subjects connected with the military standing and defense of Texas, and which are now respectfully laid before you:
The governor of Texas being convinced that the integrity of the soil of Texas greatly depends upon the success of the Southern cause in Missouri, and moved by an appeal to the people of Arkansas and Texas (published at the beginning of July by General Ben. McCulloch) ordered on the 2oth ultimo the raising and concentration on Eed Eiver of 3,000 mounted men. besides the regiment commanded by Col. W. C. Young, which has been occupying for several months Forts Arbuckle, Cobb, and Washita, under the authority of Texas, and at the request of the Chickasaw Indians. These troops were to have completed their organization into regiments on the 20th instant, the men supplying their own horses and arms, and taking service for twelve months, unless sooner discharged. The success of our arms in Missouri, the friendly feelings of the Territory Indians, except, however, the Cherokees, and also the approach of the winter season, seem to remove any plausible contingency of an immediate attack on the northern frontier of Texas, but it is probable that in fall or winter one or perhaps several simultaneous attacks will be attempted on our coast, which extends over several hundred miles, and is very sparsely inhabited, except the vicinity of Galveston Island. We must therefore prepare to meet any contingency in that quarter, and considering the vast extent of the territory of Texas, the slowness of mail communications, and the want of railroad transportation, these preparations cannot be made too soon.
To meet these exigencies the governor charged me to respectfully request that the force above referred to be accepted into the service of

99
the Confederate States. Texas cannot support them for a longer term than one month. Should the acceptance of their services be declined, it will become necessary to disband them.
The State of Texas raised in March last a force of five companies to take possession of and occupy Fort Brown and Binggold Barracks, on the Bio Grande. The men who compose it enlisted tor six months, and their period of service expires on the 9th of September. They refuse to re-enlist unless they are relieved for more active service from these stations, in which they have labored very hard to restore the old fort and to give a greater extension to its works. If some steps are not taken at once to garrison these two points, that frontier will be unprotected at a time when the probable complication of political affairs in Mexico and the presence of a blockading force render urgent the presence of an efficient force on the Bio Grande.
The governor received on the 29th of July a requisition from your honor, dated June 30, for 2,000 men, to be kept in camps of instruction on two accessible points. The governor communicated with General Van Dorn to ask his opinion as to the location of these camps. The general, having received no orders on the subject from your Department, could give no answer. The governor would wish to know whether these troops are to receive their subsistence from the Confederate States or the State, and whether the camps must be accessible to some particular point or points of defense or merely to subsistence and stores.
General Yan Dorn made a requisition on the governor for ten companies of infantry to garrison Galveston Island. These troops are now raised. Their term of service is for the war, unless sooner discharged. They are now awaiting their organization into a regiment.
In compliance with a communication from your honor, delivered to the governor by an officer of General Sibley's staff*, the raising of his brigade was progressing when I left Texas, and its organization must have been completed by this time. The men are to serve for the war, and to supply their own horses and arms.
Sixteen companies are now on the march from Texas to Virginia. Their first column, composed of five companies, was at NTiblett’s Bluffy La., on the 16th instant. Two other detachments were to follow at two days7 interval each. The twenty companies for which a requisition had been made from your Department were complete, but six of them were carried out of the State by Colonel Greer without the knowledge of the governor, who, so soon as he was apprised of the fact, took steps to supply the deficiency.
In conclusion, I would beg to state that the people of Texas are now fully impressed with the earnestness of the struggle brought upon us, and will answer with alacrity any call from the President of the Confederate States. The imperfection of the militia law of the State has been a source of difficulty for the executive. However, upon his suggestions the people are organizing, and about four hundred militia companies were reported to the adjutant-general's office on the 9th instant, the organization still progressing.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
X. B. DEBBAY,

Sir: Your report on the military standing and defense of Texas, made to this Department under instructions from the governor of that State, has been received and attentively considered. I acknowledge with profound pleasure the zeal of the people and the energies of the government of Texas in behalf of the general cause, and it gratifies me to give assurance to your authorities of the disposition and earnestness of this Department to co-operate with them to the fullest extent within the limits of its powers. Those troops which have been called into service under the requisition of this Department will be paid and subsisted by the Confederate Government. It is desired that they shall be placed in camps of instruction, to be designated by the governor of Texas. Drill officers will be assigned to them, if possible, when this Department comes to be informed that they have been mustered into service. When arms are procured they will be armed and receive marching orders. With regard also to the troops called out by General Yan Dorn, they will be accepted by this Department, and be also paid and subsisted by this Government; but in reference to the troops called out on the mere motion of the governor of Texas, this Department must first be advised concerning the necessity for their services before they can be accepted, and as to this it awaits to hear from the commanding general in the Department of Texas. It will at once occur to you that the Government could not preserve its integrity and assume the responsibility of paying and subsisting the troops that each and every State of the Confederacy might choose to draw into the field. The general commanding in Texas has been instructed not to permit the public welfare to suffer in that State, either upon the borders or in the interior, and the Department has great confidence in his ability, sagacity, and patriotism. It is* hoped this officer and the governor of Texas will freely communicate with each other, and that they co-operate in all measures best calculated to secure peace and safety at every point.

co-operation and assistance, and as a private citizen such uniform kindness and attention, that he would do injustice to himself did he not here, op the eve of his departure from among them, express both his thanks for their kindness and his regret that he has to leave them.
The command, until the arrival of General Hebert, is turned over to Col. Henry E. McCulloch, than whom there is not a more reliable soldier and pure gentleman in the Army of the Confederacy.
Brig. Gen. P. O. Hebert, to whom the command ultimately falls, was the most distinguished graduate of his class at West Point; afterwards an officer in the Engineer Corps {Corps de Genie); then the lieutenant-colonel of a regiment of infantry during the war between the United States and Mexico, and subsequently the governor of the State of Louisiana. He is an able general and a high-toned gentleman. The troops of Texas will find no cause to complain of the change of commanders.
The undersigned further returns his special thanks to the staff officers at these headquarters for their valuable assistance: Maj. Sackfield Maclin, chief quartermaster; Capt. T. A. Washington, assistant adjutant-general ; Capt. J. F. Minter, assistant quartermaster and commissary ; Surgeon Langworthy, and Lieutenant Haskell, ordnance officer. Their energy, skill, and devoted hard labor, in the discharge of their duties in their respective departments, relieved him from painful anxiety, and gave such harmony to the working of the allairs of the department, that there has been no confusion and no deficiency, except where material was wanting and where time and distance were incompatible.
The command of the Department of Texas is here given up by the undersigned to Col. Henry E. McCulloch, and u he bids vou farewell.”

Sir : Immediately upon the receipt of youi; communication of the 7th ultimo, upon the subject of providing clothing for our soldiers, the accompanying addresses were issued to the people of Texas. I have no fear that our people will fail to comply promptly with this call upon their patriotism. Indeed, they had in many places anticipated the views and wishes of Government, and gone to work in the holy cause. The greatest difficulty apprehended is the adoption of a plan of operations which will render our contributions speedily available. I trust the one proposed will prove so.
Allow me to suggest that a large amount of wool can be purchased in Texas for Confederate bonds or notes, which could be converted into cloth at our penitentiary, capable of turning out 1,000 yards per day, and rapidly made into clothing in sections of the country contiguous to the penitentiary. This would, of course, require an agent or agents to purchase the wool and to provide for its manufacture into the articles desired. It would also be expected that the State be saved from loss on account of the appropriation of the time and labor of the penitentiary to the above purpose, unless for the support and success of our cause it becomes necessary for her to perform this service gratuitously.
Any suggestions which you can make to improve or expedite the plan proposed to accomplish the object desired will be gladly received.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[Chap. XI.
Executive Department,
Austin, Tex., August 31,1861.
To the People of Texas:
The war in which we are now engaged will in all probability be prolonged for many months to come, and our soldiers exposed to the rigors of a winter’s campaign, and it becomes the demand of patriotism and of duty that the people should supply them with those things which are essential to their comfort. This can be effected at but little inconvenience and trifling expense to the people, and it will result in very material aid to the Government. Accordingly I wish to advise the formation in every county of a committee or society, whose duty it shall be to solicit and receive from every family in the county a blanket or comfortable. The articles thus contributed will be of little or no inconvenience to the family contributing, yet, when aggregated together, they will afford an immense supply for our sick and wounded soldiers. The committee or society should box up the contributions it may receive, and have them transported to Houston, Marshall, Sherman, Dallas, Austin, or San Antonio, from which points they can be sent forth wherever they may be needed. It is particularly requested that all supplies of this character which can be sent to Houston be forwarded thither without delay, and from that point they can readily be conveyed to our army in Virginia. In those instances where it is impossible to send contributions to either of the points designated, they should be taken in charge by the local committee, and held subject to the order of the governor of Texas.
In addition to these voluntary contributions for the sick and wounded, our soldiers will require clothing; and I further suggest that all articles of heavy clothing which can be made in the different communities be at once put into shape. This clothing will be paid for in the bonds of the Confederate States, and thus its manufacture may become the means of giving occupation to many persons throughout the State who would otherwise be unemployed. Of course the committee or society should also take the management and control of this business into its hands.
I will presume to offer no further suggestions. It is believed that Southern aid societies will be formed in every community, and they will judge best of the immediate means to be employed in accomplishing the end proposed.

To the People of Texas:
The Secretary of War of the Confederate States has requested the State executive to have made up, at an early day, a large quantity of woolen clothing, to supply the wants of the Army, to be charged to the Confederate Government. The medical purveyor has also asked aid from the executive to a plan to procure blankets for the sick and wounded of the Army. He suggests, very wisely, that almost every family, with little or no inconvenience to itself, can contribute a blanket or comfortable to his Department.
Warmly approving these suggestions, the executive issued his address, of the 31st ultimo, inviting the formation in every county in the State of

a society or committee to solicit and receive heavy clothing, blankets, comfortables, and other articles, which will be needed by our Army during the coming winter. The military stores thus furnished will be paid for in the bonds of the Confederate States.
To effectuate this plan depots will be established at central points, under the superintendence of the following agents, viz: At Jefferson, W. P. Sauffley; at Henderson, J. H. Parsons; at Palestine, A. E. Mc-Lure; at Dallas, Dr. Samuel Pryor; at Sherman, W. E. Sanders; at Waco, J. W. Speight; at Austin, W. H. D. Carrington; at San Antonio, Yance & Bro.; at Victoria, William S. Glass; at Houston, E. W. Taylor; at Beaumont, John J. Herring.
They will receive and forward to the proper destination the contributions of the county associations and of the citizens generally, and, whenever necessary, may furnish transportation and incur other expenses growing properly out of the discharge of their duties, on tbe faith and credit of the Confederate States. The State itself will sustain that credit to the utmost limit of its resources. All valid accounts for military stores thus furnished, or otherwise contracted by each agent in the discharge of his duties, will be certified by him to this office, where the same will be examined, approved, and registered. The county societies will forward their contributions to the agents at the most convenient or accessible depots.
Each of the agents at Henderson, Palestine, Dallas, Sherman, Waco, Austin, San Antonio, and Victoria will forward his collections to the most accessible dei>ot, either at Jefferson, Houston, or Beaumont, and directed to the agent at that point. General depots will be established at the latter points, from which the military stores thus accumulated will be transported or distributed, under the directions of the President of the Confederate States. The agents designated for these purposes will also receive contributions from the county associations, private individuals, or any other quarter.
The State executive has received assurances from the managers of the different railroad companies in Texas that u they will transport troops and military stores intended for the defense of the country free of charge.”
To give vigor, efficiency, and life to this plan, the great body of our citizens must lend to it their persevering and active labors. No appeal can be necessary to arouse them to early and efficient action to prevent a frequent recurrence among the brave youth whom w7e have sent from our mild climate to Virginia and Missouri of the horrors of Valley Forge. No time should be lost. Winter will soon be upon them.

[Chap. XL
The following is a recapitulation of the several requisitions made by General Van Dorn upon the governor for coast defense, viz: Ten companies of infantry for Fort Brown, or the Lower Bio Grande; ten companies of infantry for Galveston ; two companies of artillery for Matagorda or San Luis; one company of artillery for Indianola; one company of artillery for Sabine Pass; three companies of artillery for Fort Brown (one of them a light battery): making in all seven companies of artillery. One company of cavalry for the coast between Sabine Pass and Bolivar Point; three companies of cavalry for Galveston Island; one company of cavalry for the coast between Matagorda and Indianola: making in all five companies of cavalry. In addition to the foregoing requisition, General Yan Dorn called upon the governor for an armed regiment of infantry for the vicinity of Victoria. Under this latter requisition I have ordered four armed companies to San Antonio, to be mustered into the service of the Confederate States. In addition to these requisitions the President has called upon the governor for 2,000 men, to be stationed in two camps of instruction. I presume General Yan Dorn intended his requisitions as exclusive and additional to this requisition of the President. We are bending ail our energies to the work of filling these calls. It may perhaps be difficult to organize efficient artillery companies. They may, however, become so from subsequent instruction. The President, in his call, designed two camps of instruction. The governor authorizes me to say that he will, in accordance with your suggestion, designate Victoria as a point for one of the camps. It will, of course, have to be located by one of your officers. Companies will be ordered there immediately to be mustered into the Confederate service.
In his communication of the 22d ultimo, addressed to the governor, General Yan Dorn stated that the troops for Galveston would report to Colonel Moore. Those for the small posts would go to their stations and report to the general, to be mustered into service. Those for Victoria and the Lower Bio Grande were to go to San Antonio. I quote very nearly his own language. It will be impracticable to send ten armed companies to San Antonio for Victoria under General Van Dorn’s requisition. Shall we send the whole ten, including armed and unarmed companies ? It is likely the general designed ten companies, at all events, for Victoria.
I have ordered Captain Beuss, commanding an artillery company at Indianola, and who was recommended by Captain Bucliel, to report to you under the requisition for an artillery company for Indianola. I suppose the general intended to station it at Sabine.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. BYBD,
Adjutant-General.
Executive Department, Austin, Tex., September 14, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va. :
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th ultimo, to the effect that the regiment of cavalry which went from Texas and joined Brigadier-General McCulloch at Fort Smith, about the 30th of July, u were denied arms by the authorities of Texas upon his (McCulloch’s) requisition therefor.”
In reply it will be sufficient to state the following facts :
1st. No requisition was made upon the authorities of Texas for arms for the above-mentioned regiment.

2d. Had such a requisition been made, it were entirely beyond the power of Texas to comply with its demands, from the fact that the State was, and continues to be, destitute of arms, those arms seized by Texas from United States troops having* been transferred to the Government of the Confederate States on or about the 10th of April.
3d. The authorities of Texas did not receive a word of official information in reference to this regiment, either from the Secretary of War, General McCulloch, or from Colonel Greer, commanding the regiment. It was authorized, organized, and removed from the State independent of State authorities, and without their official knowledge.
The only thing approximating a requisition which has been received is a letter from General McCulloch, with the following reference to arms for the troops which he had been appointed to command :
u Two thousand of the arms at San Antonio are ordered to Dallas ; also one battery of artillery.’’
The communication containing this extract was dated April 14, at which time, as you are aware, the arms in Texas had been transferred to the agents of the Confederate States. Dallas is the point in this State where the regiment of Colonel Greer made its rendezvous. Hence the only conclusion was that the agents of the Confederate States had been ordered to send arms thither for the purpose of arming this regiment. The above quotation from General McCulloch’s letter is the only information in respect to this regiment from any one of the authorities interested which has ever reached this department.
From the foregoing facts you will perceive that no blame can attach to the authorities of Texas. They have faithfully endeavored, and will continue their efforts, to meet every requisition which has been or may hereafter be made upon them by the authorities of the Government of the Confederate States.
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. Minter, Assistant Quartermaster, San Antonio, Tex.:
Sir : I have received your letter of August 19 ultimo, reporting a reduction and probable scarcity in the quartermaster’s supplies in Texas. I have not been unmindful of such a contingency, but at the same-time I have not been able to fall upon any plan of resupplying you. The country is nearly bare of every needful article. It only remains for you to do your best in the country and depend in a large measure upon your neighbor, Mexico. Blankets and socks and some sort of a substitute for shoes you can get, and you may have to make clothes of buckskins. It will be of no avail to make requisitions on Hew Orleans. If a supply of clothing, &c., comes in despite the blockade, I will remember your condition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
EDWARD CLARK. *
Headquarters Department of Texas,
San Antonio, Tex., September 20, 1861.
Brig. Gen. P. O. Hebert:
Sir : By request of your aide, Lieutenant Wilson, I make the following report of troops, arms, &c., as I understand them to be, in this department:
General Van Dorn made requisitions on the governor for three regiments of infantry, one each for Galveston, Victoria, and Fort Brown ; also for seven companies of artillery (one to be light), for Fort Brown, Saluria, San Luis, Galveston, and Sabine Pass 5 but I do not understand exactly how he intended to place them all. Also five companies of cavalry, one for Sabine Pass and the coast to Bolivar Point; three for Galveston, and one for the coast west of that place. I have directed the troops intended for Galveston and Sabine Pass to report to Colonel Moore, for muster and orders; those for Victoria to report at that place to Maj. A. M. Haskell, for the same purpose; those for Saluria, to Capt. D. D. Shea, for the same purpose. At Saluria there are, or soon will be, two companies of artillery. The troops for Fort Brown are to be mustered into service here. One company of artillery (Captain Mar-mion) has been mustered, and will be sent on in a few days. Captain Kampmann’s company of infantry was mustered in yesterday (19tli), and will be sent in a few days to Camp Verde, and Captain BuquoPs company, now at that place, sent to Fort Brown. The governor has selected Victoria and Millican as the points for the two camps of instruction for the twenty companies of the reserve army. Major Haskell has been ordered to Victoria to establish that depot, muster in and supply the troops, and command them. Lieutenant Dinkins has been ordered there to assist him. He wants Lieut. J. Sparks (now at Houston on duty) also, but I do not see how I can let him have him, as there is no other officer that I know of that I can send to muster in the troops at Millican. There is no quartermaster or commissary that can be sent to Millican at present to establish that depot and supply the troops ; but Major Maclin, chief quartermaster, &c., Department of Texas, will send an agent there for that purpose. I have designated no officer to command that camp. I know of no one at all suitable, but shall instruct Lieutenant Sparks to put them to drilling, under their captains, until a commander be sent them. Colonel Forshey is in command at San Luis, at the mouth of the Brazos, but I do not know what troops or arms he has there. Several companies are now' waiting at Victoria to be mustered in, so I learn. I have directed that one of the cavalry companies be mustered in at that place. General Sibley’s brigade is filling up rather slowly; twelve or thirteen companies are here and mustered in; others are expected daily. He talks of taking three regiments with him from this point, under instructions from the adjutant-general and an agreement between him and General* Van Dorn. To aid him, this department will be entirely stripped of every tent, all the clothing of every kind, and nearly all other quartermasters7 stores. His transportation will have to be done by contract, or there would be none left in the department. Col. John S. Ford is at Fort Brown, where he has three or four companies of his own regiment (Second Texas Mounted Rifles), and

## p. 108 (#116) ############################################

﻿108	OPERATIONS IN TEX., N. MEX., AND ARIZ. [Chai*. XL
the other six companies are under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor, and scattered from Fort Clark to Fort Bliss, and probably much farther up into Arizona and New Mexico. I regret to say that there is considerable confusion throughout this regiment, and there is nothing in the office here by which I can learn or know where all the companies are or know what they are doing; but I have directed Colonel Ford and Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor to inform me of their localities as early as possible. One company of regular cavalry, under Lieutenant Ingraham, C. S. Army, is at Fort Inge. My own regiment (First Texas Mounted Rifles) is stationed on the north and northwestern frontiers, from Fort McKavett to Red River; but the camp of three companies on Red River will be broken up and the troops removed in a short time to Fort Belknap, as General Pike desires them to be withdrawn from their present proximity to the Indian Territory, and they cannot very well winter where they are. Col. R. R. Garland, late of the Seventh U. S. Infantry, has beep sent to Northern Texas (Dallas), to muster into the service the regiments of Colonels Stone and Johnson. Colonel Stone’s regiment has been, I have no doubt, mustered by this time, and will be gone in a few days to join the troops in Western Missouri. I have heard nothing of Colonel Johnson’s movements, and cannot tell what his prospects are for getting off. Colonel Gregg, of the same section, has called on me for arms, &e. (by order of the Secretary of War), for his regiment, and, as they are not on hand, I of course could not comply with the order. Captain Mechling’s company of light artillery has been ordered to Galveston, and is only waiting the completion of his caissons, which will be ready in two or three weeks. There is not more than enough (if enough) small-arms in the depot here to arm one regiment. There are some arms at Harrisburg, left there by Lieutenant Haskell, and there are some small-arms at Fort Brown; but I am unable to give you a correct idea of the quantity or quality at either place. The companies coming into service at Victoria and Fort Brown are poorly armed at best, and some of them have none at all; and if you do not need them at Harrisburg or Galveston, they had better be sent to this place or Victoria at once. Lieut. James Baltzell, C. S. Army, has been directed to remain here and muster such troops as may be reported here into service for Fort Brown. The prisoners of war, except the officers, numbering about 325, are at Camp Verde. The officers throughout the Department are remarkably slow in making their reports (my own regiment among them), when they make them at all, and, until this is remedied, no commanding officer can do justice to the troops or the service in this department.
I had hoped to see you here before this time, and regret to learn that you will not be here for some days yet; but, if it is your desire that I remain here and attend to the vast amount of business coming in here every day, I will do so until it will suit you to relieve me. But since the position is a perplexing one to me, it would gratify me much to be relieved as soon as convenient to you.
I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

Col. H. E. McCulloch,
Prov. Army C. S., Comdg. DepH of Texas, San Antonio, Tex.: Colonel: In my communication to you of the loth instant I stated that all the State arms at the disposal of the executive are tendered to you or to your successor, to be used in arming the forces designed for the protection of Texas. I referred specially to requisitions made for that purpose by the officer commanding this military department. Texas has been, to a great extent, drained of the private arms of citizens by the independent regiments which have been armed and equipped in the State. The executive therefore turns over the State arms to your department in the confidence that they will be used solely in arming the forces designed for the protection of Texas.*

Fort Bliss, Tex., September 24,1881.
Sir : I have the honor to report that Mr. Barnes, the agent sent by me to transport the prisoners to New Mexico, has returned, and brings what I consider reliable information.
The order for moving the United States troops out of New Mexico has been countermanded, and the colonel commanding that department is raising two additional regiments of volunteers, two being already raised. Fort Union is abandoned, and the enemy have taken up a position 2 miles from the fort, which they are fortifying. They have there twenty-five pieces of artillery of various sizes. There are at this time at Union seven companies of regulars and three of volunteers; at Santa Fe, four companies; Albuquerque, four, and at Craig, five.
Barnes conversed freely with Judge Beard and many other prominent Americans, all of whom (Governor Connelly excepted) are for the South. There is some division among the natives, who are resisting the levy of their men as soldiers.
I shall watch closely their movements, and act as circumstances may direct. I would again urge the necessity of forwarding with haste re-enforcements. The Indians are exceedingly troublesome, and the Sonora Mexicans are threatening to rob Tucson, and have robbed Tubac. As I have before stated, I cannot, with the limited force under my command, keep the enemy in check and afford any protection to the citizens. My opinion is that troops are on the way from California to this Territory; but I shall do all in my .power to hold the country against all odds. I will make no move against the enemy until the arrival of General Sibley. New Mexico can now be easily taken.
Details omitted.

Brig. Gen. P. O. Hebert:
Sir: This will be handed you by my private secretary, Mr. L. R. Evans, whom I take pleasure in introducing to you. Mr. Evans is dispatched to you upon business of importance, and which he will fully explain in all particulars not mentioned in this communication.
I am pleased to find, by a communication of date August 31, from the Secretary of War to Major Debray, that you are clothed with full power to protect the military interests and welfare of the State of Texas.
There are now organized in Northern and Northeastern Texas four regiments of mounted men. These troops were called out by me at a time when danger threatened in the direction of Missouri, and with the view of meeting that danger in advance of the limits of the State. They were ordered out for twelve months, unless sooner discharged. They are fine troops, splendidly mounted, and, I am informed, very well armed. These men should be received into service by the Confederate Government. They volunteered readily. They have mounted and equipped themselves at great expense, and are anxious for service. It is not a greater cavalry force than may be needed in Texas. Whether or not, let them not be disbanded. If they should be, it may be difficult to meet future requisitions. If you should accept these regiments, as Major Debray says you have consented to do, you will, I presume, send a mustering officer immediately to them to muster them into service, and he should be instructed to take Austin in his route.
I regret that I cannot meet you in personal interview, and you will receive this letter in the way of suggestion, prompted by an earnest desire to promote the cause in which we are engaged, for which you may at all times rely upon my most hearty co-operation.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The substance of your letter is a repetition of the request contained in your communication of the 16th instant, in reply to which I fully accorded the authority desired, asking only that when companies were accepted we might be advised of it.
I believe I have anticipated your views and wishes, as made known to me by Mr. Bryan, in almost every instance, and to the extent of my power. It will be my pleasure and aim to do so in the future.

By a special messenger, dispatched to you yesterday, you will learn that I have some 4,000 troops now ready for service, and offered for your acceptance. These men, for the term of their enlistment, are willing to go where ordered. They are mounted troops. Will not some two or three regiments of mounted men be needed on our coast ? They are as fine troops and as well mounted and armed as any that can be procured in the State. I earnestly desire that you receive them. If, however, you esteem it essential to raise a regiment in the vicinity of the coast for service near Brazoria (as Mr. Bryan tells me has been proposed), you have my consent. As 1 have heretofore said, you may rely upon my ready co-operation in anything necessary for the defense of Texas or the Confederacy.
If it be possible, I would be pleased, indeed, to see you at Austin. If my presence was not at all times required here, I would not impose upon you the necessity of a visit to this city.
You will please excuse my brevity and seeming familiarity, as I am much pressed with business, and without my private secretary.

Richmond, September 25,1861. General H. H. Sibley, San Antonio, Tex. :
General : The Secretary of War, in reply to yours upon the subject of additional regiments, authorizes your acceptance of the tender of all armed regiments made to you by the governor of Texas.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. H. CHILTOK, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Orders, )	Military Department of Texas,
Ko. 8. )	Galveston, Tex., September 26, 1861.
You are appointed colonel of the Fourth Regiment of Texas Yolunteers, subject to the approval of the President. You will signify your acceptance to these headquarters. The regiment is to be stationed on or near the coast, from San Luis to the Caney, but must serve at any point in the State, if required. It is to be composed of two companies, to serve as artillerists; two mounted companies, to serve as scouts and vedettes, and six of infantry. It is desirable that the companies should present themselves for muster with such arms and ammunition as the men possess or can procure in their respective counties, these arms to do until the department is enabled to supply the deficiency.
Musket and cannon powder, in a limited quantity, can be sent to Columbia, or to some other convenient point, subject to your order. The two 6-pounders at Columbia should be finished and mounted as soon as possible, and I would suggest that they be placed in charge of Capt. W. G. Mosely. Captain Mosely was formerly in the service, and informs me that he has a company partially drilled, and will be ready in a few days to be mustered into service.
The department has no funds at its disposal, and but limited supplies of any description. You must make the best arrangements you can to supply your command with provisions and quarters. The Con-

federate Government will no doubt pay all reasonable obligations in eurred for the service and protection of the State.
You will take immediate steps to fill your regiment according to the above conditions, and are hereby authorized to appoint a competent mustering officer. Companies must be mustered for the war. You are requested to recommend suitable persons for the positions of lieutenant-colonel and major. You will make your reports in duplicate, addressing them to Galveston and San Antonio.
Maj. C. G. Forshey is assigned to engineer duty on the coast with your command. The object of your command is to afford such protection as can be given to that portion of the coast. You will therefore use your own judgment, as events may occur, in stationing your companies.

Col. J. Bates, Brazoria, Tex.
Military Department of Texas,
Galveston, September 27, 1861. The Hon. Secretary of War, Richmond, Yd. :
Sir : I have the honor to report that since my arrival in this department I have, in compliance with orders, directed my attention to the Gulf coast of Texas. I regret to say that I find this coast in almost a defenseless state, and in the almost total want of proper works and armaments; the task of defending successfully any point against an attack of any magnitude amounts to a military impossibility. The port of Galveston is partially defended by a few open sand works, mounted with guns of calibers ranging from 18-pounders to 32-pounders, and of course totally inadequate to resist a bombardment with heavy guns. The few large guns now on the way, should they not arrive too late, will in some measure increase the efficiency of the harbor defenses. On a coast like this, however, where in calm weather a landing can be effected at any point, and the bays in the rear and flank of Galveston Island reached in that manner or by the pass at the west end, the problem of defense, considering the means available to that effect, is certainly one of very difficult, if not impossible, solution.
I am sorry to add that I also found this department entirely destitute of funds, either of State or General Government, and that, in consequence, all my efforts have thus far been completely paralyzed. I am in hopes that funds or credit will soon be in the hands of the proper disbursing officers. As matters now stand it is a difficult matter to purchase supplies on credit for the support of the few volunteer troops now in service. I meet with the best disposition to aid in any manner both from the people and authorities of the State, but the people are poor, and the State without money or apparent credit. Men are ready to volunteer for defense in companies and regiments; but arms, ammunition, provisions, and equipments are wanting.
Not to make too long the list of wants and difficulties, of which the Department at headquarters is probably already but too well aware, I have, in conclusion, the honor to assure the honorable Secretary of War that, although the difficulties surrounding my command now seem almost insurmountable, I will do all in my power to overcome them. In view of the distance of this department from General Headquarters, the

tardiness and uncertainty of mail communication, and the necessity often of prompt action, I may occasionally assume and exercise authority not delegated to me or in strict compliance with the regulations. In all such cases, however, the action shall be subject to the approval of the President.

I shall transmit immediately to Colonels Young and Parsons orders based upon your acceptance of their regiments. I would have been pleased to be able to state to them the service in which you will engage them, as I know it is a subject upon which they are much interested. I presume, however, that you design employing them in the State.
1 regret exceedingly that you could not receive the other two regiments, now ready for service in Northeastern Texas. They are organized and anxiously desire service. They are mounted troops, and yet I think might be willing to take service as infantry in preference to being disbanded. Regretting to disappoint them, and fearing the result of a disappointment upon any future necessity that may come upon us for volunteers, I regret very much indeed to have to discharge them. If you think you will need more infantry, I believe these men would enter that arm of the service, and better soldiers, I know, cannot be obtained in the State.

I regret to hear that you have been so embarrassed by the condition in which you found this military department. I supposed the coast had been as well prepared for defense as the ability of the Confederate and State Governments would permit. Since the 1st of June last, or thereabouts, the coast defense, and especially that of Galveston, has been confided to the Confederate authorities. I sincerely trust that you may in season make preparation for the reception of our enemy, should he conclude to make us a visit upon our coast. With a view to this end I have authorized the making of cannon at Galveston, and have agreed to purchase some already made at Lavaca, if suitable and worthy. I Imve also recently tendered to Colonel McCulloch such State arms as we have, and have already sent him 170 Colt’s improved revolving pistols, and have, subject to your order and acceptance, a few muskets and four 12-pounder howitzers, with carriages, but without caissons. These might be made available perhaps upon the coast. In offering these arms I impose the restriction of their being retained in the State for the defense of the State.
The regiments of Colonels Young and Parsons are clamorous for service, and fret under their confinement in camp $ and I would therefore respectfully suggest that they be mustered into service and given active employment at the earliest possible moment.
Assuring you of my hearty co-operation in all things necessary for the speedy accomplishment of your wishes, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
EDWARD CLAEK.
Headquarters Department of Texas,
San Antonio, Tex., October 4, 1861. Brig. Gen. P. O. Hebert, Galveston, Tex. :
Sir : I have been very much disappointed that no mail brings me any direct tidings of you. I had supposed you would write to me if delayed long on the coast, and inform me what you desired me to do; but, hearing nothing from you, I must still be guided by my own judgment and do the best I can for the country.
I have ordered Lieutenant Sparks to Millican, to provide for and establish a camp of instruction there for ten companies of the reserve army and to muster them into the service, and I suppose he has gone to that point before this time. If he has not, the troops may suffer or disband for want of proper attention.
In my first letter to you I overlooked the fact that General Yan Dorn had called for two companies of artillery for Corpus Christi, and had ordered two 24-pounder guns from Port Brown to that point. I have received notice that two companies (infantry) are ready to be mustered into service at that point. I have ordered Captain Littleton, Second Regiment Texas Mounted Riflemen, to muster them in, and direct them to report to these headquarters, and remain at Corpus Christi until further orders. 1 rather incline to the opinion that these were intended for the artillery companies. If so, they can be put on that duty. Captain Parker, of Brownsville, reports a company of infantry ready for muster at that point, which I have ordered to be mustered in at once. Captain Brewings company of cavalry has been mustered into service by Colonel Ford for the war, under no particular call, and ordered to Ringgold Barracks; and, as there seems to be great probability that the troops will be needed along the Rio Grande and about its mouth, I approved the muster and directed them to be supplied.

I have given directions to have five months7 supplies sent up to the troops on the line from this place to Fort Bliss ; five months7 supplies to those on the Lower Bio Grande, and three months7 supplies sent to my own regiment, on the northern frontier of the State, and supplies are now being sent forward for General Sibley7s brigade, expecting it to move soon. We will not be able to supply him full rations of coffee or sugar, but will give him all we can possibly spare, putting his troops at the least on an equal footing with those of the department. He has seventeen companies mustered into service and expects others daily, and I hope will soon be full and on his march. I have made an appeal to the people of the State to turn out and fill up the regiments called for by General Yan Dorn and the Secretary of War, hoping by that to show them that their services are needed now, if at all, and to get them to act at once.
Commissions for the Second and Third Begiments of Infantry have reached here, and I forwarded them at once to the persons for whom they were intended. I have no doubt that those appointed for the Fourth, or Victoria, Begiment by General Yan Dorn will also be approved, and hence shall direct the officers appointed to go on duty at Victoria.
I have arrested a gentleman of distinction (Col. Charles Anderson, brother of Anderson, of Sumter), who had sold out all his property, and was going, he said, to Kentucky, via Mexico and New York, considering him as an alien enemy, and held as a prisoner of war, subject to the action of the Confederate States courts (if he sees proper to take it before them) or the order of the Secretary of War. He is a very intelligent man, and has been the leader of the opposition here, and was leaving the Confederate States, to connect himself with our enemies, after the expiration of the forty days given by the President in his proclamation, and I felt that I would not have been doing my* duty to my country to have let him depart; consequently I interposed military power to prevent it, of which I shall inform the President as early as possible.
No important orders or communications have been received at this office from the Department at Bichmond since your arrival in the State.
If you can possibly do without the small-arms sent from this place to Lieutenant Haskell at Harrisburg (a jiortion of them I suppose are still there), it might be well to send them to this place or Victoria, the latter probably being the proper place for them now.

To the Men of Texas:
Texans: It is more than probable that your State will soon be invaded by the sea-coast. The enemy’s resources for such an attack would seem to be formidable. Yours to meet and defeat it lie almost entirely in your own strong arms, brave hearts, and trusty rifles.
Our infant Government has achieved wonders; but yet it must largely rely upon the States that created it and which have so gallantly sustained it to strain every nerve for their own individual protection. Look not to Bichmond, then, for all your military inspiration and guidance. Bemember the days of yore, when your own red right hands achieved your independence; and while some of your hardy sons are

prepared to share the glory to be won in Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and others to guard the highway to the Pacific which they have won against superior arms and numbers, be it your portion of the duty which you owe to them and yourselves to keep your soil free from the enemy’s touch and to preserve unsullied the fame of the Texas ranger. Let every man, then, clean his old musket, shot-gun, or rifle, run his bullets, fill his powder-horn, sharpen his knife, and see that his revolver is ready to his hand, as in the trying but glorious clays when Mexico was your foe.
Organize at once into companies, if possible into battalions, and report to me promptly at Galveston and San Antonio your locality, your number, your arms, ammunition, and equipments, and your distance by day’s travel, by railroad or otherwise, from the principal points on the coast.
Be ready to march at a moment’s notice, and wait for orders. Bely upon it that I shall not fail to call you when needed; and when I call, I know that you will come. I am too near to San Jacinto’s field to doubt for a moment that even against overwhelming numbers you will gladly rally to the defense of your homes, your families, and your liberties.
Our enemy may succeed, from his superior armaments, in ravaging your sea coast; but, God willing and you aiding, he will never hold a foot of your soil—never!

General P. O. Hebert:
Sir : I ask you in advance to excuse me for seeming to interfere with you in your arrangements for the defense of the coast, which is under your immediate observation; but, hearing that you had not yet visited Pass Oavallo, and supposing that you have not been able to learn as much of the condition of things at that point as might be necessary to enable you to give such directions as would be advisable, hence I requested Lieutenant-Colonel Buchel, when here a few days since, to submit a written report concerning the defenses of that post, which I herewith inclose for your consideration, with the remark that it seems to me that it may be very necessary for you to send some competent officer to that point to examine the condition of the fortifications, arms, troops, &c., and put them in a proper condition for defense. I am not acquainted with Captain Shea (the officer in command there), and do not know whether he is sufficiently conversant with all the important tluties of his position to enable him to do full justice to the service intrusted to him. The order to Captain Shea to desist from the further prosecution of the work alluded to by Colonel Buchel must have been given by General Van Dorn; but no record of it is on file in this office.

Cavallo, I have the honor to state that Captain Shea’s battery of four 24-pounder guns is very much exposed, and is at present almost in a defenseless condition from any combined attack by land and sea or from any considerable force by land alone. The intention of Captain Shea was to erect a closed work (redoubt), but after commencing the work he was ordered from headquarters to desist from the further prosecution of the same until some officer detailed for the purpose should inspect the Pass and report upon the location and plan of the work. This officer has not yet arrived there. Captain Shea’s battery is at present situated near the light-house on Matagorda Island, and can only defend the principal entrance or ship channel into Matagorda Bay. The nearest point from which re-enforcements could be expected in case of an attack would be Indianola, distant about 15 miles from the Pass, and between these two points two large bayous exist, over which no sufficient means for crossing are provided. The East Pass or channel has no defenses whatever. From these facts you can x>erceive, colonel, the urgent necessity that exists for the placing of these points in a proper state of defense, or that the troops and guns already there be withdrawn from so exposed a position.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. BUCHEL,

Orders, >	Military Department of Texas,

I.	Batteries shall be established at Virginia Point and at the Galveston head of the Bailroad Bridge. Capt. J. Kellersberg is charged with the construction of the works, as directed by the general commanding, and Major Cook with the armaments.
II.	All necessary preparatory measures shall be taken for the mounting of the large guns expected as soon after their arrival as practicable, and arrangements made for the transportation of guns, material, &c., to the batteries.
III.	The number of heavy guns being limited in number, it will be necessary to distribute them to the best advantage. The first two heavy guns received will be placed at Pelican Spit, commanding the channel, with a battery of 32-pounders commanding the channel, Bolivar Point, and East Bay. When replaced by other guns, the 18-pounder at the Spit will be put in battery at the Galveston head of the bridge. Two of the heavy guns will be placed in battery at Fort Point, and two on the beach near the front of Fremont street.

I wrote to you by the last mail, informing you of the acceptance of the four cavalry regiments offered you by the Secretary of War, and desiring to know whether you still wished the two you had accepted. On the same day I dispatched a messenger, with the intelligence of their acceptance by the Secretary of War, to these regiments, and that I had communicated with you and him. This leaves them in doubt as to the ultimate result of their present condition, and for this reason I would be pleased to hear as early as your convenience will permit.
I see that you are energetically at work for the defense of our coast. I am pleased to be able to say that several brigades of militia are ready for service, if needed, and will be placed at your command if you need them.
I am gratified at the news from the seat of war. I sincerely trust it may prove true.

Goliad, Tex., October 12, 1861. To the Hon. Secretary of War, Richmond:
Sir: Having been at Brownsville, on the Rio Grande, for several weeks, on a mission of importance for the State of Texas, I take the liberty of inclosing a memorandum of my observations while there, with the hope that it may serve in attracting the attention of the Government to the importance of that point. As the only brother of the late General B. E. Bee, my name will not be unknown to you, and I can with pleasure refer you to Colonel Wigfall, Colonel Waul, and Judge Hemphill as to the great interest I have at stake, both politically and personally, in the success of our cause.
W ith great respect,
HAMILTON P. BEE.
[Inclosure.]
Brownsville is 30 miles from the Gulf; Brazos Island is its port; depth of water 6 feet. The mouth of the Rio Grande has still less wTater on its bar.
Fort Brown was built by General Taylor for attack on Matamoras, and is of but little use for defense of Brownsville, as an enemy could without difficulty take possession of it without coming under fire from the fort, whose guns could destroy it in an hour. The fort has been repaired by Colonel Ford and is unfinished, but could in a short time be made as strong as earthworks generally are. There are twenty-five pieces of cannon of different caliber there, including a light battery, complete, with its caissons loaded, harness in good order, and ready for service in thirty minutes. The battery horses are poor and unserviceable, but in improving condition. About 300 rounds of ammunition for each piece, of the best description, and a. good supply of powder and ball cartridges constitute the supply of ammunition. Lead can be bought in any quantity at 4£ cents per pound. There is one 10-inch mortar, and no ] >,iece larger than a 24-pounder. There are now at Fort Brown four companies of cavalry (Texans), say 400 men in all.
Brownsville is the depot of the Mexican trade. In 1860 $12,000,000 in specie passed through the custom-house en route for the U nited States. The imports of goods, principally dry goods, is proportionally heavy. All that trade is now suspended. No direct shipments have arrived at Matamoras from foreign ports. Two vessels arrived there from New York while I was on the Rio Grande, both loaded with provisions and

necessary supplies. One of them was wrecked. The foreign merchants at Matamoras are English and German, and are friendly to our cause. No arrangements for direct importation have been made, owing to the unsettled state of opinion concerning the raising of the blockade. If it should not be raised, direct importation will follow.
The Mexicans are neutral. The officers, civil and military, profess and exhibit every desire to co-operate with us in maintaining peace and good order on the line, and have aided essentially in* estopping the forays of Cortinas into Texas. The Mexican population on this side of the Bio Grande are quiet, but not to be relied on in case of invasion.
It is known that Lieutenant Langdon (artillery) and two cavalry officers, who were previously on this line and familiar with the country, are now at Fort Pickens. Two cavalry companies are said to be on Santa Eosa Island. They have all the information, and we may suppose the desire, to repossess themselves of that point.
The following reasons occur to my mind why the enemy will seek to reoccupy Fort Brown: The hope of recapturing the cannon and material of war 5 the opening of the Mexican trade to New York, which will throw millions of dollars into the industry of the North. The fact, beyond a question, that the reoccupation of that; j)oint will convert the neutrality of the Mexicans into hostility, then hatred and bitterness, is against us, not against the North. By virtue of commissions from the Lincoln authorities two or three thousand Mexican mounted guerrillas would be mustered into the service of the United States, to depredate and destroy the settlements even to the San Antonio Eiver, thus destroying the stock interest of Western Texas.
My conclusions are that it is of the utmost importance to the Confederacy that Brownsville and the line of the Eio Grande should be held by them. Shut up and encompassed around as we are, it is the only point through which we can communicate with the nations of Europe. By proper encouragement every necessary supply, either for our Government or people, can be brought to Matamoras from abroad, and we have no other outlet so long as the supremacy of the seas is against us. It will keep quiet and neutral a large and in some respects an efficient force of a race embittered against us by real or imaginary wrongs dating back twenty years. By means of the steamboats now at Brownsville the enemy could transport a force to Ringgold Barracks, and thence, by forced marches over a good road, be at San Antonio in twelve days —leaving no enemy in their rear, but, on the contrary, a willing and useful ally, to keep uj) their line of communication. It is the most feasible way to invade Texas. Brownsville should be defended or given up at once, and the cannon withdrawn while yet there is time. It will be too late when the enemy lands. A few men—a thousand men—cannot defend it; they will only be caught in a trap ; there will be no way of retreat. The gloomy desert of sand between the Eio Grande and Nueces will lose us the cannon. The enemy will hardly land with less than 10,000 men. The material of war there is worth its weight in gold to our cause. It will be lost within two months unless a strong force is sent there for its protection. An officer who speaks the Mexican language and understands the people should be appointed to the command. If he is wise and watchful, he will keep the peace with Mexico and make her people useful friends. Supplies of all sorts for the troox>s can be got in Brownsville except bacon or pork.

Gov. Edward Clark, Austin, Tex.:
Sir: The very great pressure on my time and the absorption of all my energies in the attempt suddenly to direct the operations of this Department on the resignation of General Walker will furnish an apology that I trust you find satisfactory for my delay in replying to your two favors of 7th and 14th ultimo. I appreciate to the fullest extent the zealous and hearty co-operation of yourself and your generous fellow-citizens in the effort fully to supply clothing for our troops in the field.
After maturely considering the various modes suggested, it occurs to me that the simplest and best plan is for the State of Texas to clothe her own troops, under rules and regulations to be executed by her own officers, and to receive the commutation of $25 for every six months* clothing furnished to each man, according to the act of Congress of 30th August last, and which cannot have reached you at the date of your letters. I have prepared regulations on this subject, now in press, and in a day or two, when I get them from the printers, will furnish you a copy. If your State will, under these regulations, furnish her own troops, in whole or in part, it will greatly relieve our labors, that are now taxing with the utmost severity all our energies.
Please inform me as soon as you get my printed circular whether you will do this. If not, could you not have the wool manufactured at your penitentiary and sell it to us at a fair value, which we will cheerfully pay ? State agency in all these matters is much more effective than our own, and I desire, as far as I possibly can, to avoid the multiplication of Confederate officers and agencies.

The most important and available to the Confederacy are under the sway of Indians. I am at present unable to render the necessary assistance, although I have ordered Maj. E.

their signature promising to remain here, in order to keep up the place, deserted us cowardly by a train that left yesterday for Mesilla.
The undersigned having been elected captain of the Minute Company organized amongst our citizens to defend our diggings against the Indians (conjointly with the Arizona Guards, stationed here) yesterday held a meeting, and found that about 70 miners remained here, only half of which are armed. We are determined to defend this place to the last, and could easily do so if we could stay in one body ; but the diggings are such that only a few men can work at one place, and as the miners now left occupy merely a narrow space of ground, but running about 1 mile up Bear Creek, the other gulches having been abandoned for the want of a sufficient number of miners, therefore the Indians are liable to attack the dispersed miners at any time, and, until we can rally our small number of armed men to meet the enemy, they may murder our miners again before we can save them; and as we are not numerous enough to pursue the Indians, they may resume their attacks almost every day with impunity, and annoy our miners to such an extent that they will have to stop working, and consequently, not being able to earn our living, necessity would make us leave here, even against our will.
If it is in your power to send a sufficient number of mounted men here that would pursue the Indians to their hiding places and make our roads safe again, this place would soon have a large population again, and you would save a place from deser tion which at no distant day will become the most important of Arizona, as soon as our rich diggings, gold and silver mines, can be worked with safety for capital. Should you not be able to send more troops at present, you would help us greatly by sending thirty or forty muskets to the commander of the Arizona Guards here, who would distribute them to our unarmed miners with good security for their return when recalled, and thereby we will defend ourselves until you can give us more protection and commence your ojjerations against the savages. I am confident that you will do all in your power for our safety and protection in our dangerous position.

[Chap. XL
Col. W. H. Parsons, Fourth Kegiment Texas Volunteer Cavalry, having by letter and through the major of his regiment this day expressed a strong preference for service in the State, I have ordered his regiment to be mustered into service at Spring Creek, near Hempstead. In regard to the other regiments, it is, perhaps, advisable, in view of the position of General McCulloch and the urgency of his call, that they should be mustered into service under the authority granted to Colonel Young. Any other divisions of those regiments might perhaps seriously interfere with the plans of the War Department, of which, however, I am not advised, and under the authority I could not well entirely countermand orders emanating from the headquarters of the Army.
The heavy guns intended for Galveston are reported on the way, strung along the road from Alexandria to Niblett’s Bluff. Two or three of them are expected by the end of this or the beginning of next week. I have ordered them to be placed in battery as they arrive, and, as the number is limited, distributed to the best advantage. Owing, however, to the vast superiority of the naval armaments of the enemy and the almost defenseless state of the coast, the problem of defending it successfully with the means at our disposal is one of difficult, if not of impossible, solution. The enemy having complete possession of the seas, as in the days of our first revolution, we must fight this war as our forefathers did, and, I have full faith, as successfully.
With respectful salutations, I have the honor to be, your excellency’s very obedient servant,

Headquarters Department of Texas,
San Antonio, October 17, 1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:
Sir : From the time I came to this place (2d September) cotton has been passing through it to Mexico. The quantity has been considerable, though not very great, but it has been increasing for the last three weeks, and I have just been informed by reliable persons that a much greater quantity has been and is still passing from Texas into Mexico by wagons on the route below this and by light-draught vessels that go through the bays and bayous along the coast to the mouth of the Rio Grande. Cotton is now worth twenty-two and twenty-three cents at Yew York, and I am satisfied that a large proportion of the cotton going into Mexico passes on to that and other Northern ports.
The policy of our Government is no doubt to prevent our cotton being shipped to the United States to sustain the manufacturing interests of our enemies. Under these circumstances how is it to be done, and can the military authority here do anything in it?
There is a large number of beef cattle now being purchased by persons for the market in Mexico. Such a thing has not been known in Texas for many years, and I think there is good reason to suppose that these cattle are for the benefit of the U. S. Army that are expected to come through Mexico either from California or by sea, and for the support of that portion of the Army in New Mexico. It seems to me that a proper regard for the safety of the country would justify the suspension of this trade for the present, or that those engaged in it should be

required to show that the produce is intended for the use of the people of Mexico only.
I am of the opinion that there are no custom-house officers of our Government on the Rio Grande. There should be officers at several points from El Paso to Brazos Santiago—say El Paso, Presidio del Norte, Eagle Pass or Fort Duncan, Laredo, Roma, Rio Grande City, Brownsville, and Point Isabel.
The subject of our trade and intercourse with Mexico is one of great importance to our Government, especially during this war, and no step should be hastily taken without proper consideration, and it is greatly to our interest that nothing should be done to interrupt the most liberal trade and intercourse with the people of that country, as far as it can be permitted with safety to our interests. I mention these articles and this manner of trade now progressing in order to inform the Government that the proper direction may be given respecting them.
It may seem strange that I am still writing as the commanding officer of this department at these headquarters, when it must be known to the Secretary of War that General Hebert is within the Department of Texas (at Galveston, where he has been for some weeks), but he has not published any order assuming command, or relieved me in any manner by which I could feel justified in leaving the office, to which, in consequence of my senior rank, I was assigned by order of the Secretary of War (Special Orders, No. 123), and the orders of General Yan Dorn, copies of which I herewith inclose.* I mention this matter that I may not appear ridiculous in the eyes of the officers at the seat of Government.

General P. O. Hebert,
Comdg. Texas Division, Confederate Army, Galveston, Tex.:
Dear Sir : There are two artillery companies, numbering about 180 men, stationed at Pass Cavailo, as a defense to the entrance into Matagorda Bay. Their armaments consist of four 21-pounders, two 12-pounders, and one 6-pounder cannon, with a supply of small-arms, but a limited supply of ammunition. They have thrown up temporary embankments of sand at a point some 200 or 300 yards southeast from the Pass Cavallo light-house, and placed their guns in battery. The approach inland from Lavaca and Indianola to this point is by water, there being two large bayous intervening on the land route—bayous over a hundred yards in width and from 10 to 15 feet in depth, and without ferries. In case of an attack on this point, for immediate assistance there could be mustered of the militia in Indianola and Lavaca one company each. It would require from six hours to two days for those companies to reach the post, depending entirely upon wind, tide, and the supply of boats that might be on hand, there being only small sail boats now plying in the bay.
The Confederate forces now organizing at Victoria, together with the militia at that place, numbering in all at this time not exceeding 800 to 1,000 men, could not be transported on the railroad to Lavaca in

less than twelve hours, and thence to Saluria or this post in such time as favorable or unfavorable winds and tides might determine. Other re-enforcements would of course soon follow 5 but is it not prudent to suppose that if an attack be made upon this point of our coast it will be with a large and an invading force (a force susceptible of division), a portion landing below on the island and attacking us in the rear, while with their main body the enemy could pass up the channel, overwhelming our position with their superior numbers, and this, too, before re-enforcements could reach us. In view of these facts and suggestions, would it not be advisable to construct a good military road from In-dianola to the Pass, providing ample and well-attended ferries on the large bayous (boats for this purpose can be had already built), and to construct bridges over the smaller ones? Would it not be prudent, as a measure of safety against surprise, to have Captain Beaumont’s cavalry company, which is now stationed at Victoria, removed to the island, to range as scouts down the coast, to cut off* detached parties, should any land, and to give information of the movements of the enemy if he made his appearance below ? In addition to the foregoing measures of prudence and safety, would it not render our defenses certain, or our retreat entirely safe, to have five companies of infantry, now in camp at Victoria, removed to the island ? There they could drill as well as at Victoria. It is a healthy position, and provisions, fuel, and water can be had at slight advances on the present prices. In case of an attack, they could render immediate and efficient service, and, I apprehend, could reach as promptly any other point of attack on our coast as from Victoria. I think that Captain Pearson’s company, from Matagorda, and Captain Phillips’, from Lavaca, at least, should be required to return immediately to the coast whence they were taken. It does occur to me that the post should not only be strengthened, but that means of supplying it with re-enforcements should be provided, or that the position should be abandoned, and the guns, together with the forces, removed to Indianola or some other point, where assistance could with certainty reach them. The men we now have there will fight until there are none left to tell the story. But why imperil the lives of our brave men ? Why place our armament of defense within reach of the enemy ? Why keep up a mere show of defense when we really have none, the effect being only to cause the public mind to sleep in its insecurity ? Captain Shea, commanding the post, I understand, has no authority to take action in the premises. Colonel McCulloch, I learn, declines making any changes until your arrival. Our people have been anxiously awaiting your presence at this point, and hence there is nothing being done. There is a heavy responsibility resting somewhere. Our lives and property are in danger. I realize the fact with painful anxiety. Hence I venture these suggestions, and, although we have no personal acquaintance, yet I apprehend that your position in the State, and the interest which I feel in the welfare of this particular section of our country, will render an apology for this communication unnecessary.
In conclusion, I have only to add that the suggestions which I have made are intended only to call your attention to the military condition of this section of country, and to urge you, if your whole time is occupied at Galveston and adjacent points, to appoint some person competent to the command, and with full authority to give directions to our defenses.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Galveston, Tex., October 19,1801. General P. O. Hebert, 0. S. A., Comdg. Department of Texas:
General : I have the honor to state that, upon a critical investigation as to the most suitable points to station 10,000 troops, in view of subsisting them, as well as tor the defense of this city, there should be in Galveston and Virginia Point, 5,000; at Magnolia, Clear Creek, and near the railroad, 2,000; at Spring Creek, near Millican, 2,000; at the State camp, near Harrisburg, 1,000. These troops, thus stationed, could protect the city, as well as the mouth of the Brazos, if necessary. I have already ordered Harrisburg to be made a depot for subsistence supplies, as well as forage for the quartermasters department. Prom the most reliable information I can obtain I have no doubt the troops can be subsisted without difficulty. There can be subsisted on the lower Bio Grande 5,000 troops—3,000 at Port Brown and its vicinity; 1,000 at Binggold Barracks; 500 at Port McIntosh and vicinity, and 500 near Edinburg, 55 miles from Port Brown. I propose making Binggold Barracks, 120 miles from Port Brown, a depot for the support of these troops.
With the view of making the different departments efficient, I propose, Francis I. Lynch assistant quartermaster, Thomas NT. Min ter and James H. French commissaries, with the rank of captain, to be located at Harrisburg and Binggold Barracks, whose duties shall be to keep the depots supplied. These officers, in addition to those already in the department, with suitable details from the line, will be sufficient.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General P. O. Hubert :
Sir : Your communication of the lGtli instant was duly received. I am gratified that you have ordered Colonel Parsons, with his regiment, south. He was anxious to obtain service in Texas.
One object of my writing at this time is to procure, if possible, the acceptance of Colonel Locke’s regiment. Prom information just received I fear that he has taken up the line of march in the direction of the coast. If so, it has been done without orders from me, and I presume in consequence of advices given him by Colonel Parsons. Though the duty of the soldier is to await ai d obey orders, I am disposed to excuse his non-observance of this obligation, for the reason that they have promptly responded to my call for their services and are exceedingly anxious for service. This regiment would have gone to Missouri without hesitation, but are now of the opinion that Texas may need them ; and, if so, they prefer to stay at home. I am aware that you do not desire a very large cavalry force, not more perhaps than you now have. It may occur, however, that you may need additional cavalry troops; and, indeed, I see through the papers that you are in some instances authorizing the raising of cavalry companies. Would it not suit your views to receive this regiment now, in expectancy of future contingencies! Might it not be well employed at Brownsville until the forces desired for that post be obtained? We have an extended seaboard, and, if invaded in that quarter, I should think a considerable cavalry force would be needed. It is now very

late, too, to send men to Missouri; and, for tliis reason and the probable necessity that comes upon us for our volunteers at home, I would be greatly gratified if you would accept this regiment, and request, if consistent with your opinions of duty and propriety, that you do so. In addition to the impracticability of their now going to Missouri, 1 will state that they have been some time organized, and equipped themselves at considerable expense. Many of them have abandoned their employment to engage in their country’s service, and, if disappointed or disbanded, the consequences would be ruinous to them. Colonel Young’s regiment, as also that of Colonel Sims, I feel satisfied, from advices received, have been started to Missouri. While I do not wish to embarrass you, and by no means to control your operations, I sincerely desire and request that you have this regiment immediately put to service in Texas, if you can.
The impression has obtained. I find, that you have authorized the enlistment of men for six months. Within the last few days I have been repeatedly asked if such is the case. If you have done so, I suppose it results from your opinion of the necessities of our coast country. It is, however, having a bad effect upon my efforts to raise the required forces for Fort Ilrown and other points. Our jmople, though willing to serve as long as needed, desire the shortest term that can be obtained; and hence will not volunteer for the war while there is a chance to enlist for six or twelve months. You will not understand me as complaining of this course, for, if you have authorized it, I doubt not you have good reasons tor it.
It is reported here that there is an intention of withdrawing the regiment of Colonel McCulloch from its position upon the frontier. While I attach very little consequence to this impression, I feel called upon, in justice to our frontier citizens, to request that it may not be done. 1 feel apprehensive that we may in the future have more trouble from Indians than we have had for several months, and I should therefore feel very unwilling to see this regiment taken away. It lias been upon that line of frontier for nearly one year, and is, or should be, better suited for its protection than any new forces that could be placed there. I trust that the opinion of your intention to withdraw it is incorrect, and that that border may not be deprived of its presence and protection.
I trust that you have by this time received the cannon expected from Eiclimond, and that they are, or will soon be, ready for service. Should you be attacked at Galveston, which I hope will not be the case, I greatly desire to have it in my power to be present.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, &c.,

Galveston, Tex., October 21, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War, Richmond, Fa.;
Sir : My duties have been of so pressing a nature at this post and on the Gulf coast that I have not as yet been able to repair to San Antonio, the headquarters of the department.
In a former communication I had the honor to advise the Department of the difficulties under which I labored, for want of funds, guns, and ammunition, in endeavoring to place this post and other points on the seaboard in a respectable state of defense. The guns available are limited in number and of inferior caliber to those likely to be brought against us by the enemy. The few heavy guns ordered from Eichmond

are now on the route between Alexandria and the Sabine River. Much difficulty has been experienced in the transportation of these guns across the country—so much so, that the time of their reaching this point is very indefinite. I have dispatched an efficient person, with the necessary appliances, to assist the agent of the quartermaster’s department of Uew Orleans in the transportation.
In view of the fact that, owing to the superior naval armaments of the enemy and his entire*possession of the sea, it will be almost impossible to prevent a landing at some point upon this extensive and unprotected coast, I have settled upon it as a military necessity that he must be fought on shore or in the interior. To do this an army must be raised, organized, and armed with such weapons as can be procured. I have in consequence already authorized and called into service several volunteer regiments, for the war when practicable, and for twelve months when necessary. The State having already been pretty well exhausted of the young material willing to engage for the war, there is a necessity of resorting to twelve-months’ enlistments.
After mature deliberation I consider that a volunteer force of about 35,000 men should without delay be called into service, and of this the Rio Grande frontier will need some 3,000 or 4,000. Time pressing, and the means of communication with the headquarters of the Government being slow and uncertain, I shall proceed, until further orders from the War Department, to raise and organize this force, if possible, from the State, arming and equipping it as efficiently as the means available will permit, trusting that the Government will appreciate the motives by which I am prompted and will sanction my acts.
I shall appoint provisionally such field and staff officers as may be necessary, subject to the approval of the President. I am encouraged to take this action, as the precedent established by my predecessor seems to have met with the sanction of the Government by the confirmation of the provisional appointments made by him.
Upon my arrival here I found the department without a single regiment full, armed and equipped. I have now, or will have in a few days, over 5,000 men in the field, stationed here and at other points— not well armed and equipped, it is true, but as efficiently as circumstances permit.
The department is wofully deficient in powder, lead, and ammunition of all kinds. I have directed the chief quartermaster to make arrangements with individuals to obtain, if possible, arms and ammunition from Mexico, giving cotton in exchange.
I have the honor to inclose copy of a proclamation issued on the 7th instant-.*
Again expressing the hope that the Department will sanction my acts in the execution of the purpose of defending this State, if possible, against invasion, I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

would urge that re enforcements hurry up as fast as possible. I shall have to fall back on Quitman, and maybe Davis. I am sending my supplies ahead, and will keep the enemy in check, if possible ; but send up men as soon as possible, for they will be needed. It is reported to me that General Sumner is on the way from Guaymas with 2,000 regular troops to meet the forces from above at Mesilla. Hurry uj) if you want a fight.

[Judge S. Haut :]
Deau Judge: I write a few lines to say we are all quiet and busy forwarding our supplies. No news from above. My spies are down from Thorn. No sign of the enemy so far. I will have them watched, and* let you know in time all the news. Cannot you send pony to Chihuahua to ascertain if Sumner is coming across^ I learn he is coming, and think it should be seen to by all means. Keep cool, for we have time. They will get no re-enforcements from Kansas, and if Sumner does not come we will bag the whole party before spring. So far they have no re-enforcements, and are depending on Mexicans who have been pressed into service. I shall just keep out of the way and let them fall to pieces of their own weight. The money Price took at Lexington was to pay the New Mexican troops off, but won’t be used for that purpose now, and how long the Mexicans will serve without pay will be seen; not long, I imagine.
Kind regards to madam and boys.
Yours,
JOHN E. BAYLOE.

[Judge S. IlAUT:]
Dead Judge : My spy returned yesterday, bringing me news that Colonel Canby was at Craig with 2,500 men, and would move against me by the 1st of November. Last night an express from Santa Fe arrived, bringing me the same news, and confirming all the particulars stated by my spy.
1 want you to get all the transportation possible to move the stores at Fort Bliss to Quitman or Davis, as I shall direct. I shall send all from here, and make my arrangements for an orderly retreat, as it is folly for me to attempt resistance against such odds; and, besides, it only amounts to the inconvenience of moving, for when General Sibley gets with me we will return and get pay. I send you an extra which was brought by express from Santa Fe. This is a damper on the enemy, for it was the very funds intended to pay off the very troops in New Mexico, who have had no pay for eighteen months. There is great dissatisfaction up there for want of pay among the regulars and the force used to get the natives in the ranks. With three more companies I would fight them, but don’t think it prudent now. Tom has deserted and gone to Kentucky. Don’t be alarmed. I can get out of the way, and you must all look out and remove your effects across the river. Tell Crosby and Magoffin to be calm, and do not create a panic. All will turn out right. A little time is all we want. You will hear of some tall guerrilla work before long.

Dona Ana, irk, October 25, 1801. Commander Department of Texas:
Sir: I hasten to inform you that my spies have returned from New Mexico, bringing the intelligence that Colonel Canby, with 2,500 men and a battery of flying artillery, are en route to this place. I shall be compelled to fall back, as my force is too weak to meet them. 1 have petitioned time and again for re-enforcements to prevent this disaster, to all of which a deaf ear has been turned. I have only to add that the abandonment of the country will necessarily be attended with a great sacrifice of property, and subject the friends of our cause to persecution and ruin. If it is the wish of the colonel commanding the department that Arizona should be abandoned, and I presume it is, he can congratulate himself upon the consummation of that event.
The colonel commanding the department informs me in his last orders to me that in case of invasion I can make such disposition as I think proper of the troops on my line, &c. This is liberal, when it is remembered that the troops of the enemy are but little over 100 miles from me and my re-enforcements scattered for 500 miles.
It is unnecessary to ask for re enforcements, as I presume they are not to be had. I shall therefore fall back, and await the arrival of Brigadier-General Sibley.
Respectfully, &c.,

12-pounders and one 6-pounder, turned over by the citizens or military board of Indianola. This constitutes our defense. Suppose an invasion be attempted through this point. Those men, with their armaments, would fall an easy prey to the enemy, and before assistance could reach them from Victoria the enemy would be prepared to meet us with our own guns. Captain Pearson’s company, from Matagorda, and Captain Phillips’, from Lavaca, should have been ordered to the Pass, instead of farther back into the country. You are aware, from personal experience, of the uncertainty of transportation from Indianola, or Lavaca, or Mat-gorda to the Pass, depending, as it does, upon the wind and tide. It is clear to my mind that the post should be strengthened or abandoned. Captain Beaumont’s company of cavalry, it was thought, was to be stationed on the island, and many joined from here with that belief. It seems to me that they could do much good as scouts on the island below the fort. They could cut off detachments if the enemy attempted a landing, and give information if they made their appearance below. They do no good stationed at Victoria. I do not know whose duty it is to see to the military condition of this particular section of the coast, but I assure you there is immense responsibility resting somewhere. ISTo officer or engineer, with authority to control or direct the military defenses of this bay, has ever been ordered here. Captain Shea, who does not profess to be an engineer, was ordered to select a place at or near the Pass, and to put his guns in. This he has done, and done well, no doubt, and he and Captain Beuss, with their companies, will die defending them ,* but he has no authority to increase his force or abandon the post.
These suggestions are hastily summed up to call your attention to the facts, that you may see the importance of action in the premises. If we are in danger, immediate action alone can save us.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
D. M. STAPP,
Brigadier-General, Texas Militia.
Galveston, Tex., October 31,1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Richmond, Va.:
My Dear Sir : I had the honor a few days since of addressing an official communication to the War Department, stating as my opinion that an army of some 15,000 men would be necessary to resist an invasion of this State and to protect its frontiers, and to ask for authority to call out that number of volunteers. From my intercourse and correspondence with the authorities and people of tins State, I know that they look for protection at the hands of the Confederate Government, and expect me, its representative, to act in the matter. It is a difficult task under the circumstances. All I can do is to call out volunteers, and place in their hands such weapons as can be found in the country. Of lead, powder, and caps the supply is almost nothing at all. I have called upon the people to collect and preserve all they have. Arrangements have been, by my direction, made with firms here to procure munitions of war from Mexico, giving cotton in exchange, and with some hopes of success.
To tell you how totally unprepared, confused, and defenseless I found this department, and to describe fully the difficulties under which I have labored, and do still, from lack of means, guns, arms, ammunition, and a proper military organization, would be tedious, and employ too

much of your valuable time. As an engineer, I can but too well appreciate the defenseless state of the sea-coast, see plainly what is needed generally, but of course can only deplore my inability to remedy the evil. I much fear that I have brought my little military reputation to an early grave. At all events, I will endeavor to justify the confidence of the President in charging me with this difficult command, and trust to your knowledge of the correctness of my motives and .your friendship for me to set me right in all matters where I may seem to transcend the authority usually vested in commanders of departments.

that of the United States. About that time Captain Nolan attacked and killed several of the rebels, whereupon the remainder of them ran to the opposite side of the river, where they have remained ever since at a rancho opposite Carrizo. Their ranches on this side of the river are mostly deserted. Occasionally you will find servants in some of the ranches, attending to their stock. Is not this property subject to confiscation? If so, am I the proper, person to take the matter in hand? Please inform me as to the way to proceed. I have the names of the refugees, furnished me by the chief justice of the county. I find it necessary to leave a detachment of men at Carrizo, as it is unsafe for the citizens to remain there without protection as long as these marauders remain at the rancho just across the river.
I learned at Carrizo that the majority of the Mexican citizens of Zapata County had never taken the oath of allegiance to the Confederate States, whereupon I issued an order for them all to come forward and fulfill that duty. The time being somewhat short, only twenty came forward; but, on election day, all will be required to do so before voting. In a few days I expect to report to you that all of the Mexicans in that county have become citizens. My command are all well, and fast improving in the drill.

General : I have the honor to forward herewith for your information certain letters from Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor, Judge Crosby, and Judge Hart, relative to military movements on both sides in the Territory of New Mexico. I regard the probable advance of the Federal forces there as a movement decidedly to be desired by us, and that so soon as my force shall reach the field of action it must result in the destruction or capture of the enemy’s forces. It is no doubt induced by the threatened attack of Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor on Fort Craig, made by my orders. Colonel Beily’s regiment of my brigade is by this time some 250 miles en route. Ooionel Green’s broke camp yesterday, and my third regiment (Colonel Steele’s) will follow very soon. Not an hour shall be lost in pushing forward the whole force. The delays heretofore encountered have been unavoidable. Messrs.

to fall back, as my force is too weak to meet the enemy. I am forwarding my supplies to Quitman, and will send them, if necessary, to Davis. I would respectfully urge that re-enforcements be sent at once, as the supplies of this valley are of the utmost importance to us, and will be consumed or destroyed by the enemy if they are allowed to remain. There is now a fine supply of corn in the valley—enough to furnish two or three regiments. I have on hand no corn and but little hay. I would not accumulate supplies for fear of an invasion. I can save most of my commissary and hospital supplies. I have ordered corn thrown into Davis in large quantities, for your use as well as mine, should I be forced there.
I get my intelligence from Santa F6 by three gentlemen well known as men of veracity. Messrs. Phillips and Battle are two of them. Battle says the officers told him that General Sumner was coming across from Guaymas, and was expected to meet Colonel Canby at Mesilla. 1 have spies now on the road to ascertain if this is so, and will know soon.
The Mexican population are decidedly Northern in sentiment, and will avail themselves of the first opportunity to rob us or join the enemy. Nothing but a strong force will keep them quiet. I would again urge that re-enforcements cannot be too soon sent up.

General H. H. Sibley, Commanding Sibley Brigade, <&c. :
Sir : The mail has just arrived here from Sao Antonio, and I am advised by Captain Walker, in command of Fort Bliss, that he will cause it to return forthwith. Colonel Baylor’s dispatches wTill no doubt advise you of the condition of affairs here at this time. We are looking for Colonel Baylor with his entire force at any moment. The merchants and most of the families of this part of the country have u pulled up stakes” and gone to the Mexican side. Colonel Canby’s force is said to be 2,700 strong, and that he will approach us in three columns, one via the river, one via El Jornada, and another by Stanton—the latter intended to cut off* Baylor’s retreat. This seems to me rather a hazardous enterprise for a prudent man like Canby to embark in. You can imagine what an unsettled state the country hereabout is in. I for one shall stand my ground until the last moment, and will not cease to do all that can be done in the way of providing for your command, at least so long as I may have it in my power to remain. I have made arrangements with a responsible party to proceed at once and buy up a quantity of corn, beans, &c., in Mexico for your use. None of these supplies, as a matter of course, will be brought on this side of the river until such time as they would be safe from the enemy. The party who will make these purchases is not known as a contractor for the Confederate States, and will therefore run no risk in his purchases.
1 regret not having received additional instructions per last mail. I shall engage all the arms and munitions possible to be had. I am sending an express to Sonora with a view, among other things, of watching the California route. It may be that there is some intelligence between Canby and Sumner, and that it is desirable to get Baylor out of the way to enable them to form a junction at Mesilla. This is, however, purely conjectural on my part.
In very great haste, your obedient servant,

El Paso, October 27, 1861.
General H. H. Sibley, 0. S. A.,
Commanding Brigade for Arizona and New Mexico,
en route or at San Antonio:
My Dear General : A week since Judge Crosby called on me in reference to supplies for your brigade. I immediately took steps to secure supplies of breadstuffs, the greater part of which must come from Sonora, as there is great scarcity in the State of Chihuahua. I sent for my Sonora agent to come to me here a month since, to meet and see what would be required of me to furnish the Confederacy. This agent was to have left about this time with a proper escort from Colonel Baylor, and some thirty to forty wagons, to commence hauling supplies from the Sonora border to the Rio Grande, which would have commenced to arrive at Fillmore by the middle of December. In the mean time my mills will furnish from the limited supplies of grain here. I have now some 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of flour, and will have 40,000 to
50.000	pounds more if the New Mexican troops do not succeed in forcing Colonel Baylor to fall back beyond this place.
The flour I have here, and may make tilt I am interrupted, I am now placing in a place of safety in El Paso, Mexico, as recommended by Colonel Baylor in his letters, which I inclose. I shall do everything in my power, and all that is possible for a man to do in my circumstances and situation, to further the public service. This you well know, and I need not assure you of the fact. You must especially heed Judge Crosby’s and Mr. Richardson’s suggestions as to things here, and what you and the commanding officers of the department must do to facilitate Mr. Richardson and myself to furnish supplies by procuring some cash funds. I can command here now from $40,000 to $50,000, all or mosfr of which must go into Sonora immediately to pay for flour, &c. As suggested by Colonel Baylor, I have engaged au express to go into Sonora to learn if Sumner is actually coming from California via Guay-mas or Fort Union. By the same express I will order the purchase of more flour, beans, salt, beef, soap, corn, &c. I have there already some
10.000	pounds of corn and 300,000 pounds of flour, all for your brigade, and waiting your movement. I inclose herewith my last letters from Colonel Baylor.* His command is in peril. I hope God in His goodness will so order things as not to make his retreat necessary from Arizona.
Our express from Sonora, with intelligence from Forts Yuma and Guaymas, will be back in twenty days, when you and Colonel Baylor will be fully posted up as to Sumner and his movements, if he is making any, towards Arizona from California. Be easy about your supplies; we shall get all we want from Sonora—what this valley cannot furnish— until such time as you may be in full possession of New Mexico, and can avail of its resources or such part as the hungry Federals may leave for your command.

You will indorse on the envelope: “ To be forwarded instantly on its receipt, day or night,” and be particular in your instructions to the bearer of dispatches, in case your information should be of moment to the commanding general. Your scouting parties should be of sufficient strength to scout during the whole night, and be strung along the beach from Sabine to the point where you will meet the scouts from this end.
You will inform this office of your success in filling your battalion, and state how many companies you have now mustered into the service, and the progress of those in process of formation.
I inclose a paragraph from one of our papers, containing the particulars of the surprise on board the Yacht.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Col. H. E. McCulloch,
Comdg. BepH of Texas, San Antonio, Tex. :
Sir : I have nothing new to report as to the movements of the enemy. My spies report that there are sixteen companies at Fort Craig and three within 30 miles of the fort, and that every effort is being made to enlist the Mexicans, who are much divided on the subject of making war upon Texans or of taking any part in the war at all. There exists, too, disaffection among the regular troops, who have not been paid, many of them for one year and a half. There is a large train at Craig and quantities of supx>lies are being hauled there. All this would indicate that the enemy intend to make a move of some sort. I shall have them watched closely, and, should they come down, I have my supplies at Bliss, and transportation ready to move it down to Quitman or Davis, if necessary. I shall, with liiy mounted force, push for Santa Fe, and hold the country until the arrival of General Sibley.
A party of citizens from California, who have joined my forces, report great excitement in Southern California. They know of no troops marching for Arizona, but say that Fort Yuma is being strongly reenforced. I am convinced that a strong force stationed in Western Arizona would enable us to get hundreds of good Southern men, wTell armed and mounted, who are anxious to join our cause, and this would enable us to watch Sonora, and prevent United States troops from crossing that State, and, what is of importance, open communication with Guaymas and other ports on the Pacific, where we must, of necessity, get most of our supplies.
I will keep you advised of all matters here, and act as circumstances may direct.
I have the honor to be, respectfully,
JOHN R. BAYLOR,

San Antonio, Tex., November 11,1861. General Hebert, Commanding Department of Texas:
Sir: I have a commission to raise for the Confederate service an infantry company, to rendezvous at or near Victoria, and drill until spring, unless the coast is invaded, and wish to raise a company for the above-mentioned service, but find it hard to get Texans to go into infantry companies. They say they will go mounted, but no other way 5 that is, a majority say so. 1 can get a good company among the Federal prisoners that are now at Camp Verde, provided they could get certificates from the mustering officer, or some other officer properly authorized, that the Confederate States would pay what is due them by the old Government. They would nearly all to a man join the Southern Army, and there are about 350 of them. If they can get certificates from the Southern Government for their back pay, you will oblige me much by letting me know, and to authorize the mustering officer, or some one, to give them their certificates after they shall have been mustered into the Confederate service.

Chief Quartermaster’s Office,
Galveston, Tex., November 16,1861.
Respectfully returned to the general commanding for his consideration. The prisoners now at Camp Verde have from $150 to $300 due each. The Adjutant and Inspector General of the Army was consulted upon the subject of paying the prisoners what was due them by the United States. He replied that no appropriation had been made for such purpose, and that they could not be paid. But he was inclined to the belief that the Government would pay them after the war, provided they enlisted and served faithfully. No one, therefore, can give the pledge demanded by the prisoners. My opinion is that the large sums due the prisoners of war at Camp Verde ought not to be paid; that their services would not justify it. They have been solicited frequently to enter our service, and have declined. They have manifested much bitterness against our cause.

retake them. They discharged the duty with prudence and propriety. A copy of Captain Nolan’s report is inclosed. I shall send the prisoners to San Antonio with the train, which will return within a few days.
I have strong hopes of being able to recapture Colonel Anderson. A Lieutenant Williams, Second U. S. Cavalry, is reported to have been in Matamoras two days ago. I have spies on his track.
The Mexicans of Zapata County, who refused allegiance to the Confederate Government, are likely to give trouble. They are backed by a strong party in Guerrero, who avow the intention to take service with the North, should Mr. Lincoln send an invading force to the Rio Grande. They are waiting an opportunity to make a descent upon the loyal citizens living on this bank of the river, and, should the mounted force be removed, they will do much mischief. The recent attempt is an evidence of their hostility. The prompt action of Captain Brewin checked them. For further particulars you are respectfully referred to his report. In regard to the property mentioned, I shall call the attention of the Confederate authorities to the fact, and let them take the proper steps in the matter.
I have endeavored to avoid all chances of collision with the Mexican authorities, to prevent giving them offense, and to preserve neutrality between the contending parties. To effect these objects I issued an order, and forwarded the portion concerning Mexican affairs to Colonel Capistrom. I forward a copy of the order, of the note, and of Colonel Capistrom’s answer 5 also a copy of the order placing Lieutenant Lively on duty as post adjutant.*
The companies of Captains Wilkie and Creuzbar will arrive to-morrow7. The mounted companies are encamped at Rancho Viejo, 7 miles distant. They are in. one camp, for the purpose of exercising them in the battalion drill.

Headquarters Department of Texas,
Galveston, November 15, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va. :
Sir : I have the honor to report that under the apprehension of an invasion by the enemy at any time, and owing to the great distance of this department from General Headquarters, I have taken the responsibility of calling into service troops for the defense of the State. I have experienced great difficulty in regard to arms and ammunition, although the troops now in service form hardly one-half of the number I think necessary to act simply on the defensive. Men also, I am sorry to say, are now more difficult to get, especially for the war. There are now over 5,000 troops in service.
I have taken the liberty, it being a matter of absolute necessity, of appointing, subject to the approval of the President, the field officers to the regiments mustered into service and such staff officers as were necessary. I was also compelled to give temporary appointments to persons to secure their services on engineer and special duty, all of which is, of course, subject to the approval or disapproval of the President; the commissons subject to being canceled at any time, and troops disbanded by his order. I have the honor to inclose a list of officers appointed as above for the approval of the President.
Commander W. W. Hunter, C. S. Navy, ordered to report to the general commanding this department, I assigned to the immediate command of the naval defenses, such as they are, of the port and bay of Galveston. Upon his application and representation of an urgent necessity, I authorized him to employ such boats, propelled by steam or otherwise, as the service in his judgment rendered necessary. I am aware that the chartering of boats for this kind of service is rather expensive, but when it is considered that this city is on an island, connected with the mainland by only one railroad bridge, and that it is subject to a disaster similar to that of Port Hatteras, it seems that prudence would dictate that all proper precautions should be taken to get the troops off in the event of a necessity of abandoning or being driven from the island. There is no doubt but that the defense of Galveston, or any other point on this coast, in the event of a formidable attack, is a very difficult if not an impossible matter; yet an effort must be made in that direction, and this place held as long as possible. It is a cotton port, and if in the possession of the enemy would be a nucleus for the disaffected, of which there are, I am sorry to say, many in this State.

Some time since, being without means whatever, there being none in the department, I was compelled to apply to the citizens for an advance of money to commence certain field works and for purposes of absolute and immediate necessity to the service. This sum ($5,000) I shall direct the chief quartermaster to refund, and charge to the fortifications of Galveston. The proper vouchers will be forwarded to General Headquarters.
As a matter of necessity connected with the defense and possession of the island, I have directed the planking of the railroad bridge connecting with the mainland, so as to admit of the passage of troops.
The heavy guns, so long on the way, have not yet reached this place. I hav.e directed every exertion to be made to forward them to their destination.
I respectfully submit to the consideration of the Department and of the President the expediency of giving me one or two general officers in this department. My presence at the headquarters of the department, where, owing to the numerous posts in the command, business accumulates very rapidly and continually, is a matter of necessity; yet my duties have been so pressing and important on the coast, that I have not yet been able to find the time or opportunity to repair to San Antonio. A general officer I would assign, and the command fully justifies it, to the command of the troops on or near the sea-coast and another on the Eio Grande frontier, so soon as forces can be organized and sent to that part of the State.
J have the honor to transmit, for the information of the Department, copies of communications addressed by Lieutenant-Colonel Baylor, in command in Arizona, to Colonel McCulloch, copies of which I have also transmitted to Brigadier General Sibley, at San Antonio. *

Eio Grande, arising from what he understands to be the present insufficiency of the garrison at Fort Brown for its protection. Colonel Luekett, at present at this place, who has been traversing the country, using his utmost endeavors to recruit for that service, finds them rendered abortive by the very numerous authorizations to raise troops, issued from the War Department at Eichmond, for different periods of service, and, as conjectured, for more exciting fields of action. Under these circumstances, passing en route through Austin, Colonel Luekett has appealed to his excellency for that aid which he was well aware that, to the full extent of the ability of his excellency, the immense importance of the successful defense of Fort Brown would command from him.
Among the various means proposed for the accomplishment of this object, it has been suggested to his excellency, as the one most probably conducive to a.satisfactory result, should you concur in its expediency, vrould be for the Confederate Government to decline to receive into its service any more troops from that portion of the State lying west of the Colorado Biver other than those joining Luckett’s, Garland’s, and Terrell’s regiments, and such companies as shall be stationed in that district of country for its defense. His excellency is ever ready to place at. the disposal of the Confederate Government ail the resources of the State for the preservation of its soil from the polluting tread of a ruthless invader, and his ardent desire to witness the timeous concentration of an adequate force for the protection of the Lower Eio Grande, a region of country now of vital interest, has induced him to communicate to you the views that have been submitted to him.
Should you, general, deem these suggestions inexpedient, I am di-' rected by his excellency to inquire whether, in carrying out your matured plans for the defense of Fort Brown, his co-operation can be rendered available to the furtherance of their success.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector-General, C. S. Army:
General : I have the honor to report that on Monday next, the 18th instant, I shall move with my headquarters to assume in person the command of our forces in the Territory of Arizona, and to conduct the military operations there and in New Mexico.
Before proceeding on this distant field of duty it appears proper that I should briefly communicate to you such facts concerning my official transactions here and touching the present condition of my forces as may be necessary for the information of your office. On my arrival here, about the middle of August last, I confidently expected to be able to raise and organize my brigade within a very brief space of time, and to have been enabled by this date to have it actively employed in the accomplishment of the objects for which it was raised. Many unexpected circumstances, however, have occurred to defeat this expectation. In the first place, I was disappointed in not receiving from the executive of this State as efficient a co-operation as was desirable. This arose from no want of disposition or zeal on the part of Governor Clark to render every facility in his power for the rapid organization of the force called for. It was the consequence simply of the very ineffi-

[Chap. XI.
eient system of the State military organization to which the governor had recourse to supply the troops. He ordered a sufficient number of companies which had reported to him as organized to report to me for the service of this brigade, but the most of these companies had, as it appeared, either entirely disbanded, or their numbers had become diminished below the minimum of the Confederate service. The reliance, therefore, which was placed in this mode of raising the men caused the first serious delay.
In the second place, the designation by the governor of companies organized under the State law operated to deter other companies not so organized from offering their services to me, which many would have done at once but for the opinion, very generally prevalent, that the brigade would be filled by the companies ordered out by the governor. Although at the very earliest day that it became apparent that the companies ordered out by the governor could not be relied on, I at once resorted direct to the people themselves, yet it required some time to counteract the effects of the misplaced reliance upon the State system.
Another source of delay arose from the competition for men which grew out of the calls for the several regiments required for the service east of the Mississippi.
I enumerate these sources of delay simply to explain the unexpected detentions which I have encountered, and not as implying any imputations upon any one whatever.
Although I am advancing to the field of duty assigned me with the confident hope of being able to accomplish everything designed there by his excellency the President, yet it is proper that I should state that very great deficiencies still exist in the arms of my troops, notwithstanding every effort on my part to obviate them. Every company reported itself short of arms, and gave the sufficient reason that they were not to be procured in their respective sections, partly in consequence of the great reluctance of the people to allow the serviceable arms to be removed from the State, for the defense of whose coast it was generally believed they would shortly be required. The difficulty thus arising had to be surmounted in some manner. Wherefore, in virtue of the authority delegated to me in the written instructions of his excellency the President, I directed the purchase of serviceable fire-arms and the construction of lances. There not being a dollar in the hands of any of the disbursing officers of my command, I was necessitated to resort to the credit of the Government for these purchases. These liabilities are outstanding, and on the 13th of the present month I inclosed to the Chief of Ordnance the estimates of the funds necessary for their liquidation.
To another matter I desire to invite your attention. Shortly after my arrival here General Van Dorn was relieved from duty as commander of this department, and Col. Henry E. McCulloch was left in that position. Brigadier-General Hebert came within the limits of this department, but did not come on to its headquarters and assume the command, but up to very recently left Colonel McCulloch to act in that capacity, so far at least as the depots and military affairs of this place and section were concerned. Major Maclin, assistant quartermaster and acting ordnance officer of this department, left this place to meet General Hebert at Galveston, and still remains there. Colonel McCulloch shortly afterwards also left for the same purpose, and the intelligence was soon returned that he had been relieved of the command of the department by the general. The general has not yet come on here. The consequence of all this is that there is, and for the last two or three

weeks lias been, no officer within my reach to whom I could apply for the issues of ordnance stores absolutely necessary for my command. In this situation I assumed the responsibility of ordering and requiring from the subordinates in charge of the ordnance stores here the issuance of such ordnance, stores as were indispensable to my command and as could be spared from the service of the department itself. On assuming this responsibility I immediately communicated the fact to General Hebert, at Galveston, with the reasons and motives for my actions, but have as yet received no reply from him. Hot to have taken this responsibility would have been to incur another and an indefinite delay, which would have jirobably paralyzed my command for the winter, and would certainly have disabled me from arriving at El Paso, as I hope to do, in time to succor the small force there under Colonel Baylor, whose communication regarding an immediate attack by a greatly superior force I forwarded to you on the 8th instant.*
These facts will, I trust, vindicate me from any imputation of unwarrantable intrusion upon the powers of the department commander, wdiich I have been scrupulous to avoid.
The Fourth Begiment (Colonel Beily’s), being the first of this brigade, took up the line of march on the 22d of last month, and at last advices was making rapid progress. The Fifth Begiment (Colonel Green’s), being my second, took up the march on the 2d instant, and will make all possible dispatch. I hope to arrive at El Paso in time to overtake my advance corps. Colonel Steele’s regiment is just now completely organized, and will probably be able to march by the 20th instant.

am directed to state that the general commanding is fully aware of the position of Pass Cavallo and other passes on the coast in a like defenseless situation. The guns and material do not exist in the department to put the whole coast in a state of defense against a formidable attack. Everything that can will be done with the means available.
There are no engineer officers in the department under the control of the general commanding. He appointed and sent Major Slum to Pass Cavallo especially to do the things the letter calls for—to do all that could be accomplished with the forces and guns at that point, and dispose of them to the best advantage. Major Slum has some experience as an engineer officer, and the general commanding had no idea that the appointment would be unacceptable. He has no competent officer to send there as engineer. Can the citizens signing that communication recommend a competent officer ? Colonel Garland is instructed to visit Pass Cavallo, and report to headquarters if any favorable disposition of the forces under his command can be made in regard to its defenses. The general commanding would cheerfully visit Pass Cavallo in person, but it would only be to inform himself of matters which he already knows.

McCulloch, after which I will repair with all dispatch to Col. S. B. Maxey’s rendezvous, in the southwest corner of Lamar County. When I have finished the muster of his regiment I shall move directly to join my own regiment, which is ere this with General McCulloch, under the command of my lieutenant-colonel, J. J. Diamond, unless I shall receive different orders. Two of the regiments tendered the Confederate States by his excellency Governor Clark, of the State of Texas, to wit, CoL M. F. Locke’s and W. H. Parsons’, I learn, have marched in the direction of the coast, which service, I learn, has been tendered them by General Hebert, commanding the Department of Texas. I notified Locke and Parsons that I was ordered by your excellency to muster all troops tendered by his excellency the governor of the State of Texas into the service of the Confederate States, and to march them without delay to the command of Gen. Ben. McCulloch, in Missouri. I received no reply, but heard they (Locke and Parsons) marched on toward Galveston, disregarding the information I gave them.
I would ask leave to call the attention of your department to Forts Washita, Arbuckle, and Cobb. These posts are at the pres'ent unoccupied. ‘ Washita and Arbuckle are posts of considerable value, whilst Cobb is but a temporary alfair, yet at that immediate place are some 2,500 or 3,000 Indians, known as the Reserve Indians, the most of whom have been principally raised in Texas, know our country better than any one, and are susceptible of being made the most disagreeable and destructive enemies to our northwestern frontier—I mean Texas. These Indians are at Fort Cobb, and are unable to protect themselves against the depredations of the combined Comanches and Kiowas, with whom they (the reserve Indians) are and have been for a long time at war. Besides this you have no doubt been officially informed of the rupture between the Creek Indians. Though I learn that matters have been compromised and settled with the disaffected Creeks, yet I learn there are still some disaffected Indians of various tribes still hanging about the Cherokee Nation, and give to the Chickasaw Indians and the people of the northern portion of Texas a good deal of uneasiness, from their proximity to the Chickasaws and our people immediately on Red River. I learned the day before I left Red River, Grayson County, that there were at one place in the Cherokee Nation, on the Canadian River, 200 runaway and free negroes in regular drill, whose object is supposed to be hostile to the Confederates. If this be so, would not the circumstances justify a force being placed in these posts to keep down hostilities and protect the reserve Indians, and prevent them (the reserve Indians) from being trifled with by the Federals ? It has been said that some 500 of the jayhawkers were in camps with the disaffected Creeks—whether true or not I cannot say, though it is believed from the northern part of the State of Texas proper there have left for the Confederate Army several thousand troops, leaving but few, except those who have families.
There is a very considerable dread amongst our people on Red River on this account, as it might be justly said that we are now without any power intervening between Texas and the Creek Nation, and none between us and the wild Comanches except the reserve Indians, who will stampede at the first approach of the enemy. I desire in this to ask your determination, and, as you think proper, act in the premises.
With sentiments of high regard, I am, your obedient servant and friend,

[Chap. XI.
Galveston, Tex., November 17, 1861. Maj. Samuel Boyer Davis,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:
In obedience to an order from the commanding general, I proceeded to make an examination of the Rollover, and the practicability of the launches being transported across it, and the necessity of defending that point, and the best means of effecting this.
With the chartered steamer John F. Carr, drawing 2| feet of water (about that of a frigate’s launch), at a condition of the tide above the medium mark, I examined the water of East Bay, from Bolivar Point to the nearest approachable shore of the Rollover in that direction, which I found to be about 2 miles. The Carr there grounded in 2\ feet of water, bottom soft mud. From my own observation and the best information I could obtain from persons well acquainted with that locality, I learn that nothing drawing over 2Jfeet of water can approach the Rollover at East Bay sufficiently near to command it.
There are but two passes from the Rollover by water into Galveston Bay 5 one at Hanna’s Reef, and one near Smith’s Point. These have 2J feet of water at mean tide, and are so intricate that none but persons well acquainted with the locality, such as oystermen, &c., can find their way through. The Carr grounded three times, with the best pilot I could obtain. The persons reported to be best acquainted with these passes are residents of Bolivar, viz: Captain Atkinson and sons, Englishmen, both being residents of Texas ; Mr. John Hamshire and sons, Americans and Texans. The pilots who are best acquainted with these passes are James Reese and John Webster, who reside at Galveston. One of the passes alluded to can be defended by musketry at Smith’s Point. The other pass, at Hanna’s Reef, can be approached from Galveston Bay by a steamer drawing 5 feet of water. The extensive shoal adjacent to the Rollover at East Bay and the intricate navigation from thence to Galveston Bay render the passage of ships’ launches, or any boats not especially constructed for shoal waters, a very difficult matter.
I learn from persons said to be best acquainted with the waters adjacent to and seaward of the Rollover that there is deepest water off the Rollover nearest to the shore of any part of the coast from the Sabine to Galveston. A vessel drawing 11 feet of water can anchor within 300 or 400 yards, and ships’ launches, at mean tide, in a smooth sea, can come within 75 yards of the beach. There is a sand reef, extending from Bolivar Point along the coast beyond the Rollover, distant about 1 mile from the shore, on which there is at mean tide from 6 to 7 feet of water, inside of which, by Bolivar Point, there is a channel of 8 or 9 feet of water. The distance from Bolivar Point to the Rollover is about 18 miles. From Bolivar Point to the passage at Hanna’s Reef is about 7 miles. The highest point of land above the sea at the Rollover is said to be about 10 to 12 feet. The land is highest near the sea, and declines gradually towards East Bay for about 200 or 300 yards ; then a sudden fall and gradual slope to East Bay. The distance from the beach to East Bay is said to be about 650 yards. Water for ordinary use can be procured by a slight excavation 5 but good water cannot be procured nearer than 8 or 10 miles.
I am, very respectfullv,
WM. W. HUNTER,
Commander, 0. S. Navy.

Brig. Gen. P. O. Hebert, Galveston, Tex.:
Sir: I have had the honor to receive your letter of October 31. marked private, in regard to the condition of affairs in Texas. I thank you for this information, and assure you that the defense of the coast and frontiers of Texas, whenever they may be threatened, shall not be disregarded by the Government. You may confidently rely upon assistance and support whenever they may be needed. So much of your letter as referred to the deficiency of arms, ammunition, &c., I have submitted to the Chief of Ordnance for consultation, with directions that your wants should be as far as possible supplied. The want of arms is one which, unfortunately, we are not just now able to relieve, but I hope that supplies may be on hand in time to meet all the exigencies of your department. In regard to ammunition, the Chief of Ordnance informs me that the supply at the arsenal at San Antonio ought to be ample to supply all your immediate wants (for at least 15,000 men). You are therefore instructed to direct your requisitions to the ordnance officer there in charge. In the mean time it is well to continue to encourage the people to collect and preserve all their arms and ammunition and to rely as far as possible upon their own means of defense in case of attack. You may assure them, however, that their confidence in the Confederate Government shall not be disappointed, and that if threatened or invaded they shall not be left without assistance.
I am, respectfully, yours,

Dear Sir : There is a rumor in town, said by persons that pretend to know to be official, that 7,000 Federal troops had landed at Guaymas from California, destined to operate against Texas. It is also said that the governor has received official orders from the city of Mexico not to obstruct in any way whatever the passage of Federal troops over the territory of this State. I inform you of these rumors, fearing lest you may not have any advice of it, and also that you may convey to General Sibley the intelligence, that lie may act in the matter as. his judgment may dictate.

Galveston, Tex., November 22,1SG1. General P. O. Hebert, 0. S. A.:
In obedience to your verbal order of this day, directing me to state in writing the practicability of gunboats of the class represented to be in the enemy’s fleet being able to reach a position in Galveston Bay to command the bridge from Galveston Island to the mainland, I would respectfully state that a vessel drawing eight feet of water cannot get within 3 miles of the bridge, and one drawing seven feet of water cannot get within 2£ miles of the bridge, by the way of either the Pelican or Galveston channel. Six feet of water in high tide can be taken to the bridge. The enemy’s gunboats are reported to draw from eight to nine feet of water. He is however represented to have lighter-draught steamers, on which guns may be mounted. Any vessel capable of crossing Galveston Bar can pass at very long gun-shot range, by both Port Point and Pelican Spit, to about 4 miles above Pelican Spit. The enemy’s gunboats may therefore pass both Port Point and Pelican Spit with the battery at present mounted thereon. Although all the marks indicating the channel-way into Galveston Bay have been removed, the channel is well known to many persons who have been trading to this place, and doubtless the enemy may have the services of some of these.

[Maj. S. B. Davis:]
Major: I have the honor to report that, in accordance to instructions received from department headquarters, dated November 20,1861, I have visited the battery referred to, at Virginia Point, and find that it consists of a substantial earth wall, of some 12 feet at the crown and 20 feet at the base, extending about 70 yards on both sides of the railroad, and commanding the bridge at all approachable points by water. The armament consists of three 24-pounder guns and one 8-inch howitzer, all mounted on siege carriages, the platforms giving an angle of fire of 90 degrees. Two of the 24-pounders are now in position, and the remaining 24-pounders and the howitzer will be in position to day. The amount of ammunition on hand at the time is as follows: One hundred and seventy-three rounds of powder, 113 rounds of shot, and 18 shells, fixed. The powder magazine is situated 40 yards behind the parapet, 15 feet square by 7 high. It is well built, with a bomb-proof roof, and is not exposed to a fire of round shot, as it has the same height as the parapet.
In conclusion, I would state that I have consulted with Capt. J. Kel-lersburg, and we are of the opinion that the battery will be ready by Monday to do good and effective service$ but at the same time would suggest that at least two guns of a longer range than those there at present be placed at this point as soon as practicable.

[Maj. S. B. DAYIS:]
Sir : I beg to call your attention to some matter of information that may be of service to the Government at this time. California is on the eve of a revolution. There are many Southern men there who would cheerfully join us if they could get to us, and they could come well armed and mounted. I would ask permission to get all such men as choose to join us, and would further ask that some arrangement for the purchase of horses in California be made. I could now buy the best of horses there for less than $50 per head, and there are many Southern men who would sell them for Confederate bonds. Another thing I take the liberty of suggesting is, that a force be placed in Western Arizona, to watch the landing of United States troops at Guaymas, that they may not pass through Sonora to invade us. A party of Californians have just arrived, and report that there are no troops on the road at this time, but that the United States Government was trying to raise them for the purpose of invasion, and I am reliably informed that the Government of Mexico has sent orders to the governor of Sonora to allow the passage of United States troops through that State, and agents are in Sonora buying corn and supplies for the United States troops. I have thought proper to furnish you with this information and leave you to act upon it.

Sir: Information has been given me by Col. Charles Livenskiold, the Texas State commissioner, that a company of infantry, commanded
by Capt.-------Morgan, was mustered into the Confederate service for
the war, as one of the companies designed for this regiment (the Third Texas Infantry, Colonel Luckett), at Corpus Christi. This company, I understand, has received no orders to report at this post, but still remains at Corpus Christi. There is also at that point another company (artillery), both of them wrell armed. As I conceive that one company

﻿150	OPERATIONS IN TEX., N. MEX., AND ARIZ. [Chap. XI.
at that point is equally as capable of defending it as two (both not being sufficient against a superior force), I would respectfully request that orders may be sent to Captain Morgan to join his regiment at this post immediately. He is, I understand, amply provided with transportation and camp and garrison equipage. We have at this post but two infantry companies (one of them composed entirely of Mexicans), which are so wholly inadequate to the necessities of the post as scarcely to need attention being drawn to the fact ; yet, sir, I deem it my duty to urge, in the strongest terms, the necessity for the completion of the regiments and their assembly at this post in the shortest space of time. With the full force destined, or intended, for this point, I cannot but feel that in their raw and unorganized condition they are insufficient—how much the more so this is the case with the force now here you can well judge. Sir, I am so deeply impressed with the urgent necessity of the full force intended for this post being assembled and organized, that I feel at a loss to convey my impressions to you. In connection with this subject it will readily occur to your ffiind that means are requisite to provide for the force. Even with the small force now here, it is with no little difficulty that arrangements are made to obtain absolute necessaries, and even of these there are many things of which the troops are wholly destitute. Nearly everything which has been furnished the troops on this frontier in the past has been purchased on credit, and the hope of means being provided at any early day has been so often repeated as almost to produce a smile when expressed. Sir, the credit of the Government has been seriously endangered, and unless money can be had in a short time will be utterly ruined. Almost everything needed could be had here now, were we provided with the means of paying for purchases. Without money it is with the greatest difficulty that anything can be had 5 besides, everything purchased upon credit is at a cost outrageously high. Arms and other munitions can now be had in Mexico, but if not purchased soon (and money is needed to do so), the difficulties expected with Spain will utterly preclude the possibility of accomplishing it.
In my last report to headquarters I informed you that General J. M. I. Carvajal was in close proximity to Matamoras, and that an attack was anticipated. I now have to inform you that on the morning of the 20th instant General Carvajal, with a force of 1,800 or 2,000 men, commenced an attack on Matamoras, defended by General Guadaloupe Garcia, with a force of about 1,600 men. The contest has continued up to the present time, with the excex>tion of two armistices, the first of twenty-four hours, to permit the withdrawal of foreign consuls, women, children, and non-combatants 5 the second, of forty-eight hours, terminating at 2 p. m. to-day, for a conference, having for its object a settlement of the difficulties. It has resulted, I understand, in 110 favorable adjustment, and hostilities have been resumed. Much valuable property has been destroyed, the principal portion of which, so far as I can learn, belonging to foreigners. I have endeavored to preserve as strict neutrality as practicable, though I have extended several favors, which I deemed dictated and demanded by feelings of humanity. The best x>ossible feeling exists at the present hour between both of the belligerent powers and myself, and they are equally gratified, or so express themselves, at the neutral position I have assumed and the measures taken to preserve it.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Galveston, Tex., December 2, 1861. General P. O. Hubert, C. S. A.:
In obedience to your verbal order of this day, I have obtained the best information in my power touching the means of defense of the mouth of the Trinity River.
There are three passes in the Trinity River; two of them will not admit the passage of anything but small boats, drawing from 2 to 2£ feet of water, and these are much obstructed by logs and shoals. The third and main pass is through a canal, the entrance to which would be under the guns of a battery, placed at Chambersia, or the same place, called Anahuac. Through this canal there is about 4J feet of water at mean tide. Anahuac is on the mainland, on the east side of the bay, and there is a good road to Liberty and Beaumont. A battery at Anahuac, supported by 500 infantry, would seem to be a sufficient force to command the entrance to Trinity River. A steamer suited to the navigation of the Trinity River would be able to communicate with Liberty, distant about 25 miles by land and from 30 to 40 miles by water. Navigation above Liberty is practicable only in high stages of water, which is usually from about the middle of January. The condition of water will admit of navigation to Magnolia, 125 miles from the town of Sabine, which is distant about 40 miles from Natchitoches, on Red River.

Maj. Samuel Boyer Davis,
Asst. Adj. Gen., Dep’t of Texas, Galveston, Tex.:
Sir : It is with regret that I have to notify the commanding general of the lamentable condition of the forces at this post. There are but two companies of infantry here. One (Captain Parker’s) is composed wholly of Mexicans, and, like all their countrymen, are susceptible to bribes and corruption, and cannot be depended upon. No less than 14 men from this company alone have deserted and passed over the river into Mexico, taking part in the difficulties now unhappily existing in Tamaulipas. The other company (Captain Buquor’s) and Captain Marmion’s artillery company are composed partly of Mexicans, but chiefly of foreigners, who are old soldiers and deserters from the old Federal Army. With few exceptions they are a class of men in whom no dependence whatever can be placed. A few dollars and a little whisky is quite sufficient to corrupt and entice them away. Five of these men (belonging to Captain Marmion’s artillery company) have

## p. 153 (#161) ############################################

also deserted and crossed into Mexico, notwithstanding I have taken every precaution in my power to prevent it.
I make this statement not only from a sense of duty, but for the purpose of requesting that the other companies raised to complete this regiment may be selected and composed of an entirely different class of men; that, if enough companies cannot be found to volunteer for this service (the Eio Grande), the commanding general may be induced to send down some of the companies stationed in the reserve camps. We need men of character and intelligence, who have an interest in the success of our cause and country, and who cannot be bribed or enticed to desert.
I have strong hopes of being able to arrest some of those who have deserted. Indeed, I now have one, against whom charges will be preferred and forwarded without delay.

Sir : In compliance with Special Orders, No. 146, dated Headquarters Department of Texas, Galveston, November 16,1861, which was received at Gamp Henry McCulloch, November 28, 1861, I have the honor to report that, upon a thorough reconnaissance of this place as well as the coast between this and Pass Cavallo, in my judgment no disposition can be made of the forces under my command in their present state of organization and appointment, so as to defend any portion of the immediate coast or afford any material aid in preventing vessels from entering this bay. This place is pretty much abandoned, and I believe such is the case with most all the towns and villages adjacent to the coast. The point selected by Captain Shea to establish his battery is, in my opinion, the proper position to command the entrance to the bay, and, if properly constructed, under the supervision of an experienced engineer officer and suitably appointed, could be made to accomplish that object 5 but in its present condition it is totally inadequate for this purpose, and should be immediately withdrawn, or put in a condition, not only to command the Pass, but to be capable of defending itself from attack by sea or land. On account of its isolated jiosition it is totally cut off from any support from any quarter whatever, and, if attacked with heavy metal or a superior force, either by sea or land (and it is open to attack either way or both at the same time), it must inevitably fall into the hands of the enemy, as I can conceive of no possible way of withdrawing them in the presence of an enemy, on account of several impassable bayous.
I also inclose a report of ordnance and ordnance stores pertaining to Captain Shea’s command. The captain appears to be an energetic and industrious officer, and his command is in a fair state of discipline and instruction.

Sir : It is evident, from the movements of the enemy, that they are preparing for an attack on this place. Should a night attack be attempted, it will most likely be made on Fort Point, Pelican Spit, and South Battery. You will therefore take such precautions as to prevent surprise, by doubling your guards and throwing out pickets in various directions to the water’s edge. It is confidently expected that you will successfully defend yourself against any attack by boats. But should numbers overwhelm you, you will destroy your guns by spiking, or otherwise blow up your ammunition, set fire to your buildings, and retreat in an orderly manner towards the headquarters of Nichols’ regiment, on the strand. Additional vedettes are thrown out to protect the telegraph line—to keep it intact Should appearances indicate attack, you will immediately telegraph to me at the office of E. B.

I have personally investigated the circumstances attending the subject-matter of his communication, and I feel compelled to report our situation as a truly deplorable one. Flour and corn cannot be had at all on this side of the Rio Grande. All that we can get comes from the other side (Mexico), and, under the most favorable condition of circumstances the supply is limited and precarious. Both of these articles have to be brought from the interior of Mexico and from great distances. During the present disturbed state of the country the risk of

transportation is so great that it is with the utmost difficulty the common carriers can be prevailed upon to incur it, nor will they do so at all for paper money nor upon credit. They must be paid cash in specie. The quartermaster and commissary departments are wholly out of the articles mentioned; besides, many other small things necessary to the health, comfort, and subsistence of the troops, which can only be had for cash, and at best in but small quantities. There are now in the command to be provided for about 700 men and over 400 horses, and other troops expected every hour. The quartermaster and commissary departments are without a dollar and without credit. The officer in charge of these departments is not even authorized to draw a draft by means of which money can be obtained, nor can money be borrowed. Representations of the most urgent character have repeatedly been made, both orally and by letter, of the great necessity existing that this post should be supplied with funds sufficient to meet the requirements of the troops, and of the utter impossibility of accomplishing anything without them. Still we are unsupplied.
The credit of the Government here is almost wholly lost. The statement that money is soon expected elicits a smile of incredulity, if not a sneer of contempt.
The enemy has already made his appearance, as there is a steamer of war lying off Brazos Santiago (she arrived on the afternoon of the 5th instant), and others daily expected. I may be required to move the whole command at any moment to meet the enemy, if a landing cannot be x>revented. Under these circumstances, and feeling deeply impressed by the necessities of the case, I have taken the responsibility of ordering Oapt. John A. Settle, assistant commissary of subsistence and acting assistant quartermaster, Provisional Army, 0. S., to draw a draft for $10,000 on the assistant treasurer at New Orleans, or upon any other Government agent at that place holding public funds, and negotiate the same forthwith, if possible. I have therefore to request that the commanding general will give the requisite orders to the chiefs of the departments, in order that the draft may be properly met. I have no hesitation in stating that, if protested, not another dollar or one pound of any article can hereafter be procured here without the money is paid in hand; hence the necessity for immediate action.

At about 5 o’clock she came to anchor off the East, or I)ecrow?s, Channel, and 2 miles from shore. On the 8th, at noon, she made sail, and steered westward, running close to the bar. When nearly opposite our position, and 3 miles distant, I caused my four 24-pounder battery to open on her. She was struck two or three times by our shot. She put about after the first round of the battery and steered seaward. She showed no colors up to this time. She is standing off and on, in sight.
I trust the commanding general will give me instructions relative to the present position of our battery, property, &c. I only have sufficient mules here to carry one piece to the rear. We fired sixteen shots.

Captain, Commanding at Pass Cavallo, Texas.
Headquarters, Camp Henry McCulloch,
December 14,1861.
Maj. Samuel Boyer Davis,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., DepH of Texas, Galveston) Tex. :
Sir : I have the honor to report, for the information of the commanding general of the department, that I have just returned from Captain Shea’s camp, at Pass Cavallo. The captain is making every arrangement in his power to secure a retreat, if it should become necessary. He is establishing ferries across the principal bayous for this purpose. Upon a second reconnaissance I suggested to the captain the propriety of taking up a position some 2 miles farther up the Pass, as, in my judgment, he would have the same, if not a better, command of the channel, as well as being out of the range of guns from the sea. The vessel reported was still there up to the time I left. She lies off and on, and moves up and down the coast, never getting entirely out of sight of the entrance to the bay, and it is my impression she is looking out for two vessels that left that port for Mexico some time since with cotton, and are expected to return about this time laden with coffee. While I was at Captain Shea’s camp she fired some eight or ten guns, but we were unable to ascertain the object of her firing, but judge she was merely practicing. At the time of firing she was lying off the coast, some 10 or 12 miles above Decrow’s Point. With a good glass, from the top of the light-house, we could distinctly see the flashes, as well as hear the reports, of the guns. The night I spent at Captain Shea’s camp a Mexican or Spaniard was shot under very suspicious circumstances. He was taken by a party of mounted volunteer patrols while in the act of launching a pilot’s yawl near one of the pilot stations, a short distance above camp. He was brought in and turned over to the guards, and in attempting to escape was shot, but was alive up to the time of my departure.
I directed Captain Bupley’s company to take position at Saluria, to guard the ferry across the main bayou and to afford any other assistance in his power. The other three companies, under Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson, took position at Indianola. I have ordered a detachment of mounted men (1 commissioned, with 2 non-commissioned officers and 15 privates) from Captain Beaumont’s company to report to Captain Shea for duty. 1 did not order a large detachment down, on account of the difficulty of procuring forage and water) and, as 1 do

not apprehend an immediate attack, I have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson to return to this place with his command.
I also beg leave respectfully to call the attention of the commanding general to the fact that there are two assistant quartermasters on duty with this command, which, in my judgment, is an unnecessary expense. Captain Wolfe, quartermaster, appointed for the Sixth Regiment of Texas Infantry, having received his commission and given his bonds, is competent to perform all the duties required in that department.

Sir : I have the honor to forward you a statement of the disposition of the “ Federal drafts” captured at the surrender of Fort Fillmore, amounting in all to $9,500, $5,500 of which were on the assistant treasurer of New York. The other $4,000 were drawn on the assistant treasurer at Saint Louis, Mo. I sent the drafts by Mr. William McGrorty to New York for collection, which resulted as follows: $4,500 were paid by the assistant treasurer, New York $ the other $1,000 draft was not paid, Mr. Cisco, the assistant treasurer, stating that the drawer had no funds in the Treasury to his credit. The $4,000 draft on assistant treasurer Saint Louis were left by Mr. McGrorty in New York for collection. Saint Louis being under martial law, Mr. McGrorty felt it unsafe to go there in person. I have since received no information if the drafts have been collected or not. I have paid out of the above amount the following sums, viz: $500 was claimed by Lieutenant Plummer, acting assistant quartermaster, U. S. Army, as private funds, which I refunded him. Four hundred and eleven dollars paid Samuel J. Jones, sutler at Fort Fillmore, for corn delivered the quartermaster, IT. S. Army, and not paid for by the United States. The corn was in store at Fort Fillmore when the post was abandoned, and Lieutenant Plummer, acting assistant quartermaster, certified to Mr. Jones7 claim after the capture of the Federal troops at San Augustine Springs. Three hundred dollars I have paid Mr. McGrorty for part of his expenses to New York in prosecuting the collection of said drafts. The balance $3,289. I send you herewith the quartermaster’s receipts for that amount. The drafts on Saint Louis, left in New York for collection, I will duly account for when informed of the payment thereof.

Dear Sir : I have the honor to report that, on receipt of your telegram and order on Maj. J. B. Likens, commanding at Sabine Pass, received on the 8th instant, p. m., I at once proceeded to Beaumont with a sufficient force of engineers, machinists, laborers, &c., to accomplish the object. The agents of the company there were loth to give any assistance, as they deemed the town (Sabine Pass) and the railroad perfectly safe from any foray of the enemy. Major Likens promptly co-operated with me in removing the rolling stock up to a point of temporary safety and within reach of protection. The company have so neglected and abused their engines that they are comparatively useless until in the hands of skillful mechanics for a day or two. The rolling stock in working order, or which I putin rolling order, consists of seven platform cars and three house cars. I also found eighty-four wheels and axles, and all the furnishings to put them up, sufficient for twenty-one cars, which would give capacity in order for the transportation of from 1,000 to 1,500 men. I removed these wheels and axles 21 miles north of Beaumont. I also towed one engine out of order to a distance of 6 or 7 miles north of Beaumont and the other engine I removed north of Taylor’s Bayou (a draw-bridge), at which point it broke down or failed to operate. On each engine I left a detail of two men, with a sergeant in charge, as a guard, furnished by Major Likens, and to report to him. On my return here yesterday I dispatched my master machinist, with some men, to put one engine in order and fix up a train, so that either the Eastern Texas Bailroad Company or the military authorities could have some transportation facilities in case of emergency. I am sorry to report that the employes of the road, although they volunteered to assist in the accomplishment of the end desired, evinced a disposition to try and so injure the only engine they had in order to move as to defeat the securing of the rolling stock, and, by carelessness or malignity, partly succeeded; but by this time it is all rectified by my men. Should a more detailed report be desired, I will furnish it cheerfully.
I beg to make two suggestions in the matter. First, that a train be put in order on the road, either to be at the order of the commanding officer at Sabine Pass or the railroad company, subject to his protection and control. Second, that a sufficient amount of rails be shipped from Galveston to Liberty (which the company have in Galveston), to enable them to lay their track up to the junction with the Texas ana New Orleans Bailroad at Beaumont, which will give you rail connection from Galvestpn and this place to Sabine Pass. It will only require about two hundred tons of rails, and the connection can be made in five or six days after the arrival of iron at Liberty.
I remain, yours, with much respect,

Dear Sir : Your highly esteemed favor of the 17th instant came to my hands on the 21st. Contents duly noted. I also had the honor of seeing your communication made to the adjutant-general, under date of the 21st ultimo. Owing to an error, it did not receive my attention until after the receipt of your last.
I have had, in addition to your letters, the pleasure of a communication from Col. H. E. McCulloch, of 21st instant, in relation to the same subject-matter, which I answer to-day and direct to Galveston.
It is my earnest desire to co-operate with you in the most efficient and speedy mode to concentrate troops under your orders, so that an adequate force may be thrown in the face of the enemy and his assaults beaten back, no matter in what quarter made.
As you justly remark, the irregular manner in which individuals have been authorized to raise troops has created the greatest confusion throughout the State. It is beyond the power of the State authorities to control its military force, and just when we so much need a i>erfect

﻿160	OPERATIONS IN TEX., N. MEX., AND ARIZ. [Chap. XI.
system in moving the State troops we find ourselves almost helpless, unless the masses will come forward and voluntarily enroll themselves at the call of their country. Every exertion should, and I feel fully satisfied will, be made by you to successfully defend the State against every effort of the enemy.
Permit me here to suggest to you that I am possessed of unofficial information that the regiments of Colonels Locke and Maxey are yet within the State, in Upshur County, and preparing to go into winter quarters. These troops are beyond my control. Can you subject them to your orders ? The winter can be very profitably spent by them on the coast ; much more so than on Bed Biver. I confess my ignorance on this subject, and only suggest it, that you, with your superior knowledge, may take such action as is deemed appropriate. If, however, the power rests in you, I would urge that they be ordered to the coast.
While I am fully aware that it has been the policy of the Government to receive troops only when they enlist “for the war,” yet tfiis policy has been in some instances varied from so far as to receive men for twelve months. And I now approach you, sir, for the purpose of obtaining your consent to encroach still further on that policy. If it were not for the peculiar circumstances which surround us, I should not for a moment entertain the idea of placing men in the field on other terms of enlistment than those originally desired by the Government; but, from various causes, it is now very evident that the requisite number of men cannot be obtained to defend the country during the winter, if enlistments for the war are required, or even if men for twelve months are demanded.
The legislature, following the recommendations of the executive, has enacted a stringent law on the subject of the military, and, as soon as an organization can be effected, every able-bodied man in the State will be forced to discharge his duty, if unwilling to do so. But, sir, I am compelled to say that this organization cannot be completed before the danger of an invasion has passed for the present winter.
In view of all the facts and circumstances before me, I suggest, sir, that you receive into the service of the Confederate States, for the term of six months, a sufficient number of men to successfully defend the State) and, for the accomplishment of this purpose, I would further suggest that you make a requisition on the executive for such number of six-months’ volunteers as will, in your opinion, be amply able to sustain you in your plans and measures. So far as I am concerned I would much prefer that your requisition should call for more than are necessary than not enough. With such a requisition made on me, stating the number of troops wanted, the arm of service to which they will belong, the term of enlistment, and the places of rendezvous, I feel every confidence that the requisition can be speedily filled with volunteers.
I do not wish to be under the necessity of calling out the State troops as State troops, independent of the military of the Confederate States, which must be my excuse tor being urgent in my insisting that you receive six-months’ volunteers for the defense of the State. I am fully convinced that one of the two courses must be pursued, either to receive six-months’ volunteers into the service for the defense of the State, or else the necessity will devolve on me to call out State troops for that purpose. In the latter case the troops would be in a great measure inefficient for the want of arms, ammunition, and drill, and militia defeats might be the consequence, in addition to the conflicts and want

## p. 161 (#169) ############################################

﻿Chap. XI.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.----CONFEDERATE.	161
of harmony between the State and Confederate service. These, among other reasons, induce me to insist that, for the present, you receive the six-months’ volunteers, and control them entirely independent of the State, as you do those now under your command.
I entertain the hope, sir, that when we succeed in organizing the State troops under the late enacted law, enlistments will go on with alacrity and rapidity for the terms the exigencies of the service may demand ; for I do not believe that the Texan people will so far forget themselves as to wait to be drafted. But, sir, I am firmly convinced that, for the present, you must rely on volunteers for the term of six months.
The great importance of this matter induces me to expect an early reply.
I have the honor, sir, to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
By order of the governor :
WM. M. WALTOX, Private 8ecJy.
Executive Department,
Austin, Tex., December 27, 1861. Hon. John H. Reagan, Richmond, Va.:
Dear Sir : Your position as one of the Cabinet induces me to request that you will (in addition to what you may be called upon to do under the letter herein inclosed, a copy of which has been sent to each of the delegation from Texas) hand one of the copies of the “frontier law” to the Secretary of War, and use your influence to have action on it at the earliest possible day.
This law has been framed in exact accordance with the wishes of the frontier people, as expressed through their representatives, and I feel well convinced that it will be beneficial in its workings, and will give full and ample protection to a much suffering portion of our country.
The force now on the frontier does not give protection, nor is it believed that any other system than that of daily patrolling a line from Bed River to the Rio Grande will accomplish the object. Experience has demonstrated that this will do so.
There will be no heavier charge on the Confederacy by placing this particular regiment in the field than by permitting the one there now to remain. The McCulloch regiment can be drawn away and placed on the coast or sent to do service anywhere necessity demands it.
It is particularly desired that action should be taken immediately, so that movements may be made here to correspond with the necessities of the frontier.
As fast as companies are organized under this law they should take their place on the “ patrol line,” and a corresponding number of the rangers now on the frontier drawn oft* into other service.
Your energetic action in this matter will be greatly advantageous to the frontier of Texas.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. R. LUBBOCK.

legislature now in session, and approved by the governor on the 21st of the present month.
In calling your attention to the act my duty under the law would he discharged, and at the same time would as fully elicit your energetic} co-operation in seeking to have the regiment accepted by the Confederate Government as I would be able to do by any argument I may make 5 but, sir, you must excuse me for urging you to the promptest action in the direction of moving the Government to a favorable consideration of the matter. Our frontier demands a peculiar force for its defense, and nothing less than the measures set on foot by this act will secure protection to the people in that region; besides, if this regiment is placed on the frontier, as is desired, one of the regiments now there can be safely withdrawn and ordered into other service; and the settlers all through that section, being thus secured against Indian depredations, will flock to the coast service, where they are much needed at this time.
The simple effect of the reception of this regiment will be to give great confidence to the people and secure protection to the property on the frontier, and at the same time be the means of throwing into the service of the Confederacy many men from that section who are now forced to remain at home because of the daily insecurity in which they live. Your intimate knowledge of that people will fortify you in urging with the utmost zeal the reception of this regiment, knowing that by so doing you will be attempting to advantage and benefit a large and meritorious portion of your fellow-citizens.
Hoping, sir, that you will at short date from this time be able to advise this department that this regiment has been received by the Government of the Confederate States, I have, sir, the honor to remain, with the greatest respect, your very obedient servant,
F. E. LUBBOCK.

Sir : Since my last I have had more time to investigate the state of affairs on this frontier and to examine into the condition of the command assigned me for its defense, and I regret to inform you that they are deplorable enough. The difficulties now existing in the neighboring Mexican State of Tamaulipas have so wholly changed the commercial condition of affairs from what they were but a few months since, as to deprive us of many facilities upon which we could then, with a reasonable certainty, calculate and depend. The civil war extends over almost the entire State, and renders intercourse and transportation precarious and unsafe; so much so, that it is with extreme difficulty that the usual public carriers can be prevailed upon to incur the risk of bringing even the necessary supplies for subsistence, and when they do so, it is at large rates and in but small quantities. The presence of

﻿Chap. XI.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—CONFEDERATE.	165
large hostile forces in such immediate proximity to this post increases our embarrassment in this respect tenfold, as they seize, confiscate, and consume nearly everything.
The quartermaster and commissary of subsistence has used every exertion to procure forage and subsistence; but to obtain more than enough for a few days at a time has been impossible. There is no certainty at any time that a sufficient supply will be on hand for the ensuing issue. To-day we have not a single barrel of flour on hand and not more than a few days’ forage, nor can I now see any probability of obtaining more. I have therefore directed him to make a requisition on San Antonio for such stores. These difficulties further embarrass us by paralyzing the efforts of such friendly merchants as are disposed to aid and assist us, much of their means and nearly the whole of their usual facilities being for the time completely deranged. The want of money has, too, been most discouraging and nearly fatal to our interest, the credit of the Government being wholly gone ; and, although now supplied with Confederate notes for the quartermaster and commissary departments, they are almost wholly useless, as but few are willing to take them, and those who do invariably charge from 25 to 80 per cent, higher prices for what we purchase than would be the case had we gold and silver; besides, no other currency is at all available in Mexico, from whence we must procure the principal articles needed. Many things needed by us might possibly be procured were we supplied with specie, but those who possess them will not incur the risks attendant upon their delivery when they know we have only paper to give in exchange. These facts, I find from the correspondence of Lieutenant-Colonel Bu-chel, have been so forcibly urged upon the attention of the commanding general, that it would seem to be almost useless to reiterate them 5 but 1 feel so deeply impressed with the certainty that, should an enemy land, these circumstances will so militate against us as to almost compel a withdrawal to the interior.
The hope of a final adjustment of the difficulties in and about Mata-moras seems now as distant as ever. For several days they have had but little or no firing, but to-day, I understand, Carvajal has received re-enforcements and a new supply of ammunition. We shall therefore for the next few days be annoyed by their fusillade, which will, as heretofore, result only in noise and smoke.
The desertions from the command have been repeatedly reported by Lieutenant-Colonel Buchel, and since my arrival several have occurred. The condition of the troops is such, that I must candidly confess I am not greatly surprised at their yielding to the inducements offered by the parties on the other side of the river. The most of them are but scantily clothed, and have received no pay; they know the state of the Government’s credit quite as well as I do myself, and also the difficulties attendant upon procuring supplies. They are fully aware of the inadequacy of the force now here to resist a force such as the enemy are likely to land with, of the unpopularity of the Bio Grande service, and of the difficulty heretofore experienced in raising additional troops. You cannot therefore, considering all these circumstances, avoid the conclusion at which I have arrived, that cause enough exists to discourage and dishearten them.
Permit me again to urge upon you the absolute necessity of sending forward as rapidly as possible additional infantry companies. We now have here three infantry and three artillery companies, but one of which (Captain Kampmann’s) is filled to the minimum established by law, and I see no probability of their being filled up unless recruits can be sent down from the interior.

It is also imperatively necessary that funds to pay off the troops should be furnished the quartermaster at as early a day as practicable. Until this is done, I fear it will be impossible to maintain a desirable degree of discipline and subordination, and to imbue them with an esprit de corps, so very essential to a successful and satisfactory performance of our duty.

Headquarters Third Reg-iment Texas Infantry,
Fort Brown, Tex., January 1, 1862.
Sir : I have the honor to inclose the written opinions of Lieutenant-Colonel Buchel, Major Gray, and all the captains composing the immediate command at this post, in reference to our ability to hold Port Brown with the present command and its resources. These opinions have been taken separately, and without any previous or subsequent conference among officers. Iso one knows my own convictions, intentions, or final resolves in the premises up to the present time. I shall not attempt to hold the fort unless you give me positive orders to that effect. I will immediately make my arrangements for the removal of everything not necessary for the defense of this immediate section, and without any regard whatever to the holding of Fort Brown. I desire the commanding colonel to send me positive instructions on this subject, as I anxiously await his determination in this matter. In the mean time, should the enemy present himself in force, I will send them to the Ringgold Barracks, the point I design sending them, unless instructed by you not to do so. Press of business prevents my having retained copies of these opinions. Please have them copied and forwarded to me.
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
P.‘ K LUCKETT,
Colonel, Commanding.

Brief of opinions as to tenableness of Fort Brown, near Brownsville, Tex.
Capt. H. Wilke, Provisional Army, Confederate States, describes the fort as a field work of six bastion fronts, its line of defense 950 yards, requiring a garrison of 2,000 men. It is in a very dilapidated condition. Present armament is five iron siege 24-pounders; two iron ship 18-pounders; six brass 12-pounders; two iron G-pounders (not mounted); four iron 8-inch siege howitzers; one 24-pounder brass howitzer; one 10-inch iron siege mortar, and is not deemed sufficient for defense. Estimated work to be done, to put the place in a state of defense, 500 laborers for three months. Capt. F. J. Parker, Third Infantry, C. S. Army, gives it as his opinion that the fort is untenable, on account of location. Col. P. N. Luckett does not agree with Captain Wilke as to the amount of labor required, but does not consider its defense advisable. Captains Marmion, Kampmann, and Buquor do not consider the fort tenable. Captain Creuzbar considers the fort tenable for fifteen or twenty days against five times the garrison, provided 5 days’ labor of said garrison is bestowed upon it.

General : I have the honor to report that in view of the importance of establishing satisfactory relations with the adjacent Mexican States of Chihuahua and Sonora, I have ordered Col. James Beily, Fourth Begiment Texas Mounted Volunteers, to proceed to the capitals of those States, for the purpose of delivering to their respective governors the communications which 1 have addressed to them, and of conferring with those officials in person upon the subjects of those communications.
On the 21st. day of December I forwarded to you copies of the principal communication above alluded to. I have now the honor of inclosing copies of my letters accrediting Colonel Beily to those functionaries, and also of my instructions to him in regard to the duties assigned him in this mission.
Colonel Beily left these headquarters for the city of Chihuahua on yesterday, the 2d instant. The result of this mission, when known, will be promptly communicated to you.

Your first duty will be to proceed to the city of Chihuahua and deliver

in person to the governor of that State the communication addressed to him by the general, of the contents of which you have already been apprised. In that communication it has of course only been practicable to explain to the governor the general outline of the policy and general nature of the objects which are at present in contemplation. To unfold that policy and to explain those objects in detail, to further their accomplishment, to counteract any adverse influence, and to obviate any possible objections are the chief and primary duties devolved upon you. The mode and manner of discharging this duty is of course left to your own judgment and discretion.
You will also call to the attention of the governor the exaction of duties by the custom-house officer at El Paso from citizens of this place, removing their goods, <fec., there for temporary security a few weeks since, and ask that such duties be remitted to the parties who paid them.
You will be accompanied by the volunteer aide-de-camp of the general, Capt. G. Dwyer, of whose zeal, intelligence, and accomplishments you can avail yourself in your intercourse with the officials with whom you will be brought in contact. This assistance you will find valuable in many respects, and his association, the general hopes, will prove an agreeable one to each.
Should a safe opportunity offer, you will report as early as possible the nature of the reception given you and the prospects of a favorable adjustment of the matters intrusted to your charge.
Should you, after discharging your mission at Chihuahua, arrive at the conclusion, from such information as you can there obtain, that it is expedient and promotive of the public interest for you to proceed to Sonora, you will do so. Otherwise you will arrange for the transmission to the governor of that State of the official communication of the general.
Upon the completion of your mission you will report in person to the general commanding.
I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

Maj. S. Maolin,
Acting Chief Commissary of Subsistence, San Antonio, Tex.:
Sir: Col. P. N. Luckett, commanding at Port Brown, informs that the difficulties now existing in the neighboring State of Tamaulipas, Mexico, have so wholly changed the condition of affairs from what they were a short time since as to deprive the command of the many facilities upon which they could with a reasonable certainty calculate. The civil war existing in the Mexican States renders intercourse and transportation precarious and unsafe. So much so, that the public carriers are prevailed upon with extreme difficulty to undertake the risk of bringing the necessary supplies for subsistence, and when they do, it is at a high price, and the supplies but small in quantity, and are frequently confiscated by the opposing forces in Mexico.
In consequence of this state of affairs the quartermaster and commissary of subsistence at Fort Brown has been unable to procure the necessary supplies for the troops. At the time Colonel Luckett wrote there wms no fiour on hand and no prospect of being supplied from day to day. He therefore directed that requisitions be made on San Antonio for the supply of his command.
Colonel Luckett further informs that the credit of the Government has suffered, and that Confederate notes are almost wholly useless, but few being willing to take them, and when they do, requiring an advance upon their usual prices of 25 and 30 per cent.; and, under the circumstances, it becomes necessary to supply the command at Fort Brown and other points on the Lowrer Rio Grande from the u general depot” at San Antonio; and the general commanding orders that this be done accordingly.

I have the pleasure to inform you that my reception by the governor and officials of state was of the most kind and agreeable nature, and not only by the State officials, both civil and military, but by many leading citizens. The best feeling exists in Chihuahua. My sudden departure prevented me, as your envoy, from receiving a public testimonial

of the kind feelings of the Chihuahuans which they were about to tender me.
Permit me to congratulate you, general, in having obtained the first official recognition of the Government of the Confederate States by any foreign power.
Under your instructions I went to Chihuahua as an officer in the Army of the Confederate States of America, as such and wearing the uniform of a colonel of cavalry of that army I presented myself to the governor of Chihuahua, as such I was accredited by you, as such I signed my name, as such was recognized, received, entertained, addressed, and recredited to you by the governor. I made it a point never to pay a visit of etiquette or ceremony but as an officer of the A. C. S. A., and ordered there by you as general in the Army of Confederate States of America.
May all due honor and credit attach to you for this point gained for our country.

It is with the greatest pleasure, general, I reply to your second communication, of the 27th December,* which was handed to me by your second in command, Col. Santiago Reily, recommending him to me in his official character as your special envoy as well as personally.
I sincerely approve your choice, for Colonel Reily is certainly a prudent man and a most accomplished gentleman, whose manner and appearance alone would secure for him a most distinguished position. He has discharged with fidelity and intelligence the mission that you confided to him for my Government, making such explanations as were necessary on various matters which lie was authorized to arrange, and of which I spoke to you in my note of that date.
I understand he is fully convinced of the loyalty of my sentiments towards the respectable general-in-chief of the Army of the Confederate States, to all its citizens, and of the same Mr. Reily, who, until now, has never asked any service from me. He will always find me disposed to lend him any assistance in my power. I give you most sincere thanks for the honor you have conferred upon me by the acquaintance of Colonel Reily, who leaves in this city the warmest sympathies, and I renew to you the assurances of my appreciation and my highest consideration.

Before noticing the principal points, allow me to perforin the pleasant duty of reciprocating your cordial expressions of friendship and goodwill, and your desire to establish friendly relations between the Mexican States and those of the Southern Confederacy contiguous, and which you serve as general-in-chief of the army. Let me assure you that you will meet on my part, as governor of the State of Chihuahua, the most sincere and earnest disposition to cultivate these relations as far as lies in my power, as I am convinced that it is one of the most important duties that my position and the reciprocal interests of our respective countries impose upon me, and I do not fail to credit you with similar sentiments, of which I have succeeded in convincing Colonel Reily, and with which I am pleased to think he is perfectly satisfied.
As to the questions indicated in your communication already cited, I have the satisfaction of informing you relative to the one whether the Supreme Government of Mexico has within the past few months conceded to the United States the right of transit subject to the first order, and secondly to put in motion the troops and munitions of war against the Confederate States, whose forces you command, on the border of Texas, that nothing of this kind has come to my notice, nor would my Government respect it, except on the terms and with the conditions established in the general constitution of the United States of Mexico— to whom the Congress of the Union exclusively grants the privilege of permitting or denying the entrance of foreign troops in the territory of the Confederation and of consenting to the stationing of squadrons of other powers for more than one month in the waters of the republic. (Portion 16 of Article 72.)
By that constitutional principle, which it is not lawful to violate in any way nor for any consideration whatever, I find myself prevented from acceding to your proposition relative to the persecution of the savage Indians by your forces and mine. Yet when it may be necessary to draw the lines of demarcation between the States of Texas and Chihuahua, by the alternate introduction to the territory of one and the other, while the Indians make their depredations and retreats, if I am convinced of the advantage that such immunity will bring, I will take the steps necessary to act upon it before the Congress of the Union.
The third and last point referred to in your note has, in my opinion, the solution that you desire, by the means established of agents and contractors, who may make on the frontier purchases and storing of provisions which shall be necessary for yrour army, and that it may offer facilities to the population from which it draws of a commercial nature without any official intervention whatever, that may be interpreted as an act contrary to the absolute neutrality which Mexico and all the States of its Confederation must observe in the unfortunate struggle between the States of the North and South of the American Union. This is all I can lay before you, general, relative to your communication of the 16th December, and in the secure confidence that you will accept it as the most frank expression of the reasons and sentiments that must regulate my conduct as governor of the State of Chihuahua, and as your sincere friend and that of the Confederate States, I conclude by offering you renewed assurances of my highest and most cordial esteem and respect.

General H. H. Sibley, C. S. A.,
Commanding Army of New Mexico, Fort Thorn:
General : I have the honor to report that I left Fort Bliss at 11 a. m. on the 8th of January, and, in accordance with your orders of 31st ultimo, proceeded to the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, arriving there at 2 p. m. on the 8th instant. At 3 p. m. I dispatched the note referred to as No. 1 in brief report of this same date, and a copy of which note is now made:
Riddell’s Hotel, Chihuahua, January 8, 1882. To His Excellency Don Luis Terrazas,
Governor of the Slate of Chihuahua, Republic of Mexico:
Sir : The undersigned has the honor to inform your excellency that he hears to you a communication from General H. II. Sibley, C. S. A., and commanding the Army of New Mexico, touching matters of importance to the Governments of the Confederate States of America and to the Republic of Mexico, and especially to that military department he now commands, and to this State.
The undersigned trusts it will suit your excellency to designate an hour when he can have the honor to present to you in person his letter of credence from General Sibley and the communication with which be is intrusted.
I have the honor to be, with sentiments of highest consideration and respect, most truly, yours,
JAMES REILY,
Colonel, A. C. S. A.
Early the next morning I received from the governor a reply (being document No. 2), in which his excellency designated 12 m. of that day for an interview at the governor’s palace. A few moments before the hour of 12 m. I was called upon by Don Carlos Moyo, brother-in-law to the governor, who accompanied me to the palace, and by whom I was introduced to the governor. After a brief speech, interpreted by Don Carlos Moyo, and as brief a one from the governor, also translated to me, I presented to the governor your letter of credence. I was then formally introduced to the secretary of state and other high officials.
My reception by the governor and all others present was most gracious and cordial. I beg leave here to state that I had myself announced to the governor as colonel of the Confederate States Army, and was dressed as such, being in the uniform of a cavalry officer C. S. Army, and wearing my sword.
His excellency remarked that, as the communication was in English, a language he neither spoke nor read, he must request to have it translated, so that he might be able to give it due and intelligible consideration. I then informed him, if he jfleased, I would call at 12 m. the next day.
At the request of the governor I resumed my seat, when many inquiries were made about the war between the South and North, about yourself, and the number and character of your troops$ to all of which I trust I gave satisfactory answers.
Upon taking leave of the governor, I was escorted back to the hotel by Don Carlos Moyo. He remained with me some time, and I found him quite a friend of the South. To him I am indebted for much civility and many kindnesses.
The next day, at 12, Don Carlos again called for me, and, arriving at the palace, found no one with the governor but the secretary of state and one of the judges of the supreme court. In a short time we were joined by Don Joaquin Durand, whose acquaintance I had previously made, and, although a Mexican, yet writing and speaking the English language with great fluency, having been educated in England. He came there at my request, and I was glad to avail myself of his intelli-

gence. We almost immediately took up your communication, and you have, general, in the letter No. 5, and of date 11 th instant, the result of that interview.
In addition to the concessions there made by the governor, he informed me that u if even the assent of the President had come to him, sanctioned by the act of Congress, he did not think he would permit Federal troops to pass through the territory of Chihuahua to invade Texas.”
In regard to the second point, that he would not give his official sanction to the occupancy of the territory of his State by foreign troops, but hoped the Apaches on the frontier would be kept quiet. This was after I referred him to the law of nations in regard to the rights of u hot pursuit,” instanced the invasion of Shreveport, La., in November, 1838, by Texas troops, when in u hot pursuit ” of the Caddoes, and stated to him that such invasion was not deemed or treated as a wrongful one by the Government of the United States. The right to pursue Indians, even into the city of Chihuahua itself, had been granted by Don Revel la, when governor, to Judge Simeon Hart. Upon that point, if ever rendered necessary, your troops will have no trouble. [Judge Ilart made this application in 1858 to Governor Revella, under the instructions of General Garland, then commanding in New Mexico.]
As to the right to purchase supplies in Chihuahua, embraced in third point, the governor assured me no steps would be taken to prevent it, and, although the presence of your command would increase the price which the people of Chihuahua would have to pay, yet that, independent of this, we should not be excluded.
I spent an evening by invitation with the governor at liis private residence, and where I met many persons, and dined with him at his brother-in-law’s (Moyo) next day.
The governor appeared anxious to have the best relations established and continued between his State and the Confederate States, and I took leave of him, satisfied in my own mind that he would not break or cause to be broken the relations that now exist.
I found Chihuahua in a delicious climate, in the midst of mines of untold wealth, with rich agricultural and grazing lands near by, and yet the city becoming smaller in population and more and more reduced to poverty every year. These mines amj their soil need the inducement of capital, energy, and enterprise, which can only be induced thither by a stable and enlightened and constitutional government.
I have the pleasure to report that the custom-house dues I was by you instructed to have remitted were ordered by the governor to be remitted, and the governor paid me the compliment to put in my hand the order to the collector at El Paso to have the duties remitted and the bondsman released. He stated that at all times whenever necessary he would be pleased to afford protection to the persons and property of the citizens of the Southern Confederacy.
It becomes my agreeable duty to report that I took letters from no one else in Texas to Chihuahua but from Hon. Simeon Hart, and that through his introduction and his influence I received the most marked and attentive consideration. He is well known, and commands high respect and great credit in Chihuahua.
Permit me here again to congratulate you on having been instrumental in obtaining the first official recognition by a foreign government of the Confederate States of America. All the credit due such an achievement I trust will be awarded you.
I remain now, as ever, most truly, with great respect, your friend,

Events have thus transpired clearly indicating the complicity of citizens of Kentucky with the rebel forces, and showing the Impracticability of carrying on operations in that direction without involving the Kentucky shore.

Report of Col. Richard J. Oglesby, Eighth Illinois Infantry, commanding
at Cairo, III.
Brigade Headquarters, Camp’Defiance,
Cairo, III., August 23, 1861.
Sir : In the affair of the little steamer W. B. Terry, taken by Captain Stembel, of gunboat Lexington, yesterday morning, at Paducah, Ky., I had indisputable proof, which an examination of her papers found on board confirms, that she was running in the employment of the Confederate States. Without hesitating upon the neutrality of Kentucky, I ordered her capture. She turns out to be of no great value, say, vessel and furniture, $3,000. To the Confederates three times that sum will not compensate the loss. I have had her valued by a commission of my own appointment, and the papers filed at these headquarters. I am at a loss what further to do with her legally. Of course I shall use her, if necessary to do so.
Of course Paducah was in confusion, and his excellency the governor may become indignant. The result is, that yesterday the crew of the Terry, led by the captain and a few citizens, seized the steamer Samuel Orr, from Evansville, the private property of private citizens of Indiana —a retaliation more vindictive than sensible, as they thus destroy the last means of illicit trade with the border States north of the Ohio. Nevertheless, they have the boat and cargo, worth, say, $25,000. I would like to go up the Tennessee River and make the reprisal. I send herewith a copy of the statement of the captain and officers of the Samuel Orr, and also transmit copy of report [No. 3] of Capt. R. N. Stembel, commanding gunboat Lexington.
Hoping my action may meet your approval, I am, most respectfully, yours,

The steamboat Samuel Orr, running as the regular mail-boat from Evansville to Paducah, was, on the 22cl of August, 1861, forcibly taken by a mob at Paducah, Ky., from the crew in command, and taken up the Tennessee River. The boat was new, and worth $15,000. It had on board a miscellaneous cargo, worth about $10,000. The principal owners are citizens of Evansville, and the actors in the seizure were Captain Johnson, late commander of the steamboat W. B. Terry, White Fowler, A. M. Winston, and about 40 or 50 other persons, we believe . all citizens of Paducah. Several shots were fired by the assailants, wounding two persons.
We were all of us hurriedly driven from the boat, without allowing us (except in one or two instances) the privilege of bringing away our clothing or baggage.
It is but j ustice to say that some of the leading citizens of the town were loud in their condemnations of this act, but no measures were taken, as far as we know, to prevent it.

The gentleman you placed on board to designate the steamer employed in the rebel trade and carrying their flag pointed out the W. B. Terry as being the vessel thus illegally engaged. I ran alongside of her, cut her out, made her fast to the Lexington, and immediately returned to this anchorage and placed her in your iiossession. I was not opposed in the performance of this duty by either the citizens of Paducah or the officers and crew of the Terry, for the latter, evidently suspecting my object, left the boat hastily, with such articles of clothing as were at hand. I was therefore unsuccessful ;in capturing any of them.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. xn.
We can attest, sir, your religious observance of that position which Kentucky had assumed for herself. We know, sir, that when the present unhappy difficulty between the Government of the United States and the Confederate Government [arose], the State of Kentucky chose for herself a position in relation to both powers, in which her citizens fondly flattered themselves that, amid the din of war, they would find peace, security to themselves, and the ability to serve the suffering and 'afilicted of both sides.
The Government of the Confederacy acknowledged and recognized the right of Kentucky thus to act. They saw in this action only the' exercise of a great right which attaches to the sovereignty of a State, and w hich was the principle that underlies the Government itself. The South has therefore tenaciously respected the position of Kentucky, but, on the other hand, this position has been repudiated by the Government of the United States from the beginning. They have repeatedly violated the neutrality of Kentucky and scoffed at those who trusted to it for protection.
It may not be improper to recall to your recollection a few of the instances in which the North have manifested its utter disregard of, and others in which it has openly and defiantly assailed, Kentucky neutrality. You will doubtless remember that when the Army was being first collected at Cairo, it was universally understood that its object and destination was down the Mississippi, to overrun Tennessee, take possession of Memphis, and finally march into New Orleans. That purpose is doubtless still entertained. As a military man you know that no general would lead an army of occupation into an enemy’s country and •leave behind him unoccupied such a position as the map shows Columbus to be. Can any man be so blinded as to suppose that, amid a vast arrangement then being made for the military occupation of the entire South, the War Department at Washington suffered the declaration of Kentucky neutrality to interpose for one single moment a barrier to the occupancy of Columbus?
We, sir, from the first hour that Cairo became a military encampment, have felt perfectly7 satisfied that this place would-be taken possession of by Northern troops just so soon as the objects and designs of the leaders of the war rendered it needful, and, sir, we have trembled with apprehension for the consequences to our persons, our families, and our property. We had witnessed the outrages perpetrated by Northern soldiery. We had known private residences of our neighbors across the river in Missouri entered by these soldiers and despoiled, the owner made prisoner or chased into the woods or the canebrake, and insult and indignity offered to unprotected and defenseless females. We knew that we stood within the danger of similar treatment, for our offense was the same. Those men had dared to exercise the freedom of oxnnion and of speech, and so had we; they had dared to think and express the thought that a sectional President, elected by a sectional party and administering the Government upon purely sectional ideas, was a bane and a curse to the nation. We had offended in like manner. Because they would not prove such dastards as to disavow their sentiments, this treatment was visited upon them. We, too, felt incapable of retracting our opinions thus expressed, even though punishment awaited the refractory. We knew that they did not intend to respect the neutrality of Kentucky. We knew, moreover, that in more instances than one they did openly violate it.
The case of the Columbus Bangers is in point. You, sir, may perhaps not have heard the particulars of that case. Capt, M. H. Wright,

a gentleman highly respected and honorable in all the relations of life, organized from the young men of Columbus and vicinity a company of Eangers, for the mere purpose of drill, to learn camp life, and to amuse themselves in hunting. A squad of this company went some 10 miles up the river on the Kentucky side. Some evil-disposed persons reported their presence in the neighborhood to the commander at Cairo, and he determined to capture or slay them. Accordingly, a troop of 200 armed soldiers landed in the dead of night, marched in secrecy toward the encampment; as they would approach the dwelling of a citizen it would be surrounded, and the peaceful inmates, aroused in utter astonishment from their slumbers, would be placed under guard. Thus this force moved on, arresting the citizen and administering oaths until they approached the camp of the Eangers, avowing their object to be to arrest them or shoot them down if they resisted. The boys had left the evening before and returned to their homes, dreaming of anything less than they had become the objects of suspicion and of search to the army at Cairo. It has never suited the pleasure of any person connected with this flagrant infraction of Kentucky neutrality to allege any fault committed by a single individual of that party of Eangers. It was a wanton, unprovoked invasion of Kentucky soil to hunt down and murder Kentucky citizens.
Only a few days after the occurrences related above, another instance of their utter disregard of the rights of the people of Kentucky presents itself in a scene that was enacted in this place, as follows: There existed in our midst a diversity of opinion on the great question that was dividing the nation, one party favoring the doctrine of secession, the other for the Union. Each party, as was customary, manifested their opinions by the display of symbols that represented its peculiar views. The secession party had its flag, the Union party theirs. This was a matter that concerned ourselves alone. A flag of the Southern Confederacy floated from a pole on the river bank. The City of Alton, a steamboat belonging at Cairo, came down to Columbus filled with troops and having on board several cannon. She was run in to shore where the secession flag was floating, and the officer in command of the expedition demanded, in a rude and authoritative manner, by whose authority that flag was placed there. He was told it was done by citizens of Columbus. He then ordered it to be taken down. He was told it would not be done by any citizen. He then said if it was not taken down immediately he would shoot it down. He was told to shoot it down then. Thereupon three men came on shore, add, standing under the protection of their cannon, and guns bearing in point-blank distance of our persons and our dwellings, one of these men tore down the flag, took it on board the boat, and, amid shouts, jeers, and derision, it was stamped upon and carried away.
We had in all former periods of our national history been in the habit of manifesting our peculiar political views by any emblem we chose to adopt, and had felt it as one of the blessings of our form of government that we had the right to canvass and call in question the acts of our rulers in any method we might desire, so that we preserved the peace. We had, however, presumed too far in our trust in Kentucky neutrality. We had also been told by General Buckner, the commander of the military force of our State, that he had entered into an agreement with General McClellan which secured to us perfect immunity from all future disturbance; but even this consolation was denied us, for quickly upon the heels of this last act comes the denial of General McClellan that any such arrangement existed, and that, too, in such terms as to

leave it perfectly apparent that the Northern Army were at liberty to invade Kentucky at such times and places as suited its pleasure or convenience.
Contemporaneously with all this, it should be noted that in the city of Louisville, the great commercial mart of the State, a strict and severe embargo was being enforced, so that the trade of Kentucky was obstructed and the means of disposing of our surplus absolutely denied to us.
As we draw nearer to the present period of time you will see the cloud thickens over the State, and the purposes and designs of the Government at Washington become more and more apparent.
Congress convened on the 4th of July. Was there any intimation of a purpose in that body to treat Kentucky otherwise than a State in the Union, and bound by her allegiance to all the duties and obligations of that relation as understood and construed, not by Kentucky herself, but by the Northern Black Bepublican States ? None whatever. In all the vast arrangements in the form of 500,000 men and $500,000,000 of money devised and voted for the prosecution of the war, for the overrunning Southern States, butchering her soldiery, and reducing their citizens to bondage, the State of Kentucky and the people of Kentucky were as fully embraced and included as the people and the States of Massachusetts or New York. Fearful the onerous tax imposed upon the people for the purpose of raising this blood money would be resisted in Kentucky, we find an army being raised and quartered in the very heart of the State, officered, equipped, fed, and armed by the General Government; held ready in the very center of the State to proceed to either extremity and assist that Government in placing the heel of power upon the neck of the people and cod straining them into submission to unconstitutional usurpation and tyranny.
We have recently witnessed the spectacle of a thousand armed men, under General Bousseau, marching with loaded guns through the principal streets of the city of Louisville. We have witnessed the spectacle of another armed force, under Colonel Bramlette, marching into the city of Lexington, to place an unarmed populace under duress and compel them to submit to have Federal guns distributed from their city and a depot for Federal arms established in their midst. We have witnessed the placing of two gunboats at anchor in front of our own town, with a battery from each frowning upon our dwellings and menacing our citizens. We have seen the property of the city of Columbus—the ferry franchise— obstructed and the steam ferry-boat sunk and destroyed. We have seen bombs thrown into the city of Hickman. We have, sir, finally, witnessed the inhuman and fiendish act of a bomb hurled into our own town, bursting near a private residence, and in the very midst almost of shrinking, affrighted women. We have spent anxious days and sleepless nights in constant apprehension of the destruction of our town and the death of our wives and children.
Can you not then conceive of the sincere delight with which we hail the approach of the army under your command ? But you will fall far short of a just conception of the iively sentiment of pleasure we derive from the sense of restored confidence and the enjoyment of a consciousness that now our families and our property are safe. It is from hearts filled with such emotions as these that this entire community extends to you and to your gallant army a cordial welcome.

Columbus, Ky., September 8, 1861. Governor Magoffin, Franltfort, Ky.:
I should have dispatched to you immediately, as the troops under my command took possession of this position, the very few words I addressed to the people here 5 but my duties since that? time so preoccupied me, that I have but now the first leisure moment to communicate with you.
It will be sufficient for me to inform you (as my short address herewith will do) that I had information on which I could rely that the Federal forces intended and were preparing to seize Columbus. I need not describe to you the danger resulting to Western Tennessee from such occupation. My responsibility could not permit me quietly to lose to the command intrusted to me so important a position. In evidence of the accuracy of the information I possessed, I will state that as the Confederate forces approached this place the Federal troops were found in formidable numbers in position upon the opposite bank, with their cannons turned upon Columbus. The citizens of the town had fled with terror, and not a word of assurance of safety or protection had been addressed to them. Since I have taken possession of this place I have been informed by highly respectable citizens of your State that certain representatives of the Federal Government are seeking to take advantage of its own wrongs and setting up complaints against my act of occupation, and are making it a pretext for seizing other points.
Upon this proceeding I have no comment to make. But I am prepared to say that I will agree to withdraw the Confederate troops from Kentucky, provided that she will agree that the troops of the Federal Government be withdrawn simultaneously, with a guarantee (which I will give reciprocally for the Confederate Government) that the Federal troops shall not be allowed to enter or occupy any part of Kentucky in the future.

at least to mitigate its horrors, or, if this were not possible, that she might be left to choose her destiny without disturbance from any quarter.
In obedience to the thrice repeated will of the people, as expressed at the polls and in their name, I ask you to withdraw your forces from the soil of Kentucky.
I will say in conclusion that all the people of the State await in deep suspense your action in the premises.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
JOHN M. JOHKSTOK,
Chairman of Committee.
[Inclosure M.]
Columbus, Ky., September 9, 1861.
To John M. Johnston,
Chairman of Committee, Senate of Kentucky:
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of this date [inclosure L], conveying to me a copy of a resolution of the senate of Kentucky, under which a committee (of which you are chairman) was raised “for the purpose of considering the reputed occupation of Hickman and other points in Kentucky by the Confederate troops, and that they take into consideration the reported occupation of Paducah and other points in Kentucky by the Federal authorities, and report thereon.” Also “ that they be directed to obtain all the facts they can in reference to the recent occupation of Kentucky soil by the Confederate and Federal forces, and report in writing at as early a day as practicable.”
From the terms of the resolution it appears that your office as committee-men was restricted merely to collecting the facts in reference to the recent occupation of Kentucky soil by the Confederate and Federal forces, and to report thereon in writing at as early a day as possible. In answer to these resolutions 1 have respectfully to say that, so far as the Confederate forces are concerned, these facts are few and shortly stated.
The Government which they represent, recognizing as a fundamental principle the right of sovereign States to take such a position as they may choose in regard to their relations with other States, was compelled by that principle to concede to Kentucky the right to assume the position of neutrality which she had chosen in the passing struggle. This it has done on all occasions and without an exception. The cases alluded to by his excellency Governor Magoffin, in his recent message, as “raids” I presume are the cases of the steamers Cheney and Orr. The former was the unauthorized and unrecognized act of certain citizens of Alabama, the latter an act of citizens of Tennessee* and others, and was an act of reprisal. They cannot, therefore, be charged in any sense as acts of the Confederate Government.
The first and only instance in which the neutrality of Kentucky has been disregarded is that in which the troops under my command took possession of the place I now hold and so much of the territory between it and the Tennessee line as was necessary for me to pass over to reach it.
This act finds abundant justification in the history of the concessions granted to the Federal Government by Kentucky ever since the war began, notwithstanding the position of neutrality which she has assumed and the firmness with which she proclaimed her intention to maintain it.
That history shows the following, among other facts:
This reference is to seizure of the Orr at Fort Heiman.

. In January the house of representatives of Kentucky passed anti-coercion resolutions, only four dissenting.
The governor in May issued his neutrality proclamation. The address of the Union Central Committee, including Sir. James Speed, Mr. Prentice, and other prominent Union men, in April proclaimed neutrality as the policy of Kentucky, and claimed that an attempt to coerce the South should induce Kentucky to make common cause with her and take part on her side, u without counting the cost.”
The Union speakers and papers, with few exceptions, claimed up to the last election that the Union vote was strict neutrality and peace. These facts and events gave assurance of the integrity of the avowed purpose of your State, and we were content with the position she assumed.
Since the election, however, she has allowed the seizure in her ports (Paducah) of property of citizens of the Confederate States. She has by her members in the Congress of the United States voted supplies of men and money to carry on the war against the Confederate States. She has allowed the Federal Government to cut timber from her forests for the purpose of building armed boats for the invasion of the Southern States. She is permitting to be enlisted in her territory troops, not only of her own citizens, but of citizens of other States, for the purpose of being armed and used in offensive warfare against the Confederate States. At Camp Eobinson, in the county of Garrard, there are now 10,000 troops, if the newspapers can be relied upon, in which men from Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois are mustered with Kentuckians into the service of the United States and armed by that Government, for the avowed purpose of giving aid to the disaffected in the Confederate States and of carrying out designs of that Government for their subjugation.
Notwithstanding all these and other acts of a similar character, the Confederate States have continued to respect the attitude which Kentucky had assumed as a neutral, and foreborne from reprisals in the hope that Kentucky would yet enforce respect for her position on the j>art of the Government of the United States.
Our patient expectation has been disappointed, and it was only when we perceived that this continued indifference to our rights and our safety was about to culminate in the seizure of an important part of her territory by the United States forces for offensive operations against the Confederate States that a regard for self-preservation demanded of us to seize it in advance.
We are here, therefore, not by choice, but by necessity, and as I have had the honor to say in a communication addressed to his excellency Governor Magoffin, a copy of which is herewith inclosed and submitted as a part of my reply, so I now repeat, in, answer to your request, that I am prepared to agree to withdraw the Confederate troops from Kentucky, provided she will agree that the troops of the Federal Government be withdrawn simultaneously, with a guarantee (which I will give reciprocally for the Confederate Government) that the Federal troops shall not be allowed to enter nor occupy any part of Kentucky for the future.
In view of the facts thus submitted, I cannot but think the world at large will find it difficult to appreciate the u profound astonishment n with which you say the people of Kentucky received the intelligence of the occupation of this place.
I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chat. XIL
Richmond, September 15,1861.
Maj. Gen. L. Polk, Columbus, Ky.:
Your letter of the 11th instant, with accompanying papers, was this clay delivered by Mr. Ingraham.
Your correspondence with the committee and the governor of Kentucky has been considered and approved. Governor Harris and others have represented to me that the occupation of Columbus and Hickman would work political detriment to our cause in Kentucky. It is true that the solution of the problem requires the consideration of other than the military elements involved in it; but we cannot permit the indeterminate quantities, the political elements, to control our action in cases of military necessity. Such I regarded your occupation of Columbus to be, and your oiler to evacuate it upon a reasonable assurance that it would not be occupied, and other places continued to be held by the enemy, furnishes all that could be required of respect for the declared neutrality on the part of Kentucky.
A telegram has been sent to Governor Pettus, to inform him that any troops he could furnish to you would be mustered into the service of the Confederate States.
You use the expression u brigade,” but this, I suppose, is merely intended to indicate a number of regiments, as you know the law does not authorize us to accept troops in any higher organization than the regimental.
Your wish for General A. S. Johnston to command the operations in the West has been fulfilled. He is now, I suppose, at Nashville, and you will soon have the aid of his presence with the army.
I am gratified that the people of Columbus recognize in you a defender of their rights and made common cause with you. This alone would suffice to prove that we have adhered to our declared abstinence from any policy of conquest.
I feel deeply anxious as to the course of Kentucky, and sincerely trust your expectations will be realized in relation to the people of the section in which you now are.
Very respectfully and truly,
JEFFERSON DAYIS.

JEFFEBSON I)AVIS.
Nashville, September 13, 1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General C. S. A.:
After consultation with the Tennessee commissioners to Frankfort, and with prominent citizens of Kentucky, I unhesitatingly advise that the movement of General Zollicofter be stopped at the State line. The commissioners urge the withdrawal of General Polk’s force. Politically it would be a positive gain. The commissioners believe if General Polk should withdraw that the Federals would also withdraw. I think differently; but, even if it were otherwise, they say our doings in the State would more than compensate for the loss even of numbers. If a withdrawal is authorized, I can rally thousands of neutrality Union men to expel the Federals. I advise that General Johnston be ordered here at once, with discretionary authority to withdraw. Immediate action is necessary. Any delay in withdrawal necessitates energetic forward movements, for which there is not adequate preparation. Our possession of Columbus is already neutralized by that of Paducah. I regard a prompt withdrawal the only chance to unite the State. Simultaneously with withdrawal of Confederates I will issue call on all citizens

to join in expulsion of Federals. Advise us in Nashville, in order that the governor of Kentucky may be notified. The line is kept open for reply.
S. B. BUCKNER.
Nashville, September 13,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis:
On 4th instant I sent John Marshall, Andrew Ewing, and Dr. Bowling as commissioners from Tennessee to Kentucky. They returned last night, and think it of the highest importance that our troops be withdrawn. They say withdrawal secures to us majority in the State. If not withdrawn, overwhelming majority against us and a bloody contest. They think our withdrawal secures withdrawal of Federal troops and saves the State. They are able and reliable men. I submit their report for your consideration.
ISHAM G. HARRIS.
Richmond, September 13,1861.
Governor Harris, Nashville, Tenn.:
Movement to Columbus was reported to me as a defensive measure, rendered necessary by the descent of Federal troops. As a necessity it was sanctioned. If they can be safely withdrawn, it would conform to my declared policy of respect for the neutrality of Kentucky. General A. S. Johnston has been directed to confer with you at Nashville. Security to Tennessee and other parts of the Confederacy is the primary object. To this all else must give way.

Adjutant-General Cooper :
The enemy is concentrating a force at Paducah. It is necessary I should have more troops. I am offered two brigades by Governor Pet-tus, of Mississippi, armed and equipped, provided they are mustered into the Confederate service. May I take them ? Prompt action is our policy now in Kentucky.
L. POLK.
Columbus, September 14, 1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, President, &e.:
Inclosed I send you a letter from two distinguished gentlemen of Kentucky, which will explain itself. My own opinion is, they overrate the importance of the seizure on the public mind of Kentucky. This is as I regard it from other sources of information. They both agree that the course Kentucky has pursued deprives her of the right to protest, and so far as the protection of Tennessee is concerned, the seizure in a military point of view was a necessity. Both deplore the effect on what they think its political influence. I believe, if we could have found a respectable pretext, it would have been better to have seized this place some months ago, as I am convinced we had more friends then in Kentucky than we have had since, and every hour’s delay made against us. Kentucky was fast melting away under the influence of the Lincoln Government. If we make the stand now, and do it vigorously, we shall find we have more allies in the State than we shall ever have at any future day, and if our arms should be successful in a few battles, the State will soon abandon the position which fear of the power of the Federal Government alone constrains her now to maintain. Give us armies, with more commanders, and we cannot but believe that the State will rally strongly to our support for their emancipation.
I have the honor to remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major- General, Commanding.
P. S.—I hear the Federalists have about 8,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry at Paducah. I moved Cheatham’s and Stephens’ regiments out to-day to Mayfield, to protect my right flank. It is of the highest importance that we should have a large re-enforcement now to press the enemy before he has time to fortify. He has laid out extensive works around Paducah, and is meaning evidently to make it his base. General G. F. Smith is in command.
[Id closure.]
Columbus, September 13, 1861.
General Polk :
The undersigned, at the request of many friends interested in the protection of Southern rights in the State of Kentucky, visit you at the

## p. 192 (#200) ############################################

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. TChap. XTI.
town of Columbus to present for your consideration some reasons why it is desired you should retire from this point to the State of Tennessee with your army.
The policy of Kentucky was to adhere to a strict neutrality. In that determination those who feel that it is the interest of Kentucky, on final separation of the States, to be united with the Southern States, have persisted in a rigid adherence to neutrality. Thus acting, the public opinion was being molded to the point of a final union with the Southern States.
It is feared the occupation of Kentucky soil by Confederate troops will check the run of public opinion, and be the occasion of inflaming the public mind against the Confederate States, under the operation of which the legislature will inaugurate measures for the creation of a force to operate against your force.
Allow us to state the condition of affairs in Kentucky. The State Guard military organization will be disbanded, and the guns ordered into the arsenal. A new organization will be adopted, and probably an organized force of 30,000 men created, and placed under the command of General Anderson. They will be directed to operate against your force, and most probably thrown forward from Louisville in the direction of Bowling Green, in the center of the Green River country, in the direction of Nashville. Such course would subjugate the people along that line, and subject those holding Southern opinions to all the atrocities which have marked the course of the Northern Army. Such occupation would in all probability be the rallying point for an army which will effectually overawe, if it does not crush out, Southern men and sentiment. The Southern men are not organized, and are without arms or the. means of procuring them. No matter how numerous or how brave, they will be powerless for self protection, and may finally fix the destiny of the State.
We are aware that you have proposed a mutual withdrawal of the two armies. The undersigned cheerfully acknowledge the justice and propriety of that proposition, but it is due to you to say that a majority of the legislature insist that, as Kentucky is still in the Union and the Confederate States in rebellion, they will not recognize the right of the Confederate States to be placed on equal legal footing with the Federal Government. They insist that your abandonment shall be first, and without terms. Intimations are made that influential parties will use their influence to secure the withdrawal of the Federal troops, and by this means secure the neutrality of Kentucky and keep her troops out of the field, and leave the people free to act on the final question at the proper time.
We respectfully submit these views, and hope, if you shall feel it your duty to refer this question to President Davis, you will also present for iiis consideration the views here given.
Respectfully,
JOHN L. HELM.
E. M. COVINGTON.
Clarksville, September 15,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, Richmond, Va. .*
I am just from Nashville, where some dissatisfaction prevails at the action of General Polk in taking Columbus, Ky. Whether it was altogether politic to take possession I need not say, but it will be ruinous to order him back. Let him advance his columns into Ken-

tueky, to Bowling Green and Muldraugh’s Hill if necessary, and I predict lie will not leave an enemy behind him south of that place in two weeks.
In confidence I say to you the service here needs a general at its head in whom the Army and the country have unlimited confidence. Albert S. Johnston first, and Buckner and Gus. W. Smith as officers under him, would give such confidence as would insure success. I do not even insinuate that any one now in office should be displaced. I do not think they ought, but that the persons above named should be added to the list.
The neutrality of Kentucky has been all the time a cloak to enable the Lincoln party there to hide their real design to arm the friends of Lincoln and to disarm the Southern Bights party. We ought to strike now. A step backward would be fatal, in my opinion. We cannot long avoid a conflict with the paid and bought friends of Lincoln in Kentucky, and the fight might as well come off now as at any other time. If it is to be done, it should be done quickly.
Ever your friend and obedient servant,
G. A. HENRY,
Richmond, September 14,1861. General S. B. Buckner, Nashville, Tenn.:
Your several telegraphs received. A dispatch from the President to Governor Harris yesterday will inform you of his views. A similar dispatch was sent to General Polk at Columbus. General Johnston is presumed to be now in Nashville, to assume command. Appointment of brigadier general will be sent to you by mail, and it is designed that you take command of either Camp Boone or Trousdale. You are authorized to accept regiments for twelve months, if they furnish their own arms, if they will not come for the war. There is no law which authorizes the transportation, as suggested by you.
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
Nashville, Tenn., September 16,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis :
Mr. President: Your dispatch of the 13th instant,* was received at Chattanooga. After full conference with Governor Harris, and after learning the facts, political and military, I am satisfied that the political bearing of the question presented for my decision has been decided by the legislature of Kentucky.
The legislature of Kentucky has required the prompt removal of all Confederate forces from her soil, and the governor of Kentucky has issued his proclamation to that effect. The troops will not be withdrawn. It is not possible to withdraw them now from Columbus in the west, and from Cumberland Ford in the east, without opening the frontiers of Tennessee and the Mississippi River to the enemy, and this is regarded as essential to our present line of defense as well as to any future operations. So far from yielding to the demand for the withdrawal of our troops, I have determined to occupy Bowling Green at once.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap, XII.
Information I believe to be reliable has just been received that General Polk has advanced upon Paducah with 7,500 men. The indications are distinct, leading to the conclusion that the enemy design to advance on the Nashville Railroad, and will immediately occupy Bowling Green, if not anticipated.
I design to-morrow (which is the earliest practicable moment) to take possession of Bowling Green with 5,000 troops, and prepare- to support the movement with such force as circumstances may indicate and the means at my command may allow. Pull reports of the forces of my department will be made at the earliest practicable moment. But enough is already apparent, I respectfully submit, considering the intended line of our defenses and the threatening attitude and increasing forces of the enemy in Missouri and Kentucky, to authorize and require of me the assurance to you that we have not over half the armed forces that are now likely to be required for our security against disaster. I feel assured that I can command the requisite number of men, but we are deficient in arms.	#
By letter of the 15th instant, borne by a special messenger, I have called earnestly upon the governors of Georgia and Alabama for arms, which I am assured they possess. If I fail with them, I shall appeal to your excellency for support and assistance. I believe that those States have quite a number of arms, and that a portion, at least, of them ought to be spared to this line of our defenses.
Having no officer that I could place in command of the movement on Bowling Green, I have been compelled to select and appoint General Simon B. Buckner a brigadier-general, subject to your approval, which I hope it may meet.
The occupation of Bowling Green is an act of self-defense, rendered necessary by the action of the government of Kentucky and by the evidences of ‘intended movements of the Federal forces.
I would be glad to have the services of G. W. Smith, if it is in the power of your excellency to assign him to my command.
Any orders of your excellency will be executed promptly, and any suggestions you may make will be received with pleasure.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
A. S. JOHNSTON, General, V. 8. Army.
Knoxville, September 1G, 18G1. General A. S. Johnston, Memphis, Term. :
Sir : On the 10th instant I apprised Adjutant-General Cooper that I expected on the 12th to have three regiments at Cumberland Ford and three other regiments there as soon as they could be withdrawn from other posts, and I added:
The country beyond Cumberland Gap, toward Nelson’s Camp, is poor and hostile. To make secure our line of communication with the sources of our supplies, it is essential to strengthen the positions at Cumberland Gap, Cumberland Ford, and the intervening passes of the Three Log Mountains. This may be accomplished, I trust, in a few days after the six infantry regiments get to the Ford, when we will be ready to make a forward movement.
On the 13th I received dispatches from Governor Harris and General Buckner, urging me to arrest my movement at the State line, if possible. These dispatches came too late, reaching me after my return from London. 1 replied to Governor Harris by telegraph, requesting him to transmit to Governor Magoffin the following note:

﻿Chap. XII.] ADVANCE OF CONFEDERATES INTO KENTUCKY, ETC. 195
Knoxville, September 14, 1861. His Excellency Governor Magoffin, Frankfort, Ky. :
Sir : The safety of Tennessee requiring it, I have occupied the mountain passes at Cumberland Ford and the Three Log Mountains, in Kentucky. For weeks I have known that the Federal commander at Hoskins’ Cross-Roads was threatening the invasion of East Tennessee, and ruthlessly urging our people to destroy their own railroad bridges. I postponed this precautionary measure until the despotic Government at Washington, refusing to recognize the neutrality of Kentucky, had established formidable camps in the central and other parts of the State, with a view first to subjugate our gallant sister*and then ourselves. Tennessee feels, and has ever felt, towards Kentucky as a twin sister. Their people are as one people, in kindred, sympathy, valor, and patriotism. We have felt, and still feel, a religious respect for Kentucky neutrality. We will respect it as long as our safety will permit. If the Federal forces will now withdraw from their menacing position, the forces under my command shall instantly be withdrawn.
Very respectfully,
F. K. ZOLLICOFFER,
Brigadier- G eneral.
Last night General Cooper telegraphed me in reference to my suggestion of the 10th7 that, after strengthening the mountain passes, u we will be ready to make a forward movement/7 as follows:
The military considerations clearly indicate the forward movement which you propose. The political condition of Kentucky affects the determination of the question. Of that you are better informed than ourselves; and as you are supposed to have conferred with General A. S. Johnston, the matter is left to your discretion.
There are probably by this time four regiments at Cumberland Ford, and a fifth at the Gap, 15 miles this side. A sixth will probably be moved up by the 21st or 22d; and if the state of things in Greene County, where there has been some excitement, is such as 1 suppose, I am not able yet to indicate within what time proper defenses in the mountain passes can be completed, but every effort will be made to push the work forward vigorously. I hope to go there to-morrow. Would have gone earlier, but have been detained by pressing necessities here. I meant to say to General Cooper that we would be ready to make a forward movement, should it be deemed advisable.
I find myself at a loss, under present condition of things, how to obtain reliable information of the strength and movements of the enemy. I will endeavor to place before you promptly information I may receive and all circumstances enabling you to understand our condition. I inclose the most perfect report we are now able to make of the various corps, scattered as they now are at distant posts.*

Report of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, U. S. Army, of departure of the expedition from Cairo, III., September 5.
Brigade Hdqrs., Cairo, September 5—12 p. m. Sir : T have the honor to report the military operations of the day. This morning an engineering party, covered by a company from Col. Paine’s regiment, repaired to the Kentucky shore, and made a survey and reconnaissance, with a view to occupation preparatory to more decisive movements south. The party returned at sunset without accident. This afternoon vigorous measures were adopted for an expedition for the seizure of the city of Paducah, 50 miles above, on the Ohio River. To prevent opposing measures, all passing on the rivers and roads was suspended, egress from the city forbidden, and the telegraph restrained.
The expedition sailed at 11.30 to-night, comprising the gunboats Tyler and Conestoga, the steamers Graham and Terry, conveying Col. Paine’s regiment from Cairo, Colonel McArthur’s regiment from Bird’s Point, also Colonel Waagner’s artillery, consisting of six pieces, under Captain Smith. The force cotfqmsed about 1,800 men of all grades, six G4-pounders, four 32-pounders, and six 6-pounders, with an adequate supply of provisions and munitions for all expected emergencies. Brigadier-General Grant commands the expedition in person. The officers and men chosen for this duty are among the most carefully chosen and drilled of the Illinois volunteers. I anticipate the pleasure of being able to announce to you the entire success of this important movement.
Order prevails in this city and camp; the organization and drill of the forces are progressing satisfactorily, and when supplied with the arms now on the way, it is hoped that the post may be not only well defended, but the scene of efficient operations.
Having only entered upon the command of this post at noon to-day, and being pressed by active duties, growing out of the movements above referred to, I will defer details until better advised of the condition and strength of my command.

Cairo, JZZ., September 6, 1861.
I left Cairo at 10.30 o’clock last night, taking two gunboats and three steamboats, with the Ninth Illinois, under Gen. E. A. Paine; the Twelfth Illinois, under Col. J. McArthur, and Smith’s battery, four pieces light artillery, under Lieutenant Willard. I met with some detention at Mound City, owing to an accident to one of the steamers, creating a necessity for a transfer of troops. During the detention I was joined by Captain Foote, U. S. Navy, who accompanied the expedition.
Arrived at Paducah at 8.30 this morning. Found numerous secession flags flying over the city, and the citizens in anticipation of the approach of the rebel army, which was reliably reported 3,800 strong 16 miles distant. As we neared the city Brigadier-General Tilghman and staff, of the rebel army, and a recruiting major with a company raised in Paducah, left the city by the railroad, taking with them all the rolling stock. 1 landed the troops and took possession of the city without firing a gun.
Before I landed the secession flags had disappeared, and I ordered our flags to replace them. I found at the railroad depot a large number of complete rations and about two tons of leather, marked for the Confederate Army. Took possession of these and ordered the rations to be distributed to the troops. I also took possession of the telegraph office, and seized some letters and dispatches, which I herewith transmit. I further took possession of the railroad. The enemy was reported as coming down the Tennessee River in large force, but this I do not credit. I distributed the troops so as best to command the city and least annoy peaceable citizens, and published a proclamation to the citizens, a copy of which will be handed you by Captain Foote.
I left two gunboats and one of the steamboats at Paducah, placed the post under command of General E. A. Paine, and left Paducah at 12 o’clock, arriving at.this post at 4 this afternoon.
Last night I ordered the Eighth Missouri Volunteers, Col. M. L. Smith, stationed at Cape Girardeau, to report here immediately. I will send them to re-enforce General Paine at Paducah to-night. I would respectfully recommend that two additional pieces be added to the excellent battery of Captain Smith, commanded by Lieutenant Willard, making it a complete battery of six pieces. He has men sufficient for six pieces, but will require horses and harness.
Colonel Waagner accompanied me, and manifested great zeal and precaution.
1 must acknowledge my obligations to General McClernand, commanding this force, for the active and efficient co-operation exhibited by him in fitting out the expedition.

Upon my departure you will assume command of the troops at this post, and make such disposal of the forces as will best enable you to retain possession and control of the city. A portion of the troops can be quartered at the Marine Hospital. You are charged to take special care and precaution that no harm is done to inoffensive citizens; that the soldiers shall not enter any private dwelling nor make any searches unless by your orders, and then a detail shall be made for that purpose. Exercise the strictest discipline against any soldier who shall insult citizens or engage in plundering private property. Make frequent reports to me at district headquarters, and also to the Department of the West, at Saint Louis, sending me copies of such reports.

Brigade Headquarters,
Camp Buchner, wear Cumberland Ford, 2Ty.,	19, 1861.
Sir : On my way here to-day an express overtook me with your order to send two regiments from my command to Camp Trousdale. I immediately caused orders to be given to Fourteenth. Mississippi Regiment, Colonel Baldwin, and Third East Tennessee Regiment, Colonel Lillard, to move to Camp Trousdale, those two regiments being on the line of the railroad and most readily to be brought to the position designated.
1 have now four regiments here and one at Cumberland Gap. I have here one 6-pounder field battery of six guns and four companies of cavalry—eight other cavalry companies on the way. There are now but two infantry regiments left in East Tennessee ; one, the Alabama regiment, with more than 400 sick. There are five cavalry companies left for that service.
An advanced force sent out last night, about 800 strong, entered Barboursville, 18 miles from here, about daylight, where they found about 300 of the enemy, and a fight ensued, in which we killed 12 and took 2 prisoners. We lost 1 killed, Lieutenant Powell, of Colonel Cummings5 regiment, 1 fatally wounded, and 3 slightly wounded. The enemy fled precipitately. The number of his wounded unknown.
Col. J. A. Battle commanded the detachment, making a march of 34 miles and dispersing this detachment of the enemy within a period of twenty hours. He destroyed their encampment, called Camp Andrew Johnson, and captured about 25 arms. Two prisoners had been taken a day or two before, one of whom was bearing a letter from an East Tennessee captain in the Lincoln camp at Hoskins5 Cross-Roads to his wife, in which the writer states that the strength of that camp is 15,000 and still rapidly increasing. We now have a report from the country people that they are 20,000 strong.
My only engineer officer understanding military engineering has resigned and gone home.

Colonel Waagner, chief of ordnance, left here this evening, in pursuance of orders telegraphed to him. His energy and ability have been of great service to me, particularly in directing reconnaissances, and his loss from this post will be felt.
To-day the advanced sentinels of one of our pickets fired into a scouting party of about 100 rebels, killing 1 horse and unhorsing 5 or 6 men. This took place about 1 mile from Elliott’s Mills, on the Columbus road.

Sir : I had posted Captain Bledsoe’s cavalry company near Jamestown, Tenn., and four other cavalry companies at intermediate points from there to Cumberland Gap, to watch the mountain passes on the East Tennessee and Kentucky line in its whole extent. Colonel Stanton’s rifle regiment is encamped in Overton County, Middle Tennessee, 11 miles from Captain Bledsoe, but I am advised that he does not regard himself as under my orders. I have just learned that a few days ago

Captain Bledsoe ascertained that about 400 Lincoln men at Albany, Ky., had made prisoners of some of our friends in their neighborhood, who sent to Bledsoe for help. He dashed over the line to Albany, routed the Lincoln men, and captured about 60 muskets, which he sent to Colonel Stanton.
The force of the enemy has collected at Monticello 800 strong, and two small pieces of artillery have been sent them from Camp Dick Bobinson. Bledsoe has since sent to Colonel Stanton Tor help, which has been refused. He sent a second time, and was informed that he (Stanton) would not afford the desired assistance unless ordered by Genera] Johnston. This is what a messenger sent to General Caswell says. Bledsoe, a very gallant man, thinks with this timely aid he could disperse the Lincoln force and take their cannon. Three companies of cavalry have been ordered to Bledsoe’s relief, but Stanton, who is so near, ought to give his aid.
I hear that about 2,500 Lincolnites have assembled at Louisa, in Lawrence County, Kentucky, on the Lower Sandy Biver, and that the people of Scott, Lee, Wise, Bussell, and other western counties in Virginia ‘ are preparing against invasion. I have written to leading men in those counties, and have sent an intelligent officer through them to get reliable news and to urge timely preparations to guard the gaps in the mountains.

I returned here yesterday. On the 26th September destroyed the lock at the mouth of Muddy Biver; occupied Hopkinsville on the 29th, the Home Guards having departed on the previous night. Our only loss was 1 killed and 1 dangerously wounded, resulting from an ambush of a few of the dispersing Home Guards. Our cavalry wounded several and took 2 prisoners. Men stood march of over 100 miles remarkably well; their conduct generally excellent. We made many friends. I left the brigade of Mississippians and two small regiments under Brigadier General Alcorn at Hopkinsville. I will send you by mail a copy of my instructions to him. I can reconstruct at a cost of a few hundred dollars an old telegraph line from Clarksville to Hopkinsville. Shall I direct it to be built I There is a regiment 1,000 strong in Overton County, Tenn., about 70 miles southeast of this place; it is commanded by Col. S. S. Stanton, who is still under orders to respect the neutrality of Kentucky. If not wanted there, I request permission to order them to join me.

Reports of Brig. Gen. F. K. Zollicoffer, C. 8. Army.
Brigade Headquarters,
Camp Buckner, Jit/., September 30, 18G1.
Sir: The detachments whose movements I reported to you on the 2Gth instant are returning into camp. The commands of Colonels Rains and Statham and Lieutenant-Colonel McNairy went a few miles beyond London, having driven in the enemy’s pickets a few miles this side of Laurel Bridge, captured a part of the baggage of the encampment at the bridge, and given ineffectual chase for several miles to a retreating force variously estimated at from 600 to 1,500. They captured two of the pickets and one other prisoner, 8,000 cartridges, 25,000 caps, 3 kegs of powder, G barrels of salt, 2 wagons and teams (hauling off the last of their baggage), 3 other horses, 25 pairs of shoes, and several guns.
The commands of Colonel Cummings and Lieutenant-Colonel Braz-elton proceeded to the salt works in Clay County and loaded their wagon train with all the salt there—200 barrels—and returned with it without any incident of note. The works belong to Lincoln men, but Colonel Cummings was instructed to receipt for it, which he did.
It appears certain that a portion of the enemy’s force at Laurel Bridge was from Camp Dick Robinson, and there is reason to suppose that a considerable force has advanced from that camp towards London, but of this I have no reliable information. I have not yet had an opportunity of getting detailed information from the officers of the character of the roads, the topography of the country, temper of the people, &c., but learn that the people seem hostile, and that the roads have numerous mountain defiles.
I regret to have to report that I learn that some of our soldiers committed discreditable trespasses on the property of private citizens on the route, which I will investigate and endeavor to have properly punished. It will tend to thwart progress I was making in conciliating masses of ignorant people here who were hostile because they were told we would have no respect for their personal or property rights.

On the same morning I sent Colonel Cummings’ regiment and Lieutenant-Colonel Brazelton, with a part of his cavalry battalion, to the

salt works, in Clay County, to fill a train of wagons with salt. The population in those counties is hostile, and 1 considered the first expedition favorable to masking the second, while both would procure me valuable information of the country.
The first expedition drove in the enemy’s pickets some distance this side of the bridge, broke up their camp, captured part of their baggage, consisting of 8,000 cartridges, 25,000 caps, 3 kegs of powder, 6 barrels of salt, 25 pairs of shoes, 2 wagons and teams, 3 oth6r horses, and 3 prisoners, including 2 of their cavalry pickets. They gave them ineffectual cbase several miles through London and a few miles beyond.*
The second expedition obtained 200 barrels of salt, all that was at the works, and returned without notable incident. The works belong to Lincoln men, but I caused it to be receipted for, with the expectation that the Confederate Government will pay for it at the price at the works—forty cents per bushel. The scarcity of the article in the Confederate States makes the acquisition a valuable one to the Army.
I regret to have heard of irregularities among the soldiers on these expeditions in trespassing upon private property, which I will investigate and have severely punished. The population in these counties is an ignorant one, and much prejudiced against us by misrepresentation. I have made some progressin conciliating them, but I fear this conduct will tend to defeat such object.

Report of Col. William A. Soslans, Twelfth Kentucky Infantry.
Camp at Albany, September 29,1861.
Sir : On my arrival at this place on yesterday I found it occupied by the Home Guards of Clinton and Bussell Counties, the Confederate troops having evacuated the same; after appropriating such of private and public property as they chose returned to their encampment, distant from this place 20 miles.
Among other things which they captured were 30-odd Home Guard muskets and 3,000 rounds of B. and B. cartridges.
The promptness with which the Home Guards of Russell came to the relief of the people of this county is deserving of all praise, as also their heroic conduct in replanting and standing by the colors in the presence of such danger, with a foe outnumbering them ten to one, from which they were momentarily expecting an attack.
On my arrival at Mouticello, learning that the Confederate troops contemplated reoccupying Albany, I deemed it best to call to my aid the Home Guards of Pulaski County, as also those of the counties of Lincoln, Casey, and Bussell, under the command of Col. J. L. Barnes.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap NIL
They responded to the call, and joined us this morning by forced marches with a force of 184 men, to which they are hourly receiving accessions.
To-morrow I shall expect re-enforcements of some 200, making in all 800 effective men, of which number 100 cavalry from Camp Dick Iiob-inson and 100 from Hustonville and Liberty.
This morning I received information that the Confederate forces wrere forming another encampment at Travisville, distant from us 13 miles; accordingly I ordered Captain Morrison to take the effective force under his command and proceed to that point, and after reconnoitering sufficiently to satisfy himself that the number was not too great to justify an attack, to take them by surprise, order a surrender, which, should they refuse, to fire upon them.
In obedience to my orders he proceeded to that point as directed. In about two hours after Captain Morrison left camp Lieutenant Adams joined us, as also the Home Guards of Hustonville Cavalry. I ordered a detail of 15 men from the company under command of Lieutenant Adams and 30 from the Hustonville Home Guards, which were placed under command of Major Brents, and he ordered to proceed to Travisville, to support Captain Morrison in the event he was repulsed; but before reaching that point Captain Morrison had surprised the camp, finding about 100 troops, which, being ordered to surrender, fled, when they were fired upon and 4 killed, the balance effecting their escape by fleeing to the hills.*
'#*#####
They also took 4 prisoners, 2 of whom, as also 2 horses, were captured by Thomas Huddleston, a private in Captain Morrison’s company; after accomplishing which, to use his own expression, “He looked for more, but they had all fled.”
Among the officers with Captain Morrison were Lieutenant Miller, Sergeants Hay, Carr, Chilton, Smith, and Howard. The prisoners were brought this side the line, when, after taking a solemn obligation to prove faithful to the United States Government, they were released.
The promptness with which the Hustonville Home Guards obeyed my order to join in the hazardous expedition is deserving of honorable mention. But for our timely arrival the Confederate troops, I have no doubt, would now have been in possession of this place, as they were to move in this direction on yesterday.
This morning their plan was to gather their forces at Camp Monroe, when they were to divide their forces into three divisions; the smaller force of cavalry was to make a feint upon this place, while the other tw o divisions were to move one on Monticello and the other on Burkes-ville, Cumberland County.
I have ordered the blockade of the road leading to Monticello, by the destruction of a bridge, the felling of timber, &c., while I have also ordered the Home Guards of Cumberland to hold themselves in readiness to meet the attack; and- should they attempt to execute their plans, if wTe can repulse the party attacking this place, we will move in the rear of the party attacking Burkesville.
Should they delay the attack until I shad be sufficiently strengthened by re-enforcements to move from cover, I shall proceed to blockade all the passes leading into this place and erect a fortification. So soon as that is accomplished I shall leave some one in charge and return to camp.
The cavauy from Camp Dick Rooinson is too mucn fagged to return for several days.
List of property captured omitted.

I send you herewith copies of orders issued since I assumed command, as also a map of roads, &c., which will enable you the better to comprehend our position.
I am apprehensive that the attack on their camp to-day may provoke the enemy to hasten their movements on us; anticipating which, I have called for re-enforcements from this and the neighboring counties.
From the most reliable information obtained, they have 1,180 men, distributed in the following order: At Camp Bledsoe, 80 cavalry; Good Pastures, 200; and 900 at camp beyond Monroe; all of whom I learn are but poorly armed, with no artillery.

General : I wrote you on the 22d, giving the substance of General Schoepf’s report of the events of the 21st at Rockcastle Hills. I have just received another dispatch from him, in which he reports that his scouts had just returned and report the enemy “have fully retreated in the direction of London. Our loss is ascertained to be 4 killed and 18 wounded. On examination of the battle ground I set the enemy’s loss down at 30 killed, with a large wounded list—the latter taken by them off the field (as I learn from an intelligent citizen in the vicinity), except 3, who were brought into our camp and properly cared for; 1 since dead. Our wounded are doing well.
“The 3 prisoners, all examined separately by myself, gave the same statement relative to the strength of the enemy, viz, about 7,000. The enemy fought well, approaching to within about fifty yards of our muskets with shouts and cheers, which were promptly responded to by our men, under the immediate command of Colonels Coburn and Wolford.
“ In the pocket of one of the wounded prisoners was found a letter to the commander of a secession Tennessee regiment, urging him to send forward his regiment to the relief of General Zollicoffer. I have just learned from a citizen on the route of the retreating enemy that they acknowledged a loss of 100 killed.”
I shall begin to move the depot to-morrow as far to the front as Crab Orchard, and advance troops to or beyond London as soon as I possibly can. Although I have sufficient ammunition for a battle, I would be obliged if you will have my requisition of the 12th instant filled and sent forward as soon as possible. I find a rumor in the papers that General Lee will supersede Zollicoffer. If he does, I should wish to be prepared for him fully. The canister and grape have reached liere tonight, and I will forward them to morrow.
The contractors, Theodore Comstock, of Columbus, Ohio, and Heil-debach, Seasongood & Co., of Cincinnati, have violated their contracts, copies of which I inclose, as well as copies of my letters to them. The man Comstock had money placed in the hands of Jones Brothers & Co., to be paid to him as soon as his overcoats were received, yet he has never delivered the five hundred. The Cincinnati firm furnished a few things, but have failed to deliYer anything since the 18th. I fear from what I can learn that they were led away from the path of common honesty by the tempting offer of the governor of Ohio. He pays them $10 for each overcoat.

General : I have reliable information that the enemy have retreated to Laurel Bridge, 9 miles south of London, and are moving southward. I have conversed with intelligent persons from the vicinity of London, thence to Cumberland Gap, and am of the opinion that I can advance to that point (Cumberland Gap) and scatter the forces of Zollicoffer en route1 and by turning the Gap get and hold possession of it, and perhaps the great railroad from Richmond, Ya., and Manassas to Memphis and the South. Shall I do it? Should such movement meet your approval, I would suggest that all the re-enforcements which can possibly be spared from Camp Dick Robinson be sent forward, a depot of supplies (on a small scale) be established at Crab Orchard, and a similar one at Wild Cat (my present position), upon which 1 could fall back in case of an emergency. I am credibly informed that supplies can be obtained for my present (or larger) force between this point and Cumberland Gap. Hon. Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee, is of this opinion. I shall await your orders.

Report of Col. John Coburn, Thirty-third Indiana Infantry.
Hdqrs. Thirty-third Reg’t Indiana Volunteers,
Camp Wildcat, Ky., October 22, 1861.
Sir : In pursuance of your orders to take possession of and occupy an eminence on the east of this encampment, on the morning of the 21st of October I took Company D, Captain McCrea; Company I, Captain Hauser; Company E, Captain Hendricks, and Company G, Captain Dille, of the Thirty-third Indiana, comprising in all 350 men. The companies were immediately deployed around the hill as skirmishers. In less than 20 minutes the rebels, who were concealed in the woods, commenced firing, when at almost the first fire Private McFerran, of Company D, was killed. In 10 minutes more the enemy appeared in front of our position to the south at a distance of half a mile in the valley. They were in large numbers, and were over half an hour in passing by an open space in the woods, when they formed again in line. They soon came near us under cover of a wood, which entirely concealed their approach until we were apprised of their presence by the firing of musketry. At this time we were re-enforced by a portion of the Kentucky cavalry, dismounted, under Colonel Wolford, about 250 strong, who immediately formed and took part in the engagement. The firing at this time was very severe, which caused the cavalry to waver and retreat. They were soon, however, rallied and formed again in order, and fought with good spirit. The enemy engaged was composed of a portion of General ZollicoffePs command, and consisted of two Regiments of Tennesseeans, under the command of Colonels Newman and Cummings. They charged up the hill upon us, and were met by a galling and deadly fire, which wounded and killed many of them. The front of their column approached within a few rods of us with their bayonets fixed, declaring themselves uUnion men” and “all right,” at the next moment leveling their guns at us and firing. After being engaged nearly an hour the enemy retreated, bearing oil* a portion of their dead and wounded and their arms. Our men have buried (their dead left on the field and taken the wounded to our hospitals. /Thirty corpses have been found up to this time. A large number of 1 their wounded and dead were carried off in their wagons. It is safe to estimate the loss of the enemy at least 100 killed.
The bravery of the Thirty-third Indiana was well tested in this engagement. I am happy to state that universal courage, cheerfulness, and promptness marked their whole actions during the entire engagement. Too much praise cannot be given to the brave Captain Hauser, who continued fighting at the head of his men upon the brow of the hill until disabled by a wound. He, however, continued on the field during the day, doing his duty nobly. Captain McCrea, with his men, held a small breastwork, and did fearful execution upon the enemy. Captain Dille was active in rallying the men and urging on the fight in all parts of the field. Captain Hendricks, with coolness and courage, kept his men to their places, and fought without slackening his fire during the engagement. I cannot omit mentioning the bold and active Adjutant Durham, who was wherever duty called him. Lieutenants Maze and Scott were marked for their heroic bearing.
About the close of the engagement four companies of the Seventeenth Ohio, Colonel Connell, came upon the hill and formed in line of battle. Company E, Captain Fox; Company C, Captain Haines; Company K,

Captain Eea, and Company II. Captain Whissen, took their positions with promptness, eager for the fray, under the command of Maj. Durbin Ward, of that regiment. They remained on the field during the day and night, and assisted in completing the fortifications. About 2 o’clock p. m. we were again attacked. At this time the Fourteenth Ohio, Colonel Steedman, appeared upon the field. Company C, Capt. J. W. Brown, of the Fourteenth, immediately formed and opened upon the enemy, and this company, with others, also assisted in completing the fortifications. Afterwards Company G, Captain Eekles, and Company B, Captain Kirk, of the same regiment, came to our assistance. At 10 o’clock at night Lieutenant Sypher, of Captain Standart’s Ohio battery, came on the hill, and on an alarm fired three rounds. They were the last shots fired. At about 2 o’clock in the morning we heard sounds which betokened a movement of General Zollicoffer’s army. It proved to be a retreat. From a prisoner I have ascertained that his command consisted of two Tennessee regiments, two Mississippi and two Alabama regiments, together with a regiment of cavalry and a battery of six pieces of artillery. The number of our loss is as follows: Company D, 1 killed and 5 wounded ; Company I, 1 killed and 10 wounded, 3 mortally. Colonel Wolford lost 1 killed and 11 wounded. The forces now on the hill are in good spirits and ready for further service.
In conclusion, I must commejid the coolness, courage, and manliness of Colonel Wolford, who rendered most valuable assistance to me during the day.

The country is very poor indeed. The enemy occupy a strong position 8 miles ahead. We had a skirmish between pickets day before yesterday, in which we killed 1 man and captured another. We lost yesterday 1 man killed. We had a force yesterday 3 or 4 miles ahead, but, for want- of water, subsistence, forage, and transportation (our wagons having been by an accident detained at and near London), had to return here to camp.

Camp Flat Lick, Knox County,
October 24, 1861.
On the 21st I reached the enemy’s intrenched camp, on Rockcastle Hills, a natural fortification, almost inaccessible. Having reconnoitered in force under heavy fire for several hours from heights on the light, left, and in front, I became satisfied that it could not be carried otherwise than by immense exposure, if at all. The enemy received large re-enforcements.
Our loss was 42 wounded and 11 killed and missing. We captured 21 prisoners, about 100 guns, and 4 horses. The loss of the enemy in killed and wounded unknown.
The country is so poor we had exhausted the forage on the road for 15 miles back in twenty-four hours. Our subsistence nearly exhausted. Under these circumstances I deemed it proper the next day to fall back. Enemy’s camp said to be 7,000 strong, with large reserves near at hand.

ACTION AT ROCKCASTLE HILLS, KY., ETC.

Brigade Headquarters,
Camp Buckner, October 26, 1861.
Sir : I have information that the enemy were nine regiments at Eock-eastle Hills. They are thought to have large re-enforcements close at hand. The country is very poor generally between here and there, particularly beyond London. 1 learn that some signs of trouble are again arising in East Tennessee, as the impression increases That the enemy is soon to advance in force. The new levies I learn come in slowly. Could General William B. Caswell, who recently resigned when the Tennessee regiments were transferred, have a commission it would greatly promote the public interest. He has been very efficient in advising me to dispose matters properly in East Tennessee since I have been in Kentucky. He is a true gentleman, of high courage, sound sense, exemplary habits, and of popularity worth much in the present condition of affairs in East Tennessee.
The Log Mountains, between here and Cumberland Gap, will soon, I learn, become almost impassable. The road is now very bad. There is reason to suppose the enemy may advance by way of Jamestown, 120 miles below here, instead of by this route. I have seven cavalry companies watching that route; no infantry or artillery, two regiments there having been ordered away by General Johnston. If I get news of their approach in that direction I will proceed as rapidly as possible to meet them, and have already collected some stock of commissary stores in that neighborhood.
Very respectfully,

Camp Buckner, October 26, 1861.
I have fallen back to this position. I am reliably informed that there were nine regiments of the enemy at Bockcastle Hills on the 21st. Uncertain news that they were to cam]) at Laurel Bridge last night. Think there is danger they may advance by Jamestown, 120 miles from here. I have seven cavalry companies there; no infantry or artillery, Stanton and Murray being removed. Colonel Church well, at the gap, reports three 8-inch howitzers in position, but that the ordnance stores sent with them are totally insufficient, the shells not filled, &c. I fear we have no powder to fill them. Two Parrott guns have reached Knoxville and are ordered on. We much need an ordnance and competent engineer officer.

General W. E. Caswell, or Col. W. B. Wood, Knoxville, Tenn.: Being much embarrassed for want of transportation in some of the regiments and battalions, we made a march of only 10 miles to-day. Letters from Colonel Stanton and Major Bridgman, dated 11th and 12th, received this evening. They both think the enemy has retired from

Albany towards Columbia or Camp Dick Bobinson. My plan to get behind them and cut them off may be defeated; but Stanton’s regiment has now left for Bowling Green, and Bridgman returned to Post Oak Springs. What has become of the two companies of Colonel Brazel-ton’s battalion or of Captain Bledsoe’s company neither explains. Perhaps the latter is with Colonel Murray’s regiment at Camp Myers, in Overton County. This retiring of our forces may induce the Lincoln forces to return again. 1 wish the subsistence supply mentioned heretofore taken to Jamestown by the 25th instant; and you will order those cavalry companies to rendezvous in that neighborhood at the same time, that the subsistence stores may not be exposed. I must ask you to transmit from Knoxville the necessary orders to insure this and the inclosed letter to Colonel Murray.

Camp Ten Mile, 7iy., October 10,1861. Colonel Murray, Camp Myers :
Sir : I am 10 miles on the march toward a camp of the enemy on Bock-castle Biver, having left Cumberland Ford this evening with the greater part of my command. I learned that the enemy at Albany has retired. My plan has been to fall in their rear and cut them off. NTow that Colonel Stanton and our cavalry have left the neighborhood of Jamestown, the enemy may return in force near the line. 1 have ordered stores of subsistence for my troops to be placed at Jamestown by the 25th instant, and have ordered the same cavalry companies to return to that neighborhood almost the same time, to prevent the enemy from seizing and appropriating the stores. Perhaps the cavalry from above would not be sufficient to prevent an incursion. I expect to pass down by Somerset and Monticello or by Columbia and Burkesville, in the hope of capturing any forces they may be threatening your position with. As secrecy is the element of success, I must beg of you not to mention to any solitary person this enterprise. My object in writing to you is to ask you, about the 25th, to move in such a way as to insure, by the aid of the cavalry, the safety of the stores, until I can reach the neighborhood. Inform General Caswell at Knoxville what you can do, and he will communicate with me.

Report of Col. Taz. W. Newman, Seventeenth Tennessee Infantry.
Near Rockcastle Heights, October 21,1861.
As ordered, I formed my regiment from hill-top to hill-top at open intervals to move in rear of Colonel Rains’ regiment and support him. Lieutenant-Colonel Miller was ordered to take command of the left wing, composed of Companies A, D, F, and I, commanded by Captains Hoyle, Finch, Hunter, and Mathews, and for the movements of said companies upon the field I refer you to the report of Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, which is hereto appended and made a part of my report * The six companies, viz, B, C, E, G, H, and K, commanded by Captains Marks, McDearman, and Armstrong, and Lieutenants Davis, Holden, and Harrison, constituting the right wing, were undef my immediate command, and moved forward in line of battle in the direction of the heights in front of our position.
Upon reaching a point within eighty yards of the heights, we discovered a number of men ascending the heights and entering the fortifications, but supposing these men to be a portion of Colonel Rains’ command, I did not order them to be fired upon.
At this point we received a heavy volley of rifles and musketry. The command moved on, however, without returning the fire, until within forty paces of the enemy’s works, before we discovered they were not Colonel Rains’ men, at which time the men were ordered to cover as well as they could and to return the enemy’s fire. In this position we maintained a heavy fire for twenty-five minutes, when I ordered Captain Armstrong and Lieutenant Harrison to move their companies around to my extreme right, to prevent a flank movement of the enemy, which I saw they were about to make. These officers executed the order with promptness and alacrity under fire. The fire was kept up by all the companies for an hour and ten minutes, and seeing that it was impossible to fall back without great loss, I ordered the works to be charged. Four companies gallantly charged the works as ordered, officers and men seemingly vieing with each other as to who should be first to reach the works of the enemy.
After the fortification was reached, and many of my men had got within the works, driving the enemy from the first parallel, not receiv-

ing any support, and being nearly destitute of cartridges, I ordered my command to fall back, which it did in good order. While this was being executed the other two companies maintained their position as ordered.
I take pleasure in stating that the officers and men all acted with great coolness and firmness, such as would do credit to veteran troops, and for more than an hour sustained a heavy fire.

Report of Brig. Gen. William Nelson, U. S% Army.
Camp Wadsworth,
Hazel Green,, Ky., October 24, 1861
Sir : For the information of the general commanding, I have to report that on the 22d I ordered Colonel Harris, of the Second Ohio Regiment, and one section of Konkle’s light battery, and Laughlin’s company of cavalry, to move on West Liberty from the camp at McCormick’s Gap.
The morning of the 23d I marched with the Twenty-first Ohio Volunteers, under Colonel Norton, and Thirty-third Ohio Volunteers, under Colonel Sill, and four guns, and the train towards this place. I left the Twenty-first Regiment, the train, and one section of artillery on the Blackwater to follow me, and pushed on. Major Robinson, of the Thirty-third, with two companies, had marched the night previous, arrived here at four in the morning of the 23d, and made a complete surprise, capturing several of the most notorious secessionists in this vicinity.
The march of Colonel Harris on West Liberty was resisted by some hundreds, under a Captain May, but he drove them easily, and entered the town at 8.30 o’clock. He found a number of Union men confined in the jail and released them.
I will await the arrival of my train at this point. I am now in possession of both roads, and will move on to Prestonburg as rapidly as possible.

5 o’clock. Our advance guard was fired upon by the enemy’s pickets, and a general skirmish ensued, when the entire force under my command charged upon the camp, routing the enemy, capturing 14 prisoners, 3 of whom were released upon a parole of honor by me; the others were delivered to you. A number of the enemy were wounded and several reported killed.
All the officers and men under my command acted bravely. We returned to Cave City on the 25th without the loss or injury of a man.
The following contraband articles and property were captured, to wit: 1 gray horse, 11 muskets, 3 rifles, a small lot of ammunition, 3 drums, a lot of knives, &c., besides other articles that have never come into my possession. All of the above articles, &c., are subject to your order.

Headquarters U. S. Forces,
Paducah, Ky., October 31,1861.
Sir : Learning that a body of rebel cavalry were stationed at Saratoga, a small village about 4 miles from Eddyville, on the Cumberland River, and were harassing the loyal inhabitants, I detached on the steamer Lake Erie three companies of the Ninth Illinois Regiment (some 300 men), under command of Major Phillips, of the same regiment, to capture or destroy them. The U. S. gunboat Conestoga, Lieut. S. L. Phelps commanding, accompanied the detachment and rendered efficient assistance. The party landed a few miles below Eddyville, and after a toilsome march of some 12 miles, the ground being broken and rugged, made a partial surprise of the enemy, about 160 in number, who were in line and dismounted. Major Phillips advanced upon them at a double-quick step, and after firing a volley charged with the bayonet, when the enemy broke and fled. The result wrs the killing of some 7 of the rebels, including their captain (Wilcox), and wounding others as they made off, besides killing a number of valuable horses. Three of our party were severely though not dangerously wounded.
Major Phillips reports the capture of 20-odd prisoners, 30 horses, 8 mules, 2 wagons, with harness, saddles, bridles, &c., 30 muskets, several rifles and shot-guns.
The expedition seems to have been conducted with good judgment,

No. —.	)	Paducah, Ky., October 25, 1861.
In obedience to Special Orders, No. 71, from headquarters, three full companies of the Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, under command of Major Phillips, of the Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, with rations for two days, will parade at General Smith’s headquarters 15 minutes before 4 o’clock p. in., for detached service. The commanding officer will report in person to the commanding general for orders.
By order of Brig. Gen. E. A. Paine:
EMIL ADAM,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General,
I left the headquarters of the Ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteers with three full companies of the Ninth Regiment, viz: Company B, Captain Kueffher; Company H, Captain Armstrong; Company I, Captain Robinson. Details were made from other companies in this regiment to supply the place of those on duty from said companies, to give each company the full complement of men, and were paraded at the hour specified in the order in front of the headquarters of Brigadier-General Smith, from whence, in obedience to his order, we marched aboard of the steamer Lake Erie, and left the w harf at Paducah at 4.30 o’clock p. m. on the 25th instant, followed by the gunboat Conestoga, Captain Phelps commanding, to Smithland.
At Smithland the gunboat was sent in advance of the steamer Lake Erie up the Cumberland River to New Forge Landing, about 45 miles from the mouth of the Cumberland River, where we arrived about 3 a. m. of the 26th instant. The landing was effected with dispatch, Company B in advance, followed by Company H, Company I bringing up the rear. Great precaution was taken to prevent the knowledge of the landing of troops being carried in advance of their march, and by taking an unfrequented road we marched about 3 miles to a point almost due west from Eddyville, 3 miles distant. We then marched up the bed of a dry branch about 5 miles to the north, where we left the branch, and marched about 5 miles to the Princeton and Eddyville road, intersecting it at a point about 600 yards north of the village of Saratoga, at w hich place we expected to find an encampment of rebel cavalry, under Captain Wilcox. Our skirmishers succeeded in surrounding and capturing the rebel pickets without firing a gun, and the advance of our troops

was unsuspected by the rebels until we wheeled in column in platoon in the lane in full view, 600 yards distant from their camp, at about 7 o’clock a. m. They, to the number of about 160 men, dismounted, im mediately formed in line, awaiting our attack until we advanced within 200 yards of their line. We, when first coming in sight, having charged on them at the double-quick, they commenced an irregular fire when we were at the distance of 300 yards, but at our approach broke for their horses, though many took shelter behind fences, tfees, or houses. We charged to within 50 yards, halted, delivered a volley, and then charged bayonet, driving them from the houses and from their place of cover, and they then fled in every direction—some on foot, others on horseback. An occasional firing was kept up for half an hour or more. Six of their men were left dead and 1 mortally wounded. Several others were seen to ride off clinging to their horses, and were wounded.
We took as prisoners Lieut. J. F. Gibson, A. N. Bosarth, Eli Brennan, B. W. Gore, W. W. Hampton, Morton Rucker, Samuel Pearce, Joseph Parsons, George M. Coffer, James H. Roberts, Washington Rucker, Leroy YVatson, R. F. Frezell, Robert L. Beck, George E. Crum-bough, Joseph I. Hall, James S. Scott, E. Yion, James Glass, Andrew Duncan, and William Jinkins. We also captured at the camp of the rebels about 30 horses, 10 mules, about 40 saddles, about 30 bridles, 8 mule harness, 2 wagons, about 30 muskets, several rifles, and several shot-guns. We also took as prisoners near the place of action James Stom, James £t. Glasgow, and G. W. Hyatt, who live near our line of march, to prevent their giving information and because of their avowal of sympathy with the rebels. G. F. Jenkins, a notorious secessionist, was arrested near, and he had a son in the encampment. We also found with them several negroes, viz, Charlie, Onell, Willis, Melton, Ben, Jo, and Watson, all of whom and which we now have here.
Our wounded were Captain Kueffner, of Company B, slightly wounded with a buck-shot$ Corporal Gribling, of Company B, severely with a buck-shot, and Private Gatewood, of Company K, who was serving in Company H, severely wounded with a rifle ball. Among the killed of the rebels was Captain Wilcox, who commanded the company.
Too much praise cannot be given the men for the spirit and energy with which they made the difficult and laborious march, as well as their coolness and bravery during the fight, and where praise is alike due to all it is difficult to discriminate. The commanding officer of the detachment is under great obligations to Captain Phelps, of the gunboat Conestoga, for his assistance in facilitating the landing of the troops and captured property and prisoners.
We arrived from Eddyville on the steamer Lake Erie and gunboat Conestoga, with prisoners and captured property, at Paducah at 8 o’clock p. m. of the 26th instant.

Report of Lieut S. L. Phelps, TL S. Navy.
IT. S. Gunboat Conestoga, Paducah, Ky., October 27, 1861.
Sir : On the afternoon of tlie 25th instant, by order of General Smith, I left this place in company with the steamer Lake Erie No. 2, on board of which were three companies of the Mnth 'Illinois Kegiment, under command of Major Phillips, and proceeded up the Cumberland River upon an expedition to surprise a rebel camp near Eddyville, Ky., and have the honor to make known to you that the result was in the main successful.
I proceeded, with Major Phillips on board, in advance to Smithland, to procure guides and pilots, expecting that the transport would not approach the wharf boat; but the captain ran her to it, which rendered a change of plans necessary, and caused the force to reach the rebel camp at a later hour than was designed. The distance from Smithland to Eddyville by land is not half that by water, and the rebels have a complete system of runners established in that section of country. The transport was therefore sent up the Ohio a few miles, and the Conestoga followed an hour later, with two heavy barges in tow. These were cast off on reaching the transport, which was then taken in tow, with all lights out, fires screened, and engines stopped, by which precautions we succeeded in dropping down to Smithland and passing into the Cumberland without it being in the darkness of the night suspected that we had the steamer in tow. The two boats, after passing up to a safe distance, made all speed up a narrow and crooked stream, but did not reach and disembark the troops at the point selected till 3.30 o’clock a. m. I then had the transport moved to near the town and concealed behind a wooded point, while this boat was quietly anchored off* the main street, as had been done several times before in the past few weeks.
As soon as I felt satisfied that Major Phillips had had time to reach the rebel camp, a march of 7 miles over an exceedingly rough country, and in lanes and foot-paths, and that information of the force was reaching the citizens, I threw a force on shore and surrounded the town with picket guards, to prevent the escape of rebel citizens or the entrance and concealment of refugees from the rebel camp.
About 10 o’clock a. m. Major Phillips reached town with a number of prisoners, horses, wagons, arms, &e. He had got to within 400 yards of the enemy after daylight before being discovered, when the rebels formed in line. Our troops were moved at a double-quick to within 100 yards, when they delivered their fire and charged bayonets on the rebels, who broke and fled in every direction, leaving 7 killed on the field. Two of our soldiers wrere severely wounded and 1 or 2 slightly, among these a captain of a company.
I seized a flat-boat belonging to a noted secessionist of Eddyville, and it was freighted with the prisoners and plunder and towed to this place. The horses and mules were first placed on the wharf boat at the town, also secession property, but it was found to be too leaky and rotten for towing, when the animals were put on board the transport and 100 of the troops transferred to the Conestoga. There were taken in the rebel camp and brought to this place, which we reached last evening, 24 prisoners, 7 negroes, 34 horses, 11 mules, 2 transport wagons, a large nuin-

ber of saddles, muskets, rifles, shot-guns, sabers, knives, &c. A number of valuable horses were unavoidably killed in the skirmish at the camp.
Eddyville is 62 miles from Paducah, and the camp was 4 miles back of the town, at a place known as Saratoga Springs, and we were absent from Paducah 29 hours.
Major Phillips and the volunteers deserve the greatest credit for this successful daylight surprise.

miles from Hartford, and near Cromwell, on the river above mentioned, and sent out our scouts to ascertain the position and strength of the enemy, thinking to attack them before daylight Tuesday morning. Our scouts, however, failed to return in time to carry into effect our original plan.
A small portion of Captain Breathitt’s company of cavalry, under Colonel McHenry, with his force crossed the river and proceeded to Morgantown, where they encountered the enemy’s "pickets, and in the engagement Colonel McHenry lost 1 man, but wounded several of the pickets, all of whom, however, made their escape.
In the mean time I had ordered Captain better to join my command at Cromwell, but failing to make the junction, he crossed the river at and passed Morgantown in the direction of the enemy’s retreat, and about 1 mile distant from the town came upon the enemy’s pickets, who had been re-enforced to 60 strong, and with 20 men made battle, killing 6 of the enemy, without the loss of a single man.
In the mean time I moved the main body of my force over a mountainous and by a circuitous route, some 20 or 30 miles up the river to Woodbury, and there found the enemy encamped upon a summit commanding the surrounding neighborhood. They immediately formed in line of battle, but were soon thrown into consternation and dismay by a few rounds from one of Somerby’s 6-pounders. In the mean time a detachment was below after the ferry flat, the only means of transport across the river, and it was on the opposite side and in possession of the rebel pickets. They were engaged by Lieutenant Ashly, and those that were not killed were driven back and the ferry captured, and soon brought into action Captain Belt, with 85 infantry, supported by Captain Shaeklett, with 25 men; and Captain Porter, with the same number of Home Guards, was ordered over the river with one piece of artillery, under the immediate fire of the enemy. Our small-arms in the mean time were playing upon the enemy destructively.
The effort was an entire success. Captain Belt took position on and occupied the enemy’s battle ground (they having fallen back), which overlooked their encampments. A few shells were sent into their tents, and then charged by Captain Belt with bayonets, the enemy scattering in confusion and consternation, leaving behind them something like 50 killed, while others were wounded. A number of small-arms and shotguns were [found ?j, and 4 or 5 horses were the trophies taken, with 2 prisoners, whom I send to you by the bearer of this letter. Their tents, baggage train, magazines, &c., were destroyed
Learning that they had been re-enforced and were about to cut off McHenry’s retreat, we took up our line of march in double-quick and proceeded to join McHenry, 1J miles west of Morgantown, and made a stand for the enemy, but finding it was not their intention to attack us we fell back, crossed our forces over the river, and encamped [at] Cromwell’s Ferry.
It is due here to mention that we were joined by 150 Home Guards, who came to the rescue nobly, but disappeared at the approach of danger. Our men, from the greatest to the least, behaved nobly and fought bravely. It would be an idle pastime to eulogize their conduct and bravery. The rebels engaged were Mississippians, Alabamians, and Georgians.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. G. BURBRIDGE,
Colonel, Commanding Kentucky Volunteers.

Report of Col. John H. McHenry, jr., Kentucky Volunteers.
Cromwell, Ohio County, Kentucky,
On Green River, Kov cipher 3, 1861.
Sir: On Tuesday, 29th instant, hearing that the enemy had encamped 140 cavalry at Woodbury, a point on Green Kiver 25 miles above here, Col. S. G. Burbridge, with 2 pieces of artillery, 100 infantry, and 100 cavalry, went up Green Biver on north side. 1, in command of 100 men, under Captains Morton and Whittinghill, penetrated 7 miles on the south side of the river, where we met a scouting party, 14 in number, of the enemy, who fired on my men, killing 1 and slightly wounding 2 others. We killed 1 man and wounded 4 others. Captain Netter, of Colonel Burbridge’s regiment, with 20 men, advanced 1 mile farther, again met a small party and drove them back, with a reported, loss of 2 men. Colonel Burbridge in the mean time arrived at Woodbury and fired upon the enemy with his artillery. They immediately fled, leaving everything behind them. Colonel Burbridge destroyed their tents and joined the force under my command at Morgantown. We, fearing a re-enforcement from the enemy, recrossed the river at this point.
On Thursday, 31st instant, the enemy, about 200 strong, attacked the Home Guards, numbering about 30 men, and one company, under Captain Whittinghill, at this point, but by the gallant conduct of Captain Porter, with some 20 men, they were driven from the river, with three buggy loads of killed and wounded, we sustaining no damage. Captain Whittinghill was not at his post, and Lieutenant Bogers, with a few men, stood against the enemy and fought bravely until every one of them had disappeared. Colonels Jackson and Burbridge immediately came to my relief from Owensborough, to which place Colonel Burbridge had retired, and they are now encamped 6 miles from this place, on the Hartford road. Three hundred cavalry appeared in Bochester, 15 miles below here, on the 1st instant, but had retired at last accounts. Beliable information reached me that a considerable force of the enemy, numbering 3,000, had left Bowling Green in this direction on the 30th, and I have reason to believe will attempt by a rapid movement to destroy my camp at Hartford and get possession of the Government stores at that place.
An item of information reached me that the rebels had issued a proclamation at Bowling Green, calling upon the citizens of Warren County for 400 wagons and teams, and that their whole force had fallen back to this place.
1 take this method of expressing my gratitude to Colonels Jackson and Burbridge for the promptness and zeal with which they responded to my appeal, and to Colonel Burbridge for the bravery, discretion, and energy displayed by him in routing the enemy from Woodbury.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN H. McHENBY, Jr., Colonel, Kentucky Volunteers.
General W. T. Sherman.

Reports of Maj. James Hagan, Mississippi Cavalry.
Little Muddy Church Camp,
October 31,1861.
General : I have the honor to report that, in accordance with orders from headquarters, I left Bowling Green at 10 p. m. 29th instant, in command of a detachment of the Adams Cavalry. On my route during the night I met several detached parties, composing the command of Captain Lewers, all of whom gave such alarming accounts of the numbers of the enemy that it induced me to proceed with caution. I met Captain Lewers, who informed me he had abandoned his camp at Woodbury. I encamped for a few hours, with a view of resting men and horses and obtaining information, but could hear nothing but vague reports of a large force of the enemy having crossed the river, and were occupying Woodbury and Morgantown. I proceeded towards the former place. As I approached I met numbers of the inhabitants abandoning their homes. On my entrance, I made such disposition of my force as would enable me to discover the presence of the enemy without endangering the safety of my command, and proceeded in this manner through the town and immediate vicinity without opposition. I then learned that the enemy had left the night previous, taking the direction to Morgantown. This force was estimated at from 150 to 200 men, with two pieces of artillery. After securing the camp and garrison equipage left by Captain Lewers, and ordering back my wagons to this point, I proceeded in pursuit of the enern'y. As 1 approached Morgantown it became evident from the indications that the enemy were probably in position on the ground occupied by them in the affair with Captain Lewers. A reconnaissance of the hill, however, satisfied me that they had again retreated. I then entered Morgantown without opposition, and learned that a force of 400 to 450 infantry had crossed the river at Bora’s Ferry and occupied that-town for a few hours \ that this force, with the detachment that had crossed at Woodbury, had left the town the night previous, with the intention of recrossing at Bora’s Ferry. After satisfying myself that there was no opposing force in the immediate vicinity of the town, I returned to camp, which I reached at 9 o’clock last night. The force which crossed at Woodbury was commanded by a Colonel Burbridge; that which occupied Morgantown, by a Colonel McHenry.
From my present knowledge of the movements and position of the enemy I will consider the original order to thoroughly search the bend of the river as still in force, which I hope will meet with your approval. I will therefore proceed this morning on that duty, and will probably encamp to-night near Morgantown. I would here remark that the people generally in this section of the country are either sympathizers of the Lincoln Government, or so indifferent to ours that reliable information is difficult to obtain.
I would beg to state that in our operations of yesterday, when on several occasions, where a collision with the enemy was momentarily expected, both officers and men behaved with the greatest coolness and gallantry.
1 am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JAMES HAGAN.
Major, Commanding.
To Major-General Hardee.

Camp, November 2, 1861.
General : On the 31st ultimo I left my camp at the Muddy Creek Church and proceeded to Morgantown, where I left my wagons. I then directed my course to Bora’s Ferry, in the Big Bend of Green Biver, which I reached about 4 p. m. Some distance this side of the ferry I halted, and detailed 30 men, under Captain Harrison, of the Tensas cavalry (dismounted), with orders to approach the ferry under cover of some buildings, and, if possible, take possession of the ferryboat. Captain H. discovered that the enemy was on the opposite side of the river, with a guard of some 40 or 50 men. The moment our party was observed the enemy opened fire, which was promptly returned by us. The firing now became quite lively and lasted for about fifteen minutes, when the enemy rapidly retired from the banks of the river. During the engagement a force of about 100 men were evidently opposed to us. I re-enforced Captain Harrison by 30 more dismounted troopers, under Captain Phillips, of the Ouachita Bangers. Lieutenant Roane, commanding the Yieksburg company, I ordered to our left, to meet some men who were observed to escape in that direction. A portion of Captain Bavesies’ company, with a detachment of Captain Lewers’ company, were ordered to the rear, under Lieutenant Cole, to prevent surprise from that direction. Captain Bavesies, with the balance of his company, dismounted and took an active part in the affair. Four of the enemy were observed to fall during the action and several more retired evidently badly wounded. On our part, I regret to state that three of our men were wounded, two severely and one slightly. I procured conveyances for the wounded, and returned to Morgantown, which we reached about 10 p. m., and encaipped there for the night.
On yesterday I intended going to Bochester, but learned from reliable sources that a force of mounted men had been detached on that service.
I have to report that there is no opposing force on this side of the river. It is reported, however, that a Colonel Hawkins, with a command of 800 men, threatens to cross and possess themselves of some point. The people are generally much opposed to our presence, and render assistance, either by information or supplies, with great reluctance. My men and horses, by our rapid marches and irregular supplies, are nearly worn-out. I have therefore determined on returning to our camp at Bowling Green, when I will report in person at headquarters.
I beg to express my acknowledgments to Captains Harrison, Phillips, Bavesies, and Lieutenant (commanding) Boane, and the officers and men under their command, for their prompt and energetic co-operation during the scout, and particularly for their coolness and gallantry during the affair at the ferry. Mr. Warren Hines, our guide, also rendered faithful and valuable services, and I recommend him particularly to your notice.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major, Commanding Detachment Adams Cavalry.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
affair of yesterday between a Federal force and my command in the immediate vicinity of Woodbury:
My command had been, as usual, diligently employed in scouting the country adjacent to Morgantown, the ferries, and the Bend of Green Eiver, near Woodbury, with a view of observing the movements of the enemy.
Yesterday morning (29th) two scouting parties were dispatched from my command. One, under the command of Lieutenant Bondurant, proceeded in the direction of Morgantown, and after passing that point at the distance of about 1 mile and on reaching the crest of a steep and rocky hill they unexpectedly found themselves in the immediate presence of a superior force of infantry under cover on both sides of the road. After a brisk exchange of shots Lieutenant Bondurant withdrew his party in good order and returned to make his report.
The casualties in this affair were as follows: Of Lieutenant Bondu-rant’s party, 3 wounded, 1 severely and 2 slightly; on the part of the enemy, 1 killed, several wounded.
Immediately upon the return of Lieutenant Bondurant, I proceeded to the point indicated with Lieutenants Doniphan and Brown and 60 troopers. Before reaching Morgantown, and while moving in that direction, my advance guard came upon the enemy in increased numbers, posted on the crest of a rugged hill, accessible only by the road. The enemy in this instance were under the command of a man named Aetter. They had been joined by the Union men of Morgantown and vicinity and by members of an organization styling themselves Home Guards.
The enemy opened fire upon the advance guard, which withdrew without injury and joined the command, then halted at the base of the hill. I then divided my command, sending one-half to the right, with a view of engaging the enemy’s attention in that direction while I could charge him by the road in front.
I soon ascertained that we were unable to effect anything against the enemy posted as they were. We were fully in range of their Minie muskets, without being able to reach them with our guns and repeaters, while at the same time we found the ground of such a character as to prevent our ascending the hill except at a walk, and completely exposed to the fire of their entire force. One man and several horses having been wounded, I deemed it proper to withdraw and return to my camp.
Upon my return, I learned from reliable authority that a combined force of cavalry, artillery, and infantry, from a Lincoln camp near Oaney-ville, was approaching with a view of attacking me about sunset. This information was corroborated by the fact that the women and children of the Union men were being removed from Woodbury.
In about an hour the enemy opened fire with several pieces of artillery from the opposite side of the river on a portion of my command guarding the ferry, and commenced crossing under the fire of his guns.
The wounded having been sent forward to Bowling Green, and knowing my position to be untenable, the enemy having obtained the range of my camp with his artillery, I withdrew my command, and proceeded in the direction of Bowling Green. Ten miles from my camp I met Major Hagan with re-enforcements. My command returned with him, except some few troopers whose horses were broken down.
I cannot state with any degree of accuracy the enemy’s force, but from the most reliable information that could be obtained and from the close

proximity of the several Lincoln camps at Caneyville, Hartford, Porter’s, and other places, it may safely be estimated as exceeding 500.
The sentiment of the neighborhood in which I was stationed being almost exclusively inimical to our cause, the enemy was always in possession of the most accurate information as to our strength and movements.
I regret to have to report the capture of two of my command, who were stationed as pickets on the Morgantown road, the loss of several troop horses, and the leaving of two wagons, several tents, and some camp and garrison equipage in camp as a matter of necessity. In our withdrawal, the road being held by the enemy, our line of march was necessarily across the country and impracticable to wagons.
The conduct of the officers and men of the command throughout the day was excellent.

Headquarters Camp Hopeless Chase,
Piketon, Ky., November 10,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report, for the information of the commanding general of the department, that on the 7th November I dispatched Colonel Sill, with his own regiment, the Thirty-third Ohio, and light battalion under Major Hurt, Kentucky volunteers, composed of a flank company from each of the regiments—the Second, Thirty-third, and Fifty-ninth O. V., U. S. A.—and two Kentucky companies, together with 142 mounted men, under command of Colonel Metcalf, Kentucky volunteers (made up of men mounted from the wagon teams), and 36 gentlemen, volunteers, under Colonel Apperson, and a section of artillery, to march by the way of John’s Creek, and pass to the left of Piketon, where the rebels had taken post—a distance of 40 miles—and turn or cut them off. Colonel Sill marched at 11 a. m. on the 7th. At 5 a. m. of the 8th I marched, with the Second Regiment O. V., XL S. A., Colonel Harris; Twenty-first Regiment O. Y., U. S. A., Colonel Norton; Fifty ninth Regiment O. V., IT. S. A., Colonel Fyffe; the battalion of Kentucky volunteers under Col. Chas. A. Marshall, and two sections of artillery, Captain Konkle, and took the State road direct to Piketon— 28 miles. Some 8 miles from Prestonburg we met a picket of about 40 cavalry and fired on them, but having no cavalry, they escaped easily.
At 1 p. m. the column had advanced along the narrow defile of the mountain that ends at Ivy Creek. The mountain is highest along the 15 R R—VOL iv

river and very precipitous and thickly covered with timber and undergrowth, and the road, which is but 7 feet wide, is cut along the side of it about 25 feet above the river, which is close under the road. The ridge descends in a rapid curve and very sharp to the creek, or rather gorge, where it makes a complete elbow. Behind this ridge, and all along the mountain side, the enemyf 700 strong, lay in ambush, and did not tire until the head of Colonel Marshall's battalion, himself leading, was up to the elbow. The skirmish was very sharp. The mountainside was blue with puffs of smoke, and not an enemy to be seen. The first discharge killed 4 and wounded 13 of Marshall's men. 1 ordered the Kentuckians to charge. Colonel Harris, whose regiment was immediately behind me, led his men up the mountain-side most gallantly, and deployed them along the face of it. Colonel Norton, whose regiment had just reached the defile, anticipating an order from me, led his men up the northern ridge of the mountain and deployed them along the face of it and along the crest, and went at them. Two pieces of artillery were got in position in the road and opened upon them. Owing to the steepness of the mountain all this required time. On the opposite side of the river, which is here narrow, deep, and swift, there were also rebels, who annoyed us. In an hour and twenty minutes the rebels
were-----and fled, leaving a number of killed and wounded on the ground
and 6 prisoners unhurt. As I marched immediately in pursuit, I do not report what their loss was. I am told to-day that 32 dead were found. Among the wounded in our hands is H. M. Bust, late State senator from Greenup County, Kentucky. Our loss is 6 killed and 24 wounded. If I had here any cavalry I would have taken or slain the whple of them; as it was, the enemy retreated, cutting down trees across the narrow road and burning or cutting all the bridges, which are numerous. I bivouacked 4 miles beyond the Ivy Creek. It rained, and the men waded through mud and iu a heavy rain all the day of the 9th, the march being heavy and slow on account of the trees across the roads and the necessity of repairing the bridges. Last night we again bivouacked in the November rain and entered this place this morning at 9 a. in., where I found Colonel Sill, who had arrived the night previously and fired on the enemy as they were retreating. I inclose Colonel Sill's report.

Report of Col. Joshua W. Sill, Thirty-third Ohio Infantry.
Piketon, November 10, [1861].
Sir : I have the honor to report that my command occupied this place yesterday afternoon about 4 o’clock. Colonel Metcalf’s mounted force, in advance, exchanged shots with a party, probably ar reconn oiteriug one, who had just crossed the river. They retreated. I threw out Metcalf’s and Hurt’s force, deployed as skirmishers, on the hill-side flanking the road, which debouched at the ford. They found the enemy’s camp deserted, and the main street of the village occupied by mounted men, making ofl' by the Shelby road. A few rounds of shell were sent after them, and Metcalf’s men mounted their horses and took possession of the town. The remainder of the force crossed on a raft bridge. I learned that the enemy were occupied all of yesterday leaving. General Williams was here when the skirmishers opened fire. I now occupy his headquarters. The only casualty that I know of was 1 man killed on this side. On the route we encountered a party of mounted men twice. The first time our fire killed a horse and wounded 2 men. Night before last a reconnoitering party of 10, sent out by Colonel Metcalf, encountered Captain Shawn’s cavalry, of about 150, and, it is reported, wounded Captain Shawn. His party went back in great haste. There are many particulars I will speak of when I meet you.
Troops are very hungry. All that we can get is beef. There is a mill near here, which we will set in motion to-day, and get plenty of corn meal.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 6th instant. In reply, I have to say that no one can regret as deeply as myself the necessity of evacuating Prestonburg, but I was forced to do so from the unarmed and unorganized condition of my troops. The enemy has pressed me so hard that I have not even had time to complete the muster rolls of the companies. At Prestonburg we had not two rounds of ammunition, and the enemy was advancing in three columns, in front and upon both flanks. 1 fell back to Piketon to meet my ammunition. On yesterday I was compelled to make a fight to protect our retreat. The engagement was sanguinary, lasting about four hours. Our loss, I believe, was 10 killed and 7 or 8 wounded. The enemy’s loss was heavy—could hot have been less than 150 killed and a large number wounded, for the road was strewn with men and horses. We had only about 300 men. The enemy had not less than 1,500—-most probably 2,000—with six pieces of artillery. They were at first checked, but on account of their great superiority of numbers they were able to outflank us, and our force was compelled to fall back. The enemy did not pursue. They are also

advancing upon this place, upon the John’s Creek road, from Louisa. On yesterday Captain Holliday, with a small command, met this column from John’s Creek. A skirmish took place. I sent him a re-enforcement of 200 men, which checked their advance. The night was occupied in preparing to fall back in the direction of Pound Gap, but our transportation is so limited that we shall be compelled to abandon some public property. The enemy is perfectly equipped, with plenty of artillery. They are well instructed, and fight with courage. We have nothing in the world upon our side but bravery. The disparity in the loss was due alone to our position. Infantry armed with rifles are the men for this country. Cavalry is almost useless, except for picket duty.
With regard to the point at which we will be likely to meet I cannot say positively. 1 shall continue to fall back until I can make a stand or am re-enforced. Our route will be towards Abingdon.*
We have now nine companies of infantry, four of them not yet full, and five companies of mounted men, and two of these not full—making in all an aggregate of 1,100 men, poorly armed and badly clothed, and with scarcely any discipline.
Allow me to congratulate you upon your appointment.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
JM). S. WILLIAMS,
Colonel, 0. 8. Army.
Brig. Gen. Humphrey Marshall, Wytheville.
Camp near Pound Gap, November 13,1861.
General : Since my last report to you I have been compelled to abandon Piketon by an overwhelming force that advanced upon me in two columns, one directly up the river from Prestonburg, 1,600 strong, with a battery of six pieces, and the other from Louisa up John’s Creek, a branch of the Sandy, numbering 1,800 men, with a battery of field pieces. Both of these columns converged upon Piketon.
My whole force consisted of 1,010 men, including sick, teamsters, and men on extra duty. I did not believe that the advance of the enemy would be so rapid, and hoped that the artillery and re-enforcements promised wTould arrive before they could disturb me at Piketon. Under this confident hope I commenced gathering supplies, explored the leather resources of the country, found them abundant, and organized a corps of shoemakers, and had them at work. Major Hawes had purchased 1,000 fat hogs and a number of beef cattle, and wras making preparations to salt them. My men were badly clad and badly armed, with not a knapsack, haversack, or canteen. They carried their powder in horns, gourds, and bottles. This was our condition when the enemy commenced the advance upon us. Retreat was inevitable, but there was too much public property to be abandoned without an effort to save it. I at once ordered all the transportation possible to be collected, and sent the sick, wounded, and the live stock to the rear on the Pound Gap road, for the Tazewell route was no longer safe. I sent a small armed force immediately on the Tazewell route with written orders to turn back the artillery and all public wagons to a point of safety in Virginia. I then sent Captain Holliday, with a small mounted party, on the John’s Creek road, and Captains Thomas and

Clay on the River road to Prestonburg, to observe the movements of the enemy. This was on the night of the 8th. Captain Thomas discovered the advance guard of the enemy about 15 miles from Pike-ton. I went in person with Captains May and Hawkins, with their companies of infantry, and Lieutenant Yan Hook, with 20 mounted men, to the position of Captain Thomas, near Ivy Creek. I found that Captain Thomas had burned the bridge there. The men were allowed to refresh themselves and the horses were secured in a deep mountain cave, and the whole party of 250 men moved on foot to a strong position half a mile in front of the burned bridge, here to await what we supposed to be the advance guard of the enemy’s force.
I returned to our camp at daylight and met the report of Captain Holliday, who had been fired upon by an advanced guard of the enemy of about 150 men. He gave them a gallant fight, killed 8 of them, having only 1 of his number wounded and 1 horse killed. I dispatched Captain Shawn, with his own and Captain Cameron’s companies, to observe the movements of the enemy on John’s Creek, with instructions to engage any party not more than twice his number, but not to attack the enemy’s full force.
At 1.30 o’clock on the 9th instant the enemy moved up to Captain May’s position [Ivy Creek] with a force of 1,600 men and a battery of six pieces, and were received by 250 rifles and shot-guns, in point-blank range, every one of which took effect. Their column wavered and fell back, but returned in good order, and attempted to carry the pass by assault under cover of their cannon, but were repulsed again with terrific slaughter. They then withdrew beyond the range of our shot-guns, and their infantry up the hills soon outflanked our little band, compelling them to fall back behind the burned bridge. Here our force made a stand, but the enemy advanced no farther. I then ordered three more companies of infantry to sustain Captain May’s command or to cover his retreat if necessary.
At 12 o’clock at night Captain Shawn reported to me that the enemy were advancing in full force on the John’s Creek road with great rapidity. I then ordered Captains May, Shawn, and all the outposts in. I made a display of forces in Piketon, sent the exhausted infantry in the direction of our retreat, and waited with the balance of the command the arrival of the enemy. They came up slowly and cautiously, but were detained for an hour by Captain Thomas’ company of sharpshooters, stationed near the ford, which prevented their artillery from getting into position to rake the town. As they approached I moved the rear guard of 400 men off* in good order. They opened upon us a tremendous fire of artillery and musketry, and were replied to by our sharpshooters. We had 1 man killed and 3 wounded, while the enemy had 6 killed.
In the Ivy fight our loss was 10 killed, 15 wounded, and 40 missing. Some of the missing men have gone back to their homes, and others join us daily. We lost Lieutenant Rust, who fell gallantly in the discharge of his duty. My first belief was that the enemy had lost but 150 men, but from subsequent information received from spies, Union men, escaped prisoners who have joined us, and others who have examined their burial ground, I am satisfied the enemy lost over 300 in killed, with the usual proportion of wounded. I cannot speak in terms of commendation too high of the gallantry of Captains May, Thomas, Hawkins, and Clay, and Lieutenant Yan Hook and Sam Clay. Indeed, the officers and men behaved with so much courage and coolness that to discriminate at all would be invidious.

If we had had 1,000 men more and a battery of six pieces we could have whipped and destroyed both columns 5 but with the small force I had it was impossible to fight both at once, and to have exposed my whole force to one would have exposed my rear to the other. Our cartridge-boxes arrived the other day after the fight. We had powder and lead, and made our own cartridges and molded ofir own bullets.
The enemy have 6,000 troops near Piketon; 1,000 of them advanced 10 miles this side of that place. They have not more than 1,500 at Prestonburg. What they have below as reserves I know but little of, for all communication is cut off and the whole country is frightened out of its wits, and but few men will act as scouts or guides. I am satisfied that this large force was not moved up the Sandy merely for the purpose of dispersing the unorganized and half-armed, barefooted squad under my command. They intended to move upon the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, I think, by way of the Tazewell Court-House. They fortify their positions, and have a large number of wagons. The Sandy is now navigable for steamboats to a point above Piketon.
We want good rifles, clothes, great-coats, knapsacks, haversacks, and canteens—indeed, everything, almost, except a willingness to fight. Many of our men are barefooted, and I have seen the blood in their tracks as they marched from Ivy to this place. You know what we want, general. Send such articles as we need to Abingdon. There is but little subsistence here, and I fear I shall be compelled to fall back to a point where I can subsist until our organization is perfected. We have been so constantly fighting that we have not had time to complete our muster rolls. I have now over 1,200 men. If I could make a forward movement the effect would be good upon the country.
Mr. Thomas has just received from the governor of Florida a commission as aide-de-camp, with rank of colonel. I cannot insist on retaining him from such increased rank. Send somebody else.
If the enemy should move by way of the Pound I have not a sufficient force to resist them—no artillery, no intrenching tools, nor axes, spades, or picks. If they come we will give them a fight, but this will do us no good but to destroy a few of them.
I have just learned from a spy that a steamboat arrived at Piketon yesterday with supplies to the enemy.
Major Hawes wants more money. He has bought hogs, horses, wagons, &c.

enemy’s troops, but of the disaffected in North Alabama and East Tennessee.
I beg your excellency to use every exertion to ascertain the extent, power, and organization of this insurrection, if, as I fear, one exists; and most urgently I press your excellency to leave no means untried to put arms into the hands of your unarmed levies.
A. S. JOHNSTON,

Knoxville, November 9,1861.
Hon. J. P. Benjamin:
Two large bridges on my road were burned last night about 12 o’clock; also one bridge on the East Tennessee and Georgia Bailroad at the same time, and an effort made to burn the largest bridge on my road. There is great excitement along the whole line of road, and evidence that the Union party are organizing and preparing to destroy or take possession of the whole line from Bristol and Chattanooga, and unless the Government is very prompt in giving us the necessary military aid, I much fear the result. The only hope for protection must be from the Government. Unless the Government gives us the necessary aid and protection at once, transportation over my road of army supplies will be an utter impossibility. It cannot be done. We have arrested four of the individuals engaged in burning one bridge, and know who burned another, but for want of the necessary military force fear we cannot arrest them.
JOHN" B. BBANNEB,
President Past Tennessee and Virginia Bailroad.
Knoxville, November 9,1861.
J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir : I have just time to say that the bridge at Charleston over Hiawassee Biver, on East Tennessee and Georgia Bailroad, was burned last night by the Lincolnites, and that the bridge at Strawberry Plains, on East Tennessee and Virginia Bailroad, over the Holston, was set on fire and the guard badly, if not mortally, wounded. It shows that there is a concerted movement among them to destroy the railroad bridges and cut off communication from one portion of the Southern Conled-eracy with the other. A worse state of feeling never prevailed in East Tennessee than at the present moment. The belief that the enemy are about to enter our borders has emboldened them to such an extent that there is no telling what damage they may do. I believe it important that you should have this information at once. On this account I have thus hastily given you such information as I have obtained.
Very respectfullv,
B. G. FAINT, Brigade Commissary.

M. Millard, the representative of Sullivan County, Tennessee, by note, whose handwriting was testified to by George Pile and Jos. R. Anderson, I do hereby inform you that the bridge across the Holston was burned last night by about 50 Union men, and that a Union force is now assembling near Watauga Bridge, reported to number about 500, for the purpose of attacking Captain McClellan’s troops, now stationed at the bridge, and burning the bridge, and ask aid, as we are unable to form any idea of the result of this, and furthermore state that all communication between this place and Nashville by railroad and telegraph is cut off, and ask that you appeal to President Davis to call out the militia of East Tennessee to suppress rebellion.

Col. W. B. Wood,
Sixteenth A labama Regiment, Knoxville, Tenn.:
Sir : Your dispatch just received informing me of the burning of Hiawassee bridge and other bridges on the railroad, and asking for reenforcements. Colonel Powell’s regiment being 5 miles from here, on the Knoxville road, I have sent him an order to march at daylight in the morning for Knoxville, making a forced march. He is instructed*to communicate with you immediately on his arrival. You will be in command, and will make such disposition of the forces as you may think advisable.
Brig. Gen. W. H. Carroll’s three regiments have been ordered to report to me, but have not reported, and I have no knowledge where they are. I have expected them by now at Knoxville. Have you any knowledge where they are? Have the inclosed dispatches transmitted by telegraph, if the wires are not cut. Inform me daily of the facts in your knowledge connected with the wires and railroads. Send dispatch to Memphis or wherever else he may be.

Col. W. B. Wood:
Sir: I received a dispatch from General Zollicoffer last evening, dated 6th instant, at the Cumberland Gap, informing me that he would move his headquarters to Jacksborough, 9th. This dispatch came directly through by Huntsville, and I have dispatched him by the same route. I sent Captain Ragsdale’s company on the road near Huntsville several days ago, with instructions to break up the communication with the enemy that way. They attempted to arrest a mail-carrier in that section, and failed; he had absconded; they got his mail, arms, &c., and on their return to camp were fired on by 30 tories from ambush, killing 2 horses only. They sent to me for re-enforcements. I sent Captain ------, with company, night before last to their relief; have heard nothing from them since. From the best information I can get there are no Federal troops south of Cumberland River, except a small force of 300

or 400 five miles east of Monticello. I expect Colonels Stanton and Murray here to-morrow.
Yours, truly,
geo. e. McClellan-,
Lieutenant- Colonel.
Knoxville, November 10,1861.
General Zollicoffer:
Sir : Information has been received that Mr. Hodgson, a member of the legislature, has been making a treasonable speech over in Sevier County. He is also suspected as having a knowledge, if not an instigator, of the burning of the bridges. He was here yesterday morning, and we would have arrested him, but he made his escape, and may probably try to get through your lines somewhere. He ought to be arrested. Eive of the incendiaries who burned the Lick Creek Bridge have been arrested. I have sent up after them. The bridge at Union has been destroyed5 one at Charleston; two on the Western and Atlantic Eoad below Chattanooga.
Eegretting as much as any one this calamity, I feel that I did all that I could to prevent it, and I am glad that it is no worse. I had a company at Lick Creek, but the incendiaries deceived them, and getting possession of their guns, took them prisoners and accomplished their ends. I send you a Eegister, from which you will see some of the measures I have taken for the present as being necessary under the circumstances.
What shall I do with the prisoners ?
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. B. WOOD.
Loudon, Tenn., November 10,1861. Col. W. B. Wood, Commanding :
Dear Sir: Captain Cawood’s company arrived here at 6o?clockyesterday evening, and are pitching their tents to-day at the northern end of the bridge, while Captain Eidridge is encamped at the southern end. Extra pickets and sentinels were posted during the night, but no demonstration was made from any quarter, and the night was passed in quiet.
The Union feeling of this county is exceedingly bitter, and all they want, in my opinion, to induce a general uprising is encouragement from the Lincoln armies by the introduction or advance of Lincoln armies. They have a great many arms, and are actually manufacturing Union flags to receive the refugee Tennesseeans when they return. They are getting bold enough to avow their purposes. If we were strong enough, or had one or two more companies, a great many arms could be procured in this neighborhood. I mean if we had the force to spare from the bridge.
Yery respectfully,

There are two regiments—Trigg’s and Moore’s—now at Abingdon and Wytheville, if the men could be spared lor a few days.

General B. Bragg, Pensacola:
The President desires that you send one regiment of your command with the least delay to Chattanooga, with orders to report to Colonel Leadbetter, of Engineer Corps, who is charged with the special duty of restoring and maintaining the communications that have been interrupted by the burning of the railroad bridges by bands of traitors. He thinks it best to send one of the Alabama regiments now at Mobile, but leaves you to exercise your own discretion in choosing the regiment to be sent. This is so urgent as to admit of no delay, but the regiment will be restored to you the moment we can replace it. Other forces are dispatched from here to perform the same duty at Bristol, where another bridge has been burned.

to call upon the railroad companies, and also upon communities in vicinity of railroad, for aid and material, employing both where necessary, giving certificates usual in such cases. While reconstructing bridges and repairing the roads you will give due care to the telegraph communication, re-establishing it where interfered with, exercising in this the authority granted with regard to the road. To enable you to carry out these instructions Stovall’s battalion, with a light battery, will be ordered to report to you at Bristol, and a regiment ordered from General Bragg at Chattanooga, to be so disposed of as may best secure successful accomplishment of your orders. You will report to General A. S. Johnston by letter your arrival in Tennessee, the nature of your instructions, also advising General Zollicoffer to the same effect. Full and frequent reports are desired of your operations, respecting condition of the road, and disposition of the population adjacent thereto.

They have two cannon, which they found on the cars, and which were given to them by General Charles Clark, who stopped until this morning with them. The camp of the enemy is at NT. G. Taylor’s, 5 miles distant, with about 400 men. Another camp, at Elizabethtown, 2 miles farther, is said to contain 500 men. The two may be confounded. There is no doubt but that re-enforcements are every moment reaching them from Watauga County, North Carolina, and Johnson, Carter, and Washington Counties, Tennessee. These counties can furnish about 2,000 Lin-colnites, and each fresh occasion emboldens them. They threaten to burn Watauga Bridge to-night. Should they be successful, it will bring forward hundreds now quiet. It is all-important they should be disposed of before they unite their different forces, now ranging from 50 to 500. A fight occurred last night between 22 of our scouts and the main camp of the enemy. We captured 2, killed 9, and lost none. I have given orders for all trains to give way to the troop trains now coming forward. They will reach here to-morrow morning. Can I do anything for you ?

President Virginia and Tennessee Railroad.

Three bridges burned between Bristol and Chattanooga, two on Georgia road. Five hundred Union men now threatening Strawberry Plains. Fifteen hundred assembling in Hamilton County, and a general uprising in all the counties. I have about 1,000 men under my command.
W. B. WOOD, Colonel.
Knoxville, November 11,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:
Sir: My fears, expressed to you by letters and dispatches of 4th and 5th instant, have been realized by the destruction of no less than five railroad bridges, two on the East Tennessee and Virginia road, one on the East Tennessee and Georgia road, and two on the Western and Atlantic road. The indications were apparent to me, but I was powerless to avert it. The whole country is now in a state of rebellion. A thousand men are within 6 miles of Strawberry Plains Bridge, and an attack is contemplated to morrow. I have sent Colonel Powell there with 200 infantry, one company cavalry, and about 100 citizens, armed with shotguns and country rifles. Five hundred Unionists left Hamilton County to-day, we suppose to attack Loudon Bridge. I have Major Campbell there with 200 infantry and one company cavalry. I have about the same force at this point and a cavalry company at Watauga Bridge. An attack was make on Watauga yesterday. Our men succeeded in beating them off, but they are gathering in larger force, and may renew it in a day or two. They are not yet fully organized, and have no subsistence to enable them to hold out long. A few regiments and vigorous means would have a powerful effect in putting it down. A mild or conciliating policy will do no good; they must be punished, and some of the leaders ought to be punished to the extent of the law. Nothing short of this will give quiet to the country.

General Zollicoffer, at great inconvenience to himself, has sent me Colonel Powell’s regiment, numbering about 600 effective men, which I have disposed of as above stated. I have arrested 6 of the men who were engaged in burning the Lick Creek Bridge, and I desire to have instructions from you as to the proper disposition of them. The slow course of civil law in punishing such incendiaries, it seems to me, will not have the salutary effect which is desirable. I learn from two gentlemen just arrived that another camp is being formed about 10 miles from here in Sevier County, and already 300 are in camp. They are being re-enforced from Blount, Roane, Johnson, Greene, Carter, and other counties. I need not say that great alarm is felt by the few Southern men. They are finding places of safety for their families, and would gladly enlist if we had arms to furnish them. I have had all the arms in this city seized, and authorized Major Campbell to impress all he can find in the hands of Union men, who ought now to be regarded as avowed enemies, for the use of the new consumes. I felt it to be my duty to place this city under martial law, as there was a large majority of the people sympathizing with the enemy, and communicating with them by the unfrequented mountain paths, and to prevent surprise and the destruction of the commissary and quartermaster’s stores.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. B. WOOD, Colonel, Commanding Post
Jacksborotjgh, Tenn., November 11,1861.
General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : The communication of the 26th ultimo from your office, apprising me that three regiments, under command of Brigadier-General Car-roll, had been ordered to report to me, reached me only yesterday. The mail through this portion of East Tennessee is unreliable. I am under the necessity of establishing and relying upon a line of express messengers between my headquarters and Knoxville. Col. W. B. Wood, Sixteenth Alabama Regiment, is commandant at that post, and letters for me directed to Knoxville to his care will immediately reach me. General Carroll has just informed me, by letter from Memphis, that he has but one regiment armed. I telegraphed you yesterday the news communicated to me of the burning of the bridges. I learn to-day the telegraph wires are destroyed for about 15 miles. Colonel Wood also states that be has news that about 500 East Tennessee Federalists are marching on the Holston Bridge, a few miles above Knoxville, and that about 1,500 Federalists, of Hamilton County, are moving toward Loudon Bridge. 1 sent Colonel Wood a regiment, which probably reached Knoxville last night. I incline to the opinion the above-named reports are much exaggerated; but there are many indications that the Federalists in East Tennessee believe a large force from Kentucky are to invade us immediately and simultaneously at different points, and are intending, by concert of action in threatening the destruction of the railroad, to distract and derange our plans of defense.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
Memphis, Tenn., November 12, 1861.
J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: Your telegram of the 11th instant (ordering me to advance to the support of General Zollicoffer) has just reached me. I am deeply mortified that I have been unable to move my command at an earlier day, but the want of transportation, and the unexpected failure to obtain my arms, have rendered any movement of my forces both useless and unsafe. Knowing the urgent necessity which has and yet exists for prompt and vigorous action in East Tennessee and Northern Kentucky, I have used every exertion to place my brigade in such a condition as to act effectively in the field. I took measures some weeks prior to my appointment to secure arms sufficient to arm three regiments. These consisted of such guns as were furnished by the recruits themselves, together with others of a similar kind, which I had procured by various means throughout the country. Some two months since I distributed 1,600 rifles among the different armories in the State, viz, Memphis, Nashville, Pulaski, and Columbia, where I had supposed they would be rapidly repaired and fitted for use. When I received your written orders, forwarded me through Col. H. C. Young, I dispatched an officer to each one of the places mentioned, with instructions to forward all the guns that had been repaired to Knoxville, Tenn., to which point I had intended to advance with all my force then ready for service, but, much to my regret and surprise, I then learned but little progress had been made in the work of repairing. I was assured, however, by the army officers in command at these places that everything would be ready in a very short time. My movements were therefore delayed from day to day, in the hope that the guns would be completed and my command thoroughly and perfectly armed. In this expectation I have up to the present time been sadly disappointed. The guns deposited in the armory at this place would have been completed but for the breaking of the armory machinery, which was only repaired a day or two since. The work is now being pushed forward as rapidly as possible. So soon as I ascertained that my arms could not be obtained for some time to come, I set about securing such guns as would answer in the sudden emergency brought about by the recent unfriendly demonstrations made in East Tennessee. With these (shot-guns, country rifles, and old muskets) I armed Colonel Looney’s regiment, and moved it yesterday morning in the direction of General Zollicoffer’s position. Another regiment (Colonel White’s) was to-day armed in a similar manner, and will move to morrow in the same direction. The remainder of my brigade will be brought into the field as soon as I can possibly arm them in any way whatever.
I deem it proper to make this explanation of the causes which have so long kept me idle, in order that you may properly understand the difficulties under which I have labored. I shall continue to act as promptly as circumstances will permit. In the mean time I will keep you constantly advised of my future movements. I have apprised General Zollicoffer that my command is approaching to his support. When I shall have reached him, I have but little doubt that we will be able to quell the insurrectionary spirit which I learn is springing up in the eastern portion of our State and to hold in check any force which may be advancing from Western Virginia or Northern Kentucky.
Very respectfullv,
WM. H. CARROLL, Brigadier-General, G. 8. Army.

EE VOLT OF THE UNIONISTS IN EAST TENN.
239
Jonesborough, Tenn., November 12, 1861. His Excellency Jeffebson Davis, President, &c.:
Sir : Civil war has broken out at length in East Tennessee. In the late election scarcely a so called Union man voted. Neither Mr. Nelson nor any of the released men who had been sworn to be faithful to the Southern Confederacy voted upon the occasion, and there appeared a simultaneous assault upon our line of railroads from .Georgia to the Georgia line. In this county (Washington) the secession strength is about equal to the Union force, but our force is much weakened by five volunteer companies now in the service. In Carter and Johnson Counties, northeast of this, the Union strength is not only as formidable, but it is as violent, as that of any of the Northwestern Virginia counties. Had they the power not a secessionist would live in this region. The hostile element in those counties and also in Greene is so strong, that I give it as my firm conviction that it will neither abate nor be conciliated. They look confidently for the re-establishment of the Federal authority in the South with as much confidence as the Jews look for the coming of the Messiah, and I feel quite sure when I assert it that no event or circumstance can change or modify their hopes. In this state of affairs this part, and, indeed, all of East Tennessee, will be subjected during the war to apprehensions of internal revolt, more or less remote, as the tide of war turns in this direction. The recent bridge burning in this section was occasioned by the hope that the Federal troops would be here in a few days from Kentucky to second their efforts. We will crush out the rebellion here in a week or ten days, but to prevent its recurrence should be a matter of anxious consideration. Upon this subject I have the honor of making the following suggestions to your excellency :
The expatriation requiring alien enemies to dispose of their effects and leave with their families should be enforced. Should they not do so voluntarily, on proof being submitted that they were in arms or hostile to the Government they should be forced to leave on due notice, with their families. A man with his family with him in the North will do us no great harm. He will not enlist there, for he will have to support his family.
By removing the hostile element from our counties we have peace, and the Southern men can then enter the Army, because they know that their families are safe at home. By leaving this hostile element here we will never have peace, but be subject to constant alarm, these men rising up at every turn of events to harass us. I submit this suggestion to your excellency’s careful attention. There are now camped in and about Elizabethtown, in Garter County, some 1,200 or 1,500 men, armed with a motley assortment of guns, in open defiance of the Confederate States of America, and who are awaiting a movement of the Federal troops from Kentucky to march forward and take possession of the railroad. These men are gathered up from three or five counties in this region, and comprise the hostile Union element of this section, and never will be appeased, conciliated, or quieted in a Southern Confederacy. I make this assertion positively, and you may take it for what it is worth. We can and will in a few days disperse them, but when will they break out again % I am satisfied the only hope for our quiet and repose and our co-operation without hinderance in the present revolution is the expatriation voluntarily or by force of this hostile element.
I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. G. GEAHAM.

Organize into a regiment the eight companies remaining at Trousdale, arm them, have them mustered into service, and send this regiment to East Tennessee as soon as possible. Add the two companies as soon as they can be filled.
I approve heartily of the purchase of arms as proposed by you, but I cannot guarantee the payment. There is an appropriation of the Confederate Congress for the purchase of arms. No portion of this has been put at my disposal, nor have I any special authority to purchase arms ; but I do not doubt that in this emergency the Government will sanction my purchase, and pay for them if the appropriation is not exhausted, or appeal successfully for an additional appropriation if exhausted. In this expectation I have already authorized purchases for limited amounts.

I will have the pass blocked in two days. General Carroll has one armed regiment, but has not forwarded it.

Col. W. B. Wood, Knoxville:
Sir : I have cavalry scouts out on the road to Somerset and Williamsburg, which I expect in to-night. I have working parties back on the road from Jacksborough to Chitwood’s, 16 miles, and on the Big Creek road, 13 miles, which I do not wish to call in, if possible to avoid it. I have therefore thought it best not immediately to make any movement in reference to the reports you yesterday transmitted as to the 500 and the 1,500 tories. Unless you are satisfied the news is entirely reliable you should spare no pains, through cavalry scouts or citizen outriders, 16 r r—VOL iv

or true and reliable men living in the specified neighborhoods, to ascertain the precise facts, if possible, and transmit them to me, to General Cooper, to Lieutenant-Colonel Mackall, and to Brigadier-General Car-roll. I am in doubt whether my dispatches to those gentlemen were transmitted by telegraph. Please keep me advised as to the means of sending telegraphic dispatches.
The tories will probably circulate the most exaggerated and baseless stories, with a view to distract and cripple our movements. Our friends will readily give credence to them in apprehension of danger. It becomes us, therefore, to investigate these rumors and act cautiously, to avoid useless and harassing marches. I may send Captain Ashby’s squadron down the country to look after Clift; but I would prefer, before beginning to dispose of my forces, to see more distinctly the force and movements of the enemy, and to be informed how you are placing the cavalry and infantry at your disposal. If I am not mistaken, there are four cavalry companies with you or on the line of the railroad. Where are they now placed % I may soon move an infantry force much nearer the Loudon Bridge, but prefer to await certain knowledge of necessity for it.
Very respectfully,
F. K. ZOLLICOFFEB,
Brigadier- General.
Jacksboroudh, November 12, 1861.
Col. W. B. Wood, Knoxville:
Sir : The expressman reached me this evening at 9 o’clock with two letters from you, both dated 11th November. You say that the force at Papaw Hollow is augmenting from the adjoining counties. Please state what county Papaw Hollow is in. You say you inclose me a dispatch from John L. Hopkins, Chattanooga $ but ho dispatch was inclosed. I have two cavalry companies under Captain Rowan, near Oliver’s, on road from Knoxville to Montgomery, and two near Huntsville, on road from Chitwood’s to Montgomery; but your omission to send the dispatch of Hopkins and only incidental allusion to cutting somebody off near Kingston leaves me at a loss what orders to send them. Please give me all the information you have which will enable me to intercept any body of tories attempting to pass towards Montgomery, Jamestown, Huntsville, or Post Oak Springs.
I rejoice that you have caught six of the bridge-burners. I am yet unadvised what precise bridges are actually destroyed, or whether my intended telegraphic dispatches are really transmitted over the wires. Have you any news from Colonel Carroll’s regiment or any other re-enforcement? 1 will to-morrow send dispatches to the forces near Jamestown, the cavalry near Huntsville, that near Oliver’s, and start out the cavalry here, to commence simultaneously disarming the Union inhabitants. You will please simultaneously send orders to all detachments under your command to inaugurate the same movement at the same time in their various localities. Their leaders should be seized and held as prisoners. The leniency shown them has been unavailing. They have acted with base duplicity, and should no longer be trusted.
Very respectfully,

The Lincolnites are forming an encampment at Elizabethton; now have from 1,000 to 1,300 men, and more coming, within 6 miles of our railroad, at Watauga Bridge. They also have from 600 to 1,000 men near Strawberry Plains Bridge, the most important and expensive bridge on our road, and still collecting in greater numbers, and threatening to take and burn the bridge and take possession of the road.

Knoxville, Tenn., November 17, 1861. Lieutenant-Colonel Mackall, Bowling Green, Ky. :
Sir : Having blockaded the roads over the mountains near Jacks-borough, and believing the fortifications at Cumberland Gap very strong, I do not think an army train of the enemy can pass the mountains anywhere between the Pound Gap, in Virginia, and Jacksborough, a distance of about 120 miles. I have started the regiments of Colonels Statham, Newman, Cummings, and Battle, the first battalion of the Sixteenth Alabama Regiment, and Branner’s battalion of cavalry, with Rutledge’s battery, around by Wartburg, on the way to Jamestown, Tenn., and Monticello, Ky.
I came here rapidly last night to obtain more definite information of the state of things along the line of the railroad and among the tories generally. I will leave for Wartburg this evening, feeling that there is no necessity for remaining longer. General Carroll telegraphs me from Chattanooga that he is there with two regiments, half armed. I have ordered him here, with such of his command as are not engaged in pursuing Clift, a leading tory of Hamilton County, and his followers. Three different expeditions are moving from different points upon Clift’s men. I fear they will disperse and take to the mountain fastnesses, eluding our forces. A Pensacola regiment, I learn, is at Chattanooga, and a regiment from Virginia is near Elizabethton, I hear. The present indications are that the tories are about being rapidly overwhelmed. I am seizing arms of Union men known to be inimical to Confederate Government, and hope in this way to arm Carroll’s men who are not already armed. I propose to take and strengthen a position between Monticello and Somerset, giving us facilities for commanding the Cumberland River, the coal region supplying Nashville, &c. If I can clear the banks of the Cumberland of our enemies, supplies may this winter be furnished us by boats from Nashville. So soon as the state of things will justify, I would be pleased that General Carroll’s brigade would support me in a forward movement.

P. S.—I should probably state to you more in detail what I telegraphed on the loth, that I have information I think reliable that the enemy have no infantry nearer Cumberland Gap than London, where there are four regiments. They have about 200 cavalry at Barbours-ville. They have, I think, three regiments at Somerset, and are raising a fourth. They have a regiment at Crab Orchard, one at Eockcastle Camp, and one at Camp Dick Eobinson. I suppose they have a regiment of cavalry at Somerset and near Monticello. My'information is that six regiments, under General Nelson, advanced on Prestonburg, before whom Colonel Williams has retired through the Pound Gap.
Very respectfully,
F. K. ZOLLICOFFEE,
Brigadier- General.
Brigade Headquarters, Chattanooga, Tenn., November 17, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War, Richmond:
Sir : In obedience to orders two regiments moved to this point. Affairs are not so bad as reported. Suppose that Col. S. A. M. Wood has reported to the War Department a full account of his expedition against Clift and the breaking up of his camp. Five prisoners taken with arms. To-night I send a reconnoitering force to North Chickamauga Creek, where the citizens are mostly disloyal, and a good many in open rebellion. As soon as sufficient information can be obtained a larger force will be sent to capture Clift and his troops. So soon as they return I will move to join General Zollicoffer at Jacksborough. Regret that arms suitable for service cannot be procured in Tennessee. Have left nothing undone in attempting to obtain them. So far, however, have secured only common rifles, double-barreled shot-guns, and flint-lock muskets, very few being at all serviceable. The boring and rifling machine in the ordnance department at Memphis failed entirely to meet expectations. Have 600 rifles distributed for repairing at Murfreesborough, Pulaski, and Nashville', but can get no information as to the time it will take to finish them. Would thank you to order 2,400 guns from Savannah. Half arm me, and I will give you a good report at the earliest opportunity. Colonel Arny’s regiment will move to join me in a few days. He needs a few companies. They are reported, but not in camp. I inclose you a copy of oath and bond I have taken from Union prisoners taken before my arrival.

Brigade Headquarters, Knoxville, November 17,1861.
General S. Cooper, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: The passes in the Cumberland Mountains at and near Jacks-borough have been blockaded in such a manner as to prevent an army train of tlnNrnemy from crossing over into Tennessee. The fortifications at Cumberland Gap are now very strong. The enemy cannot now cross the Cumberland Mountains with a train anywhere between Pound Gap, in Virginia, and Jacksborough, Tenn., a distance of 120 miles. The regiments of Colonels Statham, Newman, Cummings, Battle, and First Battalion Sixteenth Alabama Begiment, with Branner’s battalion of Cavalry and Rutledge’s battery, are now moving in the direction of Monticello, Ky., by way of Wart burg and Jamestown, Tenn. The general in command came rapidly to this place last night, to learn definitely the movements of the tories along the line of railroad and in this portion of the State generally. He deems it unnecessary to remain longer here, and will leave this evening. General Carroll is at Chattanooga with two regiments half armed. He has been ordered to move such of his command to this place as is not in pursuit of Clift (a leading tory in Hamilton County) and his followers. Three expeditions are moving from different points upon Clift’s men, but it is feared they will disperse and escape to the mountains. A Pensacola regiment is at Chattanooga, and a Virginia regiment at Elizabethton, as we are informed. The present indications are that the tories are about to be overwhelmed. The arms of the Union men known to be inimical to the Confederate Government are being seized, and in this way it is hoped that Carroll’s men will soon be armed. The general proposes to take and strengthen a position between Monticello and Somerset, so as to command the Cumberland River and the coal region. Having command of the Cumberland River, supplies can be obtained from Nashville by boats. So soon as the state of things will justify, the general would be glad to have General Carroll’s brigade to support him in a forward movement.
From the best information we now have the enemy has four regiments at London, three at Somerset, and raising a fourth; one at Crab Orchard, one at Rockcastle, one at Camp Dick Robinson, and 200 cavalry at Barboursville. It is thought there is a regiment of cavalry at or near Somerset. Six regiments under General Nelson advanced on

Prestonburg, before whom Colonel Williams retired through Pound Gap, and was at Big Stone Gap the last account we had of him.
Very respectfully,
POLLOK B. LEE, Assistant Adjutant- General.
Chattanooga, November 17, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War :
Deae Sie : The undersigned has the honor to report that he was ordered to this place on last Monday, the 11th instant, by Major-General Bragg, with eight companies of his command, the Seventh Regiment of Alabama Volunteers. Left Pensacola at 4 o’clock Monday; arrived at Chattanooga at 5 o’clock Thursday afternoon. I arranged by telegraph with Col. William B. Wood, of the Sixteenth Alabama Regiment, who had come from Knoxville to Athens, to make a simultaneous movement across the Tennessee River—he from Cottonport by way of Decatur and the Seventh Regiment from Chattanooga. I also ordered Colonel Gillespie and Colonel Tibbs, who were at the head of 800 mounted Home Guards, to cross in two parties of 150 each, on the right and left of the place where my regiment would land on the north side of the river, one party 8 miles above, the other 8 miles below me ; and then all the different commands to move at daylight Friday morning from the Tennessee River to the supposed encampment of the enemy on Sale Creek.
The Seventh Regiment, under the immediate command of my lieutenant-colonel (Coltart) were put on a steamboat, as soon as they could cook their rations for four days, about 12 o’clock Thursday night, and just at daylight were landed 27 miles from Chattanooga, within 9 miles of the camp of the insurgents. I accompanied this part of the command. A column was formed, skirmishers thrown out, and every man and woman and negro detained as we advanced. We reached the camp ground about 11 o’clock, where about 300 of mounted Home Guards from Rhea County had arrived about five minutes in advance. Our skirmishers ordered them to halt as soon as we met, and, as they failed to do so, five guns were fired upon them as they rode off. One man slightly wounded. They then saw our flag and bayonets, and, recognizing us, halted partly, and we soon knew each other.
The insurgents dispersed the night before we arrived, after holding a council of war, in which they undertook to determine what they should do. They voted upon three propositions, there being about 200 present;
1st. Should they stay and fight % Ayes, 4—Colonel Clift, Lieutenant-Colonel Shelton, Mr. Pearson, and another.
2d. Should they endeavor to reach Kentucky % Nearly 100 voted to do so.
3d. The others voted to disperse.
In the night they all broke up, about 10 or 12 going with Colonel Clift, who is now hid in the mountains; 65 with a Captain Sullivan, who marched toward Kentucky, but who is probably still in the hills. The others fled in every way, and are hid about their respective homes or at work, denying that- they had any share in the matter. I have about 12 prisoners—some of them found on their way to Sullivan, with arms, and rations cooked for six days. I ordered Col. William B. Wood back to Knoxville. The mounted men are all still scouring the coun-

try. I have returned with my regiment to this place. I agreed to pay the steamboat $100 for the two days* trip and carrying 650 men.
I find on my return to this place General W. H. Carroll, with three Tennessee regiments and a company of artillery with guns. In my opinion 500 infantry or one regiment here for instruction, encamped at Tyner’s, 15 miles from the city, where two bridges were burned on the railroad, and where the soldiers will get no whisky, and one company of good mounted riflemen, can keep this part of the country perfectly quiet. They can also guard the Government provisions at this point.
General Carroll has just informed me that he will move a part of his command over to Sequatchie Valley and make a demonstration there, and then move on with all but one regiment to Knoxville. I most respectfully suggest that, if not needed here any longer, my regiment may be ordered back to the command of General Bragg, or I may be placed in charge of this post, with some rank and instructions that will enable me to control matters at this point for the interest of the Government. I have the honor to refer to an application I have made to the War Department. I find the citizens here have confidence in my movements, and I also find, with great respect for the present superior officers, that I have been much longer in the service and have been trained in a different school from any of these men. I am nowr really the commander of these forces, and refer to the recommendation of General Bragg in sending me here, and to what you will hear from him in a few days as to my qualifications.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
S. A. M. WOOD,
Colonel Seventh Regiment, Alabama Volunteers.
Chattanooga, November 17,1861. Major-General Bragg, Pensacola, Fla.:
Dear Sir and General : I have the honor to report to you for your information the following with regard to the Seventh Begiment: We arrived at this place on Thursday, at 5 o’clock. I came through and arrived on Thursday morning, but the burning of the bridge forced the regiment around by Cleveland, where I met it at 11 o’clock, and came down with it. At Cleveland I arranged with Col. W. B. Wood by telegraph to make a joint movement on the forces of the insurgents, and ordered him to proceed by way of Cottonport and Decatur to their camp ground on Sale Creek. I also ordered 300 mounted Home Guards, under Colonels Gillespie and Tibbs, accompanied by a lieutenant of my command, to move in two parties across the river, one to cross at daylight Friday morning 8 miles above where my regiment would cross and the other 8 miles below me, Between sundown and 11 o’clock Thursday night the Seventh Begiment prepared rations for three days, and I chartered a steamboat for three days for $100, and put the whole regiment on it. At daylight we landed 27 miles from this place and 9 miles from the camp of the traitors. Column was formed, skirmishers thrown out, and we marched through, detaining men, women, and negroes, as we went on, to prevent any information to the enemy. We arrived at the camp ground (formerly a Cumberland Presbyterian campmeeting place) at 11 o’clock. A body of 300 mounted Home Guards reached the camp ground from Bhea County five minutes before us, and had advanced 200 yards towards us in a lane. In some houses near there a large number of women, seeing our approach, were screaming,

and one or two Lincolnites were trying to escape—one on foot we had just captured. Our skirmishers surrounded the house, which increased the noise, and commanded the horsemen, now forming line of battle, to halt, but they turned and fled. Five shots were fired at them, wounding slightly i. man in the foot, and 1 of their horses; also wounding a Lincolnite, who was flying about 200 yards beyond them, in the shoulder. The whole squadron was then soon out of sight at a fien^ gallop. Their captain caught sight of our banner and returned, and we found them friends. The Lincolnites number 300; had met the night before our arrival, and voted on three propositions:
1st. Should they fight? Ayes 4, noes 206.
2d. Should they go to Kentucky ? Ayes 65, noes all the others.
3d. Should they disperse? Ayes about 230, noes about 70.
They then all tied the camp, the 4 fighting men going with the colonel, named Clift; the 65 towards Kentucky, with their major, named Sullivan; the others, with the lieutenant-colonel, scattering to their homes and the mountains.
Col. William B. Wood was now within 7 miles of me. My mounted men had not come up. I ordered Colonel Wood back to Knoxville, and I ordered all the mounted men to pursue and capture the 65 going to Kentucky. Staid all night at the carnp ground. Many good citizens, who had been robbed of their guns and property, came to see us. The next morning took a different road to return, ordering the steamboat up the river. Arrested about 12 traitors, 5 with guns and knives, bound for Sullivan’s camp. They are the most miserable, ignorant, poor, ragged devils I ever saw. Beached the boat at 11 o’clock; came down 16 miles, landed, and sent out two companies under Major Bussell (I accompanying them) to visit the house of Colonel Clift. He was not there. His house looks as if it belonged to some crazy man—a large two-story frame building with half the windows out; no furniture, and all in decay. Found a letter from him to Shelton (lieutenant-colonel), dated November 6, giving the place of the rallying. Beturned, and reached this place at 9 o’clock at night. This morning have moved the regiment out to the burned bridges, 15 miles, so as to get out of the way of whisky, and to encamp among the Lincolnites. When I arrived Colonel Leadbetter was not here. A Tennessee regiment without arms was just arriving. All in confusion; a general panic; everybody running up and down, and adding to the general alarm. I issued an order taking command; put the town under martial law; shut up the groceries; forbade any exit, by railroad or otherwise, without a permit from provost-marshal; had every avenue guarded; arrested about 12 persons who were talking Lincolnism before I came. Arrested a man myself on the cars as I went to Cleveland, and brought him back. Found him one of their traveling agents, going off with the news of my arrival. 1 have relieved all our friends in i his country. All were alarmed; all are now resting easy. I have run all i he Lincolnites.
Upon my return here I find that Brigadier-General Carroll, of the Provisional Army, formerly postmaster at Memphis, Tenn., is here with two more Tennessee regiments and one company flying artillery. General Carroll has just been appointed. He has been drunk not less than five years. He is stupid, but easily controlled. He knows nothing, and I believe I can do whh him pretty much as I please. He is going to send two pieces of artillery and 500 men to march up and down Sequatchie Valley—a useless expenditure of money. The presence of so many troops here is wholly unnecessary. He has, however, only 800

stand of arms. What the others will do I do not know. He speaks of going to Knoxville in a few days. General Hardee is now moving to Eastern Kentucky to join Zollieoffer with 13,000 men. Colonel Lead-better telegraphed me from Bristol to disperse the traitors, station guards at bridges, and move on to Knoxville, but if I station guards my regiment is all gone. I am now dispersing the insurgents, and shall keep at it from this point until I hear from the War Department or you, or again from Colonel Leadbetter. General Carroll will not detain me. I refer you to a letter inclosed for some of my private views.* I desire, unless I can get some command here, to come back to you. If 1 cannot order and have the same discipline, then let me come where I will find it.
I write this that you may know what they have set me to doing. I would have been gratified could you have seen our 9-miles march. I believe you would have been satisfied with the closed ranks, the silence, the activity, and great desire of the men for action.
I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Colonel, Comdg. Seventh Regiment Alabama Volunteers.

This was probably not intended to be forwarded, but containing much information which may be of interest to the Department, I forward it.
BRAXTON BRAGG, Major’General, Commanding.
Headquarters, Knoxville, November 20, 18G1.
Sir : The rebellion in East Tennessee has been put down in some of the counties, and will be effectually suppressed in less than two weeks in all the counties. Their camps in Sevier and Hamilton Counties have been broken up, and a large number of them made prisoners. Some are confined in jail at this place and others sent to Nashville.
In a former communication I inquired of the Department what I should do with them. It is a mere farce to arrest them and turn them over to the courts. Instead of having the effect to intimidate it really gives encouragement and emboldens them in their traitorous conduct. We have now in custody some of their leaders—Judge Patterson, the son-in-law of Andrew Johnson; Colonel Pickens, the senator in the legislature from Sevier and other counties, and several members of the legislature, besides others of influence and some distinction in their counties. These men have encouraged this rebellion, but have so managed as not to be found in arms. Nevertheless, all their actions and words have been unfriendly to the Government of the Confederate States. The influence of their wealth, position, and connections has been exerted in favor of the Lincoln Government, and they are the parties most to blame for the troubles in East Tennessee. They really deserve the gallows, and if consistent with the laws ought speedily to receive their deserts; but there is such a gentle spirit of conciliation in the South, and especially here, that I have no idea that one of them

will receive such a sentence at the hands of any jury impaneled to try them.
I have been here at this station for three months, half the time in command of the post, and I have had a good opportunity of learning the feeling pervading this country. It is hostile to the Confederate Government. They will take the oath of allegiance with no intention to observe it. They are the followers and slaves of Johnson and Maynard, and never intend to be otherwise. When arrested they suddenly become very submissive, and declare they are for peace and not supporters of the Lincoln Government, but yet they claim to be Union men. At one time, whilst our forces were at Knoxville, they gave it out that great changes were taking place in East Tennessee, and the people were becoming reconciled and loyal. At the withdrawal of the army from here to the Gap, and the first intimation that the Lincoln army was like to penetrate the State, they were in arms, and scarcely a man, with only a few honorable exceptions, but what was ready to join them and make war upon us.
The prisoners we have tell us that they had every assurance that the army was already in the State, and would join them in a very few days; that the property of Southern men was to be confiscated and divided amongst those who would take up arms for Lincoln.
I have to request, at least, that the prisoners I have taken be held, if not as traitors, as prisoners of war. To release them is ruinous; to convict them before a court at this time next to an impossibility; but if they are kept in prison for six months it will have a good effect. The bridge burners and spies ought to be tried at once, and I respectfully request that instructions be forwarded at as early a day as practicable, as it needs prompt action to dispose of these cases.

All of the regiments aforesaid will be raised for service in East and West Tennessee and adjacent counties and in East Kentucky. Blank muster rolls and the usual instructions to mustering officers will be sent to you from this office, and in carrying out this order you are authorized to employ such service and use such means as you may deem expedient and proper for its faithful execution. You will likewise report frequently to this office as you progress with your work.
I am, sir, &c.,
L. THOMAS,
Adjutant- General.
Cincinnati, Ohio, July 16,1861.
To the Adjutant-General U. S. Army :
Sir: For your information I beg to report what has been accomplished towards the Tennessee expedition.
On Sunday, 11th, I met the principal gentlemen of Southeast Kentucky at Lancaster, Ky., and Crab Orchard, and after examining the whole question I appointed Speed S. Fry, of Danville, to be colonel of the First .Regiment of Infantry in the expedition; Theophilus T. Garrard, of Clay County, colonel of the Second; Thomas E. Bramlette, of Adair, colonel of the Third, and Frank L. Wolford, of Casey County, to be lieutenant-colonel of the cavalry regiment authorized, reserving the colonelcy for W. J. Landram, who served in a cavalry regiment during the war with Mexico. Runners were immediately started in all directions, and thirty companies of infantry and five of cavalry will soon be raised—sooner, in fact, than the arms, &c., will reach here for them. To each of the colonels I addressed a letter, a copy of which is inclosed herewith, the place of rendezvous only differing. The transportation of 13,000 stand of arms, with ammunition, accouterments, artillery with its ammunition, &c., also supplies and camp equipage from Cincinnati beyond the Cumberland Gap, a distance of 240 miles, is an undertaking of no little labor. To Mcholasville, Ky.. 110 miles, I shall forward them by railroad; thence to Crab Orchard, 34 miles, is a good turnpike road; thence to the Gap, 96 miles, is a tolerable dirt road.
I have directed the captains of the armed Home Guard at Mcholasville to furnish a sufficient guard for the stores while detained at that place, and also detailed a guard to escort the trains along the road and guard all the bridges to Crab Orchard, where I have ordered five companies to rendezvous immediately to guard the depot at that place, Crab Orchard being at the end of the turnpike. There the wagons must be unloaded and reloaded, for a wagon can haul double on a good pike than on a dirt road. Crab Orchard becomes necessarily the depot of the expedition. The number of wagons to be hired will be large. It is cheaper to hire than to purchase. The articles to be transported

will afford you the best idea of the scale of transportation necessary;
13.000	muskets, weighing 185,000 pounds; ammunition, weighing 54,000 pounds; accouterments, weighing 75,000 pounds; rations, weighing
250.000	pounds; artillery, ammunition therefor, camp equipage, tents, &c. A good wagon can haul on a dirt road about 2,000 pounds. It will require 350 wagon loads to carry this farther. I have ordered 120 wagons to meet me at Crab Orchard.
The gaps in the mountains are all guarded by rebel troops, but not in sufficient numbers to prevent my going through whichever gap I may select, there being seven. The one that affords the most easy access I will of course choose. I want 100 “broken mules” for pack mules, with proper pack-saddles. Without them I will be confined in my movements to roads that are passable for wagons. With them 1 can move
1.000	men by a bridle-path through the mountains any reasonable distance. They are absolutely necessary to the success of the undertaking, and I shall go on and procure them on four months’ time, which is the usual method in Kentucky.
In reference to rations, I have stricken out everything but the substantiate, retaining only bacon, pork, flour, coffee, sugar, and vinegar. These I have purchased at sixty days after delivery.
In reference to clothing, I have directed the purchase of 10,000 flannel shirts; 10,000 pairs of socks; 5,000 hats; 5,000 pairs of pants, 5,000 pairs of shoes; all which, as well as the purchases before mentioned, were purchased at the same prices that the quartermaster and commissary pay here, and from the same persons mostly. Also 2,500 pairs of blankets; 5,000 haversacks; 5,000 knapsacks; 5,000 canteens.
I shall forward to-day estimates to the Quartermaster-General andlo the Commissary-General of the amounts of articles required in their departments, including besides the foregoing camp equipage only that which is absolutely necessary for the regiments authorized.
I have to request that Dr. J. J. Mathews, of Louisville, Ky., lately appointed a brigade surgeon, may be ordered to report to me for service in the expedition.
Owing to the absolute necessity of guarding these stores in their transit through Kentucky from destruction by the secessionists, I will muster in the companies now on duty immediately. The main body will be upon active duty from the hour of their arrival at their rendezvous, and I have to request that their pay will commence from that time. The only cash payments I propose making are for the service of the daily transportation.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
W. KELSOK

From reliable information I learn that about 7,000 or 8,000 Mississippi and Tennessee troops have left Corinth, Union City, Camps Cheatham and Trousdale for Eastern Virginia.
About 2,400 Tennesseeans from Mound City have gone down the Tennessee Kiver to Big Sandy, where they have boats; thence they intend going by Paducah and receive re-enforcements; thence to Caledonia, on Ohio Biver, above Cairo, and land. A portion are to cross to Illinois Central Bailroad track and destroy bridges. The batteries of 32

and 64 pounders I informed you of, which were at Dover, on the Cumberland Elver, are to go with this division. They have also eight 6-pounders and four 12-pounders. Troops sickly and discontented. Ammunition rather scarce. All armed with mixed description of muskets and rifles.
I telegraphed you on the 12th to Roaring River, Virginia, of Tennessee and Arkansas troops going by White River to Pocahontas and Pitman’s Perry; to this I have to add that on the 23d, 24th, and 25th instant about 12,000 troops from Union City, Randolph, Memphis, and other points left Randolph by steamer John Walsh and four more boats for New Madrid, Mo., distant from Bloomfield, on the other side of the Great East Swamp, about 30 miles, over which I have just discovered a good plank road.
Bloomfield is distant from Pitman’s Ferry 55 miles by good county road. A portion of the troops landed at New Madrid are to march to Bloomfield and join the troops from Pocahontas and Pitman’s Ferry, thence proceed to Thebes, 111., opposite Cape Girardeau. All boats are to be stopped going down the Mississippi at Cape Girardeau, while the forces at New Madrid are to stop all boats coming up, and the troops going down the Tennessee River are to stop all the boats on the Ohio, 'and a simultaneous advance made on Cairo and Bird’s Point from Thebes and the Ohio bank, in the rear of Cairo, and the expedition from New Madrid.
The rebels have taken possession of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad for their exclusive use. I know the camp at Cairo and Bird’s Point is full of spies, good fellows, and gay ladies, who are bestowing their favors on and spending their money liberally with the general and regimental officers. I do not say they reside in the camp, but they visit it daily, and by some means also at night. The rebels are in possession of accurate drawings of the whole defenses at these points, corrected daily when necessary.
Rosecrans telegraphs me from Clarksburg, Va., that he fears there is something wrong with Cox, as he has not heard from him since the 26th. All was right when my men left Cox. He is reported to have left Charleston—direction of the Gauley—Wise retreating. I advised Cox fully of the dangerous points between Charleston and the Gauley. Will send men there and investigate and report to you and Rosecrans, as he desires.

My Dear Sir : Unless there be reason to the contrary, not known to me, .make out a commission for Simon [B.] Buckner, of Kentucky, as a brigadier-general of volunteers. It is to be put into the hands of General Anderson, and delivered to General Buckner or not, at the discretion of General Anderson.

Thomas A. Scott:
I earnestly hope that the Government will not lose a moment in preparing for the crisis in Kentucky.
A large force should be concentrated at EVansville, and another at such points that they can be thrown in Louisville in a few hours, that they may be used in interior of Kentucky.
Five thousand are needed for militia in the Indiana border counties. Send any of the altered muskets or whatever can be had. Can you not send some artillery for the defense of our river towns? There is a large number of old-style guns in the arsenal at Pittsburg. The volunteering goes on with unabated vigor. With assurances of good arms we can run our regiments up to forty.
O. P. MOKTON,

Indianapolis, August 29,1861.
Thomas A. Scott:
Civil war in Kentucky is inevitable. The advices from my secret scouts leave no doubt on this subject. A force should be provided, ready to march to the support of Union men at a moment’s warning. All the State arms having been put into the hands of the State troops, it is of the first importance to provide arms for the Home Guard in the border counties. Too much importance cannot be attached to this subject.

General Thomas:
Frankfort, Ky., September 14,1861.
Sir : A committee from the Union caucus, composed of the members of the legislature, go to Louisville to-night; they return Monday morning. We advise that you do nothing as to the occupation of Mr. Bowler’s road until the committee see and confer freely with General Anderson. It would be well if you could come down and see the committee. We suppose it would be best that both the main roads be simultaneously occupied, unless you should learn something making it necessary to act. Doubtless you and General Anderson are fully posted and may have matured a plan as to these roads; if you have not, you can know General Anderson’s plans here on Monday morning.
Respectfully, yours,
JOHN F. FISK,
Speaker of the Senate.
RICH’D A. BUCKNER,
Speaker of the House.
General Thomas:
Berry, Ky., September 14, 1861.
You will here see a plan of operation submitted for your consideration.
First, perhaps a reconnaissance of the principal points should be had by yourself, &c.
The movement on railroad must be a profound secret or the bridges will be burned. Then, say, a simultaneous movement [from] Camp Robinson and Covington, starting so as to be through before daylight. (Trust not the wires.) At the long tunnel, 11 miles south of Covington, leave 100 men; at Grassy Creek, 26 miles south of Covington, leave 300 men; at Falmouth, 39 miles south of Covington, leave 400 men; [at] a small bridge or two near Morgan Station, and up to Boyd’s, 14 miles, (Stowers, secesh, part owner of railroad), 100 men; from Boyd’s to Cynthiana unsafe—secesh armed companies. At Berry’s Station and Boyd’s troops would be with friends; and although the bridge [is only] 2 miles from Berry’s, I think it would be safer to encamp near that place, as all the land or stations from Berry’s to Cynthiana are secesh. Say at Berry’s place 500 men, to scour, &c.; at Cynthiana two cannon and 1,000; from Cynthiana to Paris, except Kiser’s (I consider unsafe at Kiser’s place), 100; at Paris two cannon and 1,200; thence to Lexington (not much danger at Lexington), 80; total, 3,780.
What I mean by unsafe is that a small number of men as marked [sic] could not withstand the secesh force in those localities, and my opinion is that they will fight if they can get the advantage. This all done up in order, and the legislature order out 20,000 troops for sixty days, and [the] rebellion will be flat in Kentucky.
And last and not least, a bill of pains and penalties will be passed by our legislature, and the 20,000 troops will insure the enforcement of draft bill.
Respectfully,

Sherman. Events are hastening on which may compel me to take the field before I am ready. Should the necessity arise, and I think the cloud is so threatening that it may be wise for me not to wait any longer, I hope you will give our dear native State all the aid you can.
The movements recently made by Polk and Zollieoffer show that they will make another move as soon as they are ready. The bearer of this note, Captain Prime, is a very discreet, judicious soldier, and will give you my views.
If you can let me have a sufficient number of troops, and I find that I am not too late, I will intimate to you the desire that you shall throw your force forward by simply telegraphing u Yes.” It would add greatly to our strength if you could spare a battery of artillery.
I am interrupted and must close.
I have the honor to subscribe myself, with sincere regard and respect,
ROBERT ANDERSON, Brigadier-General, U.. 8. Army, Commanding.
Paris, Ky., September 16, 1861.
General George H. Thomas :
Dear Sir : Not being possessed of the future military plans of the United States Government, I am not prepared to offer you any views that even I myself would consider to be entitled to any reflection.
Nevertheless, believing it to be both the expectation and the purpose of the administration to overcome the military power of the Confederate States and to give effective relief to the Union men of East Tennessee, and also that Kentucky is now an active party to the war, I will on these general assumptions give you a few thoughts.
The most pressing duty is to give Kentucky all the protection possible-; to that end Paducah ought to be held by an adequate United States force, and the Louisville aud Nashville Railroad ought to be taken possession of at once by the military authorities as far south as Bowling Green, and a strong force put there and strong works thrown up for its protection.
All the force that can be obtained from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri ought to be put in camp at proper points on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, and be diligently drilled and prepared for service. The recruiting of the three years’ men in Kentucky should be pressed with the utmost activity and ought to be brought up to 15,000 or 20,000. The legislature should authorize the raising of 40,000 twelve-months’ men in Kentucky by volunteering and drafting, to be mustered immediately into the service of the United States.
Men are of no efficiency without arms, and one of the most serious wants for troops to be raised in this State is a proper and sufficient supply of arms. If the arms were at suitable depots, the men could soon be raised. By the time the General Government could be ready to move on East Tennessee from Western Virginia and on Memphis from Missouri, and down the Mississippi, the forces from and through Kentucky would be ready to move on East Tennessee by the Cumberland Gap, on Middle Tennessee and Nashville from Bowling Green, and towards Memphis from Paducah, and the different columns could continue their march towards the Atlantic coast and occupy North and South Carolina and Georgia, whilst the fleets and other armies were taking possession of all the ports in those States.
The first w ork to be done for Kentucky is for the United States to

## p. 260 (#268) ############################################

﻿260	OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. xn.
have at convenient points at the earliest day a full supply of proper arms, and for General Anderson and our legislature to have an immediate and perfect understanding, and then the promptest concurrence of action. Let General Anderson at once and in distinct and precise terms inform Union members of the legislature what he desires that body to do, and, it being thus clearly informed, let it proceed to do it. It is no time for the parties to be procrastinating or palavering when they understand each other. General Anderson ought first and immediately to take military possession of the railroads and telegraphic lines in the State, to be the master of all the communications ; that would be a potent signal, that would bring every true Union man in the State to his utmost exertions to give the most execution to such programme as might be agreed upon.
I have given a few views crudely but frankly.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
GARRETT DAVIS.

Louisville, September 17, 1861.
Brig. Gen. G. H. Thomas, U. S. A.,
Commanding Camp Dick Robinson:
General: Your letter of the 16th instant has just been received. I will send a supply of buck and ball cartridges (at least 100,000) as soon as they arrive; they have been ordered, and will probably reach here to-morrow. In the present imperfect knowledge which we have of the movements of the rebel forces, I can only direct you to guard strictly the passes on the roads leading from Barboursville to Richmond and Mount Vernon, and intercept and arrest any parties who may be going to join the rebels.
I regret that you have not been able to get staff officers. I am in the same condition, and have so far been unsuccessful in my efforts to obtain the necessary staff.
You had better retain the wagons now hired until you receive those required for from Cincinnati.
General Sherman has been sent to secure Muldraugh’s Hill, which was occupied yesterday afternoon by some secessionists.
I hope that the Kentuckians will rally now rapidly and in strength.

Sir : It has become necessary to make an advance into the interior of this State by all the disposable force at my command. Many of the men of Rousseau’s brigade and some of the regiments coming in to our assistance are too sick to go forward. Our general hospitals are not yet established; immediate accommodation is required for the sick. Under these circumstances I would respectfully request permission to put the .sick of the Army in the U. S. Marine Hospital in this city. The accommodations as far as space are ample, and the medical purveyor of +he Army will furnish bedding and bedsteads for the soldiers sent there. An arrangement can be entered into between the War and Treasury Departments in regard to the expenses incurred by keeping these men.

Understanding from you that there are several companies of Home Guards in your neighborhood who are very anxious to be allowed to save their State and our country in this hour of our need, I will thank you to say to them that I will be greatly gratified to hear that they have promptly reported themselves to Brigadier-General Sherman. It would be well for them to tidie blankets and haversacks with them; also as much ammunition as they can take.

The Home Guards of this place have all been notified to be on hand to night, ready to protect the cannon, if they have been shipped this way, as first intended.

General Thomas:
Frankfort, Ky., September 18,1861.
Sir : From indications that point to a gathering of the rebels in Lexington ou Saturday next from the surrounding country, we deem it of vital importance that you move a regiment there forthwith, fully x>re-pared for a fight.
The State Guards from all this part of the State meet in Lexington on Saturday ostensibly for drill. They have been buying and stealing all the powder and lead they can get, even tearing up lead pipes. We will take measures to have a large force of Home Guards to meet you. You take the Fair Grounds for a camp, unless you can do better. No time is to be lost. They have taken Muldraugh’s Hill, we are informed, 1,500 strong, and burned the bridge over Rolling Fork of Salt River.
General Rousseau is after them, with from 2,000 to 3,000 men; but the loss of the bridge is a great misfortune. If they take Lexington with 2,500 men, as we fear they will, they will take the arsenal and magazine here, and disperse or capture the legislature.
Please let there be no delay.

I have not seen or heard of the cavalry, but will order it forward when it arrives. We are in advance of all expectation, and will take them by surprise. I met the inclosed dispatch at this place from General Anderson. We will do what men may do; rely on us for that. I deem it better to go forward to-night, as it will avoid the tricks of the secessionists on the road.

By order:
L. THOMAS,
Adjutant- General.
Cincinnati, Ohio, September 20,1861. General George H. Thomas, Commanding Camp Robinson, Ky. :
Dear Sir : I commenced the shipment of wagons to you, and before I had gotten fairly under way I had orders from Western Virginia for 400. The consequence is, you are left without for the present. I will cheerfully do anything I can for you at any time, but these same difficulties will be constantly occurring. General Rosecrans’ orders must of course take precedence.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JNO. H. DICKERSON, Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.
Headquarters Department op the Cumberland,
Louisville, !£)/., September 21,1861. Brig. Gen. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General, Washington, D. 0.:
General : I am instructed by General Anderson to report to you that there are now in the field at Rolling Fork Bridge, on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, nearly 2,500 men, 1,800 of whom are very reliable troops, of Colonel Rousseau’s command. The remainder are Home Guards, and are of but little value, lacking very much in discipline, organization, and equipment. The Forty-ninth Ohio Regiment, Col. W. H. Gibson, arrived here to-day from Cincinnati, and will shortly proceed to Rolling Fork Bridge. A detachment of 200 Fifteenth Infantry recruits, under command of Capt. P. T. Swaine, Fifteenth Infantry, have also arrived, and wrill to-day proceed to join forces already at the bridge. Two regiments are telegraphed as ready to leave Indianapolis for here as soon as transportation can be secured. Two regiments were telegraphed as ready to come from there also, if they could be supplied with arms. They were telegraphed to come and arms would be furnished. Other regiments are expected and detachments of men are being collected all over the State of Kentucky, so that in a day or two we shall outnumber the rebels, arid in the mean time the general thinks he is sufficiently strong to prevent any further advance on their part. The general instructs me to again request that you will order Captain Gilbert’s company to his department from Saint Louis. He considers it almost absolutely indispensable that he should have a company of regular infantry here—at present at least. He has now no means of enforcing his order in the city.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
OLIVER D. GREENE,
Assistant Adjutant- General.

ing the railroad. It occurs to me that they can sufficiently guard the road, and in case of emergency I am near enough to re enforce them. You are aware that we have no tents with us, and I learn from Major Buford, who knows the localities, that there is no place where our men can be quartered with sufficient shelter near the bridge. To quarter at the depot would separate the main body too far from the guard for efficient support. Many of the men are without blankets, and all without coats or blouses, and the weather is such that to occupy the open air and sleep on the ground without shelter or blankets would be dangerous to the men, especially as they have measles in the camp. We have five new cases here.
Our quarters are comfortable here, and the men seem well pleased with the place. There is considerable stir amongst the secessionists; they are alarmed. I think their meeting here will not take place; they are fixing to run, rather than fight. Bumors through the night last night were constant of movements on foot, and it is thought they ran off the 140 rifles last night to flee to the Southern Army.
I have this moment learned, through Mr. Crittenden, of Missouri, now at this place, from what he deems reliable authority, that the arms are at Leonidas Johnston’s, in Scott County; that the secesh of Harrison and other points collect there this evening to make a run to the Southern Army to-night through Anderson County. The Home Guards of Mercer ought to be on the lookout, and a strict watch kept along the line from Lebanon to Louisville. I will, if the news be confirmed, in the course of the day telegraph to Louisville to General Anderson.
I have sent for Captain Bruce and Dr. Dudley, to consult about moving to Cynthiana. My own opinion is that this is the point for a few days at least. We are doing good by being here, and it is the finest place for drilling the men I have seen. Plenty of the best water at hand.
I wish you could take time to come and inspect the position, and determine whether it would not be well to keep an encampment here for instruction, as well as for security of the roads.
In haste, respectfully,
THO. E. BBAMLETTE, Colonel, Commanding at Camp Robert Anderson.

Major-General Fremont :
Governor Morton telegraphs as follows: Colonel Lane, just arrived by special train, represents Owensborough, 40 miles above Evansville, in possession of secessionists. Green Biver is navigable. Owensborough must be seized. We want a gunboat sent up from Paducah for that purpose. Send up the gunboat if, in your discretion, you think it right. Perhaps you had better order those in charge of the Ohio Biver to guard it vigilantly at all points.

I much regret that subsequent events have prevented me from sending you the troops. Reliable advices on Friday show an advance on Louisville by a force of not less than 10,000 men, and Anderson had not more than 3,000. Anderson begged for troops. Our own safety required that they should be furnished. We have sent him four regiments, and one to Evansville. We are out of arms. Can you not lend us 5,000 for the time ? Louisville is considered in great danger this morning, and many doubt whether it can be saved. Please send us arms by special train.

The danger in which Louisville is at this time renders it impossible for me to comply with your request that I would send you four well-drilled regiments and a battery of artillery. The latter has already been forwarded; the former cannot be obtained from any source.
A rally has been ordered of the militia and Home Guards, and I trust that you will have a force of true men, who, battling for their firesides and their homes, will soon drive the bandits from our soil.

I can’t hear from my family at Columbia. If any letters or news comes from there to me, do me the great kindness to forward it. I rest uneasy for news from my wife and little children at that place, now held, as I learn, by traitor troops.

General George H. Thomas:
I have just sent out two companies to watch the various passes, and seize guns, which my scouts think will be attempted to be moved tonight by the rebels. While engaged in instructing the commandants of the different squads I received the inclosed letter, which I forward to you, as I have no cavalry with which to operate at the distance from here required. Lawrenceburg is about 25 miles from Camp Robinson, and there is no doubt in my mind but it is in the direct line of the rebel movements. I have it from so many reliable sources, that I am well assured that their line of communication and for stealing puiposes lies through Versailles, Lawrenceburg, and Spencer County.
Some point which could be secured, and which Morgan Vance, of Harrodsburg, could designate, ought to be secured by 200 or 300 cavalry, so as to intercept arms, &c., and seize any armed traitors who may attempt to move in that direction.
We are getting along pretty well here, and I think our presence here has greatly alarmed and disconcerted them in their movements.
Breckinridge and others fled the night we reached here and in advance of our arrival, having been warned by a scamp by the name of Smith, from Nlcholasville. They are not far, I learn to-day, from Mount Sterling, at a little place called Hazel Green, and it is thought are concentrating forces in that vicinity. I send this by the same gentleman who brought the letter inclosed. Captain Hoskins’ indorsement of them is sufficient.

Brig. Gen. Robert Anderson, Tj . S. A.,
Commanding Department of the Cumberland:
General : Mr. Corcoran arrived here last evening. I am constantly beset with importunities from citizens near the border to advance to their relief; and to do so with these troops in their present disorganized state will lead to certain disaster, and in that event we shall have to fall back upon the Ohio, and lose all the advantages we now have by holding this place. I cannot think of it for a moment, unless I could have 4,000 well-drilled men and a battery of artillery.
My latest advices from Barboursville are to this effect, that the enemy are concentrating in East Tennessee, both from Virginia and the far South. This looks like an invasion of Kentucky in force, and we should be prepared to meet them; but my hands are completely tied, unless the Government will give me an organized force to work with.
It is absolutely necessary that an engineer, a quartermaster, and the four regiments of infantry, and a battery of artillery above referred to, all equipped for the field upon reaching here, should be sent to me without a moment’s delay.
I am assured by the most reliable people from East Tennessee that an invasion of Kentucky from that quarter is intended, and I beg that the Government will place me in a condition to defend this part of the State.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General : By the direction of the general I write to say that for the present he can afford yon no assistance as you required. Louisville is very strongly threatened, and until that point is out of .danger he can send no re enforcements to you.
He considers your views of the emergency as eminently just and proper, and nothing would afford him greater pleasure than to aid you with all the re-enforcements you ask if it was possible. Until he can send them (which he hopes will be very soon), he trusts you will be able to hold your position.
The general directs me to say that he gives his cordial approval to your course in occupying the asylum at Harrodsburg with the Home Guards.
You are fully authorized to contract for the subsistence of the men, in any detachment you may send out, in the manner you think most desirable. You are also authorized to contract for clothing and tents, in amount equal to your necessities, at any point where they can be obtained.

Dear Sir : Yours of the 23d instant, directing me to hold my main body at Irvine, &c., is received. We encamped here yesterday with two full companies raised in this county, and we are looking for another from Owsley County this evening; also one from Jackson County. Other companies are forming in this and other counties I learn. I have several companies in Camp Robinson who propose to join my regiment. Will it be inconsistent or incompatible for me to ask you to permit them to be sent here ? I hope not. We need blankets, tents, and other camp equipage, and guns, and I know we ought to have them right away.
Great activity in the counties around on the part of the secessionists. Our people are recruiting rapidly. I have house room at my place (Estill Springs), adjacent to Irvine, to lodge several companies and officers, but we can’t do without blankets. Straw is the best we can do, and the use of it makes it dangerous on account of Are, <fcc.

A camp at my place will greatly facilitate enlistments for the Government and hold.the secessionists in check.

Hoping that these hasty views will be regarded in the proper light, and made in the utmost good faith and respect, I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,
SIDNEY M. BARNES.
Camp Robert Anderson, September 23,1801. General George H. Thomas :
I send this evening, under escort of the Jessamine Home Guards, three caissons to Mcholasville.
Upon the 11 o’clock train to-morrow I will forward to Mcholasville, under escort of one company, 82 boxes musket cartridges, 20 boxes minie cartridges, and 50 kegs rifle powder. Should anything else come this evening 1 will forward it.
1 have no further news or rumors. I can but think that the movements of the secessionists are from fright and not for battle, yet many very prudent and wise men differ with me, who think we shall be assailed here soon—this week. Such is the opinion of Dr. R. J. Breckenridge, with whom I have held counsel. Your superior military judgment must determine what course to pursue. I can move in one hour, if required, but am of opinion that this post ought to be held as a rallying point for Home Guards and place for organizing other troops, besides giving protection to such goods as may be shipped to Camp Robinson.
Respectfully,
THO. E. BRAMLETTE.
Camp Robert Anderson, September 23,18G1. General George H. Thomas :
I have just learned from a reliable man, who gets it through rebel relations now engaged in the movement, that the activity of the secessionists is to embody a larger force than we have, they think 3,000, and attack this camp this week. There is an unusual stir in all the adjacent counties, either for preparation or from fright. If we had a few experienced artillerists and some grape and shrapnel, &c., I will hold the place while a man lives to fight ; but I need some cavalry for pickets and scouts. The inertness of the Union men, their sensationalism, their utter backwardness in rushing to the call of our country is annoying.
This would be a good point for your headquarters, the communications being rapid, the means of transportation being better than your present position.
To fall back from this place now would give encouragement to the traitors; they have scampered, but would soon return if we leave; they doubtless would return with force enough, in such event, to rob the banks, for they need money. I think it probable, if they can embody sufficient force to give them confidence, they may make the attempt; but I doubt their ability to do so. It will do no harm, however, to be ready for the emergency, whatever may come.
If I had sufficient cavalry to scout the country for some distance around some valuable discoveries might perhaps be made as to the movements of the traitors. As I wrote you last night, Breckinridge and

others fled to the mountains the night of my arrival here in advance of
arrival, having been warned by a rebel by the name of--------, who
2>osted forward upon our arrival at Nicholasville. Should you deem it advisable to move more forces forward, it would be well to precede the movement by sending forward to have him watched and arrested if he makes any movement. If there is any necessity or probable necessity for your forces remaining at Camp Eobinson, I will, if you so direct, undertake to hold this position so long as you may require it.
We have so many sensational rumors that I give but little reliance to any, except so far as to be on my guard. I have just learned, since I commenced writing, that some kid-gloved gentry, who pretend to be Union meu—Buckner, Johnson, and others—last night,, in caucus, are disposed to censure me for suffering guns to be run off the night after my arrival here. I hope it is not true that they do so, for it would be an act of sneaking cowardice in them, which I should be sorry to have to brand them with. I was not advised of any such movement, left the matter to Dudley and Bruce, and told them I would back them when they required it with all my force. They became satisfied that nothing was done, and that the arms were still concealed in the city. We have been using all activity to ascertain, and last night arranged upon what was deemed good authority to intercept them; now rumor says they were run off on Friday night. If these men make any censure upon me for not accomplishing what they had not the spirit to do for themselves, or even to notify me to do, they will lose in the game.

I learn by a person who left London last night that the rebels had 400 cavalry at Laurel Bridge, a point 6 miles south of former place. I hope to stay on the Big Hill to-night, unless we should be cut off by the enemy’s pickets.
Will it not be well to dispatch a force without delay to occupy Big Hill, letting them march across the country from Lancaster and enter the Richmond road at Morris, 13 miles south of Richmond ? I shall return by that way ; meet and give them such information as I may gather. I hope the force for Rockcastle Hills will be hurried up.

I have selected for the present a point 1J miles south of the river as the best position, all things considered, although but for the scarcity of water there may be other points which an experienced military man would prefer.
I have learned this afternoon that the rebels have evacuated Bar-boursville and returned to Cumberland Ford. They have not been near London. There seems to be no danger of an advance by them.

the Ohio River open and to dislodge the rebels supposed to have been in possession of that place, I proceeded to Paducah, on the morning of the 23d, in the steamer Bee, before the gunboat Lexington, Commander Stembel, was ready to leave Cairo, for the purpose of calling on General Smith, and having the gunboat Conestoga, Lieutenant-Commander Phelps, ready, on the arrival of the Lexington, to accompany me up the river. On arriving at Paducah, I ascertained from General Smith that the Conestoga had gone on a short cruise. Consequently, on the arrival of the Lexington, I immediately proceeded with her alone up the river, taking with us the steamer Bee, as the water was low and the river falling, that we might have the means, if grounding, of getting afloat more readily. I also sent the Bee up the Cumberland River 15 miles, in a vain search for the Conestoga. After grounding twice, at 1 o’clock on the morning of the 24th instant we were compelled to anchor and lie over till 8 a. m., when, in company with the Bee and she towing us, we proceeded up the river to Evansville, from whence I telegraphed you at 11 p. m. This morning (25th) we reached Owensborough; found no batteries, but were boarded by Colonel McHenry, who, with Colonel Hawkins, had each a skeleton Kentucky regiment, which had arrived the morning previous. I sent for the authorities of the place and directed them to prevent the display of secession flags. A strong disunion sentiment is manifest in the place, but no disrespect was offered me, although I have been much among the people, but I directed Commander Stembel to hold as little communication with the shore as practicable. The colonels, with their force, as previously designed, left the town during the day, although I strongly importuned them to remain, as I did the Cincinnati company, but they declined on the ground of not being properly equipped nor having been mustered into the service. Under these circumstances, and the water requiring the Lexington soon to leave, I went down to Evansville, in the steamer Bee, and telegraphed to Governor Morton, at Vincennes, Ind., asking for 500 men for Owensborough. If I get no reply, I purpose telegraphing General Anderson at Louisville for the same number. On returning to Owensborough in the evening I again communicated with the shore; after which, and giving my orders to Commander Stembel to remain till the low water required him to leave in order to reach Cairo safely, I ran down to Evansville, meeting and boarding the Conestoga en route, and giving her instructions, and here have telegraphed to General Anderson for 500 men to be sent to Owensborough.
Having done all in my power in this quarter, and the preparations of the gunboats in Saint Louis demanding my immediate attention, I leave for that place at 10 a. m. to-morrow, and trust that I may personally communicate with you in the evening.
In haste, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

are evidently trying to run. If I had sufficient cavalry I could surround and cut them off. I think, however, they will stampede for Hazel Green, where Breckinridge is forming an encampment in the extreme edge of Morgan, adjoining Wolfe County. They no doubt intend to pass down through Breathitt, Perry, and Clay, to Knox, ajid join the invaders at Cumberland Ford. I shall try and get some reliable scouts, and, if I can find their position in striking distance, shall move upon them. If you have any use for me, however, my longer stay here is, I think, unnecessary, as I can effect but little or nothing with infantry against the flying rebels.
This is a good place to instruct; is convenient to move, and being at the end of the telegraph, news readily passed. I await your orders.

Sir : The rebels having occupied Owensborough, you are directed to send to that place the regiment ordered to Evansville on the 25th instant, together with two gunboats. After dispersing the enemy the force will return again to Paducah, as the latest movements of the enemy require the concentration of our troops as far as possible at that place.

E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant- General:
Sir: Your telegram of the 25th instant is received. Only two regiments of Illinois troops have been in Camp Dennison. Both of these have been sent to General Anderson at Louisville by order of General Fremont.
I reached these headquarters on Saturday evening, the 22d instant, and found the city greatly excited. General Anderson was reported to be in great peril, and Louisville threatened with attack by a large force under Buckner, approaching by Muldraughs Hill, near the point of the Louisville and Kashville Bailroad, where the railroad crosses the SaltBiver; also by turnpike road leading to the mouth of Salt Biver and thence to Louisville. It was further stated that Zollicoffer had already entered Kentucky by the way of Cumberland Gap, laying waste the country, and marching on Lexington and Frankfort, while Breckinridge was assembling in force in Morgan County and Humphrey Marshall in Owen County, Kentucky.
I telegraphed the legislature of Kentucky, asking to be placed by them in a position to act within 15 miles of this city. A reply came promptly, with full authority, and an earnest appeal to send 5,000 troops to their aid, and to drive back Zollieoffer ; also requests came for assistance to General Anderson through his brother, Larz Andersen,, esq., of this city.
General Buckingham came to this city at my request, arriving Sun-

day morning, bringing Colonel Whittlesey, a military engineer. We examined the Kentucky Hill, opposite the city, and decided on a plan of defense. The engineers are at work. General Buckingham and myself then reviewed carefully the condition of all the fragments of regiments in this State, and I ordered into Camp Dennison all regiments more than half full. We then prepared the necessary papers and instructions to inaugurate greater alacrity in recruiting volunteers.
Monday morning General Morris arrived from Governor Morton, of Indiana, with the most earnest appeal for arms from Ohio. After consultation, Governor Dennison and Governor Morton were called to the city by telegraph to concert measures, and General Anderson was desired to come or send a confidential representative. The meeting was held Monday afternoon and evening, and resulted in this State furnishing Indiana 3,000 muskets for the emergency, and a determination to urge forward troops to possess and hold the strong points in Kentucky.
I have already a regiment in possession of the hither extremity of the Covington and Lexington Eailroad. To-day a regiment proceeds to Cynthiana and Paris to hold the entire road, and will be followed by another this evening to hold the Lexington and Louisville Eailroad. These will be followed by a force sufficient to render it possible (when combined with the troops under General Thomas at Camp Dick Eobin-son, 130 miles from this) to commence active and immediate operations to drive Zollicoffer and Breckinridge out of the State or to capture them.
Holding as I hope the entire region based on the Ohio from Portsmouth, Ohio, to Louisville, Ky., with the two railways already mentioned, with secure lines of communication by rail with Cincinnati and Louisville and by turnpike with Maysville and Portsmouth, a powerful force may be moved from the region near Lexington and Frankfort, and may operate either towards the Cumberland Gap, or, after shutting up that pass, concentrate a powerful column and drive the enemy back from Muldraugh’s Hill, secure Louisville, and threaten Nashville.
Such are my present ideas. I have no knowledge of the views of General Anderson further than he begs me to aid Lexington and Frankfort and General Thomas.
I have thus presented in as few words as possible the position in which I am placed and the general outline of defense for my Department of Ohio and Indiana.
I have directed the staff officers to send forward to General Eose-crans supplies of all kinds without consulting me, up to the point where it becomes a doubt whether if more be sent it will not endanger the safety of this department; then to stop and be governed by my orders. In like manner I am ready to send troops to Virginia or to Washington so long as in my judgment I retain a force sufficient to insure the protection of Ohio and Indiana. In adopting this course I am, as I conceive, acting strictly up to my orders.
I deem the immediate occupancy of Kentucky as a matter of the greatest importance and the fall of Louisville as a disaster the consequences of which cannot be overestimated. I therefore urge the necessity of placing in supreme command of this expedition to Kentucky and to Tennessee an experienced general, who will command the entire confidence of the Government.

Columbus, Ohio, September 26,1861, Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
The urgent call for troops in Kentucky compels me to send six or eight regiments before their organization is entirely completed. They have the men and arms and are ready for service, but owing to the want of mustering officers many of the muster rolls are unfinished, and the field and stall and many of the company officers have not been mustered in, and under your order No. 66 cannot take command and draw pay. This will create great embarrassment, unless you authorize me to give in all such cases effective commission of proper date.

General : The general directs me to say that, as the ten days of the Home Guard will expire on Saturday evening, he suggests the importance of arranging for your rear guard.
He thinks that Colonel Crittenden’s imrtion of a regiment would probably be the most available for that purpose, but he leaves it with you to decide.
The postmaster here infoims me that there is a large amount of mail matter in the office here for your command. lie says if you will send in some properly authorized person the mails will be turned over to him, put up in packages for the different regiments. The general suggests the appointment of some competent person to come in here as often as you may deem desirable.

These mules were to be purchased because of the political effect it would have, and these instructions were issued at my instance.
I think that I wrote you that Morgan Vance, of Harrodsburg, would indicate the persons from whom the balance of the mules were to be taken.

If you deem it to the interest of your command not to have these mules delivered immediately, you can arrange to have them transferred to your possession any time within the next two months, not to be paid for until delivered.

Headquarters, Muldraugh’s Hill, Kentucky,
September 27, 1861.
Capt. Oliver D. Greene, Asst Adjt. Gen., Louisville, Ky.:
Sir : When I left Louisville in the cars, in charge of the Home Guard, followed by Rousseau’s brigade, I understood my orders to be to station parties along the road to guard the bridges, secure the road, and to occupy the Muldraugh’s Hill. On reaching the Rolling Fork of Salt River we found it a deep stream, with railroad bridge burned down and still burning. This, of course, stopped our progress, and we disembarked the men. Various rumors of the force of the enemy which had done this wanton mischief and stolen various cars and locomotives reached me, but estimating the force not to exceed 200,1 sent forward a strong picket of 400 men, under Colonel Rousseau, and afterwards strengthened it by another 400, but receiving a telegraphic order from you on the 21st, I recalled Rousseau. Finding the effect of this to be very bad, and that great importance was attached to Muldraugh’s Hill, and having notice of re-enforcements, I concluded we should reoccupy the hill • and accordingly, on Sunday morning, the 22d instant, I put in motion Rousseau’s brigade, and followed up with the Thirty-eighth Indiana, Colonel Scribner, and the Forty-ninth Ohio, Colonel Gibson, and a detachment of regulars, under Captain Swaine. We ascended Clear Creek Valley, near the railroad, to the top of Muldraugh’s Hill. We examined the ground near the tunnel, and then proceeded to Elizabethtown, and encamped near the town. The next day we moved on the Lebanon road to this camp, where we have been ever since.
Since our arrival the command has been re-enforced by the Thirty-ninth Indiana, Colonel Harrison. On our way up I left Colonel Crittenden’s regiment to guard the road to Colesburg, but have since called him forward, and he is now fiosted beyond Elizabethtown, the guard-

ing of the road being intrusted to Colonel Hughes’ [Keeker’s?] Illinois Regiment.
This is not an isolated hill, but a range separating the waters of the Rolling Fork of Salt Creek and Green River, the ascent from the north being very abrupt and the descent to the south being very gradual. Our position is far from being a strong one when held against a superior force. Roads will enable an enemy with cavalry to pass around us and cut off our communications and starve us out. We have no safe line of retreat, and must stand our ground let what will happen. Our opponents, led by General Buckner, who is familiar with the ground, are now supposed to be along the railroad from Green River to Bowling Green. Their forces are variously estimated from 7,000 to 20,000 men, and I doubt not they have 15,000, some well and some poorly armed, but all actuated by a common purpose to destroy us.
I am fully alive to the danger of our position and to all its disadvantages, especially that of supplies. Our provisions have been hauled up the rugged valley of Clear Creek by hired wagons and by some which were brought along by the Thirty-ninth Indiana. We can barely supply our wants, and are liable at any moment to have those wagons seized. The reason I came to Muldraugh’s Hill was for effect. Had it fallen into the hands of our enemies, the cause would have been lost, and even with it in our possession a week nobody has rallied to our support. I expected, as we had reason to, that the people of Kentucky would rally to our support, but, on the contrary, none have joined us ; while hundreds, we are told, are going to Bowling Green. The railroad from Bowling Green towards us is broken at Kolin, 10 miles off, and at another trestle beyond some 7 miles. I doubt if this was done by Buckner’s orders, but rather by the small parties of guards left to protect them, and who were scared at our approach. I have from time to time given you telegraphic notice of these events, and must now await the development. We should have here at least 20,000 men 5 but that has been an impossibility.

Dear Sir : I have had as full a conversation with General McCook in reference to the condition and wants of my department as the press of business has permitted.
I need, as the general will tell you, all the regiments you can spare. I shall not attempt to guard neighborhoods, but will form not more than three corps d’armees. Forward the regiments, as rapidly as you can get them ready, to this point. Here is where the most urgent call is for additional force, and the sooner here the better. It would give me great pleasure to correspond with you, but I am without assistance, and have not time to make the proper reports and communications to the War Department.

On the 26th instant, at the request of General Anderson and the Kentucky legislature, my own judgment concurring, I ordered Colonel Yan Derveer, commanding Thirty-filth Begiment Ohio Volunteers, to take and hold the Central Kentucky Bailroad from Covington to Lexington. This has been successfully accomplished, the bridges all guarded, and our communications with Camp Dick Bobinson are now secure. On the 27th instant Colonel Steedman, commanding Fourteenth Begiment Ohio Volunteers, left Covington under orders to occupy a point on the Lexington and Louisville Bailroad near Locks 2 and 3, Kentucky Biver. We thus surround a force supposed to be concentrated in Owen County, Ky., commanded by Humphrey Marshall, while we secure our communication between Camp Dick Bobinson and Louisville.

O. M. MITCHEL,
Brigadier- General.
Camp Wildcat, September 29, 1861. General George H. Thomas, Camp JDicTc Robinson:
Colonel Wolford came into camp bringing with him the Home Guard under Colonel Brown.
The enemy have taken London. The colonel says they are in large force, and have about 600 cavalry. We might defend this place, and could if they were to come the road, but they can go through the woods with infantry. They could go the Bichmond road until they cross Eock-castle Eiver several miles, then there is a good road that intersects this road 1^ miles this side of Mount Yernon.
Should they take that road, we would be then completely cut off from your camp, there being no road for us to travel with wagons, and none that infantry could travel, except through the woods. It is 8 miles from this to the Eichmond road, and it runs nearly parallel for some 15 or 20 miles, several miles beyond Mount Yernon.
Owing to the present circumstances, Colonel Wolford will remain with us.
The Home Guards that have been run off will have to be supplied with provisions from our stores, there being no provisions in the neighborhood. Corn is scarce; no old corn except that that is brought some 10 or 12 miles.
I will await your answer, unless I am perfectly satisfied we should retreat.
Hawkins, Burton, Walker, and five others are with the rebels, they having been conveyed through the woods or by-ways. They passed the Home Guards under the pretense that they were from Camp Eobinson and sent there as spies to report to you. I have no doubt Burton, &c., were sent by their friends to carry the rebels into Madison County, knowing they were defenseless.
From what I have written you can see through the scheme (provided I am not mistaken). The last heaxd of the pickets they were this side of London, about half way between London and the forks of the Eichmond road.
I consulted with Colonel Wolford before writing this. One of Colonel Wolford’s men fired on another of his men, wounding the man, and killing one horse and wounding another. The private that shot himself at camp, which I informed you of, died yesterday, so the bearer of your dispatch informed me.
There is but little water here, not sufficient for horses and men without hauling, which we could do.

Shall send a regiment which arrived last night, also Steedman’s from Eminence—all that I think can now be spared. I will telegraph to the governors of Indiana and Ohio.

Camp Wildcat, September 30,1861. General George H. Thomas, Camp Biek Robinson:
My wife sent a messenger to me that has just arrived. The rebels have taken Manchester, pulled down the flag, tore it up, and placed theirs on the same pole. The messenger says they turned back from Manchester, taking from one of the furnaces fifty wagon loads of salt.
I have nothing of importance to write you since Colonel Wolford left. I would like very much to have Colonel Wolford with us or some more experienced person. Lieutenant Dillion is quite young, though he appears to be very active.
The Home Guard are still coming in. Colonel Brown is trying to make arrangements to feed them with beef and flour. Captain Adams has written you, I suppose, on the subject of supplies.
I have no definite news that the enemy is this side of the forks of the road, though the messenger from my house says he heard guns firing this morning in the direction of the forks of the road.
Many of our men have never drawn blankets, and some who have joined since we left have no clothing. Captain McDaniel, of Colonel Barnes’ regiment, ,has some 12 or 15 recruits that joined him on the road that have no clothing. If you have a supply of clothing I would like for you to have furnished sufficient for the recruits. Kone of the regiment have received coats, and the nights are quite cool. We had frost last night.
There are many persons here who cannot purchase food. They are willing to fight if they are fed, as they say they cannot go home. They are also willing to work or do anything else required.
If you could see proper, I would like to see you in regard to our fortifications. I am not pleased with them $ they are very good, provided the enemy would march up to them, but infantry could flank us on either side. It is quite difficult to do so, but infantry can go anywhere a common hunter can. If it will not be convenient for you to visit the camp (and I cannot see how you can leave), I would like for some experienced person to come immediately.

An encampment at Lexington also would be very convenient, as the troops could easily get supplies at that point, and I could call upon them from here to move either by this road or by the road through Richmond, according to circumstances.
I have at last found a gentleman who seems to comprehend the duties of the quartermaster’s department, and I am in hopes we may be able to get along with less confusion than heretofore.

Our means of transportation is now so limited, that I will resj^ectfully suggest that all the wagons that can be sent with these regiments be forwarded, to facilitate any forward movement which I may find it in my power to make.
If you could send a column of about four regiments up the Big Sandy and move it south through the counties of Floyd, Letcher, and Harlan, in co-operation with my advance by Barboursville, I believe that we npght easily seize the railroad and cut off all communication between Virginia and the South through Tennessee before the enemy will have time to re-enforce Zollicoffer sufficiently to prevent it.

I also requested him to employ men to destroy the McKee road without delay.
From all I can learn, the rebels have retreated some distance south of London. I presume they have fallen back only temporarily
I fear that the Home Guards will not do much towards defending Big Hill, from the sample they gave near London. Organized troops are needed there.
The impression seems to be that the rebels will take the Madison road or go by McKee’s.
I find the cavalry are returning to Camp Robinson, but if I can get enough at Camp Wildcat I shall send them to the Big Hill.
Excuse this; I write on horseback.

Camp Wildcat, October 1,1861. General George H. Thomas, Camp Dick Robinson:
I have information, reliable, that the rebels retreated 9 miles beyond London on Sunday. A negro of mine reached camp last night with a letter from my wife; she says they left there Sunday morning and returned towards their encampment on Cumberland River. Rumor says they have destroyed much property in Knox.
They destroyed Captain Murphy’s property. He is in the Third Regiment of Volunteers from Clay County. They tore down haystacks and burnt some rails for another person, is all the damage they done except taking the coffee and salt, for which I learn they left Jeff. Davis bonds.
Colonel Wolford and myself made arrangements to blockade the Madison road to-day, but we, on consultation last night, agreed to countermand the order this morning; though, should you desire it, please say so, and we will have it attended to immediately.

P. S.—I would like very much for General Crittenden to send some one here to take command of his forces; they are organizing three companies ; though I suppose Colonel Brown will do so. I will endeavor to get Colonel Brown to move them on the river, 2 miles from us; they are in our camp, and it is almost impossible to do anything with them or our men.
T. T. GARRARD.
Camp at Albany,
October 1, 1861—8 a. m.
Brigadier-General Thomas :
Sir : I find it impossible to hold the Home Guards of Casey and Lincoln longer than forty-eight hours from this time.
I learn that the Confederate troops are rallying again at Travisville, with the intention of attacking us. From the best information, they cannot muster a force exceeding 1,150. Last night at 9 o’clock our picket guard were fired upon by a party of seven persons within 3 miles of the.camp; they returned the fire, with what effect I have not ascertained. None of ours were injured that I know of, though one of the picket has not yet come up.
I have ordered a detachment of fifty cavalry to scout the whole country in the neighborhood of the beat at which the pickets were stationed, as also that in which the absent picket was stationed.
We are occupying what I consider a strong natural position and one of importance to the cause, rendered so by many circumstances, among which are the following, viz:
Within the camp guard we have three good flouring mills; within the county we have an abundance of wheat and forage, and, it being situated south of the Cumberland River, could they get possession of the county it would serve as a rallying point to which they could gather re-enforcements by way of the Cumberland River, while the number of roads diverging from this point would enable them to move forward in the direction of either Montieello, Jamestown, or Burkesville. Between this and the Cumberland River there are five beds of stone-coal, an article of importance to them. Below, at Burkesville, there are five salt wells, the possession of which is all-important to the rebels.

I hope to be sufficiently re-enforced by night to proceed with the work of blockading.
While I cannot expect to hold for any length of time the Home Guards from the counties of Casey and Lincoln, yet it is due them to mention the heroic conduct of Colonel Barnes, as also the men under his command. When the alarm was given by the driving in of the pickets, at the command they came to position like veteran soldiers, and promptly obeyed every order.
If it is desired, under the circumstances, that our position should be held, I will await your orders. If we should be compelled to abandon it, had I not best order the destruction of the mills at this place, as they would be all-important to the permanent occupancy of the place by the Confederate troops ?
If it should be ordered to hold the position, please send forward Lieutenant-Colonel Howard, with all the forces under his command, and other forces, numbering, in all, say, 800 men.
Major Brents is here, by order of Colonel Wolford, and has proven himself a most active and efficient officer, and one whose services I shall need at least until the camp can be properly organized. He desires to know whether it will meet your approbation for him to remain for that time.
I shall also ask the aid of Captain Morrison, with his command, as they are familiar with the country, and the number of roads leading into this place requires a strong picket force.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

{iResolved by the general assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, That his excellency Governor Magoffin be, and he is hereby, instructed to inform those concerned that Kentucky expects the Confederate or Tennessee troops to be withdrawn from her soil unconditionally.”
RESOLUTIONS.
Whereas Kentucky has been invaded by the forces of the so-called Confederate States, and the commanders of the forces so invading the State have insolently prescribed the conditions upon which they will withdraw, thus insulting the dignity of the State by demanding terms to which Kentucky cannot listen without dishonor: Therefore,
Resolved, That the invaders must be expelled.
Inasmuch as there are now in Kentucky Federal troops assembled for the purpose of preserving the tranquillity of the State and of defending and protecting the people of Kentucky in the peaceful enjoyment of their lives and property: It is
Resolved, That General Robert Anderson, a native Kentuckian, who has been appointed to the command of the Department of Cumberland, be requested to take instant command, with authority and jjower from this Commonwealth to call out a volunteer force in Kentucky for the purpose of repelling the invaders from our soil.
Resolved, That, in using the means which duty and honor require shall be used to expel the invaders from the soil of Kentucky, no citizen shall be molested on account of his political opinions ; that no citizen’s property shall be taken or confiscated because of such opinions, nor shall any slave be set free by any military commander; and that all peaceable citizens who remain at home and attend to their private business, until legally called into the public service, as well as their families, are entitled to and shall receive the fullest protection of the government in the enjoyment of their lives, their liberties, and their property.
Resolved, That his excellency the governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky be requested to give all the aid in his power to accomplish the end desired by these resolutions, and that he issue his proclamation calling out the militia of the State, and that he place the same under the command of General Thomas L. Crittenden.
Resolved, That the patriotism of every Kentuckian is invoked and is confidently relied upon to give active aid in the defense of the Commonwealth.
ENACTMENT.
1.	Be it enacted by the general assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, That as the soil of the State of Kentucky has been invaded by armed forces acting under the authority of the so-called Confederate States, therefore, for the purpose of repelling said invasion, the governor of the State of Kentucky is hereby directed to issue his proclamation, calling out not less than forty thousand soldiers, residents and citizens of Kentucky, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years, to be mustered into the service of this Commonwealth for any term of service not less than twelve months nor more than three years from the time they were mustered into service, unless sooner discharged.

Camp Wildcat, October 2, 1861. General George H. Thomas, U. S. A.,
Commanding Camp Robinson, &c. :
My note of yesterday advised you that I had dispatched your letter to Colonel Landram. I saw some of the Home Guards this morning from Madison, and directed them to move a portion of their force to ford of Big Eockcastle, and obstruct the road at once. I suppose the work will be commenced this afternoon.
If you design sending a force to Big Hill by way of Lancaster and Moore’s, will it not be advisable to keep the road open north of the river? Yesterday only about 150 of the rebels (according to report) were left in Barboursville; all the rest had fallen back to Cumberland Ford. Only some 2,000, according to best information I can get, came as far as Laurel Bridge; perhaps 150 cavalry entered London. Theirs seems to have been a mere marauding expedition. They gutted the houses at Barboursville before the infantry left on Monday. We are all safe here.
I hope to return to Camp Eobinson to-morrow evening.
Eespectfully, your obedient servant,
S. P. CAETEE,
Lieutenant, V. S. Navy {on special duty).

persons acquainted with the country could get into our camp many ways. Still, they could not do so if we had a small force at each point. The distance from Little Bockcastle River to Big Rockcastle is some 3£ miles. A considerable portion of this distance is defended by natural cliffs, so that it relieves us from performing much labor at those places. Teii miles of the road south of our camp is almost a dense thicket on each side of the road, and could be defended, or at least we could annoy the enemy with infantry the entire distance, whilst we would be comparatively secure, provided we acted cautiously. General Carter can explain more explicitly.
Colonel Brown desires me to say to you that he can supply his command of twelve-months’ men with beef and bread, but will be dependent on you or General Crittenden for sugar, coffee, soap, candles, and such other articles as are furnished. He has no tents or camp equipage. Many of his men are bare of shoes, clothing, and blankets.
Colonel Brown desires to know whether or not he must open a correspondence writh General Crittenden or must he address you on all matters connected with his military affairs ? He desires such instructions as you may from time to time think proper to give.
Colonel Brown has now enrolled and in camp some 250 twelve-months’ soldiers. He has muskets, but no cartridge-boxes, caps, pouches, nor bayonet scabbards. He desires to hear from you as soon as convenient. Mount Vernon is the post-office, if sent by mail.
I have not heard anything of the rebels since they reached Barbours--ville. The last account is that some 100 or upwards were in Barbours-ville. I have heard, but do not say that it is reliable, that there is a robbing party going through Knox County, plundering every person (almost) they come across, and that it is headed by men by the name of Arthur, citizens of Knox County, Kentucky.
I have got Colonel Brown to move all of his men to the river except one company, and they are outside our camp in a rock house. We have been much annoyed by them, as well as visitors and others who were driven before the rebels. Some of them returned this evening part of the way home, but heard of the rebels below London, and they Returned to camp. The report, I am satisfied, is false.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. T. GARRARD,
Colonel Third Regiment Volunteers.
October 3,1861.
I have not said anything about the cavalry, as I supposed they would return. It will be very inconvenient for our men to go so far from camp as they should to be effective. The road from our camp towards London for several miles is only tolerable, but from that point to the rebel camp on Cumberland River is as good if not better than any other dirt road in Kentucky that I know.

very first consequence which I desire to occupy in advance of the enemy.

Capt. Oliver D. Greene,
Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:
Captain: I have the honor to report to the general commanding the arrival here of the Fourteenth and Thirty-first Ohio Begiments and the Thirty-third Indiana. There are three other regiments at Nicliolasville which could have been here to-night if our means of transportation had been sufficient to bring them over. Only one of these regiments has any transportation, the Indiana, and the want of it has embarrassed me very much. Our supply as yet is very limited, and all the mules have to be broken, so that we are embarrassed in that respect also; but as soon as I can get up enough wagons I propose moving on beyond London and strengthening the position, so as to relieve as much of the country as possible from the depredations of the rebels. The report to-night is that they have again retired, after finding I had got possession of Bock-castle Hills. I shall move with caution, however, but endeavor to drive them out of the Cumberland passes before re-enforcements can reach them. I could move at once if these regiments had been supplied with transportation; but as it is impossible to hire enough in the country, I shall have to wait until I can have it sent to me. A battery of artillery completely equipped would give me a great advantage. Bespectfully, vour obedient servant,
GEO. H. THOMAS,

General George H. Thomas:
I have no information in regard to the rebels more than I wrote you, except the inclosed order of General Zollicoffer, which I have no doubt is genuine. I could not doubt it, because they carried out the instructions to the letter. I also inclose you a letter directed to Hon. Green Adams, &c.# The bearer of this letter, Mr. Hurst, is reliable, and was in Tennessee sometime since and taken prisoner. The order from Major Coffee, countermanding the blockade of the Madison Fork of the Bich-raond road, was sent me this evening. If we have one day’s notice, which we certainly will have, I can have the road blocked up completely. However, we have been doing and undoing so much, that you may begin to think we are fickle. I should not have ordered the blockade the second time if it had not have been for General Carter, and he was for carrying out instructions.

You will see before this reaches you that Colonel Brown has moved to the river some 2 miles from us. I would be afraid to place them between the enemy and our camp. Some of his men are, I fear, a little timid, and I doubt whether or not they will do their duty on that side of us. There is a tolerable good camping ground about 2 miles beyond our camp. General Carter spoke of it as we passed it, looking out the points to blockade. It is near Little Rockcastle,, and near a point where the road passes between the point of a ridge and Little Rockcastle River. At the point where we are camped there is but little room, though we can stick our tents about on points and sides of hills, and could find room enough to place another regiment on the same kind of ground.

T. T. GARRARD, Colonel Third Regiment Volunteers.
P. S.—Are there any cartridges for rifled muskets at Camp Robinson ? The muskets I received of Captain Cardwell, of Harrodsburg, are rifled. I have*not examined, but learn from others the ordinary cartridge will not suit them. Surgeon Hogan has not yet been furnished with a tent. He desires one sent, if there is any to be had.

Col. James E. Rains will march at 4 o’clock to-morrow morning, via Barboursville, to Laurel Bridge, on the London road, with his regiment, provisioned for six days, three rations of which should be cooked, leaving his tents in this encampment. Colonel McNairy’s command will accompany him or follow him, by a right-hand road crossing Laurel Creek about 2 miles above the bridge. Colonel R. will have command, and will dislodge a supposed force of the enemy at the bridge by attacking simultaneously with infantry and cavalry at both ends of the bridge. He will be furnished a guide, who will give him information of some arms, which he will capture, if practicable. He will take with him also Lieutenant Falcond’s section of artillery. A battalion of Colonel Sta-tharn’s infantry, with three companies of Colonel Branner’s cavalry, will be posted on the road to be pursued by Colonel McNairy about 10 miles back, to give support, if necessary. Simultaneously, Colonel Cummings’ regiment, with two companies of Colonel Broydton’s [Brazel-ton’s?] cavalry, will escort a train of wagons to the Goose Creek Salt Works, 16 or 18 miles east, in Clay County, to load with salt. The different detachments will communicate by express messengers with each other and with me, and when the salt train returns all will return to this encampment. Much is trusted to Colonel Rains’ discretion in whatever may transpire on the way.

out their wagons, owing to the fact that no time could be lost in getting them into the field. I have now the wagons, horses, and harness, and am organizing a force of teamsters, and hope very soon to supply all the regiments with transportation.
You request me to send the column of about four regiments up the Big Sandy, to co-operate with you in your advance upon the Cumberland Gap. You do not advise me what amount of force is indispensably necessary at Camp Dick Bobinson before you will feel it expedient to commence your advance.
We have in Ohio at this time a limited number of arms. The number of regiments which we can put in the field is necessarily limited. Admitting we have but three regiments remaining prepared to move in all this week, do you prefer them to be sent to your camp, or do you prefer them to undertake the expedition up the Sandy ?

Camp Kenton, Mason County,
Wear Maysville7 Ky., October 4, 1861. Captain Greene, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I desire to call the attention of General Anderson to the following intelligence that comes to me from a person in whom I have the highest confidence, and who is himself high in secession counsel, but is in truth a Union man, true and loyal. This person has never yet deceived me.
Breckinridge is not in Prestonburg or that vicinity, but is in Bich-mond, Ya. He sent a messenger to W. B. H. Stanton, who arrived day before yesterday, saying that he (Breckinridge) would return in a very few days as general, and that the secession companies would hold themselves in readiness and be prepared to meet him at Hazel Green, in Mason County, on his return, of which event they would be early notified.
The message went on to say that the whole of Beauregard’s army was on its way to Kentucky, and will winter in Kentucky, and will be here in time to take advantage of the hay crop ; that there was but a thin line of troops in front of Washington masking the movement.
Kow, see, this comes to me from such a source that I believe it. The sudden accessions to the strength of Zollicoffer, Buckner, and Polk show that such a movement, or one similar, is on foot. A virtual panic exists in this part of Kentucky; a fear of the General Governments ability to aid them.
I beg to call the general’s attention to another point which is doing injury to the cause here. A number of persons are establishing camps in impossible and out-of-the-way places, and raising troops for regiments that can never be found, acting in competition with each other, all desirous of having a camp on his own or his immediate neighbor’s farm, and all claiming to be acting under the authority of General Anderson, and pitch in without the slightest reference to me. The consequence is that there is no head here, no authority or control. If the general will confide to me the raising of troops in this section and give me authority over that which immediately surrounds me, it seems to me that I can

manage the affairs rather more successfully than it proceeds at present. I have at least some experience in raising an army. The utter confusion in which affairs are in this section impels me to call attention to it. Very respectfully,

Headquarters Camp Dick Bobinson, Garrard County, Kentucky, October 4, 1861. General Bobert Anderson,
Commanding Department of the Cumberland, Louisville, Ky.:
General : I have been informed to day privately, and I do not know that it is true, that 25,000 men will be sent to Kentucky within ten days to meet any movements on the part of the rebels against Kentucky. Should it be so, I have to ask that four of the best regiments, with two batteries, may be sent to me, supplied with transportation and ammunition. 1 believe if I could get such a force here, and be ready to march in ten days from this time, that I could seize on the railroad at Knoxville and cut off all communication between Memphis and Virginia.
The information I receive at this time from Tennessee is, that there are now but few troops in East Tennessee, but that it is the intention of the rebels to concentrate a large force there to act against Kentucky, and that they intend to invade this State and winter here if they can. I told General Scott, when in Washington, that I believed they would attempt the occupation of Kentucky, but fear I failed to impress upon his mind that it would be an important move on their part, and that we ought to be on the lookout lest.they get ahead again.
The regiments I am receiving are raw, and as little prepared for a daring enterprise as those I found at Camp Dick Bobinson, besides which there is but one regiment among them supplied with means of transportation.
Zollicoffer has retired again, but I have a strong force in Bockcastle Hills, prepared to prevent any advance he may make. Two efficient batteries and four good regiments is all the additional force I want. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Georoe H. Thomas:
About two hours after the messenger left this morning I learned the rebels were in London. In a short time I ordered Major Cardwell, with 200 soldiers, to take a position about 3 miles from camp, on a hill beyond Little Bockcastle, &c. I would have written you immediately, but I was not satisfied as to reliableness of the statement. A gentleman has just arrived, but he did not see a rebel$ but there is no doubt but that some 9 cavalry were in London this morning, and they reported a force of 600 a short distance off. It may possibly be a plundering party.
I would not write you, but I think it better to keep you posted with their movements.
I would like very much to have some cavalry here. We have no doubt about sustaining our position.

Returned from Muldraugh’s Hill Saturday evening. W. T. Sherman says his force is only 1,000 raw troops. Kentuckians are not enlisting, and give no aid whatever. If he is expected to make any diversion or offensive movements he must have large re-enforcements. The Louisville and Kashville Railroad has but eighty cars all told, and not reliable for military transportation. All Federal troops recently arrived in Kentucky have been sent to General Thomas.

merit, Colonel Harris, to take position at a place called the Olympian Springs, about 20 miles east of Mount Sterling, in order to close the mountain gorge through which small bands of the enemy are constantly passing to Prestonburg to re-enforce a camp forming at that place.

The commanding general learns with deep regret that arrests are being made in some parts of the State upon the slightest and most trivial grounds. He desires the civil authorities and orders the military not to make any arrests except where the parties are attempting to join the rebels or are engaged in giving aid or information to them, and in all cases the evidence must be such as will convict them before a court of justice. In some cases it is understood that the Home Guards have gone into adjoining counties and arrested and carried off parties who have been quietly remaining at home under the expectation that they would not be interfered with, provided that they did nothing in violation of the spirit of the proclamation bearing date of Sex>tember 24, issued from these headquarters. Some instances are mentioned of persons having been arrested and taken out of the State.
This is all contrary to what the commanding general has declared to be his wish, and he trusts it will not be repeated.
It is believed that many of those who at one time sympathized with rebellion are desirous of returning to their allegiance and wish to remain quietly at home attending to their business. A conciliatory, fair course pursued towards such persons will join them to our cause; the reverse may force them into the ranks of our enemies.
The commanding general entreats and urges his fellow-citizens to discountenance and. endeavor to put a stop to these ill-timed and unlawful arrests, and to aid him in keeinng peace among ourselves.

Regretting deeply the necessity which renders this step proper, I do it with less reluctance, because my successor, Brigadier-General Sherman, is the man I had selected for that purpose. God grant that he may be the means of delivering this department from the marauding bands, who, under the guise of relieving and benefiting Kentucky, are doing all the injury they can to those who will not join them in their accursed warfare.

Brigadier-General Crittenden :
Sir : I have made an order for you to go to Owensborough and to assume command of the regiments organizing in that quarter.
I am aware that whilst regiments are being formed and equipped they can do little service, yet our enemies give us little time, and we must do the best w^e can.
If one of the regiments could show itself onxGreen River, make a circuit south of the river and return, it would have a good effect. Hopkinsville has 1,000 men, but*poorly armed, and a demonstration on it would probably lead to its evacuation.
Kentucky looks for some bold stroke, and with such men as Jackson, Johnson, Burbridge, Hawkins, and McHenry almost anything might be attempted.
You may purchase subsistence or hire wagons at discretion. Certify the bills and I will have them paid here.
' Yours, &c.,

Garrett Davis, Esq.:
Dear Sir : Yours of this date is received.* You will be surprised to learn that we have not the arms you mention. Arms are coming forward very slowly. I have written and telegraphed to General Kelson, at Maysville, to take a regiment from Portsmouth, Ohio, up the Big Sandy, and at the same time for the Ohio regiment at Olympian Springs to advance towards Prestonburg. If Colonel Davis can by any means at hand scatter that camp I will approve of all the steps, but an advance up the Sandy, now navigable, would be almost sure to result in the retreat or dispersion of the force. But we have not the arms.
Men are offering, but arms and equipments are wanting.
The real struggle in Kentucky is to be between this and Nashville.

Colonel Jackson, Owensborougli:
Dear Sir: Yours of the 6th# is received. I am forced to organize and operate with insufficient means and materials. Your regiment has more facilities than any other, and I hope you will make rapid progress. Keep some runners down to Christian to keep up the hearts of your people, and if you could make a push of a few hundred men towards Hopkinsville it would disturb Buckner a good deal. I send General Crittenden down to Owensborougli. They have not sent me a single regular officer from Washington, and so engrossed are they with Missouri, that they don’t do us justice. The more necessity for us to strain every nerve.

He is aware of your being greatly deficient in arms and ammunition for an expedition, but he hopes you may be able to arm a sufficient number of men for the purpose with the arms of the country.

General Ward, Greensburg, Ky.:
I have been called here by General Anderson to assume command in Kentucky. Until regiments are organized and equipped it will be almost impossible to brigade them. Still, if you hear of Buckner’s forces advancing from Bowling Green, you could show your force on his flank about Glasgow or Little Barren and cause him to hesitate.
Gather in ail the Home Guard arms you can find. They are the property of the United States, confided to them for special reasons, but now that armies are in the field these scattered muskets are of little use.
We are moving heaven and earth to get the arms, clothing, and money necessary in Kentucky, but McClellan and Fremont have made such heavy drafts that the supply is scant.

President Lincoln :
My own belief is that the Confederates will make a more desperate effort to gain Kentucky than they have for Missouri. The force now here or expected is entirely inadequate. The Kentuckians, instead of assisting, call from every quarter for protection against local secessionists. I named T. J. Wood at Governor Morton’s instance, because he is a Kentuckian, and has been mustering officer at Indianapolis. He should have a brigade of Indiana volunteers. Col. R. W. Johnson is now with Colonel Jackson’s cavalry regiment, in process of formation at Owensborough. Both have good reputations in Regular Army. McCook has not arrived. All the men in Indiana and Ohio are ready to come to Kentucky, but they have no arms, and we cannot supply them arms, clothing, or anything. Answer.

General George H. Thomas:
The point called Laurel Hill I am unable to say anything definite. YVhen I wrote you some days ago I was of the opinion that the hill known as Laurel Hill was beyond Little Rockcastle, and not more than 3 miles from this camp ; but now I am induced to believe the hill is beyond Big Laurel Creek; if so, I cannot say anything definite about it.
There is a bridge over Big Laurel, though the stream is not 50 feet wide. There is no ford for several miles either above or below, as I am told by citizens, except near the bridge.
The country on the opposite [side] of the creek from this is level for some 300 yards ; then the road forks, one by Barboursville, the other by Payne’s Cross-Roads, andmnite 8 miles beyond Barboursville, near the

Flat Lick. The hill beyond the bridge, some say, commands the roads,
though I cannot see how it does.
I have been informed that the rebels have been examining a hill beyond London 9 miles, where there is a meeting-house, near McHargue’s. I understand this hill commands the Barboursville road for some distance. They may establish a temporary camp there for the purpose of getting grain, &c., it being one of the best neighborhoods on the road, though this would not command the road that runs by Payne’s Cross-Roads.
I have understood, but place no confidence in the report, that the rebels intend going through Whitley County and Pulaski, so as to surround this camp. They were in Williamsburg Saturday last 5 that is, about 200 cavalry.
When Captain Smith, of the cavalry, reached here there was not one of Colonel Wolford’S men in camp, nor had there been for several days, and if my informant is correct, some of them that are now here will do no good. They were seen drunk on picket yesterday at or near London, some 10 miles from this camp.
In regard to surgeon and assistant, I will write to Dr. William Atkis-son, tendering to him the appointment on conditions, which conditions I will state to him. If he accepts, I will tell him to report to you as he comes to join the regiment.
I would like very much to have had Dr. Hogan as assistant surgeon, as he is very attentive, and so far has treated the cases which he has been called upon to attend in such a manner as to give satisfaction. If it is not contrary to orders, I would like for Dr. Hogan to remain as assistant with the surgeon, so that the surgeon acting with him may have an opportunity of testing his qualifications practically. Dr. Hogan says that he was embarrassed, but still thinks he could undergo an examination.	•
Inclosed I send you Zollicoffer’s proclamation,* also statement of [illegible] about the location of troops. The proclamation was copied from Zollieoffer’s.
Captain Smith, of the cavalry, has several men that will not do any good here. I have advised him to send them to Camp Dick Kobinson, so that he may get some others in return. I have 975 non-commissioned officers, musicians, and privates in the regiment.
Inclosed I send you list of articles received in the regiment agreeably to the different captains’ reports.

To all ichom it may concern, greeting:
Since the undersigned assumed command of the troops at this place his purpose has been to pursue such a course as to show the inhabitants of this region that it was not the intention of the Government to interfere with their comfort and well being in any respect, not excepting those who were well known to sympathize with the people of the States in rebellion. The person and property of every one has been protected, and quiet and good order preserved. If any discomfort or annoyance has occurred, it has been incidental to a state of war and from military necessity.
The undersigned hoped that such course would open the eyes of the population to the falsehoods industriously circulated by the leaders and politicians of the South respecting the intention of the Government in sending troops here. Perhaps it may have done some good; but the course taken by some of the inhabitants of this city, and by many in the neighborhood, satisfies him that the conciliatory policy ceases to be a virtue.
He will, accordingly, take such measures as the circumstances call for and justify. What those may be, time will develop. As one measure, he has forbidden the outposts to pass out any person without a written permission from these headquarters, which will only be given to persons of approved loyalty to the Government of the United States. Nor will goods or stores of any description be permitted to pass out without the same permission.

General : Your communication of the 10th instant was received today at the hands of Governor Johnson, of Tennessee.
I have been doing all in my power to prepare the troops for a move on Cumberland Ford and to seize the Tennessee and Virginia Eailroad, and shall continue to do all I can to assist you until your arrival here; but justice to myself requires that I ask to be relieved from duty with these troops, since the Secretary has thought it necessary to supersede me in the command, without, as I conceive, any just cause for so doing.
I have already sent one regiment forward, and shall send the others as soon as I can get the transportation. It was my desire to have advanced two regiments and a battery about 6 miles beyond London, to secure the road to Barboursville and to protect a large tract of country abounding in forage, but up to this time have not been able to get the transportation.
I have also been very much embarrassed in my operations from the want of funds, not having received any since my arrival here, nearly a month ago. I hope the Government will be more liberal with you.

Olympian Springs. A copy of this I have forwarded to General Sherman, at the same [time] telegraphing him requesting that two regiments from Lexington or Nicholasvill^ might be immediately ordered to the assistance of Colonel Harris, and that I will go so soon as I can possibly hire wagons. General Sherman sends me the inclosed telegraph in reply. Accordingly I send Lieutenant Duke, Second Dragoons, to you, and beg that two regiments be immediately sent to the support of Harris.
I have called on all the Home Guards in this and the Ashland districts, but they show great indisposition to turn out; in fact, they cannot be depended upon. They are “fireside*7 rangers and nothing more. I look to you for support.

Camp Gill, October 10,1861. Brigadier-General Nelson, Maysvillc, Ky.:
Sir : I arrived at this point this evening with my command, 900 strong. I found Colonel Grigsby with 300 men.
From reliable information just received I have no doubt that there are now at the rebel camp at Prestonburg, at the very lowest calculation, at least 4,000 men. They are very well armed and well mounted, and are receiving constant accessions from above and below. They have also two pieces of artillery, an 8 and 6 pounder, that we know of.
Colonel Grigsby has been very active in procuring information, and there can be no doubt of the correctness of it. It is absolutely impossible for them to subsist their force in that region for any length of time, and I feel assured that unless a sufficient force is rapidly concentrated at this point they will be down upon us in less than five days.
From information brought this evening I believe that their forward movement will commence on the 12th instant.
We will push a force of 200 men into the mountains to-night after a detachment on their way to join them. I cannot impress upon you too strongly the necessity of pushing forward as rapidly as possible, and to bring along a section, if not a full battery, of artillery of light pieces. If you have no artillery, 1 think by telegraphing General Mitchel you can be supplied. I know that he will cheerfully accede to almost any request I may make; I also know that artillery in this region is very, very essential.

Sir : I am officially notified that a detachment of recruits for the Thirty-third Indiana, Colonel Coburn, has been sent to him via Cincinnati, and the governor dsks me to send arms for them. Wo have not the arms, and I can find none. An agent of the State from Washington assures me 17,000 arms have been sent for the Kentucky troops. Regiments of men from Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio are offering, all without arms, and I am powerless.
I can only suggest that you reduce the regiment to its number of arms by ordering the sick back to their State. When arms come, the regiment can again be filled. This is very discouraging, but is the only remedy that suggests itself to me.
I am, &c., your obedient servant,
W. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier- Genera l, Com manding.
Louisville, Ky., October 12,1861. Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas,
Commanding Camp Dick Robinson:
Sir : General Nelson telegraphs me that the rebels encamped atPres-tonburg have begun to move forward. The regiment of Colonel Harris, at Olympian Springs, was posted there to watch the only practicable avenue of approach from that quarter. I directed him to send a messenger to you, and you may detach from, say, Nicholasville, or your own camp, to either re-enforce Colonel Harris or General Nelson, who is directed to move with all the volunteers he can arm to check the movements, and, if possible, disperse them. General Nelson asks for arms, but we have none, and the only alternative is to give him the two regiments at Nicholasville.
As to your own movement, I leave to yourself, until I can come to see you. I do not believe you can cross Cumberland Gap this year, but you can compel Zollicoffer to fall well back in the mountains beyond the Cumberland.
The State board are now actively engaged in raising regiments, and I hope may prove successful. They have funds, and can offer inducements to the volunteers not heretofore enjoyed by us. All volunteers raised in that quarter will fall to you, and can be used in pushing towards the south and east. I do not think it likely a force superior to yours can come from that direction. But it is different- towards the south and west. The railroads come from Nashville and Memphis and meet at Bowling Green, whence it is continuous to Green River, where is Buckner’s present advance. Ours are at Nolin, about 23 miles this side, and volunteers are forming in the neighborhood of Greensburg and Monroe County, and at Henderson and Owensborough, 20 R R—VOL IV

Hear Sir : Two gentlemen unknown to me, but introduced by Mr. Guthrie, say some negro slaves have taken refuge in your camp and are there sheltered.
The laws of the United States and of Kentucky, all of which are binding on us, compel us to surrender a runaway negro on application of negro’s owner or agent. I believe you have not been instrumental in this, but my orders are that all negroes shall be delivered up on claim of the owner or agent. Better keep the negroes out of your camp altogether, unless you brought them along with the regiment. Yours, &c.,

Louisville, Ky., October 15,1861. Brig. Gen. [A. McD.] McCook, Comdg. Camp on Nolin:
Sir: 1 have ordered Colonel Willich to move by the road to Hodgens* ville to your camp with eight companies, the two others to follow as soon as Colonel Pope can reach New Haven with his regiment of Kentucky volunteers; also Captain Cotter’s battery of five of James’ rifled guns. He has not all the proper ammunition, but must use the best at hand. I have a regiment now unarmed. I will arm them with the best foreign muskets on hand and send forward as soon as possible.
I must go to Camp Hick Robinson on business ordered by the Secretary of War, but will leave orders here for all staff officers to supply you with all things possible, and to forward any armed troops that may arrive. The destruction of the railroad bridge at Green River, the defensive preparations at Bowling Green, and other facts lead me to conclude that an enemy awaits us on the other side of Green River.
But you must be prepared for anything. I leave orders for Generals Wood and Johnson to hasten to you the moment they arrive, and I wish you to divide your command into three brigades and push the drill. Look well to the ammunition, and if you need any, telegraph or send down a special messenger.
I am now fully alive to the fact that we have not strength adequate to the case, but I have done all possible to hasten forward re-enforce-ments; but the difficulty is the want of arms. The Kentuckians, too, are slow in organizing, though they promised much.
There is one regiment (Grider’s) already formed in Monroe County, south of you. Brigadier-General Ward, at Greensburg, also has three regiments forming. They are ordered to threaten the flank of Buckner’s position. At Owensborough, on the Ohio, are also forming four regiments.

these are mere demonstrations, but that is all that can be attempted. The main reliance is on what you have in hand.

Sir : A few days since the gunboat Conestoga (Captain Phelps) went up the Tennessee to Fort Henry. He describes it as a respectable earthwork, mounting heavy guns, with outworks, and a garrison of probably 1,700 to 1,800 men.
Since then I have learned from three different sources that the number of guns is 20 and the garrison 2,000; that they are constructing three gunboats, iron plated, to mount heavy ordnance, and expect to attack this place, aided by a land force from different directions. The old scheme.
I went up the Tennessee this morning in the Conestoga to the Chain of Rocks. I can render the gunboalts useless to the enemy hereafter, if need be, by sinking at this place two or three coal barges filled with stone.

Two messengers have just arrived from 9 miles beyond London, informing me certainly that Zollicoffer with his force is approaching and are at Stephen Coilier’s to-night. I must have aid here to-morrow. They say they have information that they have some 6,000.

Captain Greene, Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville, Ky*:
Sir: Night before last I wrote to General Sherman, saying that I would march at daylight yesterday (the 17th) to take possession of McCormick’s Gap, on the State road from Mount Sterling to Prestonburg, by way of Hazel Green, and that I would find the enemy and report his numbers. I ordered the Second Ohio Regiment and Colonel Grigsby’s militia to move—the militia at daylight and the Ohio troops at 8 o’clock. When the militia were called o\it to move they flatly refused, and, notwithstanding all the exertions of their officers, broke up, with the exception of about 120, turned in their arms, and started home.
Some who made the excuse that they could not march 13 miles in the direction of the enemy, did march from the Springs to Winchester last night, a distance from the enemy of 30 miles.

The consequence is that Harris’ regiment is now at McCormick’s Gap without support. The enemy, I believe, from all information I can gather, to be 1,500 strong at Hazel Green, 18 miles from McCormick’s, and 500 at West Liberty, which is 5 miles from Hazel Green. Sill’s regiment is making forced marches to get up, and to-night will be at Mount Sterling. If the rebels get the pass at McCormick’s they will then hold the three passes into the blue-grass region, and be able to come down whenever it suits them. If I can hold McCormick’s I turn the other two, Betty’s Gap and Yokum, and move and break up their force. The whole mountain, whence we expected to get many soldiers, is becoming completely demoralized, and* they are enlisting under Williams.
From the passes to this town is but 45 miles, and their forward movement must Hank the whole line of operations going on towards Hick Bobinson.
I beg that such force as the general commanding will deem proper be immediately sent to my assistance. With two regiments from Lexington, or elsewhere, I can finish this business. Without such assistance I cannot be certain as to the result.
I rode to this place to get near the postal lines and the telegraph, and return immediately to join Colonel Harris.

I saw the colonel of the Indiana regiment last night at the river when Mr. Faulkner left, ing up and joining me immediately, he was ordered by you.
I am now making arrangements to move my sick and commissary’s stores across the river, and intend, if I do not receive more troops, to abandon this place and retreat towards Camp Bobinson.

Colonel Third Regiment Kentucky Volunteers.
Camp Hick Bobinson, October 19,1861. Brigadier General Thomas :
Sir : Having inspected your position and situation, I must say you are surrounded by difficulties and exposed to labors of the most serious character.
We all occupy the strange position of carrying on war to defend Kentucky against an invasion of secessionists from abroad and refugees from the State.
A force threatens the fertile basins of Kentucky from the east by

way of Prestonburg and West Liberty. I have given General Nelson all the force disposable to meet that danger, viz, three regiments of Ohio troops. His proper base is Paris, Ky., and he will draw his supplies from Cincinnati.
Your force is distributed from the Kentucky River to the Rockcastle Hills. I understand the pass through these hills is now menaced by General Zollicoffer from Cumberland Ford; that Colonel Garrard is defending the pass with his Kentucky regiment, and that Colonels Connell and Coburn are in support.
The distance is too far from you, and either those regiments must fall back on you or yo^ advance to their support. The latter is the better plan, and you will move forward with all of your command that is prepared to move to some point at Crab Orchard or Mount Yernon, and either recall the troops in advance to you or sustain the advance in or near the Rockcastle River. The details must be left in a great measure to yourself; only keep your forces as well together as possible, and do the best you can.
Colonels Bruce and Dudley, at Lexington, are instructed to guard Lexington and the railroad as far as Nicliolasville.
You had better leave the sick and such as you determine to leave behind either here in camj) or back near the bridge over the Kentucky River. I have also instructed General Mitchel, at Cincinnati, if possible, to gather another Ohio regiment at Paris, and to guard the railroad back to the Ohio River.
The critical condition of affairs at Louisville recalls me to those headquarters.
W. T. SHERMAN,
Brigadier- General.
Camp Wildcat, October 10,1861.
General George H. Thomas :
On yesterday the rebel cavalry advanced as far as 1 mile this side of the forks of the road; there they had a skirmish with a squad of cavalry of ours. I only know what the cavalry men report. They say they killed one of the rebels—they got a clever horse and his hat; Captain Smith has his hat. Bibb, of the cavalry, says he killed the person and brought the horse into camp. Four or 5 of our men are missing, though they may not be killed. Three of their horses followed into canrp. Some of our men report that several of our men found their horses gfv-ing way, and jumped off and took to the brush. Up to this time I have heard no more from our men.
A messenger arrived here about midnight, and says the rebels had all withdrawn from this side of the forks of the roads. As the messenger passed the forks of the road, Mrs. Pitman told him the rebels said they had killed 1 of our men near there, and they ought to have him buried, though the messenger saw nothing of any dead body.
The infantry at 4 o’clock yesterday evening had not reached Laurel Bridge, but some 400 cavalry had been this side of London. The rebels say they have some 11,000 infantry, 600 cavalry. They have a large force, and were re-enforced the day before they left Flat Lick.
The river has been up, but will be fordable to-day or to-morrow. I have had all my commissary stores put on the other side of the river, and intend retreating unless I receive re-enforcements. They have men enough to come to this camp in every direction. I have had the road

blockaded for several miles and a bridge torn up, but they can soon cut out the road.
I have not heard one word from you since I wrote on the morning of the 17th instant. If they have l,3t)0 cavalry, they have almost two to one of our effective forces. The messenger says he saw a tolerably large, nearly white-headed, person with the cavalry, who said he lived between Lancaster and Gamp Robinson, and that he said his name was uAnderson”; also that Gabriel Saulter was with them) that they had a company of 38 Kentuckians, principally from Montgomery and Bath Counties.
Inclosed I send you a note from a reliable person 4’om Flat Lick. He differs from the messenger as to numbers, though several persons are in camp now that saw them leave Flat Lick. They say the troops commenced moving early Wednesday morning, and it was 11 o’clock before they passed.

Found Camp Dick Robinson partially supplied, and much troubled for want of money. Rumors of an advance. Thomas had sent forward two regiments to Rockcastle. Ordered him to concentrate near Crab Orchard or Mount Vernon. On return here find all at Camp Nolin quiet, but confirmatory intelligence of Buckner’s strength on the other side of Green River, with the purpose of an attack on Louisville and Cincinnati. General Ward, at Greensburg, on a report of an advance of 2,000 rebels, fell back to Campbellsville, where, being re-enforced by volunteers, he made an attack. He calls for re enforcements, and I have none to give. The Pittsburgh troops are floating down the river, and have not reached Cincinnati. General Mitchel reports he is ordered by you to remain at Cincinnati.

Sir : I have the honor to submit the report requested in your letter of the 19th instant.*
#######
We left Saint Louis October 14, and arrived at Indianapolis in the evening. Remained at Indianapolis October 15, and conversed freely with Governor Morton. We found that the State of Indiana had come nobly up to work of suppressing the rebellion. Fifty-five regiments, with several batteries of artillery, had been raised and equipped; a larger mmd >er of troops in proportion to population than any other State had sent into the field. The best spirit prevailed, and it was manifest that additional troops could readily be raised. The governor had established an arsenal, and furnished all the Indiana troops with full supplies of ammunition, including fixed ammunition for their batteries of artillery. This arsenal was visited, and found to be in full operation. It was under the charge of a competent pyrotechnist. Quite a number of females were employed in making cartridges, and I venture to assert that the ammunition is equal to that which is manufactured anywhere else. Governor Morton stated that his funds for this purpose were exhausted, but the Secretary desired him to continue his operations, informing him that the Government would pay for what had been furnished to the troops in the field. It is suggested that an officer of ordnance be sent to Indianapolis to inspect the arsenal and ascertain the amount expended in the manufacture of ammunition, with a view to reimbursing the State.
Loft Indianapolis October 16 for Louisville, Ky., where we arrived at 12.30 o’clock p. m., and had an interview with General Sherman, commanding the Department of the Cumberland. He gave a gloomy picture of affairs in Kentucky, stating that the youug men were generally secessionists and had joined the Confederates, while the Union men, the aged and conservatives, would not enroll themselves to engage in conflict with their relations on the other side. But few regiments could

be raised. He said that Buckner was in advance of Green River, with a heavy force, on the road to Louisville, and an attack might be daily expected, which, with his then force, he would not be able to resist, but that he would fight them. He as well as citizens of the State said that the border States of Kentucky must furnish the troops to drive the rebels from the State. His force then consisted of 10,000 troops, in advance of Louisville, in camp at Nolin River, and on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad at various points ; at Camp Dick Robinson, or acting in conjunction with General Thomas, 9,000; and two regiments at Henderson, on the Ohio, at the mouth of Green River. [See inclosure.] On being asked the question, what force he deemed necessary, he promptly replied 200,000 men. This conversation occurred in the presence of Mr. Guthrie and General Wood. The Secretary replied that he supposed that the Kentuckians would not in any number take up arms to operate against the rebels, but he thought General Sherman overestimated the number and power of the rebel forces ; that the Government would furnish troops to Kentucky to accomplish the work; that he (the Secretary) was tired of this defensive war, and that the troops must assume the offensive and carry the war to the firesides of the enemy 5 that the season for operations in Western Virginia was about over, and that he would take the troops from there and send them to Kentucky ; but he begged of General Sherman to assume the offensive and to keep the rebels hereafter on the defensive. The Secretary desired that the Cumberland Ford and Gap should be seized, and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad taken possession of, and the artery that supplied the rebellion cut.
Complaint was made of the want of arms, and, on the question being asked, “What became of the arms we sent to KentuckyIP we were informed by General Sherman that they had passed into the hands of the Home Guards, and could not be recovered 5 that many were already in the hands of the rebels, and others refused to surrender those in their possession, alleging the desire to use them in defense of their individual homes if invaded. In the hands of individuals and scattered over the State, these arms are lost to the army in Kentucky. Having ascertained that 6,200 arms had arrived from Europe at Philadelphia, 3,000 were ordered to Governor Morton, who promised to place them immediately in the hands of troops for Kentucky; the remaining 3,200 were sent to General Sherman at Louisville. Negley’s brigade, at Pittsburgh, 2,800 strong, two companies of the Nineteenth Infantry, from Indianapolis, the Eighth Wisconsin at Saint Louis, the Second Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers at Pittsburgh, and two regiments from Wisconsin were then ordered to Kentucky, making in all a reenforcement of about 10,000 men.
We left Louisville at 3 o’clock p. m. for Lexington, accompanied by General Sherman and Mr. Guthrie; remained there a few hours, and proceeded to Cincinnati, arriving at 8 o’clock p. m. At Lexington also we found that the opinion existed that the young men of Kentucky had joined the rebels 5 that no large bodies of troops could be raised in Kentucky; and that the defense of the State must necessarily devolve upon the free States of the West and Northwest.
Having accomplished the object of our visit to the West, we left Cincinnati on the 18th and reached Washington on the 21st, having spent the 19th and 20th at Harrisburg.
Respectfully submitted.

Sir: On my arrival at Camp Dick Robinson I found General Thomas had stationed a Kentucky regiment at Rockcastle Hills, beyond a river of same name, and had sent an Ohio and an Indiana regiment forward in support. He was embarrassed for transportation, but I authorized him to hire teams and to move his whole force nearer to his advance guard, so as to support it, as he had information of the approach of Zollicoffer towards London. I have just heard from him that he had sent forward General Schoepf, with Colonel Wolford’s cavalry, Colonel Steedman’s Ohio regiment, and a battery of artillery, followed on a succeeding day by the Tennessee brigade. He had still two Kentucky

regiments, the Thirty-eighth Ohio, and another battery of artillery, with which he was to follow yesterday. This force if concentrated should be strong enough for the purpose, and at all events is all he had or I could give him. I explained to you fully when here the supposed position of our adversaries, among which was a force in the valley of Big Sandy supposed to be advancing on Paris, Ky. General Nelson, at Maysville, was instructed to collect all the men he could and Colonel SilPs regiment of Ohio volunteers. Colonel Harris Was already in position at Olympian Springs, and a regiment lay at Lexington, which I ordered to his support. This leaves the line of Thomas’ operations exposed, but I cannot help it. I explained so fully to yourself and the Secretary of War the condition of things, that I can add nothing now until further developments. You know my views—that this great center of our field was too wTeak, far too weak, and I have begged and implored till I dare not say more.
Buckner still is beyond Green River. He sent a detachment of his men, variously estimated from 2,000 to 4,000, towards Greensburg. General Ward, with about 1,000 men, retreated to Campbellsville, where he called to his assistance some partially formed regiments to the number of about 2,000. The enemy did not advance, and General Ward was at last dates at Campbellsville. These officers, charged with raising regiments, must of necessity be nearer their homes to collect men, and for this reason are out of position j but at or near Greensburg and Lebanon I desire to assemble as large a force of the Kentucky volunteers as possible. This organization is necessarily irregular, but the necessity is so great, that I must have them, and therefore have issued to them arms and clothing during the process of formation. This has facilitated their enlistment; but inasmuch as the legislature provided the means for organizing the Kentucky volunteers, and intrusted their disbursements to a board of loyal gentlemen, I have endeavored to cooperate with them to hasten the formation of these corps. The great difficulty is, and has been, that as volunteers offer we have not arms and clothing to give them. The arms sent us are, as you already know, European muskets of uncouth pattern, which the volunteers will not touch. General McCook has now three brigades—Johnson’s, Wood’s, and Rousseau’s. Negley’s brigade arrived to-day, and will at once be sent out. The Minnesota regiment has also arrived, and will be sent forward. Hazzard’s regiment of Indiana troops I have ordered to the mouth of Salt Creek; an important point on the turnpike road leading to Elizabethtown.
I again repeat that our force here is out of all proportion to the importance of the position. Our defeat would be disastrous to the nation, and to expect of new men who never bore arms to do miracles is not right.
I am, with much respect, vours, truly,

cannot on paper. I went to Camp Dick Robinson to see the camp and troops there, and found the same rumors of the approach of Zollicoffer from the Gap. I gave my orders, and then directed an Ohio regiment at Lexington to re-enforce Kelson. He is the only officer I could command on that expedition, the importance of which I admit. Kelson’s reports to me warrant the belief that he will be energetic and pushing, and I hope successful. I am compelled to keep a strong force in front of Green River, and the authorities have given me very few officers, and these I have distributed to the best advantage. The Secretary of War insisted that he had fulfilled the request of the Kentuckians in Washington, and rested strongly on the people themselves, who he thought would act with vigor and promptness as soon as the legislature took positive grounds. How far they are fulfilling this supposition you can judge.
Kelson has three Ohio regiments, and the men of Marshall and some Home Guards. I also instructed General Mitchel to put a regiment at Paris. I have to work with the materials at hand; I cannot create them. The Union men must act more spontaneously and vigorously. I believe the authorities are now alive to the importance of this State, and will strain every nerve to provide the men and materials. The State Military Board has also undertaken to organize and partially equip the volunteers of the State. The President, Secretary of War, and General Anderson gave so many authority to raise regiments that it is impossible to reconcile their claims. Still I hope and trust a respectable force will be organized in Kentucky. I shall at all times be glad to hear from you, and hope you will never cease your efforts to inspire your fellow-citizens with the same spirit that actuates you.

General Georgke H. Thomas:
General : Your aid arrived in time to save us from a certain defeat (what others may say to contrary notwithstanding). It is not necessary for me to say one word about the fight, for you have no doubt been fully posted. Though don’t be deceived as to the number killed by us; my impression is that we did not kill to exceed 16 and wounded some 30 or 40. Many say we lost a great victory by not pursuing the enemy. It is true, if we had have known as much then as now we might have done wonders. But we expected an attack the next morning and every one was sleeping on their arms, and we never knew the enemy had left camp until near 8 o’clock. We have a great many here who know precisely lio\v to manage affairs when the enemy is out of hearing, but would be as much at a loss to do so in a fight as I would be.
The teams you ordered turned over to me have for some cause been retained. I have but one team in my regiment. I have detailed Lieutenant-Colonel Bidgell to go to your camp for the purpose of getting some teams for my regiment; also to remain until he can procure clothing for the soldiers. I do not attach blame to any one, but my men are actually suffering.

P. S.—When I get my train I would like to get permission to move near London, as I would like to be with my family a short time, and I do not want to leave the regiment.

General Thomas:
Sir : I am now within a few miles of our railroad, but I have not yet had time to obtain all the information I must have before I decide on the course best for me to adopt. If I can get half a dozen brave men to u take the bull by the horns,” we can whip them completely and save the railroad. If I cannot get such leaders, we will make a desperate attempt to destroy all the bridges, and I firmly believe I will be successful.
There are 1,400 rebel troops at Knoxville, some poorly armed, some not armed, and many of them sick. There are 160 at the Loudpn Bridge. I know of no other troops in East Tennessee except the 300 about whom I wrote to you from Montgomery. They have gone to Wolf River.
Zollieoffer has 6,000 men all told ; 1,000 of these are sick; 600 or 800 are not armed; 1,600 of the 6,000 are at Cumberland Gap; the balance beyond the gap.
Our enemies here are very uneasy for the safety of Zollieoffer, and have been calling on Davis for help; but, as I am informed, Davis says he is so pressed on the Potomac that he can spare none of the Virginia troops.
I can gain no reliable information from Kentucky by way of Nashville. I hear of no troops passing over our railroad.
We hear, by way of Knoxville, that Garrard has driven Zollieoffer back 6 miles. I suppose it is true, as secessionists tell it.
This whole country is in a wretched condition ; a perfect despotism reigns here. The Union men of East Tennessee are longing and praying for the hour when they can break their fetters. The loyalty of our people increases with the oppressions they have to bear. Men and women weep for joy when I merely hint to them that the day of our deliverance is at hand. I have not seen a secession flag since I entered the State. I beg you to hasten on to our help, as we are about to create a great diversion in General McClellan’s favor. It seems to me, if you would ask it, he would spare you at once 5,000 or 10,000 well-drilled troops. Will you not ask for more help ?
I know you will excuse a civilian for making suggestions to a military man, when you remember that I am risking my life and that I am about to ask my people to do the same. I find more deficiency in arms in this part of East Tennessee than I expected. You must bring some small-arms with you. I am satisfied that you will have to take the road by Monticello and Jamestown, unless you come by Cumberland Gap.
I can assure you that whoever is the leader of a successful expedition into East Tennessee will receive from these people a crown of glory of which any one might well be proud, and I know of no one on whom I would more cheerfully bestow that crown than on yourself.
I regret that I can give you no more information, but I will communicate with you as circumstances may require. Perhaps it would be well for you to let General McClellan know that I have reached East Tennessee, as I know he is very anxious for my success.
I write in great haste, but believe you may rely on all I have written.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. BLOUNT CARTER.

Brig. Gen. W. T. Siierman,
Commanding Department of Cumberland, Louisville, Ky.:
General: I have just returned from the Boekcastle Hills. Our troops have a decided victory, repulsing the enemy upon very nearly equal terms, and feel very much elated and are ahxious for an advance.
We are informed that Zollicoffer has retired to his old position behind the Cumberland, and intends to make a stand there. I am very sorry that we are not in a condition to march upon him at once, as I believe he could now be easily driven out of Kentucky; but the men have no clothing, and we are scarce of forage. The road, too, is very long—in fact, too long to transport supplies during the coming winter, unless I had funds in hand to pay the necessary expenses as we proceed. I have advanced the troops from Rockcastle Hills to the point where the road forks to Richmond. That position commands the road leading to this place also. I have established a depot at Crab Orchard, and have made arrangements to have all our supplies hauled direct, from Mcholasville to that place; but as we shall have the greatest difficulty in getting supplies over the road through the Rockcastle Hills, which are exceedingly precipitous and boggy in the winter season, I think it would be best to change the route of supply entirely, establishing a shipping depot at Lexington, and transport goods over the road through Richmond to London. That road is reported as being practicable all winter. If we remain where the troops are now encamped, it will be necessary to get forage from the neighborhood of Richmond, and the constant travel over that road I fear will make it impracticable before spring.
To advance into Tennessee, I ought to have four more regiments from some other State than Kentucky to follow after us as a reserve, and money in the hands of the quartermaster and commissary to defray necessary expenses. By taking in a train along with the army two months’ supply of s.ugar, coffee, and other small stores, I think we can get on without any very serious difficulties.
With the exception of Sharp’s rifle ammunition, we have an abundant supply now.- I would be obliged if you would send me 50 boxes as soon as possible, with the requisite supply of percussion caps.
If you approve of my advance, let me know as soon as possible. I shall move in a day or two to Grab Orchard.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. H. THOMAS,

Camp Hick Robinson, October 28,1861. Brig. Gen. W. T. Sherman,
Commanding Department of the Cumberland, Louisville, Ky.: General : My reason for advancing beyond the Rockcastle Hills was the impossibility of remaining in that inhospitable place any longer. Animals could not be foraged except by sending from 12 to 14 miles. I have therefore sent all the troops who reached the Hills forward to within 3 miles of London, at the point where the Cumberland Gap road forks to go to Richmond and to come to this point.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
For the convenience of supplying provisions to the troops I have established a depot at Crab Orchard, which depot I propose to supply from Mcholasville by hired transportation, at the rate of 50 cents per hundred, and the transporter to pay all tolls. By that means we shall be relieved of the annoyance of the toll bills. The regiments can obtain their rations and other supplies from the depot at Crab Orchard and transport them in their regimental wagons.
Should you approve of the other route, I am told that everything we may want can be sent us by hired transportation direct from Lexington through Bichmond, and it is said that road is practicable all winter.
The Kentucky Biver, as you know, is crossed on this road by a bridge, which will have to be guarded. On the other road it is crossed by means of a ferry, which it will be necessary to guard also, as all the people living in the immediate vicinity are secessionists. Madison County also is of doubtful loyalty, and it is possible that it may become necessary to send escorts with trains on that road.
The company of pioneers of which I spoke to you when here is nearly completed, and it is possible I may be able to repair the road between Crab Orchard and the camp so as to make it practicable all winter. If, however, you think I have advanced too far, I will cheerfully obey any orders you may give to fall back.
If the regiment at Irvine is of any more account than the Kentucky regiment I have, I think it is now well posted to prevent communication between the rebels at Prestonburg and ZollicoffePs forces. If it is no better than those I have with me, I shall be only so much the more embarrassed by having it with me. If I could get four additional regiments of Ohio or Indiana volunteers, I would be perfectly willing to dispense with all the Kentucky regiments I have.
The Ohio troops here have no brigade commander. I need an officer to take charge of them very much, and would be very much pleased if I could get your acting inspector-general (Capt. C. C. Gilbert) appointed a brigadier and sent here. The Government could not confer the appointment on a better man.

General : In compliance with your instructions I have moved my command forward, and now occupy a position about 3 miles north of London, at the junction of the Crab Orchard and Bichmond roads.
I have in camp the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Ohio and Thirty-third Indiana and two batteries (Standards and Kenny’s).
I have sent Colonel Garrard's Kentucky and the First Tennessee ahead to occupy London or some convenient point adjacent. The Second Tennessee will be up to-night.
Please advise me of the location, strength, &c., of the several columns of our forces now in Kentucky.

McClaries’, Pulaski County, Kentucky,
October 29, 1881.
Brig. Gen. Georgke H. Thomas,
Commanding First Kentucky Brigade :
General: I left Camp Hoskins this morning at 3 o’clock to visit my family, being summoned to attend a little daughter who I fear is dead ere this; but I am overtaken by a courier with information, reliable, that the rebels are advancing with an expressed determination to break up our encampment. I must return to my command.
The rebel force is estimated at 3,200, which I suppose is not exaggerated, as they also have a train of 140 wagons.
I learn that they have also a body of cavalry stationed at Travisville, numbering 1,200, which of course will join their main force at Albany, making in the aggregate 4,400. I have no fears from an attack should it come from the direction of the main road leading from Monticello, but apprehend that they may attempt to flank us by crossing lower down the river. It is likewise reported that they have two batteries of artillery, and if true they may shell us from our present position. Can you send us aid—say at least one regiment and a battery? Should they effect a crossing of the Cumberland, they might prove troublesome. I shall not abandon the position we now hold unless ordered or driven, conceiving, as I do, it to be of the utmost imj)ortance that it should be held. I shall improve the time by fortifying our position as well as I can and blocking the passes more effectually above and below. In conclusion, I would state that I have received the news of their advancing from too many reliable sources to justify me in doubting it.
Please send me what assistance you can and as speedily as possible. Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. A. HOSKINS.
P. S.—If cavalry can be spared I should like to have at least one company, that which I had having been recalled.
This will accredit my nephew, W. P. Hoskins.

Sir: Yours of October 28 and 29 are just at hand, as I was over to Camp Kevin. I know that forces are pouring towards Kentucky, and they cannot come in large numbers through the Gap. They will pour towards the fertile regions from Kashville, the southwest, and Somerset. If you could watch the latter point and fall upon one of the parties that will come up from the direction of Somerset, you are in position to do so. I also apprehend that Buckner will detail a force of not over 3,000 towards Lexington from his main body, between Bowling Green and Munfordville, in hopes that we will cross Green River in detail in pursuit. Wolford's cavalry, and maybe Burbridge’s regiment, could do good service in the direction of Burkesville, where a Tennessee force under Stanton is committing outrages.
A Colonel Haggard is now at Columbia with a regiment, and very anxious to drive olf the party from the neighborhood. If you can detail them, Colonel Haggard assures me he will guarantee they can be subsisted in that quarter. There are some regiments in Ohio ready, and after consultation with Andrew Johnson I will probably send you one or more, but I do not believe this winter they will give us a chance to invade East Tennessee by the Gap. Winter is near at hand, and the roads will be almost impassable. I am apprehensive of your rear, but am assured the people are gaining in loyalty.

for the troops hauled from Meholasville to Grab Orchard by contract, and will endeavor to have a Government train organized to transport the surplus supplies from the latter place to.the camp in advance, and gradually work out of the confusion into which the transportation has fallen in consequence of the inexperience of those gentlemen who have been performing the duties of quartermaster.
I cannot learn anything positive of the movements of the enemy, either in direction of Barboursville or Somerset. I have sent Colonels Bramlette and Wolford to Somerset to the assistance of Colonel Hoskins, simply because he (Hoskins) urges me to send him re-enforcements $ but I must think that the information he has of the advance of the enemy on his camp is not very reliable. I wish very much that I could get four Ohio or Indiana regiments, so as to enable me to place the Kentuckians in permanent camps. I do not think they will ever be in the least reliable.

Louisville, Ay., November 2, 1861. General W. T. Ward, Gampbellsville:
Dear Sir : Your letter of 31st is received. When prisoners are received have the papers all handed to Judge Bullitt, a good Union man, and a member of the court of appeals, to whose decision I leave the case. We cannot imprison and keep in custody all suspected persons, and the only safe course is to follow the law of the State of Kentucky, which makes arrests only proper when overt acts of treason are established. The cases you mention are certainly such as the safety of the community would justify in having imprisoned, and I will caution Judge Bullitt on the point.
By my request Judge Catron has appointed a number of commissioners to reside along the line, one of whom was designed for Campbells-ville. His examination and commitment will be final, and will obviate our hitherto trouble of judging cases from mere letters and the explanations of the accused. So many improper arrests were made by self-constituted authorities that there was a physical impossibility of keeping them. To inflict any cruelty on them would not be tolerated by the laws of war or peace, and the consequence is many dangerous men are set free. Judge Catron says the commissioners can put them under bond, and the bond will be good against their property or the property of their sureties.
As you can well understand, we would soon fill all the places of confinement in Louisville were we to arrest and imprison all who may be dangerous. Leaders and conspicuous men never should alone, be arrested, unless in strong cases, and then an examination should be had before a commissioner of the United States.
I expect you up this week.

wagoners, who had just come into camp from Adair, reports two Ohio or Indiana regiments are in camp. By to-morrow night I shall get reply. 1 have written to them to know what effective force they have at Columbia; whether they can move in concert with me, and whether they have sufficient force to throw in the rear to cut off his retreat, and, if so, can they still furnish, and how much, force to join with me in front.
If they will throw forward to Burkesville sufficient force to hold the passes and cut off communication with Buckner’s line, the rebel and rabble crew can be effectually crushed.
I have ordered 400 of Colonel Wolford’s cavalry go forward one hour before day to reconnoiter, to advance as far as they can prudently go, gather all they can of the strength, character of forces, positions, and movements of the enemy and return and report, by which time I shall hear from Columbia. From all I can gather I take it that this is the same body of unorganized, badly-armed rebels who have been heretofore gathered near Monroe, in Overton County, Tennessee. Their strength has doubtless been greatly exaggerated. There were for some two months near Monroe 2,000 to 2,500; they left there to join Buckner, and returned through Monroe County, Kentucky, Cumberland County, and to Clinton, where they were at last accounts, with the purpose of breaking up the unarmed camps at Burkesville and then at this place. Their failure to advance, I suppose, grows out of the fact that they ascertained that the camp at Goggin was armed.
Colonels Wolford and Hoskins requested me in your absence to take command.
I have sent back for the provisions we were unable to bring up.
There is no possible chance for the enemy to advance upon our front without being cut to pieces. He may attempt a flank movement, but I will guard that in time to meet him at equally as formidable a pass.

On yesterday some five Tennesseeans arrived at our camp from near Hartsville, Tenn., and they reported that Zollicoffer’s forces were marching across from Cumberland Gap to Jamestown, Tenn.; but having heard so many false rumors, I was indisposed to trouble you until I had news which was reliable.
I shall contest this point until resistance is useless. I have just ordered the destruction of all the ferry-boats at this point, and shall so distribute my picket guards along the river above and below this point as to guard against a flank movement.

Sir: Your communication of the 1st instant was duly received. The regimental reports called for will be forwarded as soon as they can be made out with any degree of accuracy. A want of blanks much retards this business.
The county of Laurel will not supply forage for more than 10 to 20 days, and even now the utmost dissatisfaction prevails among the inhabitants. Zollicoffer had already plundered the county to a large extent, and we are at this time virtually plundering the people of what little they have left. Our promises to pay are looked upon by the people as a mere sham, amounting to nothing. We are taking at the point of the bayonet what the citizens really need for the support of their families, without returning to them anything available therefor; thus turning against us a public sentiment which we should endeavor to cherish.
It is evident that our means of transportation will hereafter prove inadequate to the required duty. Many of the mules are shoeless (a requisition for which was made some ten days since). Many of our men need shoes, blankets, and great*coats, and are unable properly to perform duty without them.
Empty trains will be kept on the road to Crab Orchard as fast as discharged at this point. The report of Captain Adams, brigade commissary of subsistence, is herewith inclosed; also that of Captain Standard*

extent if we can get wagons. I send you Capt. A. J. Mackay, brigade quartermaster, who can explain to you fully the embarrassments we labor under in this poor country, and I wrould be obliged if he can be furnished with funds to pay all small bills against the department, as being able to do so will give confidence to the people, and enable us to get forage, &c., much more easily than by the present method of giving certified accounts of purchases. This is a poor region of country. If we are compelled to winter here, nearly if not all of our supplies will have to be brought from a distance.
General Schoepf has found it necessary to appoint his assistant adjutant-general, Capt. T. S. Everett, chief of the quartermaster and commissary departments for the troops at London, as he could find no one else who has any knowledge of the duties of those departments. I have also to ask that you will direct Colonel Swords and Captain Symonds to furnish Captain Everett with sufficient funds to pay all small bills against these departments contracted by him or any of his subordinates.

General : Yours of the 2d is received. Captain Adams has arrived and Captain Everett has turned over to him the duties of the subsistence department. Captain Everett thinks that with a good degree of patience and perseverance on his part he can get Captain Adams into a reasonable knowledge of the business of the department, he (Adams) being attentive and willing to be instructed. Captain Everett will continue at the head of the quartermaster department until relieved by an officer of that department.
The timely amval of the fourteen wagons, on the 31st, sent with supplies from Crab Orchard, relieves us from any immediate fears of getting out of provisions. I now have two trains on the road, and am grinding from 50 to 80 bushels of corn per day.
If I can get my mules shod I shall get along, but at present they are in bad condition, some of them having to remain in camp wholly unfit for the road. If the quartermaster at Crab Orchard has a shop in operation, please let him render us as much assistance in this line as possible. Also try to send us shoes and nails, a requisition for which has been made.
No news of importance from the enemy. I inclose a few more of the reports called for by your chief of staff on the 1st instant. I have so far found it impossible to get the commanders of regiments to furnish proper monthly returns for October. My adjutant-general has been untiring in his efforts for the last three days to get something upon which he could frame a report for the Adjutant-Generals Office, but so far without effect. The want of suitable blanks for regimental returns is one great obstacle in the way. If proper retftrns cannot be obtained in the next twenty-four hours, Captain Everett must take the matter in hand and make out the returns lor each regiment. Have you any blanks for post or brigade returns? If so, please send me a few sheets.

In considering the future movements of my command, we must not lose sight of the fact that the Bockcastle Biver is liable at any time now to present an impassable barrier between us and cut off my means of procuring subsistence, first by freshets, and next by ice. We cannot subsist from the adjacent country.
I experience much annoyance from the citizens of the county, each pressing his views, prompted in most cases by his individual interest. It is evident that public sentiment in this locality is divided, and that we have many enemies amongst and around us who are friends for the moment from self-interest, but who would not fail to turn their hands against us should an opportunity offer, while I am afraid that the number of this latter class will be augmented by our non-payment policy as at present pursued.
The rainy weather has rendered our camp most uncomfortable. Our men are nevertheless in good spirits.
I am somewhat at a loss as regards the position of General Carter, who claims a kind of command of the Tennessee brigade. Although no inconvenience has so far arisen from this claim, it is certainly liable to produce clashing at any moment. Please advise me in the matter.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. SCHOEPF,

P. S.—I have just received reliable information that the enemy has withdrawn to a point beyond Cumberland Ford, two of his regiments having been disbanded and returned home in consequence of expiration of service.
Louisville, November 4,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron,
Secretary of War, Washington:
Dear Sir : You must know that we in Kentucky are anxious about the condition of the State. The Confederates have possession of the seven counties west of the Tennessee Biver, with the exception of the town of Paducah. They have also possession of Bowling Green and the south bank of Green Biver for 50 miles, and are threatening Louisville. They have twice invaded the State immediately south of the counties of Clinton and Cumberland, and have a threatening army immediately within the boundary. They have also Zollicoffer at Barbours-ville and passes in the mountain gaps and river upon us. At Preston-burg they have an assembled army of rebels from 3,000 to 6,000 strong, and a sprinkling of disunion men in most of the counties of the State.
We suppose that General ’McClellan has more than 200,000 men in Virginia and about Washington, and that Fremont has more than 70,0Q0 men in Missouri, whilst General Sherman, in command of the central army in Kentucky, is not able to concentrate much more than 15,000 men, and all these are raw, undisciplined troops. We want more trained men, and we want disciplined men for this important army. We know that the Indiana and Ohio troops wish to serve in Kentucky, and we suppose General Keynolds7 troops are the next best thing to regulars. We should hope, if they are not wanted in Virginia, that you will be able to send them to General Sherman forthwith. Kentucky, in thirty days, will have in the field her full quota of the 500,000

soldiers, and they will fight, but they will be undisciplined men. Give us CO,000 men on General Sherman’s center, and we will awake the Union men in Tennessee.
We hope yon will act promptly on this subject and strengthen our hands.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General L. Thomas,
Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:
Sir: In compliance with telegraphic orders of General McClellan, received late last night, I submit this report of the forces in Kentucky and of their condition.
The tabular statement shows the position of the several regiments. The camp at Kolin is at the present extremity of the Kashville Kail-road. This force was thrown forward to meet the advance of Buckner’s army, which then fell back of Green Kiver, 23 miles beyond. These regiments were substantially without means of transportation other than the railroad, which is guarded at all dangerous points, yet is liable to interruption at any moment by the tearing up of a rail by the disaffected inhabitants or a hired enemy. These regiments are composed of good material, but devoid of company officers of experience, but have been put under thorough drill since being in camp. They are generally well clad and provided for.
Beyond Green Kiver the enemy has masked his forces, and it is very difficult to ascertain even the approximate numbers. Ko pains have been spared to ascertain them, but without success, but it is well known that they far outnumber us. Depending, however, on the railroads to their rear for transportation, they have not thus far advanced this side of Green Kiver, save in marauding parties. This is the proper line of advance, but will require a very large force—certainly 50,000 men—as their railroad facilities south enable them to concentrate at Munford-ville the entire strength of the South. General McCook’s command is divided into four brigades, under Generals Wood, K. W. Johnson, Kousseau, and Kegley.
General Thomas’ line of operations is from Lexington towards Cumberland Gap and Ford, occupied by a force of Tennesseeans under the command of Zollicoffer. He occupies the position at London in front of two roads which lead to the fertile part of Kentucky, the one by Kichmond and the other by Crab Orchard, with his reserve at Camp Dick Kobinson, 8 miles south of the Kentucky Kiver. His provisions and stores go by railroad from Cincinnati to Meholasville, and thence in wagons to his several regiments. He is forced to hire transportation.	*
Brigadier-General Kelson is operating on the line from Olympian Springs, east of Baris, on the Covington and Lexington Kailroad, towards Prestonburg, in the valley of the Big Sandy, where is assembled a force of from 2,500 to 3,500 Kentuckians, waiting re-enforcements from Virginia. My last report from him was to October 28, at which time he had Colonel Harris’ Second Ohio, 900 strong; Colonel Korton’s Twenty-first Ohio, 1,000; and Colonel Sill’s Thirty-third Ohio, 750 strong, with two irregular Kentucky regiments, Colonels Marshall and

Metcalf. These troops were on the road near Hazel Green and West Liberty, advancing towards Prestonburg.
Upon an inspection of the map you will observe these are all divergent lines, but rendered necessary from the fact that our enemies in the State chose them as places of refuge from pursuit and there cluster to receive the assistance of neighboring States. Our lines are all too weak, jirobably, with the exception of that to Prestonburg. To strengthen them I am thrown on the raw levies of Ohio and Indiana, who arrive in detachments perfectly fresh from the country and loaded down with baggage ; also upon the Kentuckians, who are slowly forming regiments gll over the State at points remote from danger, and whom it will be an almost impossible task to assemble together. The organization of this latter force is by the laws of Kentucky under the control of a military board at the capital (Frankfort) and they think they will be enabled to have 15 regiments towards the middle of this month, but I doubt it, and deem it unsafe to rely on them.
There are four regiments forming in the neighborhood of Owens-borough, near the mouth of Green River, who are doing good service; also in the neighborhood of Campbellsville, but it is unsafe to rely on troops so suddenly armed and equipped. They are not yet clothed or uniformed. I know well you will think our force too widely distributed, but we are forced to it by the attitude of our enemies, whose force and numbers the country never has and probably never will comprehend. I am told that my estimate of troops needed for this line, viz, 200,000, has been construed to my prejudice, and therefore leave it for the future. This is the great center, on which our enemies can concentrate whatever force is not employed elsewhere.
Detailed statements of present force inclosed with this.

Gamp Hoskins, Pulaski County, Ky., November 4, 1831. (Received November 6.) Brig. Gen. George H. Thomas,
Commanding, Crab Orchard:
General: On yesterday Colonel Wolford left to make a reconnaissance of the rebel force below this, and with the general understanding that, should he find the enemy too strong, he was either to return or send back for re-enforcements, when Colonel Bramlette and myself are to move forward with all our available force, which we think will reach 1,200.
We learned this evening that there was a rebel force of cavalry of 350 at Travisville, and, if true, I have no doubt that Colonel Wolford has proceeded to that point with a view of giving them battle.
On Friday night the same party were at Monticello, distant 20 miles from this piace; that infantry force, numbering 3,200, made but a short stay at Albany on their return to their encampment at Old Monroe

from Burkesville, though it is said they ravaged the country in their passage, driving off horses, cattle, and hogs. They also found a brother of Captain Frogg sick in bed, whom they murdered.
My boys are quite eager to meet the rebels in combat, and should any more troops move in that direction I could not, if I were disposed, prevent their joining in the march.
I have improved our position at this place by the erection of some rude breastworks along the face of the hill and parallel with the roads. I have also blockaded a number of roads to prevent a flank movement of the enemy. They, I learn, had determined to force a passage by this route with a view of forming a junction with Zollicoffer at Crab Orchard, not doubting but that he would reach that point. Their whole force at Travisville and Old Monroe from the best information will reach near 4,000, though all assert that they are but insufficiently and poorly armed. I have not learned that they certainly have any artillery.
Recruits are coming in rapidly the past few days, and I hope to have the minimum number by the 10th instant and a full regiment in a few weeks.
I hope soon to see matters sufficiently quieted in this section to allow me time to return and dispose of my old quartermaster’s business.
Most respectfully, vour friend and obedient servant,
W. A. HOSKINS.
Headquarters Department of the Cumberland,
Louisville, Ky., November 5,1861. (Received Nov. 7.)
Brigadier-General Thomas, Grab Orchard:
Sir: Yours of November 3 is received. I had previously ordered money to be sent you for disbursement in all the departments, but you know the forms through which all such things must pass. I coincide with you that money should be disbursed liberally wherever our armies move, but my power is limited by law, and I am unable to overcome the obstacles. The commissary (Captain Symonds) assures me that he pays promptly all certified accounts, and that he has sent to Captain Kniffin $4,000 for small bills, and inasmuch as rations are hauled to you he insists that but little money is needed. I take it that, though your letter is indefinite on this point, the quartermaster is the one that needs money; Colonel Swords will send by Capt. A. J. Mackay the sum of $20,000, and if in my power will continue to cause to be transmitted you more.
In the present aspect of affairs it is impossible to say how or where we shall winter. This will depend on our enemies. They will not allow us to choose. I have done all in my power to provide men and materials adequate to the importance of this crisis, but all things come disjointed— regiments without overcoats, or Avagons, or horses, or those essentials to movements. McCook has a good body of men, but the force of the enemy far exceeds him, and the railroad on which he depends is in such a country that it requires large guards. All of these in case of attack would be terribly exposed. I can hardly sleep to think Avhat would be your fate in case the Kentucky River Bridge is destroyed or the railroad to your rear, and I demanded again and again a force adequate to all these necessities—a very large force, beyond the ability of the State to furnish. Nelson and you ought simply to guard those avenues of approach to the interior; but from this .point we should have made a bold forward movement, but I have never had a force anything approximating the magnitude of the occasion.

I wish I could make your communications perfectly safe, and the cost would be nothing. There should be at least ten good regiments to your rear, capable of sustaining the head of your column at London, but I am unable to provide; and hereabouts the army should be such as to prevent all idea of attack; but Buckner and Hardee have across Greeii River a very large force and may advance at their pleasure.
In this state of the case I can only repeat my former orders, for you to hold in check the force of Zollicoffer and await events. The road by Bichmond depending on the ferry appears to me less safe to you than the one crossing Kentucky River by the bridge.
I have nothing from Kelson for some days.
Truly, yours,
W. T. SHERMAN, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Headquarters Department of the Cumberland,
Louisville, Ky., November 5, 1861. General J. T. Boyle, Lebanon, Ky.:
Sir : Your two letters are received.* My information is that Buckner has drawn back his forces from Munfordville and Glasgow and is farther down the river. His designs are either on some point of the river below or to get up between McCook and the mouth of Salt River.
I don’t think your command will be threatened for some time; therefore push your organization, and don’t allow any of the regiments to engage in marauding expeditions; it would be better for them to be united in one body, but I suppose enlistments would be delayed by concentration.
General Ward is here and exhibits an appointment as brigadier-general, and calls my attention to the fact that in his absence Colonel Hobson is entitled to command.
The great importance of forming your Kentucky regiments will force me to allow General Ward to resume his command, and I beg you will push the formation of your regiments. The force under Harlan, Ward, and Grider should be sufficient to prevent any movement from Green River towards Thomas, and that is all I design during the process of formation ; and as soon as the organization is made under the authority of the State board, then I must consolidate you on some efficient force. The scattered condition of the Kentucky volunteers makes them a source of weakness instead of strength. We depend on them, that is, the General Government does, and yet they are not in a shape to act efficiently, not even to defend themselves. The giving of commissions by the President and by General Anderson has embarrassed me much, but I suppose it was inevitable. I am forced therefore to allow General Ward to resume his office, to construct, if possible, his brigade, and await the consolidation of the board before I can presume to count on them for military service.
The sketches you have made of the passes on Muldraugli’s Hill correspond with several I have received, and were we purely on the defensive they might be occupied, but to place regiments of Northern troops there would tie them down, and prevent their use for other service. This is one of the purposes of your Kentucky regiments when they come to be ready.

Camp Kevin, Ky., November 5,1861.
General W. T. Sherman,
Commanding Department of Cumberland:
General : The subject of contraband negroes is one that is looked to by the citizens of Kentucky of vital importance. Ten have come into my camp within as many hours, and from what they say there will be a general stampede of slaves from the other side of Green River. They have already become a source of annoyance to me, and I have great reason to believe that this annoyance will increase the longer we stay. They state the reasons of their running away their masters are rank secessionists, in some cases are in the rebel army, and that slaves of Union men are pressed into service to drive teams, &c.
1 would respectfully suggest that if they be allowed to remain here our cause in Kentucky may be injured. I have no faith in Kentucky’s loyalty, therefore have no great desire to protect her pet institution, slavery. As a matter of policy, how would it do for me to send for their masters and deliver the negroes to them on the outside of our lines, or send them to the other side of Green River and deliver them up? What effect would it have on our cause south of the river? lain satisfied they bolster themselves up by making the uninformed believe that this is a war upon African slavery. 1 merely make these suggestions, for I am very far from wishing these recreant masters in possession of any of their property, for I think slaves no better than horses in that respect.
I have put the negroes to work. They will be handy with teams and generally useful. 1 consider the subject embarrassing, and must defer to your better judgment.
The ammunition we have for our guns is not serviceable. I have been trying it to-day. The powder is old; lost its strength by exposure and frequent transportation. The fuses in the spherical case are not made properly or else the graduation is very imperfect. You have been telegraphed to on the subject.
All quiet below. Miller came back from Green River to-day. He states that he has it from reliable sources that there never has been more than 8,000 armed infantry in all of Buefcner’s army. They have without doubt pressed the wagons into service. Where they are going time will determine. The negroes that came to me to-day state that their masters had notified them to be ready to go South with them on Monday morning, and they left Sunday night.
My command is improving each day, and you need have no fears for us. I will be timely apprised of their movements, and will move to please you. Bear in mind also that they cannot insult a force of 12,000 with impunity, particularly when my movements can be more rapid than theirs.
Please send the First Ohio to me at your earliest convenience, and very much oblige your obedient servant,

Brig. Gen. W. T. Sherman,
Commanding Department of the Cumberland, Louisville, Ky. :
General : I received this morning your two communications of the 31st ultimo and 1st instant.
General Schoepf writes me, under date of the 3d instant, that he has just received reliable information that the enemy had withdrawn to a point beyond Cumberland Ford, two of his regiments having been disbanded and returned home, in consequence of expiration of service. Colonel Bramlette writes me from Somerset that the forces of the enemy southwest of Somerset had also retired, but he could not yet tell but that they might attempt a flank movement on his position near Somerset from Burkesville. He is prepared for him, however, and can meet them in a very strong position and drive them back. He further reports that there is no possible chance for them to attack him in front successfully.
I inclose copies of two communications I have just received from Mr. William B. Carter, the brother of Lieutenant Carter,U. S. Navy.* If we could possibly get the arms and the four regiments of disciplined and reliable men, we could seize the railroad yet. Cannot General McClellan be induced to send me the regiments % He can spare them easily, I should think.

Brig. Gen. W. T. Sherman,
Commanding Department of the Cumberland, Louisville, Ky.: General : *	* # I have ordered five companies to work the road
from here to Bockcastle Biver, to enable our wagons to reach London with tolerable loads. The officer I sent to examine the Bichmond and London road has returned, and reports the road good and practicable all winter. It is nearer from Lexington to London than from NTicholas-vilie to London, besides being a much better road. Transportation for any amount can be hired at all times either in Lexington or along the road. A depot at Lexington could therefore easily supply London. The troops at Somerset, Columbia, and Burkesville could easily be supplied from a depot at Lebanon, and thus obviate the necessity of guarding the bridge over Kentucky Biver. I have ascertained certainly that it is nearer from Lebanon to Somerset than from Nicholas-ville to Somerset. The road is equally as good, if not better, and there are no bridges to guard. Ample transportation can also be hired between Lebanon and Somerset. Supplies may also be forwarded from Lexington to Somerset through Mcholasville, if necessary, after a depot is established at Lebanon, without any risk, as our enemies, seeing we have a sure means of transportation through Lebanon, would abandon the idea of burning the bridge over the Kentucky Biver, as the destruction would be more inconvenient to them than to us. Therefore with two depots we shall have three sources of supply. This place can then

be abandoned, and I can remove my headquarters either to London or Somerset, as circumstances may require; the distance between these two villages is about the same as between this and London, 30 miles.
With my headquarters at Somerset I can easily seize the most favorable time for invading East Tennessee, which ought to be done this winter. I shall not need for that purpose more than four additional regiments, but they should be wrell organized and drilled, and prepared to take the held on their arrival.

Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir: The telegram of the Major-General Commanding the Army, dated at 7 p. m. on the 2d instant, directing a report on the number and position of troops, &c., was not received until this morning. We have telegraphic communication with Cairo, put up at my instigation, by order of Major-General Fremont. A cable is laid over the river at this point. The wire is in my quarters. I answered the GeneraPs telegram by telegraph to-day. A copy is inclosed.*
There are four companies of the Second Illinois Cavalry in camp at Old Fort Massac, badly armed with old carbines. The whole of this regiment was under my orders, but, at the request of Brigadier-General Grant, I detached six companies to him at Cairo. I forwarded a requisition for arms for the regiment—sabers and pistols; no carbines—to the headquarters of the Department of the West many weeks since, which, I understand, was sent to Washington. The Chief of the Ordnance Department, in answer to a telegram of mine on the subject, said he could not furnish them. I want very much the services of these four companies here, but have not brought them for want of their proper arms. They are doing good service where they are, by guarding the line of telegraph and stopping the passage of contrabands across the river; at least I hope so. By direction of General Fremont I have occupied Smithland, the mouth of the Cumberland, with 300 men. They have erected two respectable earthworks, which are protected with two 32-pounders and one 8-inch colmnbiad. Twto field guns (a 6 and 12 pounder howitzer) are needed there, but I cannot spare them, and I see no probability of getting them from Saint Louis. I made a recent inspection of Smithland. The works are well constructed, and, although they will not be completed for a fortnight or so, can make a respectable defense. My orders are to hold Paducah and Smithland at all hazards.
I inclose herewith a sketch of Paducah and its vicinity,* pointing out the defenses and stations of troops. It is a flat, wooded country, not much susceptible of defense at first, but by an unsparing use of the ax a very sufficient abatis, several hundred yards in width, renders all approach, except by the roads, which are guarded by the earthworks, very difficult, if not impracticable. The sketch, however, sufficiently explains itself. The line of defense is long, say 2 miles from the re-

doubt (Marine Hospital) to tlie bridge over Island Creek. The redoubt around the Marine Hospital, intended for a garrison of 1,000 men, in a great state of forwardness, with an 8-inch columbiad in position, is intended as the main defense should the principal part of this force be withdrawn, in which case all the outworks must be abandoned.
The number and position of the enemy is to some extent conjectured, but may be stated approximately as follows: At Columbus and its immediate vicinity, 10,000, General Pillow^ in command of the post; on the opposite shore, 2,000. The whole force in and around Columbus commanded by General Polk. At Feliciana (Camp Beauregard), south of Mayfield, towards the State line, is a battery of artillery, three companies of cavalry, and four regiments of infantry; in all probably 2,500 men, who are in a very sickly condition, the measles prevailing to a great extent and many deaths daily. At Trenton, on the State line, or a little south of it, a camp of instruction is being formed. At Memphis is a camp of instruction, under the State authorities, of, say, 3,000 men. Generals A. S. Johnston and Hardee are at Bowling Green. The force there is 40,000. This I was assured of yesterday by a Northern gentleman who recently left there. The enemy can concentrate probably 30,000 troops at Columbus in a very short time, they controlling the railways from Louisville and Columbus to Memphis.
I inclose a copy of the last order received by me within a few days from General Fremont. In the execution of these orders one-half this force will move to-day to make a demonstration on Columbus. In connection with this see also General Grant’s letter and telegram of this date inclosed. I inclose herewith a field return of the troops at this post and its dependencies.* The sick list is large, as will be perceived, but the medical director considers the general health improving. The men have plenty of food and are well clad. They are tolerably well instructed and the discipline is reasonably good. We have some wants which I will specify more at my leisure. It would aid the administration of justice if I had the authority to appoint general courts-martial. This I can only do by this force being considered an army in the field, always, of course, subordinate to the commander of the department.

The country is so large that it is impossible to give clear and definite views. Our enemies have a terrible advantage in the fact that in our midst, in our camps, and along our avenues of travel they have active partisans, farmers and business men, who seemingly pursue their usual calling, but are, in fact, spies. They report all our movements and strength, while we can procure information only by circuitous and unreliable means.

now enrolled under Buckner, have gone to him, while ours have to be raised in the neighborhood, and cannot be called together except at long notice. These volunteers are being organized under the laws of the State, and the 10th of November is fixed as the time for consolidating them into companies and regiments. Many of them are armed by the United States as Home Guards, and many of them by General Anderson and myself, because of the necessity of being armed to guard their camps against internal enemies. Should we be overwhelmed, these would scatter and their arms and clothing will go to the enemy, furnishing the very material they so much need.
We should have here a very large force, sufficient to give confidence to the Union men of the ability to do what should be done—possess ourselves of all the State; but all see we are brought to a stand-still, and this produces doubt and alarm. With our present force it would be simple madness to cross Green River, and yet hesitation may be as fatal. In like manner other columns are in peril; not so much in front as rear. The railroad over which our stores must pass being much exposed, I have the Nashville Kail road guarded by7 three regiments; yet it is far from being safe, and the moment actual hostilities commence these roads will be interrupted, and we will be in a dilemma. To meet this in part I have put a cargo of provisions at the mouth of Salt River, guarded by two regiments. All these detachments weaken the main force and endanger the whole.
Do not conclude, as before, that I exaggerate the facts. They are as stated, and the future looks as dark as possible. It would be better if some more sanguine mind were here, for I am forced to order according to my convictions.

Captain : The instructions from General Thomas relative to repairs of the road hence to Rockcastle River have been complied with. Things are quiet about London and the men in good spirits. Clothing for the needy has arrived in part, much to their relief.
I learned two days since that parties of the enemy’s cavalry wrere in the habit of coming to within 12 miles of our camp for the purpose of getting their horses shod. I sent out a strong reconnaissance to a point near Barboursville two days since, but they returned without making any discovery of importance. It is evident that the enemy has retired to the vicinity of Cumberland Gap.
Having reason to believe that some of the officers of the Third Kentucky Regiment are wholly incompetent, I would respectfully ask for authority to cause such officers to be brought before a board of examination, and a report made of the result.
The Home Guard report to have had a skirmish with the enemy’s scouts yesterday, getting advantage in several respects.
Very respectfully,

Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, November 7, 1861.
Brig. Gen. D. C. Buell:
General: In giving you instructions for your guidance in command of the Department of the Ohio, I do not design to fetter you. I merely wish to express plainly the general ideas which occur to me in relation to the conduct of operations there. That portion of Kentucky west of the Cumberland River is by its position so closely related to the States of Illinois and Missouri that it has seemed best to attach it to the Department of the Missouri. Your operations, then (in Kentucky), will be confined to that portion of the State east of the Cumberland River. I trust 1 need not repeat to you that I regard the importance of the territory committed to your care as second only to that occupied by the army under my immediate command. It is absolutely necessary that we shall hold all the State of Kentucky. Not only that, but that the majority of its inhabitants shall be warmly in favor of our cause, it being that which best subserves their interests. It is possible that the conduct of our political affairs in Kentucky is more important than that of our military operations. I certainly cannot overestimate the importance of the former. You will please constantly bear in mind the precise issue for which we are fighting. That issue is the preservation of the Union and the restoration of the full authority of the General Government over all portions of our territory. We shall most readily suppress this rebellion and restore the authority of the Government by religiously respecting the constitutional rights of all. I know that I express the feelings and opinions of the President when I say that we are fighting only to preserve the integrity of the Union and the constitutional authority of the General Government.
The inhabitants of Kentucky may rely upon it that their domestic institutions will in no manner be interfered with, and that they will receive at our hands every constitutional protection. I have only to repeat that you will in all respects carefully regard the local institutions of the region in which you command, allowing nothing but the dictates of military necessity to cause you to depart from the spirit of these instructions.
So much in regard to political considerations. The military problem would be a simple one could it be entirely separated from political influences. Such is not the case. Were the population among which you are to operate wholly or generally hostile, it is probable that Nashville should be your first and principal objective point. It so happens that a large majority of the inhabitants of Eastern Tennessee are in favor of the Union. It therefore seems proper that you should remain on the defensive on the line from Louisville to Nashville, while you throw the mass of your forces by rapid marches, by Cumberland Gap or Walker’s Gap, on Knoxville, in order to occupy the railroad at that point, and thus enable the loyal citizens of Eastern Tennessee to rise, while you at the same time cut off the railway communication between Eastern Virginia and the Mississippi. It will be prudent to fortify^ the pass before leaving it in your rear.

into Tennessee. I believe General Sherman has done the same. Up to this time we have been unsuccessful.
Have you heard by authority that the troops at London were to fall back ? because I have not, and shall not move any of them back unless ordered; because, if not interfered with, I can have them subsisted there as well as here. I am inclined to think that the rumor has grown out of the feverish excitement which seems to exist in the minds of some of the regiments that if we stop for a day that no further advance is contemplated. I can only say 1 am doing the best I can. Our commanding general is doing the same, and using all his influence to equip a force for the rescue of Tennessee.
If the Tennesseeans are not content and must go, then the risk of disaster will remain with them. Some of our troops are not yet clothed, and it seems impossible to get clothing.
For information respecting the organization of regiments, I inclose you General Orders, No. 70, from the War Department.
If the gentlemen you name can raise regiments agreeably to the conditions and instructions contained in said order, the Government will accept them, and I hope will have arms to place in their hands in the course of two or three months.
In conclusion I will add that I am here ready to obey orders, and earnestly hope that the troops at London will see the necessity of doing the same.
Very respectfully and truly, yours,
GEO. H. THOMAS,
Brigadier-General, TJ. IS. Volunteers.

Brigadier-General Schoepf,
Commanding Camp Calvert, London, Ky.:
General : I find it necessary to reply to Governor Johnson’s letter in the manner of the foregoing, which I send to you for your information. It is time that discontented persons should be silenced both in and out of the service. I sympathize most deeply with the Tennesseeans on account of their natural anxiety to relieve their friends and families from the terrible oppression which they are now suffering; but to make the attempt to rescue them when we are not half prepared is culpable, especially when our enemies are as anxious that we should make the move as the Tennesseeans themselves; for it is well known by our commanding general that Buckner has an overwhelming force within striking distance whenever he can get us at a disadvantage. I hope you will therefore see the necessity of dealing decidedly with such people, and you have my authority and orders for doing so. We must learn to abide our time, or we shall never be successful.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ing to Captain Hewett’s battery, which I suppose is the cause of the reappearance of the enemy. I have directed the section to return to him, and directed him to ascertain positively whether the enemy is anywhere near, and send me more reliable information. I hope to hear from him in two days from this.
General Schoepf writes me that Zollieoffer has retired beyond the Cumberland Ford, and that it is reported he is retiring to Cumberland Gap. He does not place much confidence in the report, however. I hear also from Colonel Barnes that Nelson is at Prestonburg, the enemy having retired towards Virginia.
A man by the name of Wilson has been to see me, who offers his services as a spy ; but, having no need for him, I have suggested to him to go to see you. He is vouched for by several persons of standing in Lexington, and no doubt you can make use ot him if you desire his services. He says he is well acquainted with the country between Louisville and Nashville, and can go anywThere you may desire to send him.

General : Without wishing to do aught of injustice to the cavalry now under my command, I am compelled, in justice to myself and the service, to say that they are not the material for the occasion. I speak from experience. A cavalry force of from two companies to a regiment is absolutely necessary and indispensable with this command.
I learn that Doubleday has a regiment of very superior men at Cleveland. Could you not secure this regiment for this brigade and allow me at least four companies of it %
I spent a portion of the day yesterday in artillery practice. With a full sense of the advantages of rifled cannon, I must express my fears that we are depending on them to the exclusion of other and (under certain circumstances) more appropriate guns. If each of the batteries under my command could exchange two of the rifled for two smooth-bored guns or 12-pounder howitzers, I am certain the efficiency of that valuable arm [would] be much enhanced. I make the suggestion.

The reason why I have done so is owing to the peculiar law of this State, which permits the bar to elect a circuit judge if that officer should not be present at the stated time of holding court. Now, the judge of this district is an open and active secessionist and has gone off with the rebel army.

Having this day occupied the town of Prestonburg with the force under my command, I declare to all whom it may concern that the jurisdiction of the State of Kentucky is restored in this section of the State, and that the regular fall terms of the courts will be held in those counties in which the time for holding the same has notpafsed; and all civil officers are ordered to attend at the regular times and places of holding said courts and attend to the duties of their respective offices.

The Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. G.:
Sir : In my report of the 6th instant, in relation to the forces of the enemy, I accidentally overlooked in my notes the works on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.
The more important is Fort Henry, 71 miles up the Tennessee, just at the State line. It is a strong earthwork, on the water front, but not nearly so strong on the land side. It has three 24 or 32 tiounders, one or two 8-inch columbiads, and the remainder of field guns, in all from 14 to 16; its garrison was two weeks since about 1,200. They have been under apprehension of attack from here for the past two weeks.
Some 8 miles above Fort Henry the enemy has been for many weeks endeavoring to convert river steamers into iron-plated gunboats. This fort is an obstacle to our gunboats proceeding to look alter such work.
I sent an intelligent person to see what progress had been made on these gunboats, but he was captured. It is my only weak point (this river), made so by the use of gunboats.	m
The Conestoga gunboat, admirably commanded by Lieutenant Phelps, of the Navy, is my only security in this quarter. He is constantly moving his vessel up and down the Tennessee and Cumberland. From the latter river he came in this morning, having gone into the State of Tennessee as far as Hover, where the enemy have a work called Fort Gavock,

or Fort MacGavock, or something else, usually called Fort Gavock [Fort Donelson]. He could not give me an idea of its armament.
I mention these things because it is a favorite idea announced on the other side that Paducah is to be attacked from three quarters at once, one quarter being by one or both rivers.

In answer to the general’s request to enumerate my wants, I beg to say that my chief want is an efficient quartermaster. In this connection I beg the general will send for an extra-official letter I addressed to the Quartermaster-General of the Army on this subject.

Sir : I have no instructions from Government on the subject of negroes. My opinion is that the laws of the State of Kentucky are in full force, and that negroes must be surrendered on application of their masters or agents or delivered over to the sheriff of the county. We have nothing to do with them at all, and you should not let them take refuge in camp. It forms a source of misrepresentation, by which Union men are estranged from our cause. I know it is almost impossible for you to ascertain in any case the owner of the negro. But so it is 5 his word is not taken in evidence, and you will send them away.

As soon as the Kentucky volunteers organize in such a way as to enable me to estimate for them, I will order the establishment of a depot at Lebanon. I have been impressed of its importance from the first.
You know how impossible it is forme to obtain good, well-drilled regiments. I could not possibly send you three or four. There are three regiments in Ohio nearly7 ready to come, but of course they are fresh troops. Mr. Maynard still presses the East Tennessee expedition.

This outside pressure has become intolerable and must be met with firmness, or the Army may as well be disbanded.
With importunate citizens on one side and meddlesome reporters for papers on the other, I can scarce find time to attend to the appropriate duties of my position.

thus keeping me continually in a false position with my superior officers and the country.
So far as a forward movement is concerned, I have never urged it 5 do not now urge it 5 but on the contrary believe that in the present condition of my command (having a large sick list) it would be most decidedly imprudent. I am nevertheless ready to obey your order to advance, come when it may. That is a question for my superiors, and not for me, to determine.
Alter eight days of labor on the part of Captain Everett, he has re* turned the regimental monthly returns to the respective commanders, to be forwarded direct to your headquarters; Captain Everett having declared his inability to obtain from any one regiment anything like a passable document, or even the data upon which he could frame one.
My consolidated morning reports will be commenced on the 10th and promptly continued as per orders every ten days, and forwarded upon the days upon which they are made.
Please furnish the regimental commanders with blanks in time lor the close of the present month, when, perhaps, by “ line upon line and precept upon precept,” they may be brought to produce a more businesslike sheet in future.

Headquarters Kentucky Militia, Frankfort, November 9, 1861. (Received November 11.) General George H. Thomas, Crab Orchard:
Sir : Information has reached this department that Captain Munday and a body of men (Kentucky volunteer cavalry) presented themselves to vou a lew days since, and were sworn into the service of the United States.
By the terms of General Orders, No. 78, of the War Department U. S., all the volunteers in the loyal States are placed under the command of the governors of those States (I send a copy of order), and General Sherman’s orders Nos. 10 and 13 direct that ali persons raising recruits in the State are directed to report to the adjutant-general of the State, &c.
I beg to suggest, with great deference, that the exercise of authority in mustering in detached companies by the Federal authorities at the same time the military board is striving to compel a consolidation of fractional companies and regiments must produce great contusion, and may operate prejudicially to the public service.
There are now in the various camps in Kentucky, in fractional companies and regiments, a large number of men. The purpose of the board is to organize them into regiments as quickly as possible.
Many persons raising regiments under permit from War Department and General Anderson are disinclined to consent to a consolidation because they may lose their places.
It will be seen, therefore, if a consolidation is desirable, it can only be effected by a rigid adherence to the order giving the board exclusive control over the recruits.

Headquarters Department of the Cumberland.
Louisville, Ky., November 11, 1801. (Beceived Nov. 12.) General George H. Thomas, Crab Orchard, Ky. ;
Sir: Yours of the 7th, reporting the reappearance of the enemy at Monticello, is received.
The intention is doubtless so to occupy the attention of Bramlette and Wolford as to divide them from the forces in the direction of the Gap. The fact that two roads enter the fertile part of Kentucky at London makes that an important point, and must be held.
Whether the force of General Schoepf is sufficient I am unable to judge, but it is impossible to re-enforce you by any except the new Kentucky levies, that are yet incomplete. Barnes7 regiment at Estill Springs might be called for, and Nelson’s force if it can be reached.
It is not alone the armies in the field that we have to watch, but the disunionists all over the State, who may at any moment be assembled in sufficient force to intercept trains and break up railroads.
The Kentucky volunteers will to-day be consolidated into regiments and mustered into service, and then, for the first time, be subject to orders; but, as you well know, without wagons or sufficient arms and clothing, they will not be of much use this year.
I have daily and constantly increased evidence of a vast force in our front, and that they are assembling wagons preparing for a move; and it is probable an advance on their part from Cumberland Gap along the whole line will be concentric and simultaneous. It was my judgment of the case when Secretary Cameron was here, and I begged him to prepare for it, but they never have attached the importance to Kentucky in this struggle that it merits.
My expression of dissatisfaction at the publication of Thomas7 report and request to be relieved from this charge has led to the assignment of General Buell, of whom I have not yet heard.
You should have at least 10,000 more men, and could I give them they should be there, but I cannot get them.
The new regiments arrive without notice and perfectly raw.
All that I can now do is to say that I will approve of your course, let the result be what it may.
If you can hold in check the enemy in that direction, is all that can be attempted; or if you must fall back, your line is toward Lexington ; or if outnumbered, you are not bound to sacrifice the lives of your com-
mand.
I was in hopes McClellan, in assuming the command, would send on adequate re enforcements, but he has not done so. Indeed, it may be out of his power to do it.
I am, yours,
W. T. SHEBMAN, Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Louisville, November 11, 1861. (Beceived November 12.) General Thomas:
I am just in receipt of a telegraphic dispatch from McCook, at Camp Nolin, that the forces in his front along Green Biver have disappeared, and that there is a rumor that Buckner is moving in force toward Lexington between us.

If it be true that the force at the Gai) has been increased, as represented, to 20,000, it would be madness to contend. My information is positive as to the state of affairs along Green Biver, but conjectural as to the other, and I send a special messenger to convey it to you.

Camp Wolford, November 11,1861. General George H. Thomas:
Since writing to you this morning, I have ascertained that there are above this, in process of construction, 80 coal boats, 44 nearly complete, the others temporarily suspended. These boats are usually 80 to 00 feet long by 25 to 30 in width. Any number within reason could be constructed above this in the course of six to eight weeks, capable of transporting a large force, with all necessary equipments. They are a heavy boat, open top, made to bear up the immense burden of 80,000 to 100,000 bushels of coal.
I made inquiry of an old boatman as to the number of boats building, and what preparations were making for the shipment of coal, and thus learned the state of preparations. Boats might be built without exciting suspicion and a descent upon Nashville accomplished, if in the plan of operations such movement were desirable. I communicate these facts for consideration.
##*### #
I will send the section of Captain Hewett’s battery back so soon as I can determine whether it is necessary to make a descent upon the cavalry at Camp McGinnis. If I do that, I wish to do so with the cavalry ; two companies of skirmishers to go with the artillery, and shall accompany them and command myself. If they are back at McGinnis, I can so arrange those forces as to cut them off* and bag them. But the uncertainty of all the reports, even of avowed eye-witnesses, renders it- necessary that I get information through means of my own that can be relied on.

Sir : We have just arrived at this place—total about 230 men. Some 25 or 30 rebels were in some nine or ten miles of this place yesterday. There are some 1,200 rebels in Fentress County, Tenn., some 25 miles from here. There are some 500 near Old Monroe, Tenn., and some 600 below Livingston. Of this number there are about 1,000 cavalry.
We do not apprehend any danger here at present, but they might see proper to attack us. We could not conveniently make arrangements for our men any other place. We will stay here to-night and await further orders. Send us word as to your movements; whether we will be re enforced and when.

We must be re-enforced soon or we will have to fall back, as the rebels will receive information of our condition.

Camp Wolford, near Somerset, November 11, 1861. (Eeceived November 12.) General George H. Thomas :
I have been enabled to ascertain pretty full and accurate information of the enemy recently in Cumberland, Clinton, and Wayne Counties.
The opinion heretofore expressed by me to you in a former communication is fully sustained.
The forces consisted of two regiments infantry and about 650 to 700 cavalry, the same that had heretofore been stationed at Camp McGinnis, in Fentress County (the cavalry), and at Camp Myers, in Overton County, near the old town of Monroe, two regiments infantry, under Colonels Stanton and Murray.
They became alarmed upon a report reaching them that I was moving upon them with a large force, and the infantry regiments fled precipitately until they reached Camp Zollicoffer, 3 miles south of Livingston, the county seat of Overton County, and about 38 miles south of the State line.
The cavalry fled from Monticello very hastily upon the report that Colonel Woltord and myself were near at hand and moving upon them, and did not halt until they made Jamestown, Tenn. In a day or two they found that they were not pursued, and returned to their old camp at Camp McGinnis, where they now are, having obstructed the road with abatis.
I am quietly waiting for them to recover from their fright and venture to peep out this side of their brush, and will, if they do so, make a dash at them and cut them off and to pieces. I know their hiding place, and how to surround it, when they get sufficient confidence to think themselves safe.
From a man whom I know well, and have from his infancy, and who has been a prisoner with them for three weeks, until they reached Camp Zollicoffer, I have learned their movements.
Mr. Huff is my informant. He got to camp Saturday night just from their camp, and is perfectly reliable. He says they talked very boldly

until they heard of my approach (which was really at the time a false report, as it was started about the time you ordered me forward); they * were then suddenly overtaken with alarm, and left as before stated. Huff says they are armed with stolen Home Guard muskegs, with pistols, shot-guns, common rifles, &c., just what they can lay their hands upon) that most of the men are very much dissatisfied with their condition, and swear if they could get away they would, never to be drawn in again. The cavalry are generally well mounted, having seized all the fine horses they could lay hands upon, but badly armed. They had no artillery. At Camp Zollicoffer Huff says he overheard the colonels talking the day before he got off that they were to remain there ten or twelve days, till they got orders. There is a report that the rebels have at Jamestown, just in the rear of the cavalry, 180 wagons. I have set on foot an investigation, and if I find this to be certain, it will be an incentive to capture which I can’t resist, but will do it cautiously and with entire safety to my men, as we should have nothing to do but to frighten the cavalry again and go forward and take them. There is some plausible grounds for belief that those wagons are there for the purpose of hauling the hogs they expected to steal and carry off from along the border as soon as fattened.
And this suggests the propriety of my forming a camp forward at Monticello, and having Colonel Haggard to resume his camp at Burkes-ville. At Burkesville the whole Upper Cumberland can be controlled, ascent and descent of the river be regulated, and with sufficient cavalry force to keep up a regular line of pickets between the two posts at Monticello and Burkesville the entire central border can be assured protection against these marauding wretches or they intercepted and cut off.
At Monticello I can, when you desire it, either move forward or turn to Whitley County, join any movement made via Huntsville, or on toward Barboursville or in a descent of the river; it is 5 miles from the Cumberland at one of the shipping points. It is a rich agricultural country about Monticello, abounding in subsistence and forage.
I make these latter suggestions for your consideration and instruction. I do so only because of my thorough knowledge of the geography and topography of the country, without any purpose of obtruding my opinions, but simply to give you the facts, and then rigidly to conform to your directions.
Respectfully,

Sir : I sent a special dispatch to you last night, intimating the necessity of withdrawing your forces farther back.
I am convinced from many facts that A. Sidney Johnston is making herculean efforts to strike a great blow in Kentucky; that he designs to move from Bowling Green on Lexington, Louisville, and Cincinnati. I may be in error, but he has pressed into service some 1,500 wagons at and near Bowling Green, and his force is not far short of 15,000 men, with a large proportion of artillery.
The movement may depend on new circumstances, but I think the 23 r r—VOL IV

best disposition of your force is to leave tbe Tennesseeans and Colonel Garrard in a kind of ambush near Rockcastle River and draw back of Danville the balance. Establish communication with Bramlette and Wolford and with the other Kentucky regiments, such as Bruce’s and Barnes7.
Have all these things planned, and defer the execution of them till you know from the direction of Greenville and Campbellsville and Lebanon that my conjecture is right.
Nelson has succeeded in breaking up Williams7 party, and I will direct him to return as rapidly as possible towards Paris and Lexington.
I have furnished arms and saddles to the cavalry company attached to Barnes7 regiment because you will need them. Wolford’s cavalry has been supplied, but I have not kept memoranda of the issues, and can7t say if they are completely armed or not.
There is one incomplete Kentucky regiment (Harlan’s) at Lebanon; one at New Haven, with a good Indiana regiment.
The bulk of our force here is under McCook, with a brigade on the Ohio at its nearest point under Colonel Hazzard.
The railroad is so exposed that I am compelled to guard it with a strong force, and even then am hourly apprehensive of some devilish destruction.
If the movement be made in force, our effort should be to concentrate before they reach the neighborhood of Danville.
We cannot trust the telegraph, but when I telegraph to Nicholasville, u Your application by letter is granted,77 you will understand that my conjectures are correct. When I telegraph it is denied, then my inference is wrong.
We find it impossible to penetrate their designs, except I know their force is very large and they have pressed in all the wagons from several counties, for which they could have no other use than what I name. Yours,

General : General Sherman has just dispatched me that General McCook sends him word that the enemy have disappeared from Green Biver, and that there is a rumor that Buckner is moving in force towards Lexington, between us, and orders me, “if not engaged in front, to withdraw my force back to Kentucky Biver, and act according to the state of facts then.”

Brig. Gen. D. C. Buell, Commanding Department of the Ohio:
General : Upon assuming command of the department, I will be glad to have you make as soon as possible a careful report of the condition and situation of your troops and of the military and political condition of your command. The main point to which 1 desire to call your attention is the necessity of entering Eastern Tennessee as soon as it can be done with reasonable chances of success, and I hope that you will, with the least possible delay, organize a column for that purpose, sufficiently guarding at the same time the main avenues by which the rebels may invade Kentucky. Our conversations on the subject of military operations have been so full, and my confidence in your judgment is so great, that I will not dwell further upon the subject, except to urge upon you the necessity of keeping me fully informed as to the state of affairs, both military and political, and your movements. In regard to political matters, bear in mind that we are fighting only to preserve the integrity of the Union and to uphold the power of the General Government. As far as military necessity will permit, religiously respect the constitutional rights of all. Preserve the strictest discipline among the troops, and while employing the utmost energy in military movements, be careful so to treat the unarmed inhabitants as to contract, not widen, the breach existing between us and the rebels.
I mean by this that it is the desire of the Government to avoid unnecessary irritation by causeless arrests and persecution of individuals. Where there is good reason to believe that, persons are actually giving aid, comfort, or information to the enemy, it is of course necessary to arrest them, but I have always found that it is the tendency of subordinates to make vexatious arrests on mere suspicion. You will find it well to direct that no arrest shall be made except by your order or that of your generals, unless in extraordinary cases, always holding the party making the arrest responsible for the propriety of his course. It should be our constant aim to make it apparent to all that their property, their comfort, and their personal safety will be best preserved by adhering to the cause of the Union.

Dear General : This afternoon I received a message from Captain Byan (formerly of Second Begiment), who is on Elk Fork, in edge of Tennessee, through one represented to me as a trusty person, telling me that Zollicoffer left Jacksborough on Thursday night of last week, with five regiments, and went in direction of Knoxville. Before his command marched they were ordered to prepare two days7 rations, and all the wagons in the neighborhood were pressed into service by them. The messenger further stated that all the rebels about Big Creek Gap, Wilson’s Gap, Chitwood’s, Wheeler’s, and Childers’ Gaps had left after Riling them up as well as they could with timber and rocks. I advised Brigadier-General Sehoepf of above information.
Late this afternoon Captain Myers, of First East Tennessee Begiment, has returned from the vicinity of Big Creek Gap, and confirms the intelligence sent me by Captain Byan, and says further that it was understood that only one regiment and part of another remained at Cumberland Gap, and the report was they were to follow Zollicoffer. When at Jacksborough, I am informed, Zollicoffer had seven pieces of artillery and all his cavalry. I forward this evening requisition for arms and ammunition for same.
Yesterday I sent 45 pounds rifle powder, 50 pounds lead, and 20 boxes rifle caps into East Tennessee for the Union men. I borrowed the whole from Colonel Garrard. Will you have the kindness to have rifle powder forwarded to me, not only to return that borrowed, but also for further distribution among the mountain men. The ammunition sent yesterday was to be delivered to the men mentioned by my brother in his letter to you. Lead and caps are also needed.
We thank you, general, for your assurance that as soon as you can you will move towards East Tennessee. Our men and officers have entire confidence in you and shall be most happy to see you in our midst. If the reports made to me to-day are true—and they seem to be reliable— we might get possession of the mountain passes without loss or even opposition. Do you not think so ?
I am persuaded you will do what is right and proper.

Sir: I have just telegraphed you to await further orders.
I think that the enemy in your front will reduce rather than increase, and the difficulty of hauling supplies will warrant the reduction of your force at London and moving a portion back in the direction of the Kentucky Biver. The enemy across Green Biver has impressed a large number of wagons, and cannot remain idle much longer.
I am deficient in transportation and tied to a railroad which must be strongly guarded. The route of approach will most likely be from Glasgow to Columbia, Liberty, Stanford, and Danville. I have uot yet detected any signs of such an advance, and infer it from the fact I have stated and the current belief among secessionists. You may therefore arrange for a good person to watch that line and give you timely notice. Colonels Grider and Haggard are at Columbia, and are acquainted with all the country as far as Bowling Green. And in addition to the person you may rely on, I will instruct them to send you word of any signs they may observe.

General : My brother William has just arrived from East Tennessee, and the news he brings I think of so much importance, that I will dispatch a special messenger to convey it to you. My brother left Roane County, near Kingston, on Monday night last. He reports that on Friday night, 8th instant, of last week, he succeeded in having burned at least six, and perhaps eight, bridges on the railroad, viz: Union Bridge, in Sullivan County, near the Virginia line $ Lick Creek Bridge, in Greene County; Strawberry Plains, in Jefferson County, 15 miles east of Knoxville, partially destroyed; Hiawassee Bridge, 70 miles southwest of Knoxville, and on the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad; two bridges over the Chickamauga, between Cleveland and Chattanooga, and between Chattanooga and Dalton, Georgia. These bridges are certainly destroyed. The Long Island Bridge, at Bridgeport, on Tennessee River, and a bridge below Dalton, on the Western Atlantic road, are probably destroyed.
The consternation among the secessionists of East Tennessee is very great. The Union men are waiting with longing and anxiety for the appearance of Federal forces on the Cumberland Mountains, and are

all ready to rise up in defense of the Federal Government. My brother states that he has it from reliable sources that the rebels have but 15,000 men at Bowling Green, many of them badly armed and poorly organized. The other 15,000 men are distributed at two other points in Southwestern Kentucky.
The above information was obtained from Union members of Tennessee legislature who were at Bowling Green on last Monday was a a week ago.
On last Monday, as nearly as could be ascertained, Zollicoffer had in East Tennessee 8,000 men, about 1,000 of whom were unarmed, and about 1,500 on sick list, most of them badly clothed, and many poorly armed. About 6,000 of the above were at different points on Cumberland Mountains $ at Jacksborough there were some troops, but the exact number could not be accurately ascertained. There were 1,400 at Knoxville, but only 600 of them able to bear arms. There were 60 at Loudon, 60 at Carter’s Depot, and 300 at Jamestown.
The only troops that have passed through East Tennessee in last six weeks was an Alabama regiment, 800 strong, which went to Virginia ; they were without arms.
I send you a Kashville paper, brought by my brother, containing some account of the attack on Port Boyal.
I to-day moved Colonel Garrard’s regiment to the ground which was occupied by the Thirty-third Indiana, and the First and Second Regiments East Tennessee to the heights where the artillery and Thirty-eighth Ohio were encamped. I have heard nothing definite since yesterday from Cumberland Gap, but I have reason to believe that the reported loss of the Union men at Cumberland Ford was not correct. If possible, general, send me some artillery, for if I am attacked with artillery I cannot resist with any hope of success. Some cavalry are also necessary to our security.
General, if it be possible, do urge the commanding general to give us some additional force and let us advance into East Tennessee; now is the time. And such a people as are those who live in East Tennessee deserve and should be relieved and protected. You know the importance of this move, and will, I hope, use all your influence to effect it. Our men will go forward with a shout to relieve their native land.
The brigade commissary has not yet handed in his report of the amount of provisions on hand; but I think we have already nearly, if not quite, a month’s supply on hand.

We do not desire to reflect upon the discretion exercised by the Government in placing a distinguished citizen of Louisiana in command of the valley of the Mississippi, but we cannot hesitate to express the satisfaction that it would have afforded the citizens and Army of Tennessee that this command should have been given to their own distinguished fellow-citizen Major-General Pillow. His indomitable energy, his sleepless vigilance, his masterly ability, as displayed before our eyes since he took command of our army, has won for him the esteem of all, and we think fairly entitles him to lead the army which he has created. In a few weeks he has brought into the field a force of more than 20,000, armed and equipped, ready to meet the enemy. Taking command without ordnance, commissary, or quar-

We feel that no eulogium that we could make would do justice to the services that he has rendered the cause, but we simply and respectfully to suggest to the Secretary of War, and through him to the President, that the appointment of Major-General Pillow to the command of the active force on the banks of the Mississippi would be but an act of justice to him, and would give the greatest satisfaction to the force thus placed under his command.

Sir : I am presuming upon a slight acquaintance I had the honor of forming with you in this city several years since (and which it can hardly be supposed you can possibly recall in the midst of the constant labors and important events with which you have since been occupied), when I trouble you with but a word in reference to Major-General Pillow, now in command at this point. Since he assumed his command he has been by no means free from criticism. Probably no man ever is under such circumstances. It is every day’s experience that those who u never set squadron in the field,” and are utterly ignorant of all military matters, feel themselves qualified to pass judgment upon the plans of the most experienced commanders. Possessing no military education or experience myself, it would be presumptuous in me to express an opinion, except upon such matters as may fairly come within the scope of the observation and judgment of all. And here I beg leave to say that since he has been in command here he has manifested a degree of energy and activity in organizing our State forces and in collecting the materials of war that has challenged the public approbation and called forth no slight expressions of praise. Hence I believe that the wish is pretty general that, having labored so energetically in the details of organization, he may be called into such more active service of the Confederacy as may be commensurate with his position and rank.

An express arrived at Knoxville on the 1st day of July from Cumberland Gap, bringing intelligence that one Dr. Scriven, who left Knoxville some weeks ago, arrived at Bar-boursville, 33 miles from Cumberland Gap, in charge of a considerable lot of arms for the Union men of East Tennessee. Mr. Brownlow, in his paper, says civil war is inevitable, and that the Union men have 10,000 men under drill and armed with rifles and shot-guns. Mr. Thomas A. R. Nelson made a speech, I am informed by a gentleman

now here, on Monday last, at the circuit court in Carter County, in which he incited the crowd to resist the action of the State, and promised assistance to the Union men of the Lincoln Government. The New York Times, in a lengthy article, says that East Tennessee is a vital point to the Lincoln Government; urges the Union men to seize Knoxville, and hold it till Lincoln can give aid. The Louisville Courier states that large quantities of arms are passing through Kentucky for East Tennessee. My opinion is (and I canvassed East Tennessee in favor of separation and union with the Confederate States previously to the election) that there are organized now of Union men, as they call themselves, at least ten regiments, which, if in anywise assured of aid from Lincoln and Johnson, would rise and rush into rebellion. What shall then be done ?
I feel, I assure you, great delicacy in suggesting to a Government that has my fullest confidence. I can only give my opinion as one who has been raised and has lived in East Tennessee all my life.
1.	A small, inadequate force is as bad or worse than none, because while it irritates, it invites aggression.
2.	The question as to whether the presence of a force will irritate and incite to rebellion ceases to be a practical question, because the irritation grows worse without it and independent of it.
3.	The presence of six regiments properly distributed will quiet the passions of the rebellious and secure the peace in spite of Thomas A. R. Nelson, William G. Brownlow, Conly F. Trigg, and William B. Carter, who are the leaders of the Union men. Moral power can no longer be relied on to crush the rebellion. No man possesses that power. Bell had more than any other man, but he is as helpless as a child. Maj. Gen. S. R. Anderson, or some gentleman equally calm, brave, and judicious, and six or eight regiments, properly stationed, armed, and equipped, will, I think, secure the peace without any violence.
4.	I am looking every moment also to hear that the bridges have been burned and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad torn up. Nothing can save it but a sufficient guard. The Confederate States have no marshal in East, Middle, or West Tennessee to assist in keeping the peace. Ought they not to be appointed %
Pardon this piece of seeming discourtesy to you, sir, in making the foregoing suggestions; made more for the purpose of directing your attention in the midst of so many labors you find on your hands to what you and the President and Cabinet shall think best.
I would respectfully suggest, as a gentleman every way worthy and fit to be appointed marshal, if but one be appointed, General J. B. Clements, of Nashville, Tenn., for the State. He could then select such deputies in East and West Tennessee as might be necessary.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
LANDON C. HAYNES.

President Davts :
No time is to be lost in East Tennessee. I examined the case thoroughly. There are 2,000 men of various arms now there. I think at least 10,000 ought to be there and at once. Governor Brown, of Georgia, has 2,500 well armed and equipped, at Marietta, ready to move. Floyd, I hear, has 2,000. The rest might be sent from Corinth. I would strongly recommend making a department of East Tennessee and parts

President Davis:
Sir : When I had the honor of an interview with you at Bichmond last week I endeavored, together with other gentlemen from East Tennessee then accompanying me, to impress you with the absolute necessity existing in this division of our State for prompt and effective action to repress a most fearful rebellion against both the authorities of the State and the Confederate States. I returned a day or two since to Knoxville, and came thence to this place in a southern border county of East Tennessee to meet my family.
The startling state of the public mind in this county, lying as it does upon the Georgia boundary, impels me to again importune your early attention in some effective manner to this section of the South. It is fortunate that we are not now left to conjecture the purposes of the Union men in East Tennessee who are in arms, or the probable number of them in this county. On Sunday, July 7, an alarm was given that a troop of secessionists had entered the county to disarm the Union men. By some means unknown to our friends here, in twelve hours near 1,000 Union men were in arms at different rendezvous, and disclosed a most complete organization, secret hitherto in its character and numbers. The alarm proving to proceed from a mere jest, the party immediately dissolved, only to hold themselves in readiness, at like short notice, to rally again with their rifles and shot-guns and with such ammunition as they have.
I must assure you that from the Georgia line to Cumberland Gap a

like feeling to that here developed exists, and not the slightest obstacle could be interposed by the Southern men, so overwhelmed are they by numbers, to the movement of Lincoln’s troops, should they enter our territory in the direction of Georgia; neither can we unaided strike a single blow with any effect to suppress an outbreak, which may any day occur here.
If it be true, as we understand, that a large majority of the people of Eastern Kentucky are like to our East Tennessee people, then may an army move from the Ohio Eiver to the Georgia line (north) without the slightest impediment from our present defenses.
Gan you not take action to avert disaster now so threatening, not only to the true men in East Tennessee, but so demoralizing to the great movement of the South % No moral influence of any kind whatever will do it; physical power, when exhibited in force sufficient, may, and I believe will, prevent it.

General Orders, ) Headquarters Department No. 2,
No. 1.	)	Memphis, Term., July 13,1861.
Having been assigned to the charge of the defense of that part of the valley of the Mississippi which is embraced within the boundaries of Department No. 2,1 hereby assume command. All officers on duty within the limits of said department will report accordingly. In assuming this very grave responsibility, the general in command is constrained to declare his deep and long-settled conviction that the war in which we are engaged is one not warranted by reason or any necessity, political or social, of our existing condition, but that it is indefensible and of unparalleled atrocity. We have protested, and do protest, that all we desire is to be let alone, to repose in quietness under our own vine and under our own fig tree. We have sought and only seek the undisturbed enjoyment of the inherent and indefeasible right of self-government, a right which freemen can never relinquish, and which none but tyrants could ever seek to wrest from us. Those with whom we have been lately associated in the bonds of a pretended fraternal regard have wished and endeavored to deprive us of this, our great birthright as American freemen. Nor is this all. They have sought to deprive us of this inestimable right by a merciless war, which can attain no other possible end than the ruin of fortunes and the destruction of lives 5 for the subjugation of Christian freemen is out of the question. A war which has thus no motive except lust or hate, and no object except ruin and devastation, under the shallow pretense of the restoration of the Union, is surely a war against heaven, as well as a war against earth. Of all the absurdities ever enacted, of all the hypocrisies ever practiced, an attempt to restore a union of minds, hearts, and wills like that which once existed in North .America, by the ravages of fire and sword, are assuredly among the most prodigious. As sure as there is a righteous Euler of the universe, such a war must end in disaster to those by whom it was inaugurated, and by whom it is now prosecuted with the circumstances of barbarity which, it was fondly believed, would never more disgrace the annals of a civilized people.
Numbers may be against us, but the battle is not always to the strong. Justice will triumph; and an earnest of this triumph is already beheld in the mighty uprising of the whole Southern heart. Almost as one man this great section comes to the rescue, resolved to perish rather than yield to the oppressor, who, in the name of freedom, yet under the prime inspiration of an infidel horde, seeks to reduce eight millions of freemen to abject bondage and subjugation. All ages and conditions are united in one grand and holy purpose of rolling back the desolating tide of invasion, and of restoring to the people of the South that peace, independence, and right of self-government to which they are by nature and nature’s God as justly entitled as those who seek thus ruthlessly to enslave them.
The general in command, having the strongest confidence in the intelligence and firmness of purpose of those belonging to his department, enjoins upon them the maintenance of a calm, patient, persistent, and undaunted determination to resist the invasion at all hazards and to the

last extremity. It comes bringing with it a contempt for constitutional liberty and the withering influence of the infidelity of New England and Germany combined. Its success would deprive us of a future. The best men among our invaders opposed the course they are pursuing at the first, but they have been overborne or swept into the wake of the prevailing current, and now, under the promptings of their fears or the delusion of some idolatrous reverence supposed to be dup to a favorite symbol, are as active as any in instigating this unnatural, unchristian, and cruel war. Our protest, which we here solemnly repeat in the face of the civilized world, has been hitherto unheeded, and we are left alone, under God, to the resources of our own minds and our own hearts, to the resources of manhood. Upon them, knowing, as he does, those whom he addresses, as well as those with whom you are co-operating throughout the South, the general in command feels he may rely with unwavering confidence. Let every man, then, throughout tbe land arm himself in the most effective manner, and hold himself in readiness to support the combined resistance. A cause which has for its object nothing less than the security of civil liberty and the preservation of the purity of religious truth, is the cause of Heaven, and may well challenge the homage and service of the patriot and Christian. In God is our trust.

Sir : I would respectfully ask your attention to the accompanying extract from a letter written by Mr. Yerger, of Corinth, Miss., dated July 9, and communicated to the President by Mr. W. P. Harris, of Jackson, Miss., and subsequently referred to this Department. In inviting your attention immediately to the suggestions it contains, I would remark that from the apparent indications in that section, as well as from the concurrent testimony of other writers, additional troops, in my opinion, should be sent forward without delay. If the guns at Chattanooga are not being manufactured for us, they ought to be secured at once, and a reconnaissance of the points described ought to be ordered.

“Availing myself of the privilege you were kind enough to accord me, I will now venture to make some suggestions for your consideration. Being delayed in my passage through East Tennessee, I found a much more hostile and embittered feeling among that people towards the Confederate Government than I supposed to exist. I found the emissaries of the Lincoln Government active and constantly engaged in exciting hatred and animosity towards our Government. I believe the people only await the occasion to rise in revolt against the Confederate Government. Numerous instances of active organization came to my knowledge. I do not think there is an adequate Confederate force in that region to maintain us securely. At Chattanooga is a foundery engaged in casting cannon, which could easily be seized by the people and con-24 r r—VOL IV

verted to that use for themselves. I found two 6-pounders and one 12-pounder nearly complete—for where intended I did not learn. I will call your attention to three points on the line of the railroad that, if occupied by a hostile force of 3,000 men with one or two batteries of flying artillery, could easily and successfully cut off all communication between Virginia and the Southern States it seems to me. Tffe first point to which I will call your attention is at the foot of Lookout Mountain, where the railroad passes between the mountain and Tennessee Eiver. At this point an inconsiderable force, with a small battery, could successfully resist the advance of a very large force. So at the second point above Chattanooga, at a tunnel which passes through a spur of the mountain, a small battery could effectually prevent the advance of the cars with any number of troops 5 and, lastly, at a defile beyond Loudon, near the Tennessee Eiver, a small force could prevent all transports of men and munitions. These points all lie in the most disaffected region, and, in my opinion, if not occupied by Confederate forces in less than a month, will be by hostile men. I think that at least a reconnaissance should lie made of the locality. All this may have been called to your attention, or may, in point of fact, be of no value. If so, set down and excuse the error because of my zeal and desire to protect the service from injury. I feel that my thus addressing you might seem presumptuous in one so unused to military affairs; yet I assure you a most earnest desire to be of service prompts me. The conviction that more is necessary to protect us from the outbreak of the disaffected in East Tennessee than is generally supposed induces me to call your attention to these facts. I think at least 2,500 or 3,000 troops should be-properly-stationed at these points in this district of country to keep our way open. The twelve-months7 men of Mississippi now at this point could be much better employed there than here, and if it should become necessary to disarm those people of the weapons they have, could effectually and successfully accomplish it if under the command of some discreet commander. If this point is kept quiet by the presence of an imposing military force, there will be no other part of East Tennessee that will be able to give any considerable trouble.77

You can have them returned quietly, so as to avoid any unnecessary excitement about the matter.
Trusting and believing that you will at once comply with this request, I am, very respectfully, yours,
Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir: On receipt of my instructions on the subject of the transfer of the Tennessee troops I opened a correspondence with Governor Harris, asking when he would be ready to make the transfer. He informed me he must have some further correspondence with the President before he was prepared to act. Since then I have heard he will be in the city on Monday next for the purpose of consummating the transfer.
In regard to the positions of the officers of Tennessee Army now commanding, I beg leave to suggest that I think better use could be made of General Pillow as a major-general than as a brigadier, and I think the interests of the service would be greatly promoted by the appointment) of General Cheatham to the office of brigadier-general.
In regard to the staff, I beg leave to say that I have examined carefully the organization of the medical department and the manner in which it-was constituted. It is agreed on all hands as the best arranged and appointed part of their army. The selections have been made with great care by a medical board, composed of the most eminent surgeons in the State, after examination, and a large number of applicants rejected. Those who have been appointed have been taken from different parts of the State, many of them the family physicians of the men composing the regiments. I respectfully submit whether it would be practicable for the department to do better than appoint them as they stand. All the regiments are provided with a surgeon and an assistant surgeon. Besides these, the State appointed a surgeon-general and two medical directors, all of whom are eminent surgeons, and might be appointed as medical directors to accompany and provide for the different parts of the Tennessee Army. I desire particularly that Dr. Joe C. Newnan, one of these three, be appointed medical director and purveyor of my department. He is a gentleman of large experience, of maturity of years and character, and well fitted for the duties of such an office. A young man has reported himself as a surgeon of the army to me—a Dr. Potts—who is quite too young to be intrusted with such a grave responsibility.
As to the other staff appointments of that army, the quartermasters and commissaries, I have reason to believe they might be in many cases much improved. If it should be desired by the Department, I could aid it in ascertaining who might be retained with advantage and who dropped.
We need at once an officer to act as post quartermaster at this place. As it will be the place from which supplies must be distributed not only to my own command, but that of General Hardee also, it is of the first importance that the person in that office should be a business man of the highest personal and commercial character. Such a man I have taken pains to find, and now recommend to you. It is Mr. D. A. Shepherd. He is well situated in business, and seeks no office. I have

sought him. He will take the office only for the sake of the cause. If agreeable to the Department, I should be glad to have that gentleman and Dr. Kewnan appointed as early as may be.
In a department so large it is impossible for the duties of the quartermaster and commissary to be performed by the same individual. In tile Tennessee Army these duties are separated, and the service of both departments is very efficiently done.
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Eichmond, July 23, 1861.
Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : I am requested by his excellency Isham G. Harris, governor, to ask at your hands full and specific instructions for the transfer of the Provisional Army of Tennessee to the Confederate States. The Tennessee troops and those of the Confederate States are not organized alike in all respects, and, consequently, in the transfer the organization of the former may be in some respects interfered with. The governor made such appointments in the general staff for the Tennessee Army (about 22,000 strong) as were deemed necessary for a force of that magnitude. These appointments embrace an adjutant-general, quartermaster-general, surgeon-general, inspector-genferal, and commissary-general, with suitable and proper number of assistants of each. In the transfer by regiments and battalions will those appointed be displaced or not ? If displaced, the governor expresses the hope that, as an act of justice to the State and to the appointees, in supplying the force with necessary officers in this branch of the service, they be taken from Tennessee and from his appointees, if it can be done without prejudice to the service. If such shall be decided to be the general line of policy of the appointing power, it will give great satisfaction to the State.
In order to prevent confusion, and to relieve the governor from embarrassment and the officers of the general staff from uncertainty, please state the effect of the transfer and the general rule to be observed as to this branch of the service. A large quantity of stores were collected for the subsistence of the Provisional Army of Tennessee, and the same is now on hand. They have been paid for, and constitute part of the war expenditures of the State. The transfer of the army makes it necessary to determine what shall be done with these stores. If they are to be turned over with the army, it is respectfully suggested that arrangements should be made for that purpose. Be kind enough to furnish instructions on this point.
The governor desires that steps be taken to have the debt incurred by the State for war purposes settled and provided for by the Confederate States, in accordance with the league between the two powers.

## p. 373 (#381) ############################################

I submit an aggregate of this debt, with the hope that measures will be instituted for its adjustment.
The extent of the force will make it necessary to appoint several generals in addition to those already appointed. It would be gratifying to the governor if in making the same the appointing power would select Generals Caswell, Sneed, and Foster, appointed by him as generals in the Tennessee forces. He would not make the request if he thought the service would suffer by it.
I am requested to invite your attention to the policy of establishing camps of instruction in East Tennessee. The healthfulness of the climate, cheapness of forage, and proximity to the field of operations all indicate this section of Tennessee as eminently appropriate for camps of instruction; in addition to which, the presence of an armed force will furnish a sense of security to our friends, and tend to suppress unlawful combinations and conspiracies against the Government.
Kifle regiments for twelve months, each man to provide his rifle, to be taken by the Government at value, and converted into Minie rifles, are being raised in Tennessee, and it is believed that several thousand troops of this description could be raised if desired by the Confederate Government. The State is able to convert these rifles at the rate of 300 per week into Minie rifles. The State is engaged‘in the manufacture of guns, sabers, powder, and caps, and if encouraged by some expression of approbation from the Confederate Government would, it is believed, press forward with greater energy.
Trusting that you will furnish an early reply to the matters and suggestions contained herein, I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Sir : If you should determine to call for more troops, I trust that you will bear in mind the fact that some fifty companies from Kentucky have applied to me to be received into the service of the Confederate States, and at least 10,000 can be enlisted in forty to sixty days, to serve during the war.
Many companies of cavalry have tendered their services, who propose to arm themselves with shot-guns and revolvers. If you desire to receive either infantry or cavalry companies, advise me by telegraph, and your instructions will be promptly carried out.
We can always command the services of men who reside in the Confederate States, and it seems to me that it would be good policy to take the Kentuckians while we can get them.

G. Gantt, Esq., Richmond, Va. :
Sir: Your letter of July 23, written on behalf of the governor of Tennessee, has been received.
With regard to the question of the transfer of the Provisional Army of Tennessee to the Confederate States, that transfer must take place in the manner prescribed by law, and the army so transferred becomes at once in every respect subject to the organization and regulations of the Confederate Army. The simple act of transfer of the army may be effected by the mere inspection of the muster rolls, and by the transfer of the same under the proper officers. So far as possible, it would be the policy of this Department to retain such officers in commission as had been appointed under the State organization, but such officers as are not recognized under the army organization of the Confederate States must, of course, cease to exist. Such are those to which you refer—adj utant - general, quartermaster - general, surgeon - general, inspector-general, and commissary-general, with their assistants. These appointees must, therefore, necessarily be displaced by the transfer; but in making such corresponding appointments as may under the new organization be necessary, this Department will be happy to consider in each case the claims of the gentlemen previously appointed, it being the policy of the Department to consult in every case, so far as possible, the interests and the wishes of the State in question. Governor Harris has already been requested, in a letter from the President, to present his recommendations for these appointments.
In the transfer by regiments the field officers of the regiments must be already elected. In the transfer by companies or by battalions, to be afterward organized into regiments, the appointment of field officers is reserved to the President.
The army stores referred to in your letter, which have been collected and paid for by the State of Tennessee, will be included in the trasfer. They will be receipted for by the proper departments, and this Government will become responsible for their purchase and for all the expenses properly incidental.
The debt incurred by the State of Tennessee for war purposes will be assumed by the Government of the Confederate States according to the terms agreed upon, but it is not in the power of this Department at present to enter fully into arrangements for that object. The account inclosed in your letter will be referred to the proper authority, and will receive due attention.
With reference to the future appointment of brigadier-generals, Governor Harris has been already assured, in the letter from the President previously referred to, that his recommendations and the public sentiment of the people of Tennessee shall be consulted in this particular so far as the interests of the public service may permit.
The suggestion of the governor with regard to the establishment of

camps of instruction in Tennessee is approved. The location of such camps has been referred to the governor already, as will be seen by reference to the communication of June 30.
The Department is gratified to hear of the success of the efforts in Tennessee for the raising of rifle regiments. Too much energy cannot be devoted to the enlistment of troops and the procuring of arms. The Government would also gladly co-operate with any proper measures for the improvement of the arms, subject, of course, always to the direction and approval of the proper officers of this Government. The manufacture of the munitions of war, such as you refer to, within the State of Tennessee, is highly improved, and the Government would gladly encourage and promote such manufactures by every means within its power.

Sir : Yours of the 19th instant, in which you express a willingness to accept the additional Kentucky companies but for the inability of the Government to arm them, has been received. Since our glorious victories of the 18th and 21st I hope it will be in your power to arm them. The companies are still organized, and will be greatly disappointed if they cannot be received. If you find that you can arm them, please telegraph me at Clarksville, and I will, if instructed to do so, order them to our camp. I can provide everything for them except the arms. My word is out to receive the companies, or I would not again bring the matter to your attention.

Sir : I am instructed by the President to make you the following communication:
The great importance of the East Tennessee and Western Virginia road requires that it should be closely guarded wherever there is reason to apprehend its destruction. The movements of the enemy or the sending of arms into East Tennessee should be so closely watched by an adequate force as to render success impracticable. You will know so well the state of things in East Tennessee that nothing more can be said in that regard than to point to you the importance of preventing organization for resistance to the Government and of attracting by every possible means the people to support the Government, both State and Confederate. It may occur that civil process in case of treason may be resisted, in which event you will endeavor to be in position to give all needful support to the civil authorities. The President relies on you to give more accurate and exact information in relation to public affairs in East Tennessee than it has heretofore been possible to obtain, and you are invited to the fullest correspondence in all matters relating to your command.

Commonwealth of Kentucky, Executive Department,
Frankfort, August —, 1861. Hon. Jefferson Davis, Richmond, Va. :
Sir: Since the commencement of the present unhappy difficulties yet pending in the country, the people of Kentucky have indicated a steadfast desire and purpose to maintain a position of strict neutrality between the belligerent parties. They have already striven by their policy to avert from themselves the calamity of war and protect their own soil from the presence of contending armies. IJp to this period they have enjoyed comparative tranquillity and entire domestic peace.
Recently a military force has been enlisted and quartered by the United States authorities within this State. I have on this day addressed a communication and dispatched commissioners to the President of the United States, urging the removal of these troops from the soil of Kentucky, and thus exerting myself to carry out the will of the people in the maintenance of a neutral position. The people of this State desire to be free from the presence of the soldiers of either belligerent, and to that end my efforts are now directed.
Although I have no reason to presume that the Government of the Confederate States contemplate or have ever purposed any violation of the neutral attitude thus assumed by Kentucky, there seems to be some uneasiness felt among the people of some portions of the State, occasioned by the collection of bodies of troops along their southern frontier. In order to quiet this apprehension, and to secure to the people their cherished object of peace, this communication is to represent these facts, and elicit an authoritative assurance that the Government of the Confederate States will continue to respect and observe the position indicated as assumed by Kentucky.*

Hon. L. P. Walker:
Sir : It is a matter of importance, if not of absolute necessity, that the Kentucky regiments, under command of General Withers, at Camp Boone, on the Kentucky line, should be armed at the earliest moment practicable. That there will be an effort on the part of the Federal Government to arm the Union men of Tennessee 1 have no doubt. For this purpose companies and regiments of Union men are being organized in Kentucky, and every day our relations with the people of Kentucky are becoming more complicated and threatening, especially that part of Kentucky adjoining East Tennessee. I am relying upon the regiments at Camp Boone to guard a part of the line between the two States, but without arms of course they are useless. The transfer of the State army will be completed within a few days $ in view of which fact, you must allow me to say that a strong force should be kept at the gaps on the State line in East Tennessee. I fear we will have to adopt a decided and energetic policy with the people of that section. I hope, however, to visit Eichmond in a few days, and confer with you upon this and other questions of interest to the State and General Government.

Urge Secretary of War and President to receive at least one more regiment of infantry from Kentucky. They ought, if possible, to take every man that offers, for we not only get good soldiers, but we get the sympathies of their relatives and friends. If the President will receive them, we can get a company from almost every county in the State. About fifty companies have already offered their services.
Try to get a regiment of cavalry accepted. Some ten companies of cavalry have offered, and will arm themselves and furnish horses, equipments, &c.
An army of 10,000 men can be provisioned with breadstuff’s in this section. Much of it will be donated, and the balance can all be paid for in bonds. I have been assured that 50,000 to 70,000 bushels of wheat will be donated. Some 10,000 bushels have, I am advised, already been donated.

Seven steamboats loaded with troops left Saint Louis yesterday for Bird’s Point and Cairo. Fremont is concentrating a force at Cairo and Cape Girardeau. My force greatly needs strengthening. Will you not order Bussell’s and the other Mississippi regiments and any other forces at your command in the States of Alabama or Mississippi or Louisiana that are disposable to report to me without delay ? Bussell’s have not yet moved. Will you please reply to my application for a quartermaster % I have none, and Captain Stockton has been detailed as my inspector-general, and I have detailed Major He Bussy to act in his place as chief of engineers. The latter is not available, therefore, as quartermaster. I have nominated Mr. H. A. Shepherd as quartermaster, with the rank of major. Mr. S. is the best man I can procure for that office. I propose, also, to have transferred to the Confederate service the Ordnance Corps of Tennessee. As it stands it is very efficiently organized, and we want it all for supplying any order and the neighboring commands. I wish Capt. Moses H. Wright, late of the U. S.

brought to a camp under my command at Cumberland Gap, and was from there sent, under a guard of 60 men, to Abingdon, Va. These facts are to-day communicated to me by Lieutenant-Colonel Walker, of Cumberland Gap. The knowledge of the event has apparently produced much excitement among Nelson’s adherents here, giving rise to menacing language.
I have information from various sources, apparently reliable, that different bodies of men in the counties of {Southeastern Kentucky, estimated to amount in the aggregate to several thousand, are under military organization, and are threatening to force a passage through the mountains into East Tennessee. The Federalists here, I am now well advised, are awaiting such a movement. My impression is that a large number of Union men are opposed to it, but there are very many Lincoln men here wiio will be restrained from co-operating only by considerations of policy or apprehensions of the consequences. A very large amount of arms and ammunition has been placed by the Lincoln Government in Kentucky. Anderson (of Sumter memory) is by the Federalists here believed to be the leading military man. A Kentuckian named Nelson, late a lieutenant in the U. S. Navy, by some said to be Anderson’s aide, by others said to be a newly-appointed general, having his headquarters at Cincinnati, is the most prominent man in getting up the threatened invasion of East Tennessee. My information goes to show that they contemplate a movement very soon, but I am not sufficiently advised of their state of preparation. It is becoming difficult to command reliable information, on account of the apprehension felt by spies in that region.
I send you a copy of the best map I am able to have made of the topography of country about the Kentucky line. It has been gathered from the best information I could get from scouts, but think it may be imperfect. The centers of their military organizations seem to be Crab Orchard, London, Somerset, Barboursville, Albany, Columbia, and Boston. The principal gaps in the mountain are Cumberland, Big Creek, Elk, and the passes by Chitwood’s and Camp McGinnis, but the top of the mountain is comparatively flat and 30 or 40 miles broad, and there are innumerable bridle-path passes intervening between Cumberland Gap and Camp McGinnis. My purpose is to form a chain of infantry posts at Cumberland Gap, Big Creek Gap, Elk Gap, Camp McGinnis, and Livingston, for which I have 33 infantry companies, all but one regiment very raw troops. There are six cavalry companies, which I propose to use as scouts, advanced posts, and to pass intelligence rapidly along the line of infantry posts. I will have a constant patrol at Archer’s Gap, Chitwood’s, and at other advanced posts near the Kentucky line, patrolling scouts of cavalry traversing the various paths leading across the mountains, the objects being to cut off communication between Kentucky and Tennessee Federalists, seize arms, or prevent them from being brought over, &c. Should there be an approach of Kentuckians in much force, I could soon concentrate upon the line of approach. I have a regiment here, one I am disposing at different bridges on the railroad, and sixteen other companies of infantry, the latter entirely undisciplined and some of them without arms. I hope in a few days to have a battalion of cavalry for service in connection with the road. There are three field pieces of artillery at Cumberland Gap, used as a fixed battery, with no experienced artillerists. Here there is a field artillery company with six 6-pounders, which might be taken to the Kentucky border when required.
I have great reason to fear that our friends in Kentucky are power-

Dr. Kewnan, having been already assigned to General Anderson’s command, could not be properly transferred without General Anderson’s consent.

The Department is inclined to be guided by your recommendations in all cases, but it is requested that you will designate all the appointments, medical and other, which you desire in one letter, devoting that letter entirely to this one subject.

Dear Sir: I learn from Dr. Lackey that there were some conflicts between the orders issued by you and myself with regard to shipments on the Tennessee River.
I had some time since given orders to the commander at Fort Henry not to allow the shipment of cotton, cotton yarn, tobacco, wheat, sugar, coffee, rice, or any article contraband of war, north of the Tennessee line.
I have not ordered the seizure of property; have allowed owners to dispose of their property, do what they pleased with it, except to ship it north of our line 5 have not prohibited the running of boats; have only prohibited the character of shipments specified.
I am, however, not only willing, but wish to give up the entire military jurisdiction and command of the State to the military commanders of the Confederate States. Have urged the Government to appoint a commander for Middle Tennessee, and am perfectly willing to yield to you the command and control of the Tennessee River. Shall cheerfully co-operate with you in carrying out your policy if you see proper to take command of it, and notify me as to the policy adopted. You will allow me to suggest, however, that in no event should cotton, sugar, coffee, tobacco, or wheat be permitted to go north of the line. When it once passes beyond our jurisdiction, we cannot know where it goes or what use is made of it.

I return to Nashville to-night; shall be pleased to hear from you as to your policy on Tennessee River, and shall avoid any conflict of orders.
We have in Middle Tennessee some unattached cavalry and rifle companies. Captain Stockton refuses to muster them as unattached companies or to attach them to regiments and battalions which already have their full number of companies. They are a part of the Provisional Army of Tennessee, and must be mustered the one way or the other. You will please order him by telegraph to muster them, and I would prefer being left to determine myself as to whether they be mustered as companies or attached to other organizations. Send dispatch to my care.
I shall proceed rapidly with organization of reserve corps. No power to order militia to drill oftener than specified by law unless I order them out for actual service. This would involve an expense quite unnecessary, as we could not make them useful for want of arms. I hope, however, to be able very soon to give you efficient aid with the reserve corjis, which I shall arm as rapidly as it is possible to do so.
Very respectfully,
ISHAM G. HARRIS.
Ordnance Office at Memphis, August 12,1861. Major-General Polk:
Sir : If this war should unfortunately be prolonged, the valley of the Mississippi must ultimately become its great theater, for the enemy now working to subjugate the South knows the value of our great artery of commerce and of the prominent cities upon it too well for us to doubt that he will bend all his energies to control them. To prepare for such a defense as may be commensurate with the interests involved, we may have to invoke all the resources of this valley, and I feel satisfied that they are amply adequate to the emergency.
You now have in the section under your command, already finished and to be finished in the next 30 days, 75 field guns of various caliber, and I beg you will allow me to suggest and recommend that 50 batteries, of 6 guns each, be put into the field as early as possible.
To effect this, it will be best to send agents to Vicksburg, Jackson, New Orleans, Mobile, Montgomery, Huntsville, and Nashville, to make contracts for, say, 165 field pieces and howitzers. Sixty field pieces can be contracted for at this place, one battery to be finished per week. I would recommend that the batteries be composed of the following guns: Two 6 pounder field pieces; two 12-pounder rifled Parrott guns; one 12-pounder howitzer; one 24-pounder howitzer; making a total of 74 6-pounder field pieces; 7412-pounder Parrott guns, rifled; 3712-pounder howitzers; 37 24-pounder howitzers.
For the moving of this artillery we shall require 2,500 sets of artillery harness ; 225 gun carriages, and 225 caissons; 38 battery wagons,
and 38 battery forges.
The cost will be, for—
225 field pieces, at §300 each.......................................... $135,000
225 gun carriages, at $400 each......................................... 90,000
225 caissons, at $375 each ............................................. 84,375
2,500 sets of harness, at $50 per horse.................................... 125,000
37 battery wagons, at $400 each......................................... 14,800

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XIL
This estimate is based upou the number of pieces allowed per thousand men by the United States Government. Three hundred pieces would be the supply allowed for 100,000 men, two pieces per thousand men for battery purposes, and the third piece to be held in reserve, in case the pieces in battery should be disabled by any casualty. Should you fail to get the number of pieces contracted for, yet you could not fail to get a large supply of them, and the entire manufacturing enterprise of the country would be enlisted in the manufacture of cannon or of any and all kinds of ordnance, as they would have abundant machinery in readiness for turning its powers into any required channel.
The history of all wars of independence teaches us that the iires of patriotism burn more brightly at the outbreak than towards their close. Men in the outset of such a contest are more oblivious of personal discomfort, less selfish, than they become as the struggle progresses, and more willing to contribute in all ways the means of winning independence. Our Revolution of ?76 is an instance to illustrate this truth. The paper of the Government passed current at first, though rejected as worthless towards the close, yet that Government was surely better able to make good its contracts at the end of that struggle than at the beginning. May not such be the result in this contest, and does not wisdom point out the necessity of securing such war material as we can while our Government is in good credit?
For the 300 field pieces will be required the following kind and quantity of ammunition:
For 6-pounder guns.
6-pounder shot............................................................. 14,800
Spherical-case sliot.....«................................................. 11,840
Canister stand............................................................. 2,960

Costing, say, $100,000; making a total cost for the 225 field pieces and ammunition for one campaign, say, $640,000.
I would also respectfully recommend that contracts be made for 25,000 sword bayonets for Mississippi rifles and 10,000 for double-barreled shotguns. These bayonets complete will cost about $9 each, making a total cost of $315,000 for the 35,000. Bayonet and gun barrels for rifles ready forged out for rifling can be procured in any quantity at $3 each from Hillman Bro., on Tennessee River. The dies tor locks and nipples are being made here and can be turned out in large quantities. A foundery and shop in this city can turn out gun stocks at the rate of 100 to 200 per day, and we can thus have a weapon equal in all respects to the Mississippi rifle, while it will not be so heavy.

The spirit animating the United States Congress and people, and the great preparations made for a war upon a grand theater, induce me to urge upon you the importance of a timely and efficient preparation on our part, and the plan for equipping ourselves I have now the honor to submit to your superior judgment.

General Polk has been ordered to send to Russellville, Tenn., the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Regiments of Mississippi Volunteers and to advise you of their departure. Col. W. B. Wood’s regiment Alabama volunteers, at Tuscumbia, has been ordered to the same place, with orders to telegraph you. Change at your discretion the point of rendezvous if Russellville is considered unadvisable.

Will you have a bill passed authorizing generals in command, at their discretion, to appoint drill-masters, with the rank and pay of first lieutenants? The service is absolutely suffering for the want of such a law.. Wre have a number of young men wfith military education we can employ in that way if we had the law.

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, C. S. A., Memphis, Tenn.:
Sir : In answer to your dispatch of 12th instant, the State has three artillery companies, armed and equipped, which can be placed in service at short notice, also sis cavalry companies, fully armed and equipped. Eight regiments of infantry are being formed (but few arms), and will [be sent] into camps for instruction shortly. The chief of ordnance, Lieutenant-Colonel French, informs me that he can arm from 2,000 to 3,000 men with good arms. In addition to the above-named troops, there are nineteen companies now tendered for the war under the requisition of President Davis and proclamation of Governor Pettus (proclamation herewith inclosed). These last-mentioned companies are not armed. Efforts have been made to collect arms in the different counties, but with what success I am unable to say, as no reports have been made to. the ordnance department.
I have delayed this letter for several hours expecting Governor Pettus’ return. He will doubtless communicate all information in his posses? sion immediately on his return.
I have the honor to be, with respect, your obedient servant,

PROCLAMATION.
Whereas the President of the Confederate States of America has made a requisition on the State of Mississsippi for two regiments of volunteers, to serve for and during the continuance of the war, to be sent to Corinth, Miss., for the protection of the Mississippi Valley; and 3,000 volunteers to serve for and during the continuance of the war, to be received by independent companies; each company to be composed of 1 captain, 1 first lieutenant, 2 second lieutenants, 4 sergeants, 4 corporals, 2 musicians, and from 64 to 100 privates, to go immediately into camp of instruction, under the control of the War Department of the Confederate States. The President will assign competent officers to take charge of them, drill and discipline the men, and organize them into battalions or regiments, as he may prefer, and appoint field and staff officers: (Any company heretofore mustered into the State service for twelve months may volunteer under this call for and during the continuance of the war. It will not be a prerequisite in accepting these companies that they should be armed.)
Therefore I, John J. Pettus, governor of the State of Mississippi, by virtue of authority vested in me by law, do hereby proclaim that volunteers for the service are desired and will be accepted as above specified.
Given under my hand and the great seal of the State affixed at the city of Jackson this 9th day of July, A. D. 1861.

Eespectfully,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.
Executive Department,
Nashville, August 16, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, War Department, Richmond:
Sir: I am satisfied from the movements of the Union men of East Tennessee that more troops should be stationed in that division of the State. If you would establish camps of instruction at different points in East Tennessee, and order to them such troops as you may have in camps in States south of us to the extent of 5,000 or 7,000 men, the presence of such a force would give perfect security to our railroads and prevent the organization of a rebel army, while the presence of the force we have there at present has the effect of irritating without being sufficient to awe or subdue.
Twelve or fourteen thousand men in East Tennessee would crush out rebellion there without firing a gun, while a smaller force may involve us in scenes of blood that will take long years to heal. We can temporize with the rebellious spirit of that people no longer. If you can order a sufficient number of troops from States south of us to that point, the adoption of a decided and energetic policy (which I am resolved upon so soon as I have a sufficient force to sustain it), the arrest and indictment for treason of the ringleaders, will give perfect peace and quiet to that division of our State in the course of two months. If I had the arms I could raise troops enough within one or two weeks to answer all purposes there, but having armed the provisional force and transferred it to the Confederate States, I have no arms to put into the hands of the regiments here seeking service and anxious to get into the field. Having sent from Middle Tennessee three regiments to East Tennessee and five to Western Virginia, and General Polk and General Pillow having moved some 6,000 men from West Tennessee to Missouri, it leaves us very much exposed upon the Kentucky border— too much so if our Kentucky friends should attempt any hostile move* ment; but if you can arm the brigade at Camp Boone, under General Withers, I can take care of Middle Tennessee with the troops now here; but until matters assume a more peaceful attitude in Kentucky, I do not think it prudent or safe to send troops from here. If the suggestion with regard to East Tennessee is to be acted upon at all, it should be done at once, as every moment’s delay but increases the danger of an outbreak there.
Very respectfully,
ISHAM G. HARRIS.
War Department, C. S. A.,
Richmond, August 20, 1861.
His Excellency Isham G. Harris, Governor of Tennessee:
Sir : Your letter of August 16 has just been received by the hands of Major Bradford. The importance of the present attitude of East Tennessee is not unknown to this Department, and the necessity of

providing promptly the means of supporting our friends in that section is by no means disregarded. Three regiments have been accordingly already ordered into East Tennessee, two from Mississippi, and one from Alabama, and it is hoped that these troops, with those already within your State, may suffice for the accomplishment of the objects at present necessary.
The Department fully concurs in your view of the necessity of adopting a decided policy to insure the public safety, and only regrets that it is not in the power of the Government to the extent that may be necessary. No precautions, however, within the power of this Department shall be spared. Full confidence is entertained in the zeal and vigilance of your excellency and of the military authorities in command.
The letter of your excellency of August 7, with regard to the proposal of Col. Acker Turner, of Kentucky, was referred to the President for consideration, and hence the delay in replying. I have this day telegraphed to you to the effect that a regiment, armed and equipped, and organized by the election of its own field officers, would be at once accepted and mustered into service. The election of its own officers is necessary to the organization of the regiment before it can be received, and this is the rule always observed by this Department when troops are offered by regiments.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.
Camp Redan, Tuesday, August 20,1861.
Col. Lewis G. De Russy,
Chief Engineer Department Wo. 2:
Colonel : I am now able to say that we are ready for the enemy; at least we can prevent his occupying the peninsula of Island No. 10 bend.
Last night, after a hard day’s labor, I had prepared my parapet sufficiently to place the two 24-pounder siege guns in position, and early this morning the Falls City arrived and we had them up. By this evening I shall have two 82-pounders in position and two more to-morrow.
We have the three companies of artillery under Major Stewart, and four companies of infantry under Major Hamilton, the latter lately a part of Colonel Carroll’s regiment.
The reasons for the change in Colonel Neely’s position I will be able to satisfactorily explain. Colonel McGowan’s brigade did not move up, but Colonel McGowan accompanied me to the points I had selected for the defenses of this part of the river. He agreed fully with me, and said that he would not alter the sites one foot I had selected or my plans for the defenses of the river.
If I am permitted to continue the works according to my plans, which will be submitted for approval in a few days, I feel satisfied we can defend the valley of the Mississippi against any number of invaders above us.
We have now command of the only landing for vessels for 10 miles above this, and of the channel of the river passing by us as far as our present armament can control. We shall be ready for as many more guns as you can send up.
If you can order the Falls City to bring up the two 8-inch howitzers now at Randolph, with shell and ammunition, as well as some guns upon

barbette carriages, I think we can be strong enough at the present post against any number of gunboats until we can put up the batteries on end of Island No. 10 and opposite main-land.
By the bye, colonel, I had named this post the Redan, as the form of the fort is a redan. I had also given to the main battery site, 1 mile below this, on the main-land, the name of Fort Leonidas, in compliment to our major-general commanding. And to the battery upon the end of the island (to be about the same size as the redan), Fort Wo. 10.
These three names suggested themselves to me as peculiarly appropriate and strong, and I beg to suggest them to you for approval by the commanding general.
Colonel, I have a great deal to report to you, but every moment of my time has been occupied in arranging, moving, meeting impediments (that ought not to have been in the way), and in preparing to defend this superb section of country, agreeably to your wishes and those of General Polk. Both of you will, I think, not be disappointed. Tonight I shall sleep, but I have not done so one night since we parted.
I)o send me the Mohawk and my theodolite, which I want for a short while. I will return it to you, colonel.
In a day or two I will have time to give you a detailed account of my movements since I saw you.
At New Madrid a young gentleman came to me to know if he should go down the river to you—Mr. W. D. Storke. I was in want of immediate assistance from just such an officer, and the great necessity of the case caused me to request him to aid me for a few days. He lias been of service to me, and I will send him down in a few days, unless you can let me have him until I finish the works of Island No. 10 bend.
Colonel, can you have barbette carriages sent up to us ? The guns at Memphis are of no use there, and before you will be ready for them at the Fort Pillow works others can be made.
We can at least keep the enemy at bay, and I believe can destroy him at this point, the threshold of General Polk’s department, should he attempt a passage by us. I shall have the country thoroughly examined between this and Union City as to feasibility of a short, good road, as well as defensible jiurposes.
Colonel, please advise no other orders be issued to any other commanding officer for this point for the present. Major Stewart and I will get along well together. If you can send up the light battery from New Orleans I will have a good camp ground for them and fine position if we are attacked. Also send us a mounted company.
I beg you will pardon this hasty communication, but I have no place to write, and my time every moment employed on the works. Major Stewart has made requisition for ammunition.
Colonel, please push our guns and powder and shot along, and let me have the Mohawk for my service here for a little while. The Grauqms is on sentinel duty.
I am, very respectfully, yours,
A. B. GBAY,
Captain, C. 8. Army.
Nashville, August 21,1861.
Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Confederate States:
Sir: I have the honor to inform you I have conferred with Governor Harris and the military board of this State in relation to the transfer of military stores from the State of Tennessee to the Confederate States.

## p. 392 (#400) ############################################

﻿892	OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XU.
These authorities desire a full and complete transfer of all the military stores of the State and everything relating thereto, including powder mills and percussion-cap manufactory, now in operation, and all the contracts in the ordnance, quartermaster, and commissary departments in existence, but not filled at the date the transfer is perfected. A wish was expressed by the board that they should receive some assurance from the Department that the State of Tennessee would be refunded within a reasonable time for the stores and supplies now in their possession.
The ordnance stores are at Nashville and Memphis, and probably a few at Knoxville. The quartermaster and commissary supplies are stored at various points through the State, but much the larger portion is concentrated at the same depots—Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville. The State authorities are now engaged in having inventories made of these stores and supplies, also schedules of the contracts now existing for stores and supplies, with a statement of other property, an early completion of which I have urged upon the board. These inventories shall be promptly submitted to the Department as soon as they are prepared. Should the Secretary of War decide to shoulder these contracts, the acting quartermaster and commissary at this point could attend to the contracts in his department, and see them properly filled. The contracts for ordnance stores, however, are numerous and varied, and they would require an ordnance officer to receive and inspect the same.
When the inventories of the State military stores are prepared, I will proceed to examine and receipt for them at cost, unless otherwise advised by the Department. I desire to be instructed whether I shall receipt for stores and supplies already issued by the State of Tennessee to the troops of the Confederate States now in the field. The question of transfer is in the present instance a complicated one, owing to the scattered condition of the supplies and the various contracts for both stores and supplies not yet filled.
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Richmond, August 24, 1861.
Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk,
Commanding Second Military Department:
General: The law gives to this Department no latitude as to the subject-matter of your letter of the 5th of August. The President is only authorized to ask for and accept the services of volunteers who may offer their services either as cavalry, mounted riflemen, artillery, or infantry. Neither a volunteer corps of engineers nor an ordnance corps of volunteers can be accepted. I have already suggested to you the idea of employing such officers of these corps as you may select in the character of special agents. Your staff appointments should be recommended to this Department, which under the law is alone intrusted with the power of making such appointments. It is hoped these embarrassments to your movements may be happily surmounted, and 1 only regret the inability of this Department under the restrictions of the law to meet your wishes in full.

General Orders, )	Brigade Headquarters,
No. 11.	)	Knoxville, Tenn., August 26, 1861.
Sir : I have ordered you to move with your command, and encamp at Pish Springs, near the Johnson County line, because of the great disaffection, as reported to me, among the inhabitants of that county, and of Carter, adjoining, and in order that any efforts at rebellion against the authorities of the State or Confederacy may be quelled at once. I have information from various sources that a number of loyal citizens from those counties, apprehending danger at the hands of the Federalists among them, wTho seem to be largely in the ascendency, have fled for safety to Virginia and North Carolina. I also learned today that two men were killed and others wounded recently by these Lincolnites. You will try and ascertain the facts in the case and report to me. You will report to headquarters as often as convenient, or as circumstances may require, the condition of affairs in those counties.
I desire you as much as possible to be conciliatory towards these people, adhering strictly to the policy indicated in my proclamation and in General Orders, No. 3. You will enjoin upon your men a scrupulous observance of the rights of j>ersons and of property, and all peaceable and law-abiding citizens. You will disarm and disperse all bodies of men in open hostility to the authorities of the State and of the Confederate States; capture and hold their leaders, and if resistance is offered, and it becomes necessary, destroy them. The following are the names of some of the Lincoln leaders in Johnson County, viz: Lewis Venable, of Laurel Creek ; Nortliington, hotel-keeper at Taylorsville; R. R. Butler, Taylorsville, representative of the county; John G. Johnson and J. W. Merick, captains of Lincoln companies. Joseph P. Edoms, of Elizabethton, Carter County, and A. Evans, of Washington County, are also among the ringleaders of them. If you obtain satisfactory evidence that these or otherleaders are in open hostility to the authorities of the State or the Confederacy, or stirring up rebellion against the same, you will arrest and detain them in custody. I will forward to your aid, for scouting purposes, a cavalry company so soon as I can arm them, if you think their services are required.

horse, to be composed of Southern men to the exclusion of late Unionists, thus keeping* alive the distinction which all sensible and good men are trying to obliterate. I wrote hastily to you whilst the cars were standing, hoping that you would pardon a scrawl which I would not like to send to the Secretary direct, and as the party designed to telegraph to the Department I used the same vehicle also.
When the President changed my destination from Manassas to Knoxville he expressed himself as anxious to have some regiments drawn from East Tennessee, especially from the ranks of the Unionists, whose threatened outbreak I was specially charged to aid in preventing by use of supposed personal influence. I asked you whether cavalry (or rather mounted rifle) regiments would be accepted. You answered yes, but added that your answer was unofficial, and that such authority must come from the Secretary direct. I had already been delayed in Eichmond till I was asked why I tarried, and thus left without any written instructions, which I expected to receive here. Having spent four days in the camps near Manassas for instruction, I hastened to this point as ordered, and arrived on Saturday last, but found no orders or instructions. In Eichmond I was given to understand that if I could raise one or more regiments here in East Tennessee I would be placed in command according to the number raised, and as I have been placed on that duty unsolicited, I shall expect to be sustained by the Department in the effort, if deemed worthy. In this view I claim that it is my due, the State having closed its recruiting, to have this district of East Tennessee considered as the field assigned to me. But as some will offer as horsemen and some as foot, and I cannot well command both, I willingly relinquish all claim to any consideration on account of the infantry that may be raised and confine myself to mounted men, whom Generals Johnston and Beauregard informed me they much need. I beg you to bring this matter before the Secretary, and let me be specifically authorized to raise as many mounted men as may be wanted. I have with others labored hard and with some success to allay the spirit of disaffection in this region and to produce a calm, vThich some deprecate, that will probably be succeeded by an active enlistment on our side. I stopped at Jonesborough one day to confer with Col. T. A. E. Kelson, and through him to learn what the Unionists design, and the result of a long interview has strongly impressed me with the belief that he will not only abstain from doing anything hostile to the Confederacy, but that in due time (i. e., as soon as his standing with his party will permit) he will coine out openly for the Southern cause, and he has given me aid already in getting up volunteers. At my instance Union leaders now here from different counties are tonight engaged in preparing an address, adopting Kelson’s card (a copy of which I sent to the Adjutant-General yesterday), and advising their friends in Kentucky and elsewhere to return to their homes and submit to “the powers that be.” I purpose publishing a handbill, containing a short appeal to my friends and relatives, with Kelson’s card 5 this indorsement of it by his friends and General Zollicoffer’s general order holding out the olive branch. This may lead to such mutual confidence that both sides may deem their rifles useless here, and agree to carry them together under my lead against a common foe.
Please to ask the Secretary to telegraph me how many mounted men I may raise.
Very respectfully and truly, yours,
A. M. LEA, Brigade Commissary.

DAVID M. CUBRIK
[Inclosures.]
Memphis, August 20, 1861.
Hon. D. M. Currin:
Dear Sir: I trust you will not consider it out of place if I make you a few suggestions.
The brigades and divisions under McCulloch and Price, Hardee, Pillow, Jeff. Thompson, and others seem to be concentrating towards Saint Louis. In the mean time Fr6mont is using extraordinary exertions and concentrating all the forces at his disposal upon the defense of Saint Louis. As proof of this, Bird’s Point, opposite Cairo, has been evacuated, and but 2,000 troops are at Cairo. To an outsider Saint Louis is the stake that is to be played for.
Whether Missouri is to fall into the hands of the Abolitionists or with the South is the question. That being the case, it has occurred to me, as the preachers would say, that now is the accepted time. If Missouri is to be helped, now is the time. A day or an hour may turn the scale. The troops that are there are badly armed and equipped, and sadly in want of the conveniences necessary to an army. The most of them are green and have had little or no training. This applies particularly to the Missourians and Arkansians that are hourly flocking to our standard.
I pretend not to know anything of the contemplated movements of the President eastward. As I came from Richmond a few days since I met on the entire road from Richmond to Memphis a vast number of soldiers. I learn that companies from Mississippi, Louisiana, and elsewhere arriving here are sent on eastward. It occurs to me that the true policy would be, in view of the great stake we are playing for in Missouri, to turn all the forces now organized in Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and elsewhere upon Missouri, so that we could throw an overpowering force upon Missouri and crush out abolitionism in Missouri, and thereby break up their contemplated movement on the South in the fall. Would it not be well to see President Davis and mention these matters to him^ Whatever is done should be done instantly.
Since writing this Colonel Carroll has come in, just from East Tennessee ; says he can raise any amount of troops in East Tennessee if they could be provisioned whilst being organized. Would it not be well for the President to give him the command of a brigade if he can raise them, as he says he can, in thirty days'?
I throw out these suggestions for your reflection. I learn that the volunteers in Arkansas are looking with intense interest to the arrival of A. Sidney Johnston, with the hope that he will have command of all the troops in Missouri. They say they want a man of experience.

Memphis, August 23, 1861.
Hon. H. M. Ourrin, Richmond, Va.:
Dear Sir: Our army matters here are in a terrible condition. Go to President Davis and Secretary Walker, and insist upon their sending a practical military leader here to take charge of our army in the field or put Hardee on this line of defenses. Polk and Pillow are at logger-heads—Polk giving a command and Pillow countermanding it by the same messenger. Something must be done, and that quickly. Pillow, I learn, is acting on his own hook; will not give up his position as a senior general; denies Polk’s authority to give him orders. Pillow has ordered his forces (only 6,000 to 7,000 men) into the interior of Missouri, against the advice of Cheatham, Stephens, and other prudent and qualified men, and will most assuredly be cut off. He says he intends to fight his own fight first before he joins commands with Hardee or any one else. This state of things will produce mutiny and revolt, and our people, whose sons, brothers, and husbands are in the army, will rise up in revolution at such conduct.
Your friend,
SAM. TATE.
We hope to hear that A. S. Johnston has been assigned to this command. General Polk is a sensible gentleman, and will do well if he had proper co-operation.

Sir : I have received your letter,# informing me that u since the commencement of the unhappy difficulties yet pending in the country the people of Kentucky have indicated a steadfast desire and purpose to maintain a position of strict neutrality between the belligerent parties.” In the same communication you express your desire to elicit u an authoritative assurance that the Government of the Confederate States will continue to respect and observe the neutral position of Kentucky.” In reply to this request, I lose no time in assuring you that the Government of the Confederate States of America neither intends nor desires to disturb the neutrality of Kentucky. The assemblage of troops in Tennessee to which you refer had no other object than to repel the lawless invasion of that State by the forces of the United States, should their Government attempt to approach it through Kentucky without respect for its position of neutrality. That such apprehensions were not groundless has been proved by the course of that Government in Maryland and Missouri, and more recently in Kentucky itself, in which, as you inform me, “ a military force has been enlisted and quartered by the United States authorities.”

The Government of the Confederate States has not only respected most scrupulously the neutrality of Kentucky, but has continued to maintain the friendly relations of trade and intercourse which it has suspended with the people of the United States generally.
In view of the history of the past, it can scarcely be necessary to assure your excellency that the Government of the Confederate States will continue to respect the neutrality of Kentucky so long as her people will maintain it themselves.
But neutrality, to be entitled to respect, must be strictly maintained between both parties,* or, if the door be opened on the one side for aggression of one of the belligerent parties upon the other, it ought not to be shut to the assailed when they seek to enter it for purposes of self-defense.
I do not, however, for a moment believe that your gallant State will suffer its soil to be used for the purpose of giving an advantage to those who violate its neutrality and disregard its rights over those who respect them both.
In conclusion, I tender to your excellency the assurance of my high consideration and regard, and am, sir, very respectfully, yours, &c.,

To avoid inconvenience to the loyal citizens of the South who may wish to pass through these points into the United States on any account, it is further provided, that all such persons who may not have the means of being identified at Union City or Clarksville may get passports from the military authorities where they live, from the governors of their respective States, from the governor of Tennessee, or from the headquarters of this department.

The Secretary of War decides, in reference to Brigadier Generals Foster and Caswell, that their functions cease with the transfer, as do also the connection between the Confederate troops and the medical board, ordnance board, &c., of the State. All expenses incidental to operations of the troops will be at the charge of the Confederate States from date of transfer. Blanks, &c., will be sent to you.

You will seize the ieaders who commit overt acts of a hostile character, as much as possible endeavoring to pursue a conciliatory course towards their misguided followers. The indications are that a crisis is upon Kentucky5 that in a few days the armed Lincoln companies will be in great force there. Be strict in keeping your men in camp, so as to prevent the soldiers from committing trespasses or otherwise alienating the feelings of well-disposed citizens. You may pursue any route you choose to Fish Springs, or, if your information should seem to make it proper, you may, instead of going to that point, go to any point in Johnson County, and move from point to point, or remain stationary, at your discretion. It may be important to keep me daily advised of your movements, that I may know at any moment where a communication will reach you.

In answer to your letter to the President of this date,* I am instructed to inform you that General Polk will be instructed to communicate with you, and will not fail to appreciate the importance of such co-operation as circumstances will permit. Action by the State of Kentucky would relieve this question of all embarrassment.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
Should the movements contemplated by you as likely to occur in Kentucky actually take place, the most important results may be anticipated therefrom, and in that connection the force of General Zollicoffer can probably render you more effectual aid than that of General Polk. In that contingency the cause of Kentucky will be in every aspect that of the Confederate States, and the officer to whom you refer will be as readily ordered to operations there as elsewhere, within the limits where the Confederate forces fight battles in the cause of constitutional liberty. In anticipation of such events, and because of the confidence reposed in you, the President directs me to give you letters to General Zollicoffer, Governor Harris, and General Polk, which will secure to you their confidence in any conference you may have with them.
Copies of the various laws affecting the condition of Kentuckians wrho may co-operate with us in the existing war will be sent to the disbursing and supplying staff officers in Tennessee, which will best answer your wish in that regard. Ko one can regret more than the President his inability to furnish arms to the Kentucky volunteers. He thought he had provided against it, but his arrangements have been disturbed, and he has not since been able to supply the deficiency created. You refer to the arms now in the hands of Major Gorgas; they are 700 in number, and there are two regiments encamped here without arms and waiting for service. Under such circumstances you cannot expect that arms will be sent from their presence and in proximity to the great military force of our enemy, to be issued to troops elsewhere.

General S. B.

You will not fail to appreciate the common interest whLh binds Kentucky to the South and the Southern States to Kentucky. It is, therefore, only needful to present to you General Buckner as one entitled to your confidence, and to ask that you will converse with him so freely, that he may anticipate the assistance which Kentucky may expect in the hour of her need from the forces and other means of the Confederate States.
Concerning all movements in this regard you are requested to communicate promptly and freely, both as to events and your views of wffiat may be necessary and proper.

Secretary of War of the Confederate States :
Sir : I had the honor on the 3d instant of telegraphing you, to wit:
Shall I assume for the Confederate Government the Tennessee contracts for ordnance, quartermaster, and commissary stores or supplies now pending ? The contracts are desirable. Orders or officers will he needed at once to issue to Confederate troops now in the field and making requisitions daily.
The demand is urgent for orders to issue these stores and supplies, and will be appreciated by the Department when I state that a large force of the Confederate troops in this State are now drawing their rations from said supplies and are dependent upon them.
I herewith transmit to the Department a copy of the views of the Military and Financial Board of the State of Tennessee, submitted at my request in writing. The board agree that the transfer shall be made with the distinct understanding that I do not, as agent for the Government of the Confederate States, pledge the Government to make payments for the property transferred at any specified time, though the authorities of Tennessee may expect to be remunerated within a reasonable limit. With this clear understanding the transfer wdl be made at as early date as the inventories can be completed and the supplies inspected and counted.

It is proposed that the quartermaster supplies, consisting of clothing, shoes, &c., for soldiers, shall be applied to the use of the Tennessee volunteers in the Confederate service as far as necessary.

L. P. WALKER.
Military and Financial Board,
Nashville, Tenn., September 6, 1861.
Hon. L. P. Walker,
Secretary of War, Richmond, Va. :
Sir : The State of Tennessee has expended in equipping for the field the Provisional Army, in paying the troops, in purchase of quartermasters, commissary, and ordnance stores the sum of $4,000,000, and there are still demands upon our treasury to pay the troops and for balances for purchase of supplies a little over $1,000,000. This money must be paid to sustain the credit of the State. We had expected to be reimbursed from the Confederate Treasury under the treaty made by the Confederate commissioners with the governor, and relied upon that fund to pay the balance of the debt thus contracted, but learn from our Delegate to the Confederate Congress that we cannot look to that source.
We have borrowed the sums already expended from the banks of the State, but they now refuse to extend the loan to the $1,000,000 now required, unless we will give them assurance that we will within a short time take up the Tennessee bonds by depositing Confederate States bonds, convertible in six months into Confederate Treasury notes, at the option of the holder. It is of vital importance to us to be able to maintain the credit of the State, and we would most respectfully urge upon the Government the absolute necessity of enabling us to give this pledge, that we may be able to keep that credit unimpaired. The money thus to be raised will be paid out in the discharge of debts contracted in preparing for the common defense.
We cannot too strongly represent this policy of enabling us to pay our debts, but without this guarantee from the Government we will not be able to do so.

Dear Sir: We, the undersigned citizens of Sneedville, &c., would respectfully represent to you that we are threatened with immediate invasion from the Union party of Hancock and Hawkins and perhaps other counties in East Tennessee, in connection with Union and Northern men from some of the mountain counties of Kentucky. We have the proof showing these facts from men who have heretofore belonged to and acted with the Union party of our own county. One gentleman,% the sheriff of our county, revealed the following facts to a citizen of our town this morning, viz, that in a few days there would be a strong force from Kentucky, escorted here through the mountains by a force of Union men* from this county and Hawkins, who have lately gone * from here to Kentucky. There have been crowds within the past ten days from this county and Hawkins, numbering, from the best information, 500 men, who, we understand, are determined to bring back with them from Kentucky a sufficient force to overrun {Southern men in Hancock and in this portion of East Tennessee generally, and from thence to the railroad, with a view to tear it up, so as to stop any transportation upon the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. We have abundant proof, clear to our minds, that there exists a great necessity for having force stationed here. There is no. appearance of Union hostilities having abated. We do not feel that the lives of ourselves and our families are by any means safe. A regiment can be supported here as cheap to the Southern Confederacy as at any other point in East Tennessee. We would desire at least one company of well-armed cavalry, for the purpose of meeting outstanding emergencies. We have, therefore, sent as messenger F. IT. Brewer, to confer with you upon this subject, and for proof of his character for truth we wrould with great pleasure refer you to Captain Thomas, Captain Legg, and their com-

If you have two newly-organized regiments armed and equipped, which you could send to Pensacola to relieve the two who have been serving there, so that they might come to Virginia, it would be but an act of justice to the men who first volunteered and have been disappointed by not getting into the field. Any troops which you are pre-

Nashville, Tenn., September 16, 1861. Col. Lloyd Tilghman, Commanding Kentucky Brigade:
Sir: You will make the following dispositions for the movement directed by General Johnston: You will replace the telegraph operator at the State line and guard the present operator securely during the day. You will have a small force so disposed as to prevent the escape of the evening train from Louisville. The transportation train will be at Camp Boone, under your order, at 4 p. m.; you will be in readiness with your command at the State line by the time of arrival of the Louisville train ; you will direct the connection of the two tracks, beginning
the work only in time to complete it by dusk. Major -------’s battalion,
with the artillery, will be disposed in the advance. The companies and battalions will be disposed in regular order. The troops will be provided with two days’ provisions in haversacks and a week’s supply in addition.

Nashville, September 16,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War C. S. A.:
Sir : I have the honor to inclose a rough copy of the deed of transfer by the State of Tennessee to the Confederate Government of the ordnance, quartermaster’s, and commissary stores and supplies, which I submit now, as it nmy be weeks before full reports from State quartermasters are received and the transfer rendered complete. I had huped before this to have reported the entire transfer as perfected and the said stores and supplies received and receipted for, but the quartermaster’s department of Tennessee has been dilatory. I have received only one report from their department, which I herewith inclose. I am waiting now for their other reports, having requested them to dispatch special orders to their different posts, and thus to procure speedy returns. Should they not be received within a reasonable time, I presume it will be necessary for me to look up their quartermasters personally. I have transferred the stores and supplies of this depot to Capt. John T. Shaaff, of the subsistence department, and inclose his receipts of the transfer. The ordnance stores I will transfer to Captain Wright, lately

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
KENSEY JOHNTS, Assistant Quartermaster.
[Inclosure.]
The State of Tennessee, acting through the governor and military and financial board, conveys, sells, and assigns to the Confederate States of America its stores and supplies in the commissary, quartermaster’s, and ordnance departments, which are specified in the schedules hereto annexed, marked “Exhibits to contract between the State of Tennessee and the Confederate States of America.”
This transfer and sale embraces the stores and supplies above enumerated, which were in possession or which have been acquired since the 1st of September, 1861, and all supplies which may be received before the inventories are completed, and all issues made by the different State departments since the 1st September, 1861, or may be issued before the Government of the Confederate States shall have acquired its staff in the State of Tennessee, and shall be paid for as hereafter stipulated.
It is expected that the stores and supplies in the quartermaster’s department, so far as the same may be necessary, shall be issued to and for the benefit of the troops of the Provisional Army of Tennessee mustered or to be mustered into the service of the Confederate States. For all which stores and supplies, and for all ordnance and ordnance stores in possession of the said department or acquired since that day, and for all to be delivered before the act shall be complete, the Confederate States will pay to the State of Tennessee the actual cost when such cost can be ascertained, or its market value where it cannot be ascertained. The State of Tennessee also assigns to the said Government all its contracts for arms, munitions, ordnance, and ordnance stores, for the quartermaster’s and commissary supplies, the same specified in an abstract thereof, marked “ Contracts with Tennessee,” and delivers the originals of written contracts to said Government, which agrees to assume the position of the State of Tennessee under said contracts, to perform and discharge all its obligations under and growing out of said contracts, and fully to indemnify the said State against loss or damage growing out of the same, and the State gives to the Confederate Government the right to use its name in compelling performance of said contracts, and agrees to do all things to secure a proper compliance by contractors. The value of said supplies to be paid promptly, and the amounts to be taken into the account in a final settlement of expenses incurred by the State as contemplated in the league between the State and the Confederate States.

In reply, I beg leave to state, and I do so with much regret, that it is utterly impossible for me to comply with your request. There are no arms belonging to the State at my disposal; all have been exhausted in arming the volunteers of the State now in the Confederate service in Virginia, at Pensacola, and on our own coast, in all, some twenty-three regiments. Georgia has now to look to the shot-guns and rifles in the hands of her people for coast defense and to guns which Jher gunsmiths are slowly manufacturing. I deeply regret this state of things, for to respond to your call with the arms you need would afford me the greatest gratification.

Bowling Green, Ky., September 18,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
I occupied Bowling Green at 10 this morning with 4,500 men. I have sent forward an advance of 500 men to occupy Munfordville. I have issued the following proclamation:
To the People of Kentucky:
The legislature of Kentucky have been faithless to the will of the people. They have endeavored to make your gallant State a fortress, in which, under the guise of neutrality, the armed forces of the United States might securely prepare to subjugate alike the people of Kentucky and the Southern States. It was not until after months of covert and open violation of your neutrality, with large encampments of Federal troops on your territory, a recent official declaration of the President of the United States not to regard your neutral position, coupled with a well-prepared scheme to seize an additional point in your territory which was of vital importance to the safety and defense of Tennessee, that the troops of the Confederacy, on the invitation of the people of Kentucky, occupied a defensive post in your State. In doing so the commander announced his purpose to evacuate your territory simultaneously with a similar movement on the part of the Federal forces whenever the legislature of Kentucky shall undertake to enforce against both belligerents the strict neutrality which they have so often declared. I return amongst you, citizens of Kentucky, at the head of a force the advance of which is composed entirely of Kentuckians. We do not come to molest any citizen, whatever may be his political opinions. Unlike the agents of the Northern despotism, who seek to reduce us to the condition of dependent vassals, we believe that the recognition of the civil rights of citizens is the foundation of constitutional liberty, and that the claim of the President of the United States to

declare martial law, to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, or to convert barracks and every prison in the land into a bastile, is nothing but the claim which other tyrants have assumed to subjugate a free people. The Confederate States occupy Bowling Green as a defensive position. I renew the pledges of the commanders of other columns of Confederate troops to retire from the territory of Kentucky on the same conditions which will govern their movements. I further give you my own assurance that the force under my command will be used to aid the government of Kentucky in carrying out the strict neutrality desired by its people whenever they undertake to enforce it against the two belligerents alike.

Sir : I have the honor to inform you that I this morning occupied this position as a defensive measure against the Federal forces, which have endeavored to possess themselves of the entire territory of Kentucky, as a means both of subverting the liberties of the State and of attacking the Confederate States. The attention of your excellency has heretofore been repeatedly called to the different acts of the Federal authorities which were a violation of the neutral position of Kentucky, and of such a character as to threaten the safety of the Confederate States. I have the honor further to inform your excellency that the Government of the Confederate States has no desire to violate the position of strict neutrality chosen by the people of the State of Kentucky; but, on the contrary, is ready to evacuate the military positions already occupied whenever the Federal authorities will agree to respect the neutrality of the State. I transmit to your excellency a proclamation which I published this morning.

Hon. James Guthrie,
President of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company:
Sir : It is my purpose to reopen the traffic recently suspended by direction of the President of the United States on such portions of the Louisville and Nashville Railway as may be under the control of the forces under my command, and also to re establish the running of the regular passenger trains. The counties through which this railway passes are largely interested in its stock, and are charged with heavy burdens to pay the interest on the debts which they have contracted in the construction of the road. The cessation of this traffic, under the orders of the President, was an act of injustice to the people, who were already sufficiently taxed, for it deprived the citizens of these counties

## p. 415 (#423) ############################################

﻿Chap, m] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-----------CONFEDERATE.	415
of the very means relied upon to pay the largely-increased taxation demanded by the policy of the Government. As far as rests in my power, I propose to secure to the people of these counties their just rights in this respect, by permitting the traffic on the road to continue as it existed before the illegal interference of the President. With this view I have possessed myself of a considerable portion of the rolling stock of the road, and now propose to you that, as president of the company, you continue the management of the portion of road within the limits of the influence of the forces under my command, and conduct it, as before the existence of the war, in the interest of the people who are interested in its stock. I propose that you will continue your agents and employes, with the single restriction that they shall be men who are not inimical to the people of these counties, and that the stockholders shall enjoy all the benefit to which their railroad charter entitles them. In order to secure the rights of the stockholders, I have directed an account to be kept of the earnings and expenses of the road, including the amount to which the company will be entitled for transporting the troops under my orders. This account will be rendered to you, and the balance paid over on the single condition that it shall be applied to the purposes contemplated by the charter. If this proposition should be declined, I propose transferring the rolling stock to such agents as may be appointed by the counties through which the road passes. This will insure an equitable distribution of the property of the road in the interest of the stockholders.

Sir: You will establish yourself without delay, with an infantry battalion of 600 men and Byrne’s battery of artillery, at the railroad crossing on Green River, to cover the bridge and the line of defense of the river. I also desire you to open communication with Elizabethtown. It is also suggested that you establish a strong picket at Bacon Creek Bridge, 8 miles in advance of Munfordville, on Green River, and that you carefully watch the Green River Bridge, 10 miles above Munfordville. You will rally around your command as strong a force of Kentuckians as possible. It is supposed that a large force of southern-rights men will assemble on Muldraugh’s Hill, near Elizabethtown. Encour age their remaining there as long as they can and the assemblage of soldiers. Muster into service all companies who may present themselves armed for three years, or during the war, or for twelve months, if they will not volunteer for a longer period. At Elizabethtown, communicate with Colonel Helm, Col. Martin H. Cofer, or General Henry E. Read in relation to destruction of bridges aod organization of troops. At Mun-fordville, communicate with Messrs. Showdy, Bohannon, or Edwards. Seize any United States arms which may be in Munfordville depot. Send all trains to Bowling Green, after establishing communication with Elizabethtown, except one locomotive and a few cars, to keep up communication with your pickets.

Judge,* the Seventeenth Alabama Regiment, commanded by Col. Thomas H. Watts; the Eighteenth Alabama Regiment, commanded by Col. E. 0. Bullock, and the Nineteenth Alabama Regiment, commanded by Col. Joseph Wheeler. This was done because it was agreeable to General Walker to have the command of Alabama troops, and it was supposed that it would be equally agreeable to the regiments to have him to command them. The President directs me to express his earnest wish that your excellency will do everything in your power to arm these regiments without delay, in order that General Walker may report with his command to General A.

erate States to call upon the governor of Tennessee for troops for the defense of the Mississippi River and the States included in this military department.
The defenseless condition of this department was patent from the moment I arrived and had a hasty view of the field. The necessity for a strong and efficient army is present anti pressing.
I therefore avail myself of the permission above cited to call upon your excellency to furnish for the service of the Confederate States 30,000 men. I would prefer volunteers for the present war, as securing better disciplined, more shilled, and effective forces, and if any such shall volunteer by companies, they will be gladly accepted under the act of May 8.
But dispatch now is of the first importance, and therefore companies, battalions, and regiments offering for twelve months will be at once received.
After the full conversations I have had with your excellency I need say nothing more of my deficiency in arms, except that it exists to the same extent still.
I beg your influence with the volunteers, to induce them to bring into the field every effective arm in their possession. Bifles and shot-guns, double-barreled guns in particular, can be made effective weapons in the hands of your skilled horsemen. These arms will be replaced in the hands of the troops by uniform arms at the shortest practicable period.
I have selected the following points in your state for the rendezvous of this force, viz: Knoxville, Nashville, Jackson, Trenton, and Memphis. At each of these places officers will be in readiness to muster in companies, battalions, and regiments, as soon as organized, for the war or for twelve months, as they decide to serve. At these designated places provision will be made for supplies, and the instruction of the troops will be prosecuted until they can be armed and prepared to move to the frontier.	•
The proportion of troops to be ordered to these different points, depending upon the districts from which the volunteers are drawn, I leave to the determination of your excellency, asking to be informed of the probable numbers you may be likely to assemble at each, in order that my preparations for their wants may be in proportion.

Helm, you moving from Russellville. As your proposed point of junction, of which you are informed, is near the enemy’s position at Rochester, your movement will be cautious. I inclose you a copy of my instructions to Colonel Helm.# Endeavor to communicate with him by guides during to morrow, and concert your movement in such a way as to insure concert of action in supporting distance of each other as you approach the point of junction. If the enemy should be in stronger force than is supposed, unite with Helm at a point farther from Rochester. The dam or lock at Rochester should be disabled.

General A. Sidney Johnston, Nashville, Tenn.:
Dear Sir : Col. W. P. Buckner called on me yesterday in behalf of yourself and our great cause in Kentucky. His accounts of our affairs there are by no means cheering, but with the blessing of Providence and your exertions we yet expect a great deal in that direction.
It is in my power to do but little for you. We have no spare arms, and are still deficient in ammunition. I have men and can get any number, and those who have been with us some months are well instructed, fine soldiers. Weeks ago I offered four of these regiments to the President for an equal number of new men, believing that the cause would be advanced by such a move. This was all I could do, and all I can do now, but no reply has reached me, though I learn from an officer who has been to Richmond that the Department thinks that the short time my men have to serve would not justify the expense. Upon hearing this I again wrote, requesting that I might offer the alternative to them, satisfied a very large proportion will stay for the war. To this I ought to hear very soon.
The mission of Colonel B. will not be successful, I fear, as our extreme Southern country has been stripped of both arms and men. We started early in this matter and have well-nigh exhausted our resources. Besides, there is a general apprehension of invasion this fall and winter, and every means in the country is being devoted to defense5 some of it very injudiciously. Mobile and New Orleans are being fortified at

great expense, when they should be defended in Kentucky and Missouri. The unfortunate state of affairs which has caused our troops to fall back in the latter State is deeply to be deplored. We are bound to accept it as necessary, though we may not see the reason. It would ha^e been a great diversion in favor of the movements in Kentucky. In both these States all depended on rapid movement to save our triends before the enemy could disarm and disorganize them. We fear that procrastination lias cost us much, but look with great confidence to the future under your control. Deep solicitude is felt on the subject of an appointment to the War Office.
The health of the President is such that he cannot give his personal attention to the details of service, and it is essential that he should have a man of the highest abilities and of great nerve and self-reliance.
The policy of the enemy seems now to be defensive at the North, relying upon the winter to check us there, while he will operate by naval expeditions throughout the South.
Wishing you full success in the arduous and responsible task before you, I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

Whereas the armed occupation of a part of Kentucky by the United States and the preparations which manifest the intention of their Government to invade the Confederate States through that territory has imposed it on these last, as a necessity of self-defense, to enter that

State and meet the invasion upon the best line for military operations; And whereas it is proper that the motives of the Government of the Confederate States in taking this step should be fully known to the world:
Now, therefore, I, Albert Sidney Johnston, general, and commander of the Western Department of the Army of the Confederate States of America, do proclaim that these States have thus marched their troops into Kentucky with no hostile intention towards its people, nor do they desire or seek to control their choice in regard to their union with either of the Confederacies or to subjugate their State, or hold its soil against their wishes. On the contrary, they deem it to be the right of the people of Kentucky to determine their own position in regard to the belligerents. It is for them to say whether they will join either Confederacy or maintain a separate existence as an independent and sovereign State. The armed occupation of their soil, both as to its extent and duration, will therefore be strictly limited by the exigencies of self-defense on the part of the Confederate States. These States intend to conform to all the requirements of public law and international amity as between themselves and Kentucky, and accordingly I hereby command all who are subject to my orders to pay entire respect to the rights of property and the legal authorities within that State so far as the same may be compatible with the necessity of self-defense.
If it be the desire of the people of Kentucky to maintain a strict and impartial neutrality, then the effort to drive out the lawless intruders who seek to make their State the theater of war will aid them in the attainment of their wishes. If, as it may not be unreasonable to suppose, those people desire to unite their fortunes with the Confederate States, to whom they are already bound by so many ties of interest, then the appearance and aid of Confederate troops will assist them to make an opportunity for the free and unbiased expression of their will upon the subject. But if it be true, which is not to be presumed, that a majority of those people desire to adhere to the United States and become parties to the war, then none can doubt the right of the other belligerent to meet that war whenever and wherever it may be waged. But harboring no such suspicion, I now declare, in the name of the Government which I serve, that its army shall be withdrawn from Kentucky so soon as there shall be satisfactory evidence of the existence and execution of a like intention on the part of the United States.
By order of the President of the Confederate States of America:

Governor Pettus, of Mississippi:
Governor: I have the honor to inform your excellency that, under date of September 10, 1861,1 was authorized by the President of the Confederate States to call upon the governor of Mississippi for troops for the defense of the Mississippi Biver and the States included in this military department.
The defenseless condition of this department was patent from the moment I arrived and had a hasty view of the field. The necessity for a strong and efficient army is present and pressing.

I therefore avail myself of the permission above cited to call upon your excellency to furnish for the service of the Confederate States 10,000 men. I would prefer volunteers for the present war, as securing better disciplined, more skilled, and effective forces, and if any such shall volunteer by comi)anies, they will be gladly received under the act of May 8.
But dispatch now is of the first importance, and therefore companies, battalions, and regiments offering tor twelve months will be at once received.
I beg your influence with the volunteers to induce them to bring into the field every effective arm in their possession. Rifles and shot-guns, double-barreled guns in particular, can be made effective weapons in the hands of your skilled horsemen. These arms will be replaced in the hands of the troops by uniform arms at the shortest practicable period.
1 have selected the following points in your State for the rendezvous of this force, viz: Vicksburg, Natchez, and Grenada. At each of these places officers vyill be in readiness to muster in companies, battalions, and regiments as soon as organized for the war, or for twelve months, as they decide to serve. At these designated points provision will be made for supplies, and the instruction of the troops will be prosecuted until they can be armed and prepared to move on the frontier.
The proportion of troops to be ordered to these different points, depending upon the districts from which the volunteers are drawn, I leave to the determination of your excellency, asking to be informed of the probable numbers you may be likely to assemble at each, in order that my preparations for their wants may be in proportion.
I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

I designate Little Rock as one point for the rendezvous of these volunteers, and ask your excellency to select such other points within the State most suitable, having in view the health of the troops and economy of supply while organizing and under instruction preparatory to taking the field and for their march thence to the Missouri frontier of your State.

Brig. Gen. F. K. Zollicoffer :
General : Your letter of the 16th instant was received by General Johnston yesterday. I am directed to say that he agrees with you that it is essential to strengthen the position at Cumberland Gap and Ford and the intervening passes of the three mountains; and so fully is he impressed with the importance of these works, that he wishes them prosecuted with all vigor, and to be made tenable by the smallest practicable force, thus setting free for other operations as large a portion of your command as possible. A forward movement from your present position at this time cannot be made.
Your advance into Kentucky and your route must be timed by, and in its direction combined with, the movements of General Buckner, now advancing into Kentucky. When this position, military and political, is better developed, you will receive full information and special orders.
Pending this, the general wishes the works of defense to be prosecuted with the greatest vigor, and your troops held in hand for a prompt movement when the route is given.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. W. MACKALL, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Nashville, September 23,1861.
General A. Sidney Johnston,
Commanding Confederate Troops, Columbus, Ky.:
Sir : My telegram of this morning may not sufficiently explain the condition of things in my brigade.
I reached here this morning, by order of Brigadier-General Buckner, to superintend the arming of that portion of my brigade which remained at Camp Boone after the forward movement by General Buckner, but was afterwards moved here by order of General Buckner, expecting to find arms sufficient to fit them for the field. Not a single gun can be procured, of any sort, under any circumstances.
The brigade numbers near 3,000 men, about one-sixth badly armed. The brigade is in the advance, at Bowling Green, and the want of arms has a most demoralizing effect on the men.
Governor Harris states this morning that a vessel with 8,500 Enfield rifles, with other supplies, has reached Savannah, Ga.; if this be so, can you not intercede at Richmond for us1? A failure to arm us promptly will act ruinously on our friends in Kentucky.
If anything can be done, I beg you will telegraph me as to how I shall proceed.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
LLOYD TILGHMAN, Colonel, Commanding First Kentucky Brigade.

General Alcorn :
Cosby is on the Bowling Green and Greenville road, about 1 mile west of the point of crossing of the direct Russellville and Rochester road. I wish you to effect a junction with him to-morrow night at that point, with about 1,000 men. Start early, and have 100 of your men to escort the artillery I will send in the morning. Leave a guide for them. I will join you before night via Russellville. Take all the rations and ammunition your wagons will carry.

Maj. Georoe B. Cosby:
Sir: General Buckner has arranged to re-enforce you with a large force of infantry and artillery. He expects to accompany them. They will move from Russellville with the purpose of effecting a junction with you to morrow evening. They will move along the direct road from Russellville to Rochester. General Buckner will send to morrow what supplies he can. Cooking utensils are difficult to get. Unless you find it advisable to advance, you can wait for a junction to be effected. Send couriers back to advise General Buckner.
Yours, truly,

Lieutenant-Colonel Mackall,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville, Tenn.:
Sir : I intended making a movement to-morrow, but upon inquiry find that there is not twenty-four hours’ supply of bread in the command. I have been here five days, supposing my supplies were accumulating, but there being as yet no other administrative officers furnished my brigade but a commissary, that officer has had to furnish transportation for subsistence and ammunition, and has thus been disabled from keeping up the supplies. A quartermaster has been recently appointed, but has yet no funds furnished. I have no ordnance officer. I hope soon, however, to be better provided.
Yery respectfully,

an onward movement towards those who threaten invasion. I have been unfortunate in having no brigade quartermaster until within a few days, and he has now gone to Eichmond to give bond and get funds. Transportation being inadequate, our subsistence supplies have been retarded, but we are now getting them up.
I would be pleased to know how I can best co-operate with General Buckner’s movements. I have five infantry regiments, ten cavalry companies, and an artillery company of six 6-pounders here.

This Department will accept, under the provisions of the act of 21st August, 1861, entitled “An act to provide for local defense and special service,” all volunteer forces that you may desire to organize under its terms, with the sole condition that the forces thus mustered into our service are to arm and equip themselves.

You will perceive by the words of the law that troops thus raised are to serve u for the defense of exposed places or localities or such special service as the President may deem expedient.77
It will be necessary to use great care in specifying the service for which the troops are thus specially engaged, in order to avoid all question as to the legality of any call that may be made on them when the moment arrives for resorting to their aid.

Sir : Feeling the importance of our position, and wishing to facilitate matters as much as possible, I. have instructed Major Boyd, brigade quartermaster, now en route for Memphis, to call at Columbus and ascertain something definite as to the arms for my brigade.
Understanding that an officer was on his way from Savannah, Ga., with arms, I would request, if compatible with the public service, that you give Major Boyd an order to receive 2,500 stand from the first arrival at Nashville. Part of my brigade is waiting in arms at Nashville, and there is no other authority than your own to effect this purpose. My zeal in the public interests must be my apology for thus troubling you.

Fort Henry, Tennessee River, September 25,1861. Col. A. Heiman:
Sir : Agreeably to an order received upon the 14th instant, I proceeded to the Kentucky side of the river opposite the post, where I met 14 mounted Kentuckians, armed and equipped, to assist me make a reconnaissance of the river and the country adjacent, as far down as I should find it expedient.
The small map which accompanies this was copied from an old one furnished by one of the company, Mr. William M. Smith. It is most probably correct, since the original is the one from which all the land in the u Jackson purchase,” of which this is a map, was entered. The large map is a portion of the Jackson purchase, showing the topography of the country through which I passed.*
You will by simple inspection see to what scales the maps are drawn, recollecting the squares included between the heavy lines represent 36 square miles. The route I traveled is marked with a red dotted line. A few general facts and several particular points will embrace everything en route.
I found that the river bottom extended from one-half to three-quarters of a mile from the river, and where not cultivated was very heavily timbered. The bottom is terminated by a system of hills, generally very steep, and varying from 80 to 100 feet in height. This system is not at all regular; that is, there is no summit of any extent parallel to the river. The hills have an oblong contour, the longest diameter pointing to the southwest and northeast.
The country immediately opposite the fort is much more hilly than any I passed, owing to the hills immediately on the Tennessee River meeting those which characterize the Blood River Valley.
A very remarkable feature noticed is that the greater part, if not all, of the streams run parallel to the river (Tennessee).
The road to Bayley’s Ferry is at the foot of the hills, and, though not a large one, with but little work could be made a very superior military road. The soil is compact, and has considerable gravel in it.
The hills recede from the river as you approach Bay ley’s; from Bay-ley’s to Pine Bluff the road is very bad. Pine Bluff consists of two dwelling-houses and a store. There is a ferry at this point, and a large, fine road leading to Murray. Immediately opposite is a very steep, rocky, and large hill. A short distance below is another hill, not so steep, nor does it appear to be so rough.
A mile below Pine Blufi* is Bass’ Ferry.
Three-quarters of a mile below Bass’ is Blood River Island, in size and length very similar to Panther Greek Island. About 150 yards below the foot of this island is the mouth of Blood River.
This river is rather remarkable for its steep banks and muddy bottom. There is no ford below the point at which I crossed, and but two or three above, until you reach a considerable distance from its mouth. Below Concord there are but two bridges over this stream. Blood
No inelosure found.

River lias the appearance of the bayous in the southern countries. The fords are marked upon the map.
Newburg is the next shipping point below Blood River; at this place there is also a ferry. Calloway town is next below Newburg. There is also a ferry at this point. There is a large public road from Murray to Callowaytown. Highland is then reached. A large road communicates from this place to the Murray road (see map). Highland evidently received its name from the height of the river bank, which is said to be ten feet above the highest watermark. A u tow-head,as it is called, or an island, commences at this point and extends down the river nearly a mile. At very low water the sand bar is visible considerably above this place, and therefore the river is very wide and shallow. The channel, as you will see from the map, is almost against the shore at Highland, and boats are obliged to land low down stream when descending the river, on account of the channel being so narrow. The bank is heavily timbered. This tow-head extends to Aurora.
The largest and most public road in the country reaches the river at Aurora, at which place there is a steam ferry-boat, used to ferry a stage line, under the employ of the United States Government, carrying the United States mail from Canton to Mayfield, &c. The crossing was formerly accomplished by means of buoy-boats, the buoys being held in their places by anchors and a cable chain. The chain has never been removed, and therefore is still in the water. The conductor of the ferry says it is over three-quarters of a mile long, and is situated on the west side of the island. This chain is sufficiently long to extend three times across the river.
In case a masked battery was desirable, I think there is no point on the river more suitable than between Highland and Aurora. The chain could be made very useful in impeding the progress of boats, or, if necessary, is long enough to span the narrow channel a great many times, and by cutting the timber above, which is mostly oak, could completely blockade the river. The hills are near enough to command the river and a small creek affords a fine traverse from the river bank.
There being no road near to and down the river from Aurora, I determined to take the main road to Mayfield, and learn the position of the enemy’s pickets from General Cheatham. When I reached Wades-borough I learned that General Cheatham had moved his command from Mayfield westward towards Columbus. Therefore I concluded to return to Fort Henry via Murray and Concord. There is considerable sameness in the character of the country from the fort to Aurora. The country is undulating from the river to Wadesborough, and from Wadesborough to a point half way between Murray and Concord, where the hills of Blood River commence. Upon the map the large roads are indicated by two parallel lines and the space included colored yellow.
The party was very hospitably treated by every one with whom they stopped. I am indebted to Mr. Sam. Coleman for a great deal of information in reference to the roads and the character of the country. He was formerly a surveyor of Calloway County, and could tell me by very little reflection the squares through which roads passed and in what squares all the roads intersected. Mr. William M. Smith is also well acquainted with the country and was of great service to me. *##*###
Hoping the report of this short survey may meet your approbation, allow me to subscribe myself, yours, most respectfully,

S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
Camp Buckner, September 26, 1861.
Lieutenant-Colonel Mackall,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville:
Sir : I am in receipt of your letter of the 23d instant, but not until I had ordered an expedition that may possibly draw me into collision with the enemy, which I am apprehensive from your first paragraph General Johnston does not consider expedient at present.
At Laurel Bridge, in Laurel County, from 36 to 40 miles from here, is an assembly of Home Guard companies to dispute our passage. I am not able to learn their number definitely, but reports say from 100 to 500. At the salt works on Goose Creek, in Clay County, is a large amount of salt, which it is desirable we should possess. The works are about 35 miles distant, and about 18 miles east of Laurel Bridge. I desire to reconnoiter the country to that distance in advance, and it occurred to me to feel of the guard at the bridge, and under cover of the movement to send all the empty wagons I could command to load with and receipt for the salt. I sent an infantry regiment before day this morning with three companies of cavalry and a section of artillery to take possession of the bridge; a battalion of infantry and two companies of cavalry follow to take position 8 or 10 miles from the bridge, toward the salt works, and a regiment of infantry with two cavalry companies proceed to the works to load with salt and return.
The movement at the bridge is designed to attract attention and mask the movement to the salt works. All are instructed to communicate with each other and with me by express messengers, and to give each other mutual support. I have two cavalry companies watching the road between here and Barboursville, and I have here two infantry regiments and two sections of an artillery company. The bridge is about 50 miles from Cam]) Dick Robinson, and the movement may draw a force from that camp, which would require me to support my advanced force; but I do not believe this probable. I expect the whole expedition back in five or six days.
I am without information as to the strength or movements of Camp Dick Robinson. Any information you have might be of service to me. The population here is so generally hostile I cannot push spies through. The male population has nearly disappeared between here and Barboursville. I am carefully respecting the rights of the citizens, and am making some favorable impression on their sentiments I hope. I have no engineer officer of military education, but will do all in my power to strengthen the positions I hold.
Yery respectfully,
F. K. ZOLLICOFFER,

Bichmond, September 27, 1861. General A.. Sidney Johnston, Columbus, Ky.:
Sir : The President has communicated to me your request for small-arms, supposed by you to have arrived per Bermuda at Savannah.
The whole number received by us was 1,800, and we purchased of the owners 1,700, making in all 3,500 Enfield rifles, of which we have been compelled to allow the governor of Georgia to have 1,000 for arming troops to repel an attack now hourly threatened at Brunswick, Ga. Of the remaining 2,500 I have ordered 1,000 sent to you, leaving us but 1,500 for arming several regiments now encamped here, and who have been awaiting their arms for several months. I state these facts to evince our solicitude to furnish you every aid in our power and our disposition to share with you all our resources.
We are hourly in hope of hearing of the arrival of small-arms, and the arsenal here is now turning them out at the rate of 1,000 per month. We will receive the first delivery in about ten days. I have ordered 1,200 Texan Bangers under Terry and Lubbock, fully armed and equipped, to report to you for service, understanding from them that you can furnish horses, which is out of our power.
We have not an engineer to send you. The whole Engineer Corps comprises only 6 captains, together with 3 majors, of whom 1 is on bureau duty. You will be compelled to employ the best material within your reach by detailing officers from other corps and by employing civil engineers, for whom pay will be allowed.
Your obedient servant,
J. P. BEKJAMIK,
Acting Secretary of War.

Learning now that he is in Memphis, the general directs you to execute the order. Call on the ordnance officer, who will be instructed to give you arms as fast as he can get them.
Did you get 800 arms for the Kentucky troops in Kashville? As fast as a company is armed, send it to Trousdale and report to General Buckner.

L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding.
Executive Department, Nashville, Tenn., September 28, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Acting Secretary of War, Richmond :
Sir: The transfer of the Provisional Army of Tennessee having been agreed upon, Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk was authorized and ordered to appoint Confederate officers to muster the army into the service of the Confederate States. The mode of mustering agreed upon by General Polk and myself was a simple verification by and delivery of a copy of the rolls to a Confederate officer. To carry out this agreement and complete the transfer, on the 31st day of July, 1861, I issued a general order to the officers commanding the Provisional Army of Tennessee to muster their respective commands, for the purpose of verifying their rolls when called upon by a Confederate officer for that purpose, and when verified to deliver the same to said Confederate officer, arid to hold themselves subject to the orders of the Government of the Confederate States; which order completed the transfer so far as the action of Tennessee was necessary to complete it, and from that day almost the whole army has been actually under the command and control of officers of the Government of the Confederate States, and the balance subject to their command and control. The verification of the rolls of the various regiments has been delayed (unnecessarily, I think) by the small number of musteriug officers thrown into the field and the tardiness which characterized their action. For nearly two months they have been slowly progressing with the work, and at this time there is a considerable portion of the force which has not been called upon to verify their rolls.
It becomes a question of interest to the troops to know from whom they are to draw their pay while in this state of transit. In the present condition of their rolls a Confederate paymaster would not feel authorized to pay them without an order from the War Department. The object of this letter is to ask that you make an order that the Provisional Army of Tennessee, thus transferred by my general order, be placed upon the pay roll of the Confederate States from the 31st day of July, 1861, and that they be paid from that day as all other troops of the Provisional Army of the Confederate States are x>aid. Tennessee has paid them up to that day, and, indeed, has yielded to the necessities of the soldiers, and has advanced to a portion of them the amount due them for services since that day; but these advances shall be reported to your Pay Department, so that the pay roll may be properly made out, and the sum so advanced should be refunded to the State by the Confederate States.
Your early attention to this matter is a necessity to the soldier, and will greatly oblige, very respectfully,
ISHAM G. HABBIS.
Executive Office, Jackson, Miss., September 28,1861.
General A. Sidney Johnston:
Sir: By proclamation I have called for 10,000 troops for the war or twelve-months’ service, as they may elect, in accordance with your

request, and urged them to bring with them every effective weapon which they can obtain. I cannot now inform you how many will probably assemble at the rendezvous named in your letter.
More than 40 companies are now in camp in this State, which have not received marching orders ; over half of these are enlisted for the war. I will advise you at the earliest moment of the tenders of companies, and hope mustering officers and provisions will be ready as soon as possible at the several encampments.
I have a number of hands employed in preparing ammunition for cannon, muskets, and rifles, and nearly out of lead. Could you aid me in procuring any quantity, from 1 to 100,000 pounds ? I need some now in preparing ammunition for rifled cannon.
I could send you a company of artillery with two field pieces, with horses, harness, &c., for four if I can get the two field pieces which I loaned to General Pillow last spring to complete the battery of four guns. These two pieces are at Union City, or in that region of country.
Advise me how I can aid you, and it shall be done to the extent of my power.

Looking at the map, Milburn or Mayfield would seem to fill the conditions of the problem $ but it is understood that a want of water at both these places forbids the establishment of a camp at either, and that therefore the point must fall south of this line.
2d. To the thorough reconnaissance of the roads leading from the front to the camp and the communications of the camp with the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers.
3d. The practicability of the country for cavalry and artillery.
Your particular attention is called to the supply of water. It is understood that this section of the country is badly watered, and in summer almost destitute, and though you may find water in abundance after the recent rains, you must inquire carefully as to the state of the streams and springs during the dry season, as the necessity for the camp may be as great during the coming summer as for the present winter.
The camp must, if possible, be convenient to wood for fuel and for bivouac, and for economy of transportation as near the Paducah Railway as practicable. Be particular to obtain from the people of the country the names of the roads, and let these appear on your map. You are authorized to employ guides and to give them a certificate of pay due for services, to be paid by the quartermaster at this post.
The object of your expedition will not be communicated to others.
I am, sir, very respectfully,
WM. W. MAGKALL,

On 25th was ordered to send 100 barrels powder to New Orleans and 50 to Mobile as soon as I could. I replied that the amount called for was not on hand. Received no answer till to-day. On 27th General Johnston ordered two tons to be shipped to Columbus, Ky., which was done, leaving one ton here. I can ship this one ton of cannon and two tons of damaged rifle powder to New Orleans and Mobile if desired. Reply.

Governor : I this morning received your letter of the 28th ultimo, and thank you for prompt answer to my call for troops and your offer of services.
The companies now in camp I accept as a portion of the quota, and beg you to organize them into regiments at once, placing such as have arms, if any there be, in the same regiment, and sending it to this place, and those without arms to one of the rendezvous already pointed out to you, and where I have to-day ordered supplies of provisions. Should mustering officers not reach any particular point in time, do not permit this to become a matter of discontent with the troops, as I will give orders to have their time counted on the rolls from the date at which each regiment presents itself.
I regret that I am unable at the present time to furnish lead. My supply is limited.
I will make inquiry in reference to the guns spoken of and inform you of the result.

Sir : Accompanying this is an order assigning you to the command of this district. The general purposes to be accomplished are: To cover the left flank of my line of operations and the right flank of the line of operations of General A. S. Johnston ; to disperse assemblages of troops which may be collected in the interest of our enemy and to prevent other similar assemblages; to collect the arms which may be the property of the enemy; to muster into the service of the Confederate States all organized bodies of Kentuckians who may present themselves for that purpose. You will consider Green Elver your northern line of defense, and, as soon as possible, it is expected that you will occupy Eamsey, and disable the navigation of Green Eiver if you should find it necessary to evacuate that point. In collecting arms you will adopt the most conciliatory policy, and avoid the searching of private houses; and in searching any portion of the premises of individuals, you will see that it is not done without the strongest reasons for doing so. My object is to protect the civil rights of all citizens, without regard to their political opinions, as far as is consistent with the safety of the army. With this view, you will visit with the severest penalties every act of the soldiers of your command which may violate this rule. As far as possible you will co-operate with the civil authorities, and give them all necessary assistance in enforcing their police regulations. You will have authority to subsist and quarter bodies of men previous to their being mustered into service, when they shall have assembled with that view.

Gov. Isham G. Harris, Nashville, Tenn. :
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 28th ultimo. There can be no difficulty on the subject to which you refer. The Confederate Government will pay all the troops of Tennessee from the 31st of July, the date of their transfer to this Government, and will do this without regard to the date of the formal muster into service. Your excellency will, perhaps, do wrell to let this fact be made known to the volunteers of your State, in order that no uneasiness be felt by them on the subject.
Of course it will not be possible to pay troops before they are mustered, but when that is done they will be paid their back pay from the 31st of July by this Government.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. P. BENJAMIN.
Headquarters Western Department,
Columbus, Ky., October 4,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:
General: Captain Wright, in charge of the ordnance department at Nashville, informs me that he has been ordered to send to New Orleans and Mobile 150 barrels of cannon powder from the first manufactured. From his previous reports I am satisfied that the only supply he has consists of 15 or 20 barrels, which I ordered to be retained for the use of Buckner in Kentucky. Nashville is the only source of supply for my department. At present the capacity of the mills is, at a maximum, 400 pounds per day (they promised 10,000 per day), but this is not only prospective, but uncertain; therefore this issue will consume the labor of the mills for thirty-seven days to come.
My necessity seems too pressing to await additions to my limited supply for such a length of time. Small as is the supply, I find that all in store at* Fort Pillow is damaged, and must be reworked to be useful.
I am about completing works here to meet the probable flotilla from the North, supposed to carry 200 heavy guns. To meet successfully this armament, and at the same time to supply field batteries sufficient to cope with their land forces, will require all the powder I have and all that the mills of Nashville can supply for some time.
I am aware that there is a deficiency of powder in the Confederate States, and as fully aware that, this being so, the Government must decide where the need is greatest. At the same time it is my duty to represent my own wants, and I may be pardoned if, intrusted as I am with the defense of this department, I should find the upper part of this river as important as its mouth.
Of two things one should obtain: If Nashville is my only source of supply, no powder should be drawn thence until it is known that I can spare it. If Nashville mills are liable to calls by the Chief of Ordnance at Richmond for other departments I should be so informed, that I may make my wants known and my calls on Richmond.
I had the honor to lay before you a month ago a proposition from responsible parties at Memphis to go into the manufacture of powder to the extent of the wants of the Government, if authorized, with proper

guaranties ; that proposition, if accepted, will hereafter relieve the Government from embarrassment in respect to powder, and had it been promptly accepted, I think the mills would by this time have been in operation.

Also a requisition which was made on the ordnance department at Nashville for the same purpose.

Camp Dick Robinson in considerable force have encamped and are fortifying the place. The enemy has cavalry, artillery, and infantry. At latest dates he had about 2,000 men. The cavalry are scouring the border and pillaging to a considerable extent. To resist these depredations upon the citizens it seems to me our forces ought to be augmented and constituted an invading column. Too much unprotected country, it would seem, intervenes between the commands of Generals Buckner and Zollicoffer. This intervening border invites the invasion of the enemy. By appointing an able brigadier and giving command of the regiments of Colonels Stanton and Murray in O verton to him, and by increasing his command to 5,000 men, an advance into Kentucky could be made and co-operation established with Generals Buckner and Zollicoffer. The border war now raging would be transferred to the soil of the enemy and the down-trodden Southern men of the section of Kentucky referred to lifted up. They are being forced in Cumberland, Clinton, Russell, Wayne, and Pulaski Counties to take the oath of allegiance at the point of the bayonet by the Federal forces and Home Guards. Such a$ seek Tennessee do so with much peril to their lives. Should you determine to accept the cavalry company of Overton, please authorize Colonel Murray to muster it into service, and order the same to be armed forthwith.

Sir: It is against my policy to seize the banks. They must not be permitted, however, to furnish supplies to the enemy. To prevent this, you will station a small guard over the banks. You will require the president, cashier, and directors to give their parole to the effect that they will not dispose of the coin or bills of the bank; that they will not receive any orders from the mother bank which may be in the enemy’s country, and that they will in no way use the funds or influence of their bank to favor our enemies. You will recognize as directors only those who give their parole to the above effect, and will exclude the others from participating in the deliberations of the directory or the exercise of authority as bank officers. In your communication to them on this subject you will distinctly make known your policy to be strictly defensive in its character and as protective of the interest of the people of this section of the State against a common enemy.

Columbus, Ky., October 13,1801. General Cooper, Adjutant-General:
The troops here all still actively engaged in preparation for the defense of this point, and hope to have the work completed soon. I anticipate no immediate advance of the enemy on this line; and learning that they are advancing in considerable force on Bowling Green, I have ordered thither all the available forces, and to-night will repair there myself and take command in person. General Hardee has already arrived there, and by to-night three-fifths of his command will have arrived, and the whole be en route. Deficiency of rolling-stock did not permit me to make his movement more compact.

General S. Cooper:
Major Breckinridge is with this army. He has resigned his position of Senator in a stirring address to the people of Kentucky. He will enter the army, if necessary, as a private soldier. Please say to the President that he will accept any position that may be tendered him. Permit me to suggest his name as a brigadier-general, either for the Kentucky brigade or for a separate column, to be directed through the strong southern-rights counties in Eastern Kentucky. I make this suggestion on my own responsibility, but with a knowledge of Major Breckinridge’s views.

Sir : General Walker informs me he has 4,000 men at Huntsville without arms. They are well drilled, having been in service some months. He asks arms for them, and requests that 4,000 be sent to him out of the‘first supply, and I beg leave to ask attention to his wants.

Major Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance:
You are aware that when I took command of the field in the West, to which I was assigned, we were without ordnance supplies of every description. This made it necessary, after obtaining all that was accessible from other quarters, to order such supplies as the defenses of the field demanded.
I ordered Colonel Hunt, the ordnance officer of the State of Tennessee, who was acting as my agent, to make such contracts as were necessary. This he did, and they have been filled as rapidly as practicable. A list of these contracts I have inclosed, to show you the kind of supplies

ordered and tlie rates at which they were to be furnished. The work has generally proved very satisfactory, and, indeed, equal to any furnished in any shops anywhere. I have also been obliged to have a shop put up in Memphis for the alteration and repair of guns.
The amount for these expenditures made I have directed Captain Hunt to send you. You will perceive that we must have remittances if we are to be supplied with the means of defen ding dhe valley.
In the article of field batteries I am now getting all that is required, reaching from McCulloch’s and Price’s commands in the West to Zolli-coffer’s in the East, though it has required a large amount.
We still want 12, 18, and 24 pounders as siege pieces and for the arming and flanking our forts. Where shall we get them? We hope you will continue to send us as many rifled guns as possible. Can we not have Mr. Eead, of Alabama, the inventor of the shell, to come to Memphis to put our people in the way of making his shell ?
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Fort Henry, October 14,1861.
Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk:
Sir : Saturday night, immediately after tattoo, a signal rocket from my picket, 3 miles below the fort, announced that a boat was in sight. I sent Captain Morgan with his company at once as an additional picket, and to ascertain if any troops had landed, got the regiment under arms, and the gunners at their posts. Shortly after the first picket came in, stating that two reliable men, who live near the mouth of Blood River, 9 miles below the fort, came up in a skiff, and informed them that two gunboats were lying at that place; but to be sure of the fact, I directed Lieutenant Berrie, of Captain Ford’s company, with two mounted men from the neighborhood, to proceed to that point to reconnoiter, and by all means to ascertain if any troops had landed. By that time a dense fog hung over the river, which prevented the approach of any boat.
Next morning (Sunday) Lieutenant Berrie returned, stating that two gunboats were coming up, and that they had fired a shot from a small gun at them, and that they had landed a few men, who shortly after retifrned to the boat. A black smoke was now visible below the island, which made the approach of a boat certain. I recalled the pickets, struck tents, took the regiment into the fort, and we were ready.
A little before 11 o’clock the boat showed her broadside in turning the bend of the river and passing the chute below the island, showing that she moved very slowly and with great caution. Shortly after she turned the foot of the island, showing her bow to the fort, stopped a very short time, and retired.
As the boat had stopped some distance below the range of our guns, which I was not willing to expose, and which is short beyond all reasonable expectation for 32-pounders, I did not permit a gun to be fired.
Last night I sent a mounted picket, which I formed from the minute-men of this vicinity, again down as far as Blood River Island, and they reported just now that there are no boats in the river as far as they could see.
Sixty men, under the command of Captain Graham, were sent to me from Fort Douelson, who will return this evening.

October 14,1861.
Brig. Gen. W. R. Caswell, Knoxville:
General : I received your order of the 3d instant to hasten my movement to the relief of Captain Bledsoe, on Sunday, at Kimbrough’s, at the foot of the mountain. I had fallen in with Captains Ragsdale’s and Finley’s companies, marching under similar orders; we learned from Captain Bledsoe’s lieutenant that he had left Jamestown and fallen back to Camp Myers, some 25 miles distant from his encampment at McGinnis’, to where Colonel Stanton’s regiment was stationed. I arrived (my squadron) at Camp Myers on Thursday evening; on Friday it rained incessantly all day, and on Friday evening Colonel Stanton arrived from Bowling Green, with orders for his and Colonel Murray’s and all the cavalry at Camp Myers to march to Bowling Green, Ky., to join General Buckner’s command, and in pursuance of said orders Colonel Stanton’s regiment and Captains Saunders’ and Bledsoe’s companies of cavalry left Camp Myers on Saturday evening for Bowling Green. Colonel Murray’s left (the last of it) to-day, when I did, and is encamped at this place to-night. Major Bridgman ordered the two companies of his battalion, viz, Ragsdale’s and Finley’s and mine and Captain Snow’s companies, to take the back track to Post Oak Springs. I refused to obey said order. The other three companies left Camp Myers on Saturday evening.
On Sunday I sent my first and second lieutenants to Camp McGinnis, to confer with Captain Gillespie; they returned to-day at noon, informing me that Captain G. left this morning for Knoxville. Captain G. informed my lieutenant that he was advised that he was not safe to remain at the camp where he was. I did all that I [could] to prevent Major Bridgman from leaving until we heard from headquarters. Captain Ragsdale and myself followed Major Bridgman to Livingston, and endeavored to induce him to await orders, but all to no avail.
This section of the country is in a perilous condition. The people are greatly alarmed in consequence of being left without protection. The pass or main thoroughfare from Kentucky to East Tennessee is open to the enemy. The Lincoln troops have evacuated Albany when they heard of the encampment at Camp Myers, leaving two companies of cavalry and the Home Guards. As I passed through Livingston on this evening the citizens en masse came out, and prevailed on me not to leave them in their defenseless condition, and said they would send a committee to-night to Major B.’s encampment and endeavor to jnevail on him to return. I am going to remain here or hereabouts until 1 get further orders. My opinion is that our four companies of cavalry could do great good by scouting in Clinton County, Kentucky.
There is a perfect reign of terror in Kentucky. The Southern men are greatly in fear of their lives. The Lincolnites are swearing in the citizens daily, and many of our friends are made to take the oath in order to save their lives and property. If we had a force, say one regiment of infantry and our four companies of cavalry, we could make a favorable demonstration in Kentucky and join General Zollicoffer at Somerset or some other point.

Executive Department,
Nashville, Term., October 15,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, Richmond:
As you are doubtless already informed, General Johnston has called upon me for 30,000 volunteers, in addition to the Provisional Army of Tennessee heretofore transferred to the Confederate States. To fill this requisition companies and regiments are rapidly reporting themselves, yet, from the constant inquiry made as to when and how they can be armed, I fear there will be some difficulty in raising so large a force unless I am authorized to give more satisfactory assurances than I am at present able to do.
It is the prospect of immediate and active service that swells the ranks of a volunteer force. They are reluctant to go into camp for winter quarters, where, without arms, they feel that they can render no service and really be of no use to the Government. I am exceedingly anxious to have this force armed and equipped to aid in repelling invasion, so strongly threatened at this time upon the northern border of the State, feeling certain that if properly prepared we can prevent the enemy reaching our soil.
Tennessee has placed every arm that she could command in the hands of the troops transferred to the Government. If it is the policy of the Government to cease operations in Western Virginia until the winter is past, I would be pleased, if it can be done consistent with the public interest, to see the Tennessee troops there removed to. the scene of action in this vicinity. The term of service of these troops will about expire with the winter in the mountains, in view of which fact the Government can make more profitable use of them in the manner indicated than by quartering them there; besides, a re-enlistment would be much more probable than in their present location.
The confidence of our people in their security from invasion is necessary to insure the production of such supplies and provisions as are absolutely demanded by the wants of our armies; to aid in doing wffiich (if there were not more important considerations), it becomes of the utmost importance that Kentucky shall be held by the South. If the movement in Kentucky should halt or fail, it may seriously affect the amount of supplies produced in Tennessee. Recent movements indicate the purpose of the Federal Government to throw an overwhelming force into that State. I am satisfied that Kentucky is now the battle ground, and if superior numbers should give the enemy even a temporary success, it would not only endanger the safety of Tennessee, but carry with it incalculable mischief to the whole Confederacy. I am sure your policy is to drive them back to the Ohio.
The requisition of General Johnston will be promptly filled upon the assurance of arming. Without such assurance I frankly confess that there will be some delay.
If there could be thrown into this quarter an army large enough to drive the enemy back to the Ohio and push a column forward to Saint Louis, from these points amide supplies could be obtained to support the armies of the Government, and aggressive movements inaugurated and pushed forward which would deprive the Korth of the rich grain fields of the West, cut them off from their supplies, break up their hives of men, and enable you to make peace upon fair and honorable terms. It is the West that sustains the Federal Government in prosecuting the war. If able to take such positions as will command that section the East becomes powerless, and our supplies, so necessary and important to all our future movements, become abundant and certain.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
But I find myself digressing from the object of my letter, which was to suggest the importance of a large force for a winter campaign in Kentucky ; to ask that the Tennessee troops be sent from Western Virginia, or a part of them, if it can be done with safety, and to appeal for arms for the 30,000 men now being raised here. The interest and anxiety which I feel for the success of our cause and the safety of Tennessee, which I regard as now seriously threatened with invasion, must be my apology for the length of this communication and the freedom of my suggestions. Feeling the highest assurance that your excellency will do all that is possible to prevent such a calamity,
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, yours, &c.,
ISHAM G. HARRIS.
Bowling Green, Ky., October 15,1861. General A. Sidney Johnston:
Sir: The anomalous condition of Kentucky, in the civil war now raging in the States formerly composing the Federal Union, induces me to hope that you will use the power of your position for the mitigation of the necessary evils of such a condition. At present a large portion of the people of Kentucky have neither the protection of State, Federal, nor Confederate law. The people, by large majorities, maintained at the polls the position of neutrality and peace; whilst the legislature, repudiating the only doctrine it dared to assert before the election, have plunged the State into war. Large majorities of the people have always been and now are in favor of a permanent connection with the South, whilst the legislature, urged by an insatiable ambition and party spirit, have forced her into an unnatural connection with the Korth, the most unnecessary, foolish, and criminal act, in our opinion, ever perpetrated.
Whilst the people have thus maintained a position of neutrality, the Federal Government have directed against them, in common with their Southern brethren, an organized system of unconstitutional aggression against their domestic peace and slave property. In this condition, a factious majority of the legislature of Kentucky, in defiance of every pledge, and against the repeated vetoes of the governor, and fearing the universal indignation of their constituents, determined to surround themselves with an army, sworn, officered and paid by Lincoln, and have pursued their political opponents with the fell vengeance of edicts (which they call laws)—edicts at once unprecedented, unconstitutional, and atrocious. Thus pursued, subjugated, and betrayed by armies and legislatures, by Federal and State law, they receive no protection from Confederate law, because as yet they constitute no part of the Confederate States.
Under these circumstances, we ask of you such protection as you can extend (consistently with your position) to our trade, our property, our liberty, and our lives.
1st. The people have been forbidden by the acts of the Federal Congress and the embargoes of Lincoln their usual free trade with the Southern Confederacy. The Federal Government contend that this power of restriction on trade is an incident of the war-making powers of Congress, and one of the principal means possessed by the Federal Government of successfully assailing the South. If this be true, it is certainly within the powers possessed by a commander of Confederate armies to remove a restriction imposed by their enemy for the purpose of injuring the Confederate States. The advantages of a free and mire-

﻿Chap. xn.J CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.---------CONFEDERATE.	451
stricted trade between tbe people of Kentucky and the Confederate States are too obvious to need illustration. The commercial interchange of the products of the two sections, composed on the one hand of provisions, clothing, horses, and mules, and, on the other, of cotton, sugar, and rice, would tend obviously and greatly to the relief of both sections.
So far, then, as your occupation of this State is concerned, it would obviously embarrass the enemies and assist the friends of the Southern Confederacy to open up, to the extent of your occupation, a free trade with the South. To prevent the smuggling North of the cotton, sugar, and rice, so much needed by the enemy, you could subject this trade to such restrictions as would confine it to the open and stanch friends of the South. Licenses might be granted to all true friends of the Southern Confederacy, and thus all danger of smuggling to supply the enemy avoided.
2d. The majority of the legislature have also subjected the people to taxation for the support of this war against the Southern Confederacy, and the sheriffs are now engaged in its collection. If they are permitted to collect and pay over this tax, the people will be forced to contribute to their own subjugation, and the enemy supplied with money for the prosecution of the war. It is within the conceded powers of belligerents to appropriate to themselves the revenues of each other ; and it is therefore certainly within the scope of your powers, as commander of the Confederate armies, to seize and appropriate the Federal revenue or to prevent its collection altogether by the enemy’s agents. It is the latter which we request you to do, and in this manner cut off the supplies of the enemy, and relieve our people from the payment of an unjust tax, intended to be used against the Southern Confederacy.
3d. The legislature have also passed their edicts, subjecting every Kentuckian who takes part in this war on the side of the South, within this State, to imprisonment as a felon within the penitentiary, whilst they encourage the enlistment of Kentuckians into the armies of the North. This act, so atrocious in its object, and so well calculated to inflame the passions of the combatants, must lead to cruel acts of retaliation, and will crimson the very land with blood. The legislature have thus endeavored to use all the civil powers of the State in behalf of the North, and to array all the terrors of penal law against the Southern Confederacy. If the sheriffs and judges of this State be permitted by you to hunt down, arrest, try, condemn, and imprison as felons all who serve or aid the Confederate States, then our citizens would have the protection of no government in aiding you, and could expect to escape prosecution and imprisonment only by submitting to or by aiding and supporting the enemy of your States. It is difficult to overestimate the moral power of such acts in paralyzing your friends and in encouraging your enemies. We venture therefore to hope that you will prohibit the arrests of citizens by the sheriffs and their trial and condemnation by the judges and courts under this atrocious act, aimed at the liberties of the people.
If you will thus grant to the people of this part of the State, now occupied and held by the arms of the Confederate States, the advantages of an unrestricted commerce with the South, and give ample protection to life, liberty, and property, it will furnish a proud and noble contrast to the Northern despotism which now reigns supreme in the balance of the State.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
GEO. W. JOHNSON.

Hdqrs. Division No. 1, Western Department,
Columbus, October 15, 1861.
General Johnston, Commanding Western Department:
General : In reply to yours of 12th, I have to say that I have to-day ordered a battery of six guns (two howitzers, one Parrott, and three iron guns) to be shipped to General Zollicoffer at Knoxville. The company to man it I have yet to get up, though it is in process of forming and will be ready in a few days. They shall go forward at the first moment after they are ready. I have a call for two batteries from Missouri for General Price, which I shall be able to supply also in a few days. Thornton’s Mississippi Eegiinent, from Union City, will follow the last of General Hardee’s command, which leaves to-day, immediately. I regret I have not guns of the size required by General Buckner to send him for his work at Bowling Green. Harper’s battery has gone forward to Clarksville, and is subject to your order, if not now wanted on the Cumberland Biver. I have ordered 24-pounders, 18-pounders and 12-pounders, the sizes General Buckner wants, to be prepared as soon as may be, at Nashville and at Memphis.
My work here is rapidly drawing to a close on the fort, and transportation is arriving in such quantities as to leave the powder difficulty to be the only one left.
Bespectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major- General, Commanding.
War Department, 0. S. A.,
Richmond, October 16, 1861. General A. Sidney" Johnston, Bowling Green, Ky.;
Sir: My occupations have been so engrossing that I have delayed, some days longer than I desired, addressing you on various matters connected with your command.
1.	I telegraphed you two or three days ago on the subject of the supplies at Nashville. Those supplies were collected for the army in Virginia, and have been delayed on account of the embarrassments in transportation on the railroads. The supplies in this part of the country are becoming exhausted, while in Kentucky you have a rich and fertile State, amply able to feed your army. I desire very much that you should refrain from drawing anything from the stores at Nashville, and that your commissariat be furnished by purchases in Kentucky, for which purpose funds will be forwarded in ami>le amount and sufficient time to your commissary staff. I hope you will to the utmost of your power co-operate with this Department in this matter.
2.	Your call for troops on Mississippi and other States will, I am afraid, produce embarrassment. When General Polk was sent to take command of the department now under your orders, he wras instructed that he might use his own discretion in the calls on Arkansas and Tennessee, but not to draw on Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, or Georgia without the consent of this Department. The reason for this was that Arkansas and Tennessee had not yet been subjected to any considerable drain of men, whereas the other States mentioned had been furnishing largely since the beginning of the war, and it was desired to proportion the calls on the different States with a due regard to their numbers of men capable of bearing arms. On other point also let me urgently

fix your attention. It is understood here that you have accepted certain troops from the State of Mississippi by brigades. Now, this is against our whole policy from the beginning. If you will look at the sixth section of the act for the public defense, page 36 of the Laws of the First Session, you will see that we accept no organizations higher than a regiment. The President alone is vested with the power to form regiments into brigades and divisions, and this was done for the express purpose of enabling him to keep control over the general officers, and to get rid of them if found inefficient, by breaking up the brigades and divisions to which general officers are appointed. Of course these points could not be as familiar to you as to us, in consequence of the long delay which intervened before you could reach us irom the Pacific. I therefore lay the more stress upon them, that you may be put fully into possession of our policy in the organization of the army. If it be true that you have accepted brigades, we must, of course, get along as best we can; but for the future I beg you to be careful to accept no organized body higher than a regiment; as many regiments as you please, but separately, by regiments.
3.	I have next to beg your special attention to making your adjutant prepare and forward punctually your monthly returns. The negligence on this point that has prevailed elsewhere has seriously embarrassed the Department. Without them we cannot, of course, administer the service; can make no calculations, no combinations; can provide in advance with no approach to certainty, and cannot know how to supply deficiencies. I need not enlarge on this point to a general of your experience, but I have suffered so much from inattention to this particular, that I cannot refrain from calling your attention to it.
4.	I have your letter asking for the appointment of a brigadier-general to command at Columbus, Ky., in your absence. Your recommendation of Maj. A. P. Stewart has been considered with the respect due to your suggestions, but there is an officer under your command whom you must have overlooked, whose claims in point of rank and experience greatly outweigh those of Major Stewart, and whom we could not pass by without injustice. I refer to Col. Lloyd Tilghman, whose record shows longer and better service, and who is, besides, as a Kentuckian, especially appropriate to the command of Columbus. He has therefore been appointed brigadier-general; but, of course, you will exercise your own discretion whether to place him in command at Columbus or not. Colonel McCown had been appointed brigadier-general some days before the receipt of your letter to General Cooper of the 5th instant.
I much lament that we are still so strained for arms. As soon as we can get any you shall have your full share. I shall order four 32-pounders at once to be sent to you for defense of your works at Bowling Green or such other point as you may desire to fortify with heavy guns.
Bely on the active co-operation of this Department to the full extent of its disposable means.
Your obedient servant,
J. P. BENJAMIN,
Acting Secretary of War.

Hopkinsville immediately ? The distance is only 30 miles, over a turnpike most of tlie way and a good dirt road the balance. It seems to me there is no part of the whole West so exposed as the valley of the Cumberland. The river is in fine boating order and rising quite fast. If Paducah is not to be attacked, so as to hold the enemy in check, he can, unimpeded, destroy the rolling-mills on the river now manufacturing iron for the Confederate States, the railroad bridge at Clarksville, and otherwise do incalculable mischief. I have written to General Polk on this subject, but it occurs to me the army at Hoxikinsville is not subject to his order, and therefore I address you.
Dixon has not yet had time to mount his 32-pounder guns, nor has the artillery company ordered from here left Kashvilie. I suppose it may reach Fort Donelson to-morrow night.
Excuse my anxiety about this matter, for I think the danger is not only great, but that there is no time to be lost to avert it.
Sincerely, your friend,

His Excellency Jefferson .Davis,
President of the Confederate States of America :
Dear Sir: I have just received orders from the commander-in-chief of the Army of the Mississippi, John J. Pettus, to transfer the two regiments under my command to the Confederate States, which I shall do to-morrow. I have one word to say in behalf, not only of the troops, but for the good of the service, to wit: These troops, numbering some 1,800, are now just recovering from measles. At least two-thirds of the brigade have had them, and to send them in their present condition into the valley of the Mississippi or Kentucky would lose one-half of them in a very short time. If they could go to the coast anywhere for a few months, they would then be prepared for a colder climate. Hoping you will find it convenient to send them South,
I have the honor to be, very, respectfully, your obedient servant,

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector-General, Richmond, Va.:
General: I informed you by telegraph on the 12th that, in consequence of information received from General Buckner of the advance of the enemy in considerable force, I had ordered forward all my available force to his support. Hardee’s division and Terry’s regiment have arrived here and in advance. Our force may be estimated at 12,000 men. Correct returns cannot be obtained until after a better organization. Two Tennessee regiments (Stanton’s, from Overton County, and one from Union City) are? yet to arrive, and may reach this [place] in two or three days, and give an increase of about 2,000 men.
I cannot expect immediately any additional force under the call of last month on the governors of Tennessee and Mississippi. The men will doubtless present themselves promptly at the rendezvous, but I

cannot suppose any considerable portion will be armed. When I made the call I hoped that some might come armed. I cannot now conjecture how many will do so. The call was made to save time, and in the hope that by the time they were organized and somewhat instructed the Confederate Government would be able to arm them.
As at present informed, I think the best effort of the enemy will be made on this line, threatening perhaps at the same time, the communications between Tennessee and Virginia, covered by Zollicoffer, and Columbus from Cairo by the river and Paducah by land, and maybe a serious attack on one or the other; and for this their command of the Ohio and all the navigable waters of Kentucky and better means of land transportation gives them great facilities of concentration.
As my forces at neither this nor either of the other points threatened are more than sufficient to meet the force in front, I cannot weaken either until the object of the enemy is fully pronounced.
You know the efforts I anticipate from the enemy and the line on which the first blow is expected to fall and the means adoiffed by me with the forces at my disposal to meet him.
I will use all means to increase my force, and spare no exertion to render it effective at every point, but I cannot assure you that this will be sufficient, and if re-enforcements from less endangered or less important points can be spared, I would be glad to receive them.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Saltpeter, the article chiefly needed for its manufacture, is now being delivered in increasing quantities from the mines in Arkansas, but the wTork does not go on as it might, nor will it until the Government makes a contract with parties of capital and character to furnish a supply of manufactured powder.
I strongly urge the making of a contract for powder with a company, to be headed by Mr. Sam. Tate, of Memphis. This company can be made up of the best men in West Tennessee, who would go into the matter for the sake of the cause, and would furnish the best guarantee for an abundant supply that could be presented. I am greatly in want of powder, and urge this mode of relief on the Government.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : General Johnston directs you to hasten the armament of the works at Port Donelson and the obstructions below the place at which a post was intended. The operations of the enemy on the Tennessee show that the necessity of interrupting the Cumberland is urgent; and he reminds you that Island No. 10 should be occupied by at least a regiment, aud that, as the men are to be occupied chiefly in working the guns, a regiment not fully armed should be selected.
The regiment that was sent across the river to strengthen that of Colonel Tappan was not intended to be permanently detached, but only to remain until the works were sufliciently advanced, or until in your opinion it could be safely withdrawn.
As soon as the whole of General Hardee’s regiments are dispatched, send forward to this place the regiment designated by you from Union City.
The general has been informed that the experiments made with the torpedo at Memphis have been very successful. Should you on inquiry find this to be the case, you are authorized to employ them to any extent necessary on the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers.
For the present don’t move the regiment from Fort Henry. The men are accustomed to the guns; new ones might not be efficient. Respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. W. MACKALL, Assistant Adjutant- General.

Headquarters Central Division of Kentucky,
Boicling Green, Ky., October 17, 1861.
Col. S. S. Stanton:
Sir : General Johnston directs me to send you the following instructions:
With your own regiment, Colonel Murray’s regiment, the cavalry, and such armed militia as you can induce to join you, you will break up all the Lincoln camps which threaten the citizens of Tennessee and the southern-rights men of Southern Kentucky. Your own judgment must to a great extent dictate the best mode of accomplishing this object. From the position I understand you to occupy at this time, I suggest that you proceed first to break up Frame’s camp, on Indian Creek. After accomplishing that, you will next proceed to disperse the camps at Burkesville and Albany. In order to accomplish this without any considerable risk, it will be necessary to employ the entire force which has been placed under your orders. The object of General Johnston is to remove from the frontier of Tennessee the occasion of the apprehensions now existing in the minds of the citizens. In order to meet with success, you must move with all the rapidity possible, thus preventing any large collections of the enemy. As your expedition will continue longer than was contemplated in your last instructions, you may find it necessary to make contracts for supplies for your forces. You are authorized to do this through the quartermaster’s and subsistence departments. As soon as these orders are executed, you will proceed with your own regiment in the most expeditious way to obey your previous order to move to Bowling Green, marching well to the southward. Upon leaving, you will place the rest of the command under the orders of Colonel Murray, and direct him to station it in such positions as will best insure the protection of the border. Accompanying this is a copy of my former instructions and of an order directed to you and Colonel Murray in reference to granting furloughs.

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk:
Sir : Inclosed jfiease find a letter which I received early this morning from Colonel MacGavoek, at Dover, the contents of which I have telegraphed to you as well as to Governor Harris.
My picket reports this morning that three gunboats are 30 miles below the fort, so stated to them by Mr. Marbry, who lives 6 miles below. I dispatched Lieutenant Gibson, mounted, to ascertain facts, but he has not yet returned. Under existing circumstances I could send but one company to Fort Donelson, and artillerists I have none to spare $ not near enough to man the guns at this tort. It is to be regretted that Captain Taylor and Lieutenant Stankiurez only have experience in gunnery ; their men have none.
My urgent request to headquarters at Nashville to recruit the artillery company at this post to its full strength has not been complied with; neither has my demand for a company of cavalry, so indispensable for this post for vedettes and scouting, and to communicate with Fort Donelson and the telegraph ofiice at Danville.

On the 6th of August last I reported at length to General Foster in regard to the defenses of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, and stated that nothing could prevent the enemy from ascending both rivers at the same time when the latter river is navigable. Both rivers are up now and rising rapidly. With your permission will by to-morrow's mail report to you more fully.
Your obedient servant,
A. HEIMAN, Colonel, Commanding.
P. s.—Since writing the above I have received the general’s letter of the loth, by Captain Ellis. The regiment is already encamped in the rear of the fort.
Nashville, October 17,1861. Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, ColumbuS) Ky. :
1 beg leave to draw your attention to the defenseless condition of the Cumberland River. From here to Smithland there are not 300 soldiers in arms. One small fort—Donelson—3 miles below the town of Dover, with four guns, is all we have to rely on.
On yesterday Lieutenant Dixon took from Clarksville the four 32-pounder guns I obtained in Memphis three weeks ago for Fort Donelson, and this day Governor Harris has ordered one artillery conqiaily to go to Fort Donelson immediately.
Lieutenant-Colonel MacGavock, now in command there, telegraphs to Governor Harris of this date that 300 men were on yesterday landed in Eddy ville from the gunboats of the enemy, and that there was water enough for them to pass the shoals, and, to make the matter worse, it has been raining all night last night and nearly all day to-day. We are in actual danger of being invaded and without any means of defense. The four 32-pounder guns cannot yet be put in battery, nor are there now any soldiers there who know anything about artillery service. Wood, Lewis. & Co. have very valuable property on the river a few miles above Fort Donelson—the Cumberland Rolling Mills—now engaged in manufacturing iron for the Confederate States, which could be destroyed any night. Its machinery could not be reinstated now, and the public loss would be irreparable. The bridge at Clarksville over the Cumberland River could also be destroyed, which would sever all connection with West Tennessee, and this loss could not be repaired at a cost of $200,000. If the river keeps up Nashville itself is not safe..
Colonel MacGavock telegraphs for two companies of cavalry and one company of artillery and one regiment of infantry. Can you not spare a regiment for Fort Donelson immediatelyNo time is to be lost, in my opinion. When I saw you in Columbus I was impressed with the danger that threatened us, and so expressed myself to you. I am now more fully impressed with [the] danger, and cannot too urgently urge you to send prompt relief to us.
It seems to be the idea that Paducah is not to be assailed by our army. If that be so, there is nothing to prevent the enemy from harassing us on this and the Tennessee Rivers, both of which are now in fine boating order.
Truly, your friend,
G. A. HENRY.

Fort Henry is situated, on the east bank of Tennessee Eiver, about 1

mile north of the offset in the boundary line of the State on its western extension. It is 20 miles below Danville, where the Memphis, Louisville and Nashville Railroad crosses the Tennessee, and 60 miles above Paducah. The river at this point is 1,260 feet wide. It is a bastion fort, inclosing an area of a little over 3 acres. The ditch surrounding it is 20 feet in width, with an average depth of 10 feet, making the height of parapet from the bottom of the ditch about 18 feet. The line of parapet is 2,270 feet.
Its armament consists at present of six 32-pounders, two 12-pounders, and one 6-pounder field piece.
Four of the 32-pounders range down the river, and the fifth may be brought to bear when a boat passes the channel between the island and the bank, which is a distance of about 1J miles. Should a boat be able to run close to the bank in high water, this gun would have a very uncertain range.
The head of the island is 1J miles from the fort. The island is 1 mile in length and about 350 feet in width, and is heavily timbered. The channel is 700 feet in width. The chute between the island and the Kentucky shore is not navigable except the river is very high.
The valley in which the fort is situated is parallel with the river, about 7 miles in length and from J to 1J miles in breadth, excepting one point north of the fort If miles, where the valley is narrowed by projecting spurs to about 350 yards.
The hills on the east outlying this valley have a steep acclivity to a height of 80 to 100 feet in a horizontal distance of 300 feet. These hills are spurs from a dividing ridge distant from the bank of the river from 3^ to 6 miles. This ridge is about 350 feet above low water, and divides the waters of the Tennessee from the Cumberland River.
The hills of the greatest elevation fronting upon the river are south of the fort about 3 miles and distant from the river about 1 mile. Two hills within If miles from the fort attain the height of 220 feet above the crest of the parapet, but owing to the heaviness of the timber between them and the fort, they can be of little advantage to an enemy.
There is also a ridge northeast of the fort, about 3,000 feet distant, with an elevation of 60 feet above the parapet, which furnishes an effective basis of operations if the fort should be attacked by land forces. From low-water mark to high-water mark is about 56 feet $ the rise of water from an average stage to high-water mark is 44 feet.
At the high stage of the river the water backs up into Panther Creek on the north and Lost Creek on the south 2f miles, and at this stage the lower part of the fort is not free from overflow, being 7 feet 6 inches lower than the highest part. The leading roads begin to ascend the hills in about half a mile from the river, and are generally located on the summits of the ridges, are gravelly, and generally very good.
This is the topography around the fort on the east bank (Tennessee side) of the river.
On the west bank of the river (Kentucky side) the valley extends northwards to the mouth of Blood River, about 9 miles from the fort, and to the southward only about 1J miles.
The hills outlying this valley are distant from the river at the south only 80 yards, just opposite the fort only 700 yards, and thence recede to a general distance of J to 1 mile.
The hill abutting on the river on the south side of the fort and on the west bank is distant from the fort 1,500 yards and is 170 feet above the crest of the parapet. Across the summit of this hill runs the dividing line between Tennessee and Kentucky. About | of a mile north of

this hill and about 1 mile from and immediately opposite the fort, is a hill 250 feet above the crest of the parapet, from which a spur projects to a distance of 3,000 feet from the fort, with an elevation of 80 feet, which, from its flanking position and the nature of the ground, may be easily fortified.
These hills I consider the really dangerous points, and proper batteries placed on them will certainly command the fort.
Should the enemy attempt an invasion of the State by ascending simultaneously the Cumberland and Tennessee Kivers with a large force, these points, being within 20 miles of the railroad leading from Louisville and Nashville to Memphis, should be occupied by our troops in order to maintain our position here.
I have at present for the defense of this fort my own regiment, with an aggregate of 820 men, Captain Taylor’s company of artillery, with an aggregate of 50 men. I have repeatedly requested that the company of artillery be recruited to its full strength. In its present condition there are not men enough to work all the guns at the same time and to properly arm the fort. Four 12-pounders are necessary in addition to the guns now here, particularly if we have to defend it against a land force.
Whether a gunboat can pass Fort Henry depends greatly upon the skill and efficiency of our gunners. A boat coming within the range of our guns 1^ miles below the fort will get out of their range as soon as it passes the fort, as none of our guns have a range up the river; their range, too, is unreasonably short for 32-pounders, which must be caused by inferiority of powder, and perhaps by the balls having too much windage.
If the enemy’s gunboats should succeed in passing Fort Henry, two hours’ run will take them to Danville, and there is nothing to prevent the destruction of the railroad bridge.
Again I beg leave to call the attention of the general to the indispensable necessity of having a company of cavalry at this post for the purpose of communicating with the railroad and telegraph at Danville, to act as pickets and scouts in every direction from Fort Henry, that we may be apprised of the enemy’s approach either by land or water, and to communicate between this post and Fort Donelson.
The defenses on the Cumberland have so far been almost entirely overlooked. It is true a little fort was constructed 1 mile below Dover by my regiment, in which were placed two 32-pounder sea-coast howitzers, which have a very good range down the river, but from the hemmed-in position of this work it is entirely worthless.
To hold the place against even a small force would require a great deal of additional work on the crest of a ridge which immediately overlooks this work, called a fort.
This post was entirely abandoned until within the last few weeks, when it was occupied by three companies lately organized by Lieutenant-Colonel MacGavock, of my regiment, whom I detailed for that purpose. This force has not yet been armed, except with such guns as they could furnish themselves—mostly shot-guns. As I have learned within the last few days, other companies will be added to this command, to raise it, if possible, to a full regiment.
No artillery force whatsoever is there; but I have detached Lieutenant Watts, of Captain Taylor’s company, to instruct such men of the companies there to serve the guns as may be best fitted for that purpose. I have since learned that two more 32-pounders are to be placed at that point.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
Lieutenant-Colonel MacGavock is in command there at present, and requested me to send a detachment of artillery from Captain Taylor’s company, which is impossible, for reasons stated above, and because of the report lately received here that the gunboats are now in the Tennessee River ; and believing that no enemy ascending the Cumberland would leave Fort Donelson in its rear, and nothing as yet having been done for land defenses at that point, I have no confidence in its efficiency. I was also informed by Captain Hayden, Corps of Engineers, that Captain Harrison, of Nashville, is at Fort Donelson with two steamers and six barges, loaded with wood and stone, to be sunk at Ingram’s Shoals, 35 miles below Dover, for the purpose of obstructing the navigation of the river—by whose authority I know not ; but, if I may express my opinion on the subject, I beg leave to state that this will be a fruitless operation in a river which rises from low-water mark at least 57 feet, and which I myself have often known to rise at least 10 feet in 24 hours. The general will perceive that these obstructions are no impediment to navigation in high water, and it may cost an immense sum to remove them.
Dover is 105 miles below Nashville, 90 miles above Smithland, and 40 miles below Clarksville, where the Memphis, Louisville and Clarksville Railroad crosses the Cumberland; and, if the enemy passes Dover in gunboats, nothing prevents the destruction of the railroad bridge at Clarksville, and Clarksville, and even the capital of the State, is in immediate peril.
I have been informed that it is contemplated to build a fortification at Line Port, 15 miles below Dover, and above the most important iron works on the Cumberland River, and of course will afford no protection to them.
Fearing that I have already trespassed too much upon the valuable time of the general, I beg leave to call attention to only one other subject, which is the means of communication between Fort Henry and Danville. The steamer Florence, which now runs between these points, is inadequate to the transportation of either freight or troops, and will not, as I am informed by the captain, continue here longer than the first of next month. If the steamer Samuel Orr is still under your command, I would respectfully suggest that it would be a proper boat to run between Fort Henry and the bridge, being very fleet, with sufficient capacity for the transportation of either freight or troops.

Brig. Gen. S. B. Buckner, C. S. A.:
Sir : Your dispatch of 17th was not received until the evening of yesterday. At 6 o’clock this morning the detachment moved. I had some difficulty in responding to the call for mounted men, as Ca})tain Meriwether was out on a scouting expedition, and I had as recruits only 27 armed men. My enlisted squads are out recruiting on large promises of arms and men. I sent the 27; enough doubtless. My command, after furnishing nurses for the sick, is reduced to a battalion. It appears that every man in my camp will directly be down with measles. The thought of a movement in my present condition is idle. 1 am not more than able to patrol the town.
In relation to the movements of the enemy at Eddyville I have reliable information. The gunboat steamed up to the town and steamed back again. A company or squad of 25 cavalry from Smith land marched within 4 miles of Eddyville, took all the double-barreled guns they could find, robbed some women of their jewelry, seized several

horses and mules, destroyed some property, insulted some women, captured one citizen as prisoner, and returned to Smithland, from whence they came. I now have spies at Smithland, and will be advised daily of all movements. The enemy have at that place COO troops and are fortifying at a hill in rear of the town. No immediate movement of the enemy in force up Cumberland need be apprehended, yet a force for defense at Fort Donelson is certainly necessary.
The cloud looks most ominous for immediate injury in the direction of Henderson. On the 17th 100 cavalry, supported by 250 infantry, marched from Henderson within 11 miles of Madisonvillc, took some prisoners, burnt a house or two, as I am informed, stole some horses, and are now encamped at Nebo, 12 miles from Madisonvillc.
In Livingston and Caldwell the enemy are seizing every horse and mule and driving off every animal tit for rations that they can find, besides taking prisoners daily. Our mutual friend Wallace, who was at your camp on the morning after your arrival at this place, is of the number arrested. It would be an easy task with a small army to read some valuable lessons in that direction.
I had a courier aiid spy to return to-day from a searching visit northward. He reports at Owensborough 400 troops, mostly cavalry, about 50 wagons, and 200 extra horses 5 at Henderson, 1,700 infantry, 50 cavalry, with a large and increasing amount of transportation 5 at Calhoun, 600, mostly cavalry, 60 wagons, and two 6-pounder guns; at Hartford, the spy takes the word of a friend whom he thinks reliable, that there are 500 infantry, a few cavalry, and about 50 wagons; summing up something over 3,000 troops, well equipped, who shift from one post to another, and when moving steal everything that they meet and take everything valuable that they can carry.
I have just received from Clarksville two 9-pounder pieces and one 6-pounder piece, with 50 rounds of fixed ammunition; no caissons; carriages out of fix, but can soon have them ready. I could obtain howitzer, but have no carriage. At this post there should be supplies of tents and camp equipage. It discourages troops to have to lie out until the slow process of requisition from Bowling Green or Nashville is worked out. Apothecary supplies should also be sent, as when a company comes the requirements of medical treatment will not await the requisition.
I scarcely know what to do about an artillery company. I can form one—have it partly formed—but hearing that a company of artillery is coming, without knowing anything of their purpose, do not know but that they are for the pieces which I have. I have written to know if I should buy horses; not being answered, I fear to proceed further.
I this evening received your reply to my note asking the appointment of N. S. Cumings [f] as quartermaster, and C. S. Severson as commissary or assistant quartermaster. I11 reply to your suggestion I have to state that my command has been mustered into service, except some hospital patients. Major Hewett fell sick and did not finish these. He has promised to return on Monday, when the last one will be mustered in. This being done, the cause for my continuance no longer exists in force sufficient to detain me. I wish to leave for Mississippi, and ask your permission to fix the 27th instant as the day for my departure. This post is an important one, and should not be commanded by one who has not the confidence or is distasteful to the Government at Biehmond. My service as brigadier-general of Mississippi is due that State only. If the Confederate Government wished me, I would be appointed. This not being done, I am an intruder. My self-respect,

my own honor, is dearer to me than country or life itself. The hope of being able to make an early movement has lured me; that hope dissipated, common decency requires me to leave this command. Besides, to stay here and labor and toil as I do, struggling with disease and death, to be superseded presently, or, if continued, to be a mere interloper, a nondescript, every impulse of my nature says, “No; death first.” My command will complain, but this will soon be hushed, for now they are bound. I shall leave with them my son, a captain of a company, as hostage that my heart is with them.
In conclusion, I thank you most sincerely for the kind manner in which you have treated me since my return to my native heath, and beg that you will have some one to take my command, if not before, on the day indicated. Do not neglect this, I beg you.

The last and best information we have of the enemy in front of you was received from a gentleman who arrived yesterday. It is this, that Camp Dick Robinson contains 10,000 men, 4,000 of them being advanced towards Cumberland Gap, but to what distance our informant could not tell. This advance is under Garrard. He was satisfied that, in addition to these troops, there were 10,000 of the enemy dotted from point to point on the line from Camp Dick Robinson to Cincinnati. Colonels Stanton and Murray are ordered and supposed to be engaged dispersing a Union force at Tompkinsville, Burkesville, and along that point.

Col. W. W. Mackall :
Sir : On the arrival at this place of two regiments of Mississippi State troops, I found that they had not yet been mustered into the Confederate service. They were under the command of Brig. Gen. J. L. Alcorn, of Mississippi. At my request, he consented to retain the command of the two regiments, which I organized temporarily into a brigade, until they were mustered into the service. In making this request I consulted what .1 am still convinced was the best interests of the service. General Alcorn deservedly holds a high place in the estimation of his soldiers and has rendered me valuable assistance. The manner in which he has discharged the delicate duties which have been assigned him in the district of country west of here, and of which he was formerly a citizen, has contributed very much to the success of our cause, and I hope will entitle him to be continued in the command as a brigadier-general after the regiments shall have been received into the Confederate service. Brigadier-General Alcorn has continued in command at Hopkinsville from motives of patriotic duty and as a personal favor to me.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. B. BUCKNEB, Brigadier-General, C. S. Army.

Sir : I am instructed by General Johnston to say that his order to you was based on the great deficiency in and the great necessity for organization of this army corps; but, on other reflections, this must yield to other considerations and be effected by other means.
The backward movement from Green Biver might, and probably would, be interpreted by the enemy into a retreat, and if it did not encourage them to a move in rapid advance, would discourage our friends and elate our enemies in Kentucky. He therefore asserts [revokes?] it.
He desires you to maintain yourself in observation of Green Biver, disposing of the forces now with you so as, in your judgment, will best

Headquarters,
Gamp Hopkinsville, October 21, 1801. Brig. Gen. S. B. Buckner, C. S. A., Bowling Green, Ky. :
Sir : I had the honor to send you dispatch this morning. The gunboat Conestoga passed up to Canton or Linton Saturday, took 1,000 barrels of flour, and passed down again Sunday, I suppose to Smithland. Jackson’s force at Owensborough is increasing; has 800 or 400 cavalry constantly scouring the country around him. Our friends are suffering greatly. Jackson is receiving large supplies of small-arms, Minie muskets, Colt’s and Enfield rifles ; three steamboats, as my spy says, are now discharging at that place; munitions are being sent in quantities to Hartford from Calhoun. The enemy is active, and unless you can move soon in that direction, the pork, bacon, wheat, all subsistence upon which we rely in that direction, will be lost to us. A movement to Madisonville, Calhoun, Henderson, and Owensborough promptly made would give us the whole country. If this cannot be done, then the country will be a barren treasure when acquired.
The Kentuckians still come in small squads. I have induced the most of them to go in for the war. This requires about three speeches a day. When thus stirred up, they go almost to a man. Since I have found that I can’t be a general, I have turned recruiting agent and sensation speaker for the brief period that I shall remain. By all means supplies and equipments, if any are to be had, should be sent to this post. I now have about 250 war men, without arms, camp equipage, or anything else. My quartermaster is out of money, and can’t obtain it, except on personal security. At Kashville he obtained $7,000, of which I advised you, in this way: happening to meet a responsible acquaintance in that city. This, I submit, ought to be a post or it ought not. Major Hewett has returned. My command is now mustered into the service, except about 60 sick at Clarksville, who will not muster in (although I have written them) until they see me. When I can see them, they will muster in. I can do this as I return home. I know they will do as I say.
Let me impress upon you the necessity of sending a competent officer to command this post; the senior colonel is disqualified; the army will be demoralized under his command; he is clever enough, but is indolent, and requires to be looked after. I had about as soon be shot as to leave here, but would rather be shot than remain a hermaphrodite in the service. I have a young man now under arrest for making or using threatening and abusive language on the streets towards myself and the army; among other things, that lie intended to shoot myself. Such language should not be permitted, and I shall, unless I find imprisonment at hard labor sufficient to suppress it, make some examples of severity that will be sufficient for the purpose. It is openly avowed that our indulgence results from our conscious weakness. The course

of indulgence pursued you will find must be changed; sooner or later it must be changed. This you will find ; I think the sooner the better. I don’t think I am disposed to tyranny, but a sensible, firm, efficacious, decisive, and prompt authority is necessary to the occasion. I make suggestions, believing that I may do so without offense 5 always obedient, however, to my superiors.
I hope you will pardon my liberty with you in thus writing to you direct rather than through the adjutant, as my correspondence is not intended to be classified as reports.
Bespectfully, yours, &c.,
J. L. ALCORN,
Br igadier- General.
Headquarters Western Department,
Bowling Green, October 22, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant.
Since the reception of your instructions by telegram on the 11th instant, directing me to draw no more commissary stores from the depot at Nashville, I have conformed to them, and am now taking measures to purchase in open market or by contract all the flour, beef, pork, and forage necessary to supply the troops here, and if there should be a surplus of those items of the rations, to secure that for other corps. There is, however, an embarrassment in the accomplishment of this object, from the refusal of the farmers for their flour, &c., of any but gold or Kentucky paper money. While private dealers comply with their demands, we are unable to do so. We have only Confederate or Tennessee paper. We are at present without money in the subsistence department, and I submit to you to judge and decide if it would not be better to procure coin, gold or silver, for the present, until in the progress of trade our paper could obtain currency. This result, I think, would occur if the restrictions of the law prohibiting the importation of certain productions uexcept by seaports” could be removed so far as to allow the introduction of certain articles, except cotton and military stores, of absolute necessity, in the district of country occupied by our troops. It might first be tried for specified productions of the South under special license.
It is necessary that the money for the purchase of supplies should be remitted as early as possible, and I desire that it be deposited in some bank in Nashville, to the credit of Oapt. T. K. Jackson, chief commissary at my headquarters, who, for the responsible duties that devolve upon him, should be appointed brigade commissary in the Provisional Army. He was an officer of the United States Army and a graduate of West Point.
Nashville is the most proper place for the accumulation of supplies for this army corps. I shall therefore establish a depot at that point for supplies, under my control, separate from the one under charge of Captain Shaaff, leaving him subject only to the orders of the Commissary-General, which will prevent confusion and better divide the labor.
In making the call for troops, I asked from the governors of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas respectively as follows: Tennessee, 30,000; Mississippi, 10,000; Arkansas, 10,000; confining my call strictly to those States. The call upon Mississippi was small compared with that on Tennessee, as only a part of that State is within the limits of

my department. I had no means of ascertaining the relative proportion of troops furnished before by each State, nor was I aware that instructions had been given Major-General Polk to refrain from making further calls upon Mississippi. I was desirous that the furnishing of the quotas should operate as little onerously as possible upon the several States of this department. The Stites, as far as I knew, had previously furnished troops promptly to meet the exigencies of the Government, and I did not know that there had been any considerable disparity in proportion to population. I have asked for no other troops than those from States in this department. I have accepted the services of two regiments by special authority of the War Department, and a few detached companies without any special sanction, from, I believe, Alabama, Terry’s regiment has joined. The other, De Veuve’s, [1] has not. I presume it could not be spared. I have in no instance accepted a brigade organized as such, and when they have been so offered, have replied that such acceptance would exceed toy power. (Herewith I send an extract of an answer to Governor Pettus on this subject.)
Two Mississippi regiments were ordered from Corinth to report to General Buckner. General Alcorn accompanied them, and as they had not been mustered into the service and the condition of the regiments required some one of better ability to command than either of the colonels possessed, General Alcorn was temporarily kept in command of them by General Buckner, with the understanding that General Alcorn should be relieved so soon as the regiments were mustered. General Alcorn having now reported that they have been mustered, and requested to be relieved immediately, General Tilghman, whom I intend to assign to the command of Fort Columbus as soon as the fort there is finished, will be ordered to relieve him.
My attention was at once on my arrival directed to the indispensable necessity of having correct returns. I hope soon to be able to cause accurate ones to be made and regularly forwarded to the Department.
We have received but little accession to our ranks since the Confederate forces crossed the line; in fact, no such enthusiastic demonstration as to justify any movements not warranted by our ability to maintain our own communications. It is true that I am writing from a Union county, and it is said to be different in other counties. They appear to me passive, if not apathetic. There are thousands of ardent friends to the South in the State, but there is apparently among them no concert of action. I shall, however, still hope that the love and spirit of liberty is not yet extinct in Kentucky.
The action of the legislature of Kentucky places this State in the attitude of war against the Confederate States, and the political relations existing at the time of arrival of this army corps in the State are thus entirely changed, and there is no longer any obligation to regard the neutral position this State professed the desire to preserve. The revenues may therefore rightfully be appropriated to the use of the Confederate States in any portion of the State occupied by the Confederate forces.
The legislature has levied an onerous tax for the expulsion of the Confederate forces, but as the people do not concur heartily in the object for which it was levied, I think it would be bad policy to demand the payment of it to the Confederate States. If we do, we would make ourselves the instruments of an act of oppression in enforcing the execution of an unjust law. By forbidding the payment when the time comes (the law, I understand, does not go into effect before January 1, 18G2),

tlie people would be relieved from the operation of a burdensome tax, and would probably appreciate the disinterestedness and magnanimity of the Confederate Government in abstaining from exercising an undoubted right of war, because of its injustice toward them and of our belief that the law is not sanctioned by a majority of the people.
At the time I recommended the promotion of Major Stewart and Colonel McCown to the grade of brigadier-general I was aware that Colonel Tilghman had been recommended for promotion, but presuming that his services would be required for this column, and that he would be appointed, I made no mention of his name. While on this subject 1 have to remark that the appointment of at least three competent brigadier-generals would contribute greatly to the efficiency of this army corps. As the promotion of Colonel Tilghman leaves the colonelcy of the Third Kentucky Regiment vacant, it will be necessary to appoint a colonel to that regiment, and as the lieutenant-colonel is not well qualified, as I am informed, for the command, though a man of ability and valuable to the service, the appointment should be made very soon. There are the following-named officers, formerly of the U. S. Army, here, viz: Lieut. Col. B. H. Helm; Major Cosby; Captain Lyon, a graduate of West Point, and formerly of the Third U. S. Artillery, now commanding a battery; Capt. W. N. R. Beall; Lieutenant Wickliffe, and Maj. Benjamin Anderson, of the Third Kentucky Regiment, in which the vacancy occurs, all Kentuckians.
I have already mentioned that there is no money in the hands of the commissary, and I should add that the quartermunter7s department is also destitute. The embarrassment is peculiarly felt at this time, as without it transportation, in which our troops are greatly deficient, cannot be obtained. I have been also particularly anxious to mount Terry’s Texas regiment, the services of which are much needed, but for want of ready money cannot procure the horses. Only about 350 have been bought for this regiment.*

From other sources he is led to believe that this advance is in force, and for the purpose of dividing us from the east by an attack through Cumberland Gap.
Nothing more need be presented to show you the necessity of the immediate employment of every man for the defense of the line, and to explain to you the propriety of sending your command to Knoxville instead of drawing it to this place, as was the wish and intention of the general.

He now directs you to send forward your command, now armed and organized, to Knoxville, as fast as possible, and Lave the detachments reported to General Zollicoffer as fast as they arrive at that point.
You will remain in charge of the organization of the remainder of your forces and superintendence of their movements or proceed with the advance of your command, as the interests of the force prepared and unprepared may require.
The general has seen your requisition for clothing, made on Quartermaster Stevenson. He regrets he could not have it filled. Only half the number of blankets called for by you are in store, subject to his order, for the whole of the command. A large stock on which his quartermaster counted has been diverted by the Government. He now, having shown you his deficiency in this article (and in all others the deficiency is great), begs you to limit your call to the most absolute wants of your men. He has himself, when similarly situated, found the advantage of requiring the captains when the men asked for clothing to examine into their condition, and compare that condition with the state of clothing in the company, and supply those most in want.

' Your station will be in close proximity to a country whose inhabitants are hostile to us in feeling, but you are instructed not to molest any citizen unless he may in some form assume a hostile attitude towards you, either by taking up arms, by actually inducing others to do so, or by giving information to the enemy. You will watch the village of Morgantown on your left very closely. It is probable there may be a hostile assemblage at that point. Should there be, you will break it up if you have the strength to do so. You will encourage the citizens in your vicini ty to bring their corn and provisions to this market. You will use great vigilance to prevent being surprised, and will make daily reports by couriers to these headquarters. Endeavor to establish communications with the country beyond Green River and down Green River, with a view of learning every movement of the enemy.

tain control of general officers and thus secure competency and efficiency.
There is another point connected with your proclamation calling for troops of which I was not aware at the time, and which, I fear, is going to give us great embarrassment.
From the beginning of the war we have been struggling against the enlistment of men for a less period than the war or three years. We were tolerably successful, although this policy was strongly combated in some of the States. This struggle lasted, however, only so long as the States had arms to furnish. When armed men were offered us for twelve months necessity forced their acceptance, for we were deficient in arms; but the admirable ardor of our people in defense of their rights is such, that now, when they can no longer get arms from the governors of States, they offer their services for the war if we will arm them. I have about 10,000 men now in camps of instruction awaiting arms, and am daily adding to their numbers, but in Mississippi and Tennessee your unlucky offer to receive unarmed men for twelve months has played the deuce with our camps. I have just heard from Hon. Wiley P. Harris, a member of Congress from Mississippi, that several war regiments, nearly completed, have been broken up, and the men are tendering themselves for twelve months.
There is this unfortunate result also : We are on the eve of winter. These men will be in camp four or five months, fed and paid by us, transported at great cost, provided with clothing, and then, when fairly able to do us service, we shall have to muster them out and transport them back home at great expense. However, 1 need not dilate to a man of your military knowledge on the vast advantage of war enlistments over those for twelve months.
Now our Treasury is sorely pressed, and I want to avoid the very heavy drain that will be caused by accumulating all these twelvemonths’ men, whose term of service may possibly expire without our ever arming them, for we shall certainly give arms on all occasions to the war volunteers in preference. Of course I want to avoid every appearance also of running counter to your measures. It occurs to me, therefore, that all further embarrassments will be best avoided by some proclamation from yourself, in which you could announce that you were now satisfied that the people of Kentucky were prepared to take up arms in defense of their liberties in much greater numbers than you had anticipated, and that it was no longer necessary to appeal to her sister States of the South, &c. I beg you will act promptly in this or some other manner, as shall seem to you best, to get rid of the twelve-months’ unarmed men, and I will engage to furnish you as many for the war as you can arm. It is not men we lack, but muskets.
In the mean time I inclose you a copy of a circular letter prepared by me, which will put you in possession of our policy about accepting troops, &c., so that we may preserve uniformity and regularity in all our movements.
I am, with great regard, yours, truly,

are but five regiments being organized at the present time in the State of Arkansas; that said regiments are forming under a requisition from General McCulloch; that said regiments are being but slowly filled. I understood from Governor Bector that General A. S. Johnston had made a requisition on him for ten regiments; that he telegraphed General Johnston to know if the ten regiments called for were independent of the five regiments previously called for by General McCulloch; that no answer to this inquiry had been received ; that he (Governor Bector) had made no call for volunteers under the requisition of General Johnston.

Brigade Headquarters, Huntsville, October 25,1861. Maj. W. W. Mack All, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Major: Your letter of the 22d instant, informing Brigadier General Walker that the enemy are advancing in force upon the position of General Zollicoffer, explaining the necessity of the employment of every man for the defense of the line, and directing this command, so far as it may be armed and organized, to be sent forward to Knoxville as fast as possible, has been received, and he instructs me to answer that he immediately, on its receipt, replied by telegraph, in general terms, informing General Johnston of his unarmed condition and the impossibility of rendering any immediate aid in the direction of Knoxville. But he desires to state more fully the attendant facts, so that his position may be the better appreciated. Before leaving Bichmond he obtained from the Ordnance Bureau assurance of a sufficient number of arms for the three regiments assigned to his command, composing the Alabama quota towards the reserved army corps called for by the President. But these arms were afterwards diverted by the Government. He has since then dispatched in all directions—to Bichmond, Lynchburg, Charleston,’ Savannah, Yew Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, Holly Springs, and to other points, wherever he thought arms might be procured—but with little success. He has sent special messengers to LaGrange, Memphis, Yew Orleans, Lynchburg and Bichmond, but, so far, with very limited results. One hundred and sixty stand of arms, chiefly muskets without bayonets, are all that have been positively secured, with promises of a few hundred in addition that have not yet arrived.
As a last resort he has dispatched to the President direct, asking the favorable interposition of his authority with the Ordnance Office) and has assumed the responsibility of making contracts with manufacturers, through which he hopes to be supplied within ten days with 1,000 country rifles, rebored for the Minie ball, adapted to the percussion-cap, and fitted with the saber bayonet. In connection with this last movement he has requested authority to employ agents to purchase up in the country old rifles and muskets to be similarly treated, and, if countenanced, has good assurance that he may be able ultimately to arm his entire command.
From this statement he hopes it will satisfactorily appear that all has been done in respect to arms that could have been done. As last as he arms a detachment it will be sent forward to Knoxville, unless otherwise ordered. He has in camp near by two regiments and an

unorganized battalion of five companies, and two other regiments he expects here in the course of the next week. These four regiments have been much thrown back by measles and other camp diseases, but only a few of the men have died, and the companies are being rapidly filled up again. The whole, save the unorganized battalion, are quite well exercised in battalion movements, although deficient in the manual by reason of the want of guns. With the arrival of the two additional regiments mentioned, exercises of the line will be immediately forwarded. With regard to requisitions for clothing he wishes to say, that in the requisitions made he limited himself, according to his judgment, to the absolute wants of his men, and deeply regrets the inability of Quartermaster Stevenson to supply his demand. He will, however, act upon the suggestion contained in the concluding paragraph of your letter, and cause his company officers to examine into the condition of their men asking for clothing, and to compare that condition with the state of clothing in the company and to supply those most in want.

More than 100 persons have been arrested in East Tennessee, without warrants in some cases, marched great distances, and carried into court on no other charge than that they were Union men. In one case an old man named Duggan, a Methodist preacher, was arrested, carried 50 miles on foot—he a large, fleshy man—refused the privilege of riding his own horse, and all they had against him was that in February last he prayed for the Union. If that is a good charge, about two-thirds of the people of the State are liable in the same way, as at that time they voted G2,000 majority for the Union.
I have spent much time this summer and fall in trying to conciliate the people of East Tennessee. I thought I had succeeded. Just as the people were quieting down, getting reconciled, raising volunteers, &c., they commenced these arrests, which have gone far to poison the minds of the people against the Government, and if tolerated and persisted in, the people of that end of the State at a critical moment will rise up enemies instead of friends.
You ask me who makes these arrests. As far as I can learn they are instigated by a few malicious, troublesome men in and about Knoxville. I always hear the names of W. G. Swan, William Churchwell, John Crogier, Crozier Bamsey, and a postmaster at Knoxville mixed up with these matters. It is said these men have private griefs and malice to gratify, and they aim to bring down the avenging arm of the Government to satiate their passions. Crozier Bamsey is the attorney-general. It is said he in most cases causes the arrests and makes the affidavit. Just think of this—an attorney degrading himself by turning an affidavit man.
You may inquire, what is the remedy? I answer, turn out Bamsey. Put some man in Middle or West Tennessee in his place who has dignity and character. Turn out the postmaster at Knoxville. If the President will then make it known to all officials that he discountenances all frivolous arrests, things will quiet down. If, however, he refuses to do this, retains Bamsey, then we may look for great trouble in that end of the State. If the President will write Landon C. Haynes, Senator-elect, and any other respectable men in East Tennessee, he will be at no loss what course to pursue.
i address this to you to be certain the President will get it and receive attention.
Very respectfully,
BOBEBTSON TOPP.

The enemy profess to be advancing towards Cumberland Gap, but may turn towards Jamestown or Wheeler’s Gap. General Zollicoffer is falling back to Cumberland Ford. I have ordered seven companies of cavalry to Jamestown—all I could spare. There ought to be sufficient re-enforcements sent to Jamestown and a force to Wheeler’s Gap immediately. No troops here that can be spared.
W. 3. WOOD,
Colonel, Commanding Post.
Headquarters Western Department,
Bowling Green, October 27, 1861.
General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General C. 8. Army:
General : I have the honor to inclose for your information an abstract return showing the present organization of the force here.* You will observe that besides the division commanders, Major-General Hardee and Brigadier-General Buckner, there is but one brigadier-general (Hindman). I had the honor in a recent communication to the Secretary of War to suggest the appointment of three brigadier-generals. I now, in addition to those, recommend three others. The appointment of competent officers to these grades would contribute very greatly to the effectiveness of the force. I have organized a reserve, consisting of a regiment of cavalry, one of infantry, and a battery. In order that it should have the full effect of such a body, it should be thoroughly instructed and well commanded. There is no one available who, in my opinion, has higher qualifications for that position than Major Hawes. I therefore recommend that he be appointed a brigadier-general. I also recommend for the same grade Col. J. C. Brown, of Third Tennessee Regiment: His regiment is in excellent condition; its thorough instruction and discipline is a commendation indicating that he will make an efficient commander of a brigade.
Lieutenant Wright is in the performance of most responsible duties of his department (ordnance), requiring a superior knowledge and skill, which he possesses in an eminent degree, and I do not doubt that the interest of the service would be promoted by his appointment to a higher grade. It is difficult to find any assistant for him who does not rank him. I am making every effort to be ready for operations as soon as possible. I hope soon to provide sufficient transportation to give all desirable mobility to this corps. We are quite deficient at present.
The enemy seem to design to operate on at least three lines in Kentucky : One against Zollicoffer, on the route to Cumberland Gap, which can be turned by Walker’s and Jamestown Gaps; another on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, confronting the troops here, and the other against Polk, and will, perhaps, endeavor to use the Tennessee River in aid of the movement. They have, besides the other places on the Ohio with which you are acquainted, occupied Henderson and Owens-borough in considerable force, and have detachments of 300 or 400 at Calhoun and Hartford.
Zollieoffer’s force is insufficient. I estimate it under 8,000. I have not the means to re-enforce him. He has authority to order to join him troops from Knoxville if any armed have assembled at the rendezvous. I have ordered General Walker to join him with his division of four

regiments, but he replies that his command is unarmed. Colonel Wood, at Knoxville, informs me that he has sent seven companies to Jamestown.
I hoped by this time to have placed under General Polk’s command a sufficient number of men for the defense of the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland, but so far, for want of arms, of which the country seems quite destitute, there has been no very considerable addition to the force under his command under the call I made upon Tennessee and other States. I have sent Major Gilmer to make an examination at Clarksville and Kashville, with the design of constructing works of defense at both places. Many pieces of cannon will be needed for the works, and an estimate will be prepared and forwarded as soon as he returns. I hope as soon as we can get ready to make up by activity for our deficiency in number. We have still here, and among all the troops elsewhere, a large number of men sick with measles.
Respectfully,

General, G. 8. Army.

Sir: This will be handed you by Mr. Hillman, with whom I have talked freely on points of great interest to us all. He will give you facts connected with events now thickening fast around us that I am sure will be of service. His high character and warm devotion to our cause are guarantees for all he may communicate.
I have been detained here to-day, i>reparing matters to aid my organization at Hopkinsville, where I learn a vast deal of suffering exists, owing to the exposed condition of men. I have made arrangements to put 200 women to work on clothing, and hope for a contribution of blankets and clothing from the society at this place. I regret deeply to hear of the condition of things at Hopkinsville, but hope to overcome them. I am sorry also to hear of the inefficient condition of things at Fort Donelson. I fear our interests there are well-nigh beyond our control.

Fort Henry, Tennessee River,
October 28, 1861.
Capt. E. D. Blake,
Acting Assistant Adjutant- General:
Sir: Lieutenant-Colonel MacGavock, in command at Fort Donelson, notified me on Friday last that the expedition to obstruct the navigation of the Cumberland at Ingram’s Shoals would be ready to leave that place Saturday evening, 26th, under the command of Colonel Haynes, who was sick. I immediately proceeded to Dover, and finding Colonel Haynes unfit for duty, I directed Captain Dixon, Corps of Engineers, to take charge of the expedition.
A squadron of cavalry of 115 men, under command of Maj. D. C. Kelly, left Fort Donelson on Friday for the Shoals, for the purpose of reconnoitering and protecting the operations.
At 3 o’clock Saturday evening the expedition left Fort Donelson, accompanied by a detachment from Captain Maney’s light artillery company, of 40 men and 4 pieces, and 2 companies of infantry (170 men), under command of Captain Young. I returned to Fort Henry yesterday, bringing with me a detachment of cavalry of 40 men of Colonel Forrest’s battalion, under command of Lieutenant Hamtrie, to be used as pickets and scouts at this post until the arrival of the company which I was informed would be ordered here.
Last night, at 12 o’clock, a messenger from Colonel MacGavock brought me the inclosed note.* I sent the messenger back immediately, with instructions to Colonel MacGavock to inform me early this morning of any further developments. The cavalry company mentioned in the note are Kentuckians.
This morning early I sent one company of my regiment, and have others ready to march at a moment’s notice should it become necessary.
I dispatched a messenger to Fort Donelson early this morning, with instructions to return immediately should his report render it necessary. I will further re-enforce Fort Donelson, and accompany the re-enforcements myself, leaving Colonel Drake, of the Fourth Mississippi Regiment, in command of this post during my absence.
The bearer of this, Lieutenant Milton, is assisting Captain Bolling in recruiting a cavalry company in Kentucky. They have now about 40 men mounted, and deeming it unsafe to remain at home, they came to this post, have offered their services for any duty that may be assigned them, and are anxious to be mustered into the service at once and armed. Being intimately acquainted with the surrounding country, this company would be a valuable acquisition to the service of this post. Please instruct me as to what shall be done with this company.
The gunboats are reported in this river, and last week they captured a steam ferry boat at Egner’s Landing, 20 miles below this point. The owner of this boat, who has been a stage contractor in the United States service, informed me that he had 36 horses for sale suitable for artillery.
If the enemy is ascending the two rivers, it may be with the object of making a feint at either place and an attack on the other, against which I will guard.

officers and privates. I was joined by Major Cox, with 75 men from his battalion of cavalry, a few miles from this place, which increased the force under my command to about 250 men.
At my first encampment, 13 miles distant, I was informed that a detachment of about 150 or 200 men, under command of Colonel Hobson, occupied the town of Green sburg. Hot deeming it prudent to proceed to Williams’ plantation without first dislodging this party, who might easily, if warned of my advance, attack me in rear, I sent a party of 10 men, under Lieutenant Owens, to reconnoiter the town and report the strength and position of the enemy. This he did in three hours, stating that he had marched through the town and conversed freely with the citizens, who informed him that a party from the enemy’s camp had been in town for several days. I then proceeded to Williams’, where his wife told me the Black Republican troops had carried away 9 of the most valuable negroes, every horse and mule on the plantation, the household furniture, besides spoiling the crops and robbing the smoke-house. At the request of Mr. Williams I brought away his niece and daughter and 6 young negroes. I learned from reliable authority that the town of Campbellsville was garrisoned by 1,800 infantry, under command of General Ward. They have also a few cavalry (probably a squadron) and two pieces of artillery (one brass and one iron, 12-pounders). A regiment of infantry, 600 strong, left that place six days ago for Columbia, where they are now quartered.
The Black Republican troops in that vicinity have oppressed and persecuted men entertaining Southern feelings with a relentlessness and rigor scarcely to be expected of a civilized enemy. Neither the property nor person of themselves or family are free from their depredations and malice. Their houses are constantly broken open and plundered; their crops laid waste; the men forced to swear allegiance to the NTorth or fly from their families and firesides. I returned to this place to-day at 1 o’clock p. m.

Brig. Gen. F. K. Zollicoffer :
General : We will start in the morning the two Parrott guns, caissons, and 40 kegs of powder. Upon inquiry, I learn that the 47 halfbarrels of powder reported by Major Bicknell have been sent to Hew Orleans, by order of General Polk ; but there are still some kegs left here, and I will send another load as soon as I can get transportation. There is great difficulty in obtaining horses and wagons. Major Jack-son and Captain Burleson are both absent. Mr. Gammon is acting for Major Jackson, and exerting himself to the utmost to procure transportation.
The news of your falling back to Cumberland Ford has had the effect of developing a feeling that has only been kept under by the presence of troops. It was plainly visible that the Union men were so elated that they could scarcely repress an open expression of their joy. This afternoon it assumed an open character, and some eight or ten of the bullies and leaders made an attack on some of my men near the Lamar House,

and seriously wounded several. Gentlemen who witnessed the whole affair say that my men gave no offense, and were not at all to blame. The affair became pretty general, and couriers were sent to me at my camp of its existence. I immediately marched Captain White’s cavalry and 100 of my men into the town to arrest the assailants, but they made their escape. The Southerners here are considerably alarmed, believing that there is a preconcerted movement amongst the'Union men, if hy any means the enemy should get into Tennessee. J. Swan told me to-night that he heard one say this evening, as Captain White’s cavalry rode through town, that u they could do so now, but in less than ten days the Union forces would be here and run them off.” I cannot well tell you the many evidences of disaffection which are manifested every day, and the increased boldness that it is assuming. I deem it, however, of sufficient importance to be on the alert, and, as there are no other forces here now but a part of my regiment and Captains Gillespie’s and White’s cavalry, I think I had better keep my men there until others arrive.
Thursday morning, 29th.
The town is quiet this morning. The men who committed the assault on my men yesterday have left town, I am informed. The cannon and ammunition start this morning, with orders to push on as rapidly as possible.

Camp Buckner, Ky., October 28,1861. Col. John P. Murray, Near Albany, Ky.:
Sir : I felt of the enemy’s intrenched camp at Rockcastle Hills, on the road from London to Mount Yernon, on the 21st instant; found the position almost a natural fortification. My information [was] that the enemy was nine regiments strong there, and large reserves between there and Cincinnati. I fell back on the 22d, and will retire to Cumberland Gap, where I have placed a number of guns in position. The Log Mountains will soon be impassable, making this position difficult to hold. If the enemy advances, the approach is likely to be by way of Jacksborough or Jamestown. So soon, therefore, as I can complete the work, strengthening the pass at the Cumberland Gap (now in a few days), I will dispose my forces so as to be ready to meet the enemy on either of the other routes.
I hope you and Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan will co-operate to watch that border, and give me early and frequent reliable intelligence.
Learning that the enemy had retired from Albany, and desiring to see that the guns were all in position at the gap, I determined to return this way.
Yery respectfully,

He should place a strong picket of cavalry, throwing forward vedettes in twos in front of his advance guard, which should be strongly posted under a mile in advance of the main body.

Col. W. W. Mackall,
Assistant Adjutant-General, &c., Bowling Green:
Sir : I lose not a moment in communicating through you to the general commanding the Western Division the condition of affairs at this post. I had hoped that the picture sketched to me of matters here might not have been realized, but I am compelled to think it not too highly colored. Under all the circumstances,.! doubt not General Alcorn has made the best of things, his camp being merely one large hospital, with scarce men enough on duty to care for the sick and maintain a feeble guard around them, with insufficient pickets at prominent points. Over one-half the entire command are on the sick list, with very grave types of different diseases. Those remaining and reported for duty have not enough really well men to do more than first stated. The Kentucky Battalion of Infantry, numbering 547, have only 45 cases reported sick. The measles have made their appearance, and the battalion will average 20 new cases per day, judging from to-day’s report. The morning brigade report, herewith inclosed, shows only 7i6 for duty out of a total of 2,237. Of this number, you will see that the Kentucky Battalion furnishes 376, one-third of whom only are armed, with no equipments.
Of cavalry we have nothing to count on, save Captain Meriwether’s company of untutored recruits. Captain Huey’s company of cavalry.is entirely unarmed. Captain Wilcox’s company not yet recovered from the Eddyville affair.

On the score of artillery I have merely to say, that there is not an organized squad for a single gun that could be taken into action. There are five pieces of artillery—two 6-pounders, two 9, one 12—none of which I think fit for service on account of the wretched manner in which they are mounted; a total ignorance of all mechanical principles evidenced in the construction of the carriages. The guns seem to be pretty fair. On the subject of clothing and equipments, equipage, &c.,-1 can only say that I find nothing more encouraging. The commissary department is pretty well suppliedj the quartermaster’s department entirely deficient.
1 have thus fairly sketched the condition of things. Major Hewett will be able to give you some particulars that I have not time now to do, but will write by the next mail. I have commenced at the root of things, and mean to work out the best result I can. I write not thus discouragingly in any spirit of complaint, but to lay before the commanding general the plain facts of the case. They are plainly these: I have no force here available for any purpose save protecting the sick and depot. I have reason to think that the enemy are in full possession of this fact, and are calculating on it. I have no force with which to operate in any direction, and our people are suffering terribly within the lines assigned me for my operations. In front and on my left they need a check. The defenses of the Cumberland cannot I believe be perfected, unmolested, unless my position is strengthened for this purpose.
A movement has taken place at Henderson. A courier reached me to-night with the inclosed paper* from a committee at Henderson. The Union men have been very busy here to-day. They are too open-mouthed, and must be checked. The stage is waiting, and I have not time to say more than this. I deem it absolutely necessary that I should as soon as possible be re-enforced. A cavalry force is indispensably necessary to cover my front and prevent the removal of a large amount of wheat, flour, corn, and hogs, now drafted daily on heavily by scouting parties. Of the latter item, there are not less than 50,000 hogs. This service would require the whole time of not less than 500 cavalry. For practical purposes I am without infantry and artillery, and desire that a due proportion of both be at once sent. I beg you to say to General Johnston that I need the assistance of some graduates, for artillery especially. Could I not have the services of the two young men mentioned by General Buckner ? (See him.) I will prepare full estimates for all my wants and forward them.
I beg you to pardon this hurried communication. I have not had time to read it over. Major Hewett will give you facts as to a landing at Eddyville by our people.

portion of the enemy’s force has advanced to London. Their force at and on this side of the Eockcastle River is reported at 9,000. There are three main roads by which, if an invasion of East Tennessee is contemplated, an enemy might approach. On this, by Cumberland Gap, we have heretofore concentrated nearly our whole force, and we now have seven guns in position at Cumberland Gap. The most westerly road is by Monticello, in Kentucky, and Jamestown, in Tennessee. The counties of Fentress, Scott, Morgan, and Anderson are poor, mountainous, and disaffected. Should a force select that route of invasion I could meet them at the mountain passes near Clinton and between Kingston and Morgan Court-House, and keep them on that broad, sterile region until it would be practicable for General Buckner to throw a force in their rear and cut them off.
In view of this danger they may select the middle route, by Williamsburg and Jacksborough. The road over the Log Mountains will soon become almost impassable between here and the Cumberland Gap. The Gap is a much stronger position than this. While I am watching the road from here to Laurel River, the enemy might be advancing on the Jacksborough or the Jamestown road without my knowledge. For these reasons I send four cavalry companies to scout on the roads from the neighborhood of Jacksborough into Kentucky, and I have ordered one infantry regiment to Jacksborough, one 6 miles east to Big Creek Gap, two about half way between Jacksborough and Cumberland Gap, while four will remain at present at Cumberland Gap. I leave six cavalry companies to observe this road. One cavalry company is posted on the road from Williamsburg, Ky., to Huntsville, Tenn., and six cavalry companies and (I suppose) Colonel Murray’s regiment of infantry are in the neighborhood of Jamestown.
It is currently reported that an invading force, from 20,000 to 30,000, is on the road from Cincinnati to East Tennessee, but I have no means of knowing anything of the accuracy of the rumor. Except cavalry scouts, my force will be withdrawn from this post to-morrow. Acting upon my best judgment, I have supposed the disposition of my forces I have described the very best under the circumstances. Had I a military engineer, in whose judgment I could rely, to reconnoiter the mountain roads, gaps, and passes from Cumberland Gap to Jamestown, I would feel much more capable of making a judicious disposition of troops. I have had rumors that re-enforcements of Confederate troops were to be thrown upon this part of the border, but as I have no official information, I take it for granted the rumors are erroneous.

F. K. ZOLLICOFFER,

Stanton were approaching Albany with their regiments, and from the best information he could get they feared an attack, and desired me to send him one company of cavalry. This morning I set [out] for Albany with 150 men; reached our destination by 12 o’clock. We found Colonel Murray with his command there, and no foe in all the country. From the best information I can get from our friends in this section, there are no organized forces in Kentucky nearer this point than Camp Goggin, in Pulaski County, on the Cumberland River, about 40 miles north of this point. There is an encampment supposed to number some 12,000 or 15,000 Home Guards, cut-throats, renegades, and thieves, under the command of Colonels Hoskins and Wolford, and my opinion is we could disperse them with a small force. Colonel Murray informed me this evening that he was moving his command to Camp Zollicoffer, Tenn. Why this strange move I cannot say, for certainly this is the pass we should guard, in a military point, with vigilance. As I have no means of communicating with General Zollicoffer except by way of Knoxville, inclosed I send you a report. Please forward.
Yours, truly,

Sir : We commence moving part of the brigade to Cumberland Gap to-day, and part of the command will be placed near Jacksborough. The road over the Log Mountains, now bad, will, I am told, soon become almost impassable. I have some reason to suppose that, if the enemy advances at all, it will be by one of the Jacksborough gaps. If Maj. A. E. Jackson, quartermaster for the brigade, has left Knoxville, forward the inclosed letter to him wherever he may be, after reading it yourself and showing it to Major Burleson, and ascertaining whether he can give me any aid with reference to the artillery horses and the horseshoes.

Colonel Heiman, Fort Henry:
Your communication by the hands of Lieutenant Milton is received. Your report of dispositions for defense of Forts Donelson and Henry are satisfactory, and I hope you will not relax your vigilance. You will have Captain Bolling’s company of cavalry mustered into service, and aid him in making requisitions for what troops he may require. Lieutenant Milton says they can supply themselves with arms. As to the horses you speak of, they should be bought by the quartermaster for artillery horses, if they are suitable for that purpose.

Sir: I am instructed by Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman to say that the enemy are assembling in considerable force upon Green River, and that he has certain and reliable information that Madisonville and a point higher up are the points upon which they intend to advance. Since his hurried letter by Major Hewett concerning the condition of the troops here, he has had reports from the different parts of his command, showing that his estimate of its inefficiency was entirely correct. There is no artillery which can be used, and re-enforcements of both infantry and cavalry are needed at once. Whilst not alarmed, the general deems

it his duty to lay these facts before General Johnston, and urge their importance upon him.
A spy has been arrested to-day with papers upon him, showing that he was not only playing that part, but also that of an enlisting officer. A court of inquiry has been ordered, which will proceed regularly, but expeditiously, to examine the matter.

Camp Buckner, October 30,1861.
Col. W. B. Wood,
Sixteenth Alabama Regiment, Knoxville, Tenn.:
Sir : Our scouts day before yesterday drove back a small party of cavalry scouts of the enemy at Laurel Bridge, and captured three prisoners, who state that the enemy are 9,000 strong near London. If they attempt an invasion of East Tennessee, it is rather probable they will move by way of the passes near Jacksborough or Jamestown. While our scouts are observing this road they might be advancing by one of the other roads. I have therefore taken steps to have four cavalry companies employed in scouting from Jacksborough to Williamsburg. I have heretofore ordered Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan to send one cavalry company to observe the road from Huntsville to Montgomery, and his six other companies ought to watch the road from Monticello to Jamestown. I will keep the other cavalry on this road. I will dispose the infantry along PowelPs Yalley from Cumberland Gap to Jacksborough, until I can discover what is to be the precise movement of the enemy, when I will strike him with my concentrated force should he approach in any direction.
Watch the movements of the Lincoln men in East Tennessee. Be-strain our ultra friends from acts of indiscretion. Promptly meet and put down any attempted open hostility. But I have observed heretofore that a few of our friends about Knoxville are unnecessarily nervous ; give their expressions of apprehension only their due weight. Urge the brigade quartermaster to get the artillery horses heretofore ordered and the supply of horseshoes at the earliest practicable day.
Yery respectfully,

Sir : I reached this post this evening. The defenses have progressed rapidly. Extensive intrenchments for infantry, and seven pieces of artillery in good position, though the platforms have been completed for only two or three pieces. A cavalry company sent yesterday to Jacksborough has caught and sent in a Lincoln emissary, who says that it is the plan of the enemy to send two or three regiments in

the direction of Cumberland Gap to draw me out, while their principal forces will be moved on the roads from Williamsburg to Jacksborough and from Monticello to Jamestown. He represents their forces at 20,000, and says that Lincoln recruiting officers are to be in every county in East Tennessee within ten days.
Captain Ashby, a very reliable and efficient officer, who commands the cavalry company, reports that the road from Williamsburg to Jacks-borough is now being worked. I started three other cavalry companies to Jacksborough this evening, with instructions to reconnoiter the road from Jacksborough to Williamsburg, and I start two infantry regiments from this point to Jacksborough early to-morrow morning. Others will be placed at intermediate points between here and there. I have seven cavalry companies scouting back as far as Barboursville. One of their small picket parties was fired on this morning from the bushes, when, giving chase, they killed one man and captured four horses. They report that they have information that a cavalry picket of the enemy had advanced to within a mile or two of Barboursville, and our cavalry were advancing to meet them when the courier was sent to me.
Yery respectfully,

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk,
Commanding First Division, Western Department:
General : In your letter of October 27 you say: u I much regret that the regiments I might send to his (Thompson’s) aid are still unarmed, and that I am not in a condition to help him. This will be done as soon as I can send them forward.”
I am instructed by the general to advise you that your force is not now, nor in his calculation likely to be, more than sufficient to do the work assigned you.
Your front, and particularly your right flank, require incessant watching, and may at any moment demand all the force at your disposal.
The Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers afford lines of transportation by which an army may turn your right with ease and rapidity, and any surplus you may be able to spare from the left flank on the Mississippi can well be used to secure you against such movements.
General Thompson’s force, active and most useful as now used, as partisans, is large enough for its work. To swell his ranks by detachments from your command without raising it to an army would destroy its character and not increase its usefulness.

nication I need not speak. If they should be occupied and held by the enemy, they must necessarily prove of the most serious inconvenience to our army in Kentucky. Without disparagement to the parties in command, I beg to say that Colonel Tilghman, who I presume to be with you, is better informed as to the military aspects and capabilities of the country through which they run than any other person of whom I know, and I would suggest the propriety of having Colonel Tilghman put in charge of those defences, if the exigencies of the service he is now upon would at all allow of such an arrangement. He might be with great advantage advanced to a higher military grade, and if in that command would form a very much needed link of connection between my command and that of General Buckner. The information I am daily receiving from that quarter makes this increasingly necessary. The space between General Buckner and myself is now very feebly occupied.

Rocky Hill Station, Ry., October 31, 1861. Lieut. D. G. White, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir: Pursuant to the order from division headquarters the troops under my command have fallen back to this place, except a detachment of cavalry, left at Cave City to protect public property, for which there was no transportation. A special train has been sent for this property, and upon its return to-night the detachment will move here.
The position I now hold commands all approaches. The encampment is in order of battle as nearly as the nature of the ground will allow. Pickets are thrown out to the distance of from 5 to 8 miles, in the direction of Brownsville, Mammoth Cave, Cave City, and Glasgow. They are posted also at Chalybeate Springs, Dripping Springs, and Merry Oaks. On the night of the 29th my pickets went beyond Green Biver, on both the Nolin and Brownsville roads, and within half a mile of Greensburg. They saw nothing of the enemy. On yesterday they were thrown out towards the same points, but without crossing the river, with the same result. It is reported in this locality that Bous-seau’s army is advancing, but I have observed nothing as yet to sustain the rumor. I believe that the prompt movement of two brigades, one towards Green Biver, on the railroad route, the other upon Camp-bellsville, would drive the enemy beyond Muldraugh’s Hill on both lines, and secure to our forces ali the region south. The unexpected movement of my command interrupted the inspection and muster which had been ordered. The work is resumed to-day.

deavor to procure a battery suitable for service. I have no idea (he will explain) that these guns will stand the firing of shot from them. Eeport reached me at a late hour last night by express that the enemy were strengthening at Ashbysburg, and that the Union men north of me were preparing to join them. I have scouts in front (consuming all available cavalry) and watch them closely. I have reconnoitered around this place, looking for a place to give the best fight I can. I repeat again I need re-enforcements of every arm. Cavalry first is important, as explained in my former letter. I am not frightened, but only appreciate, as you would do were you in my place, the condition of things here.

Brigade Headquarters, Cumberland Gap, October 31,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:

Brigade Headquarters, Cumberland Gap, October 31, 1861. Colonel Stanton, Colonel Murray, and Colonel McClellan,
Near Jamestown:
Lieutenant-Colonel Mackall, General Johnston’s assistant adjutant-general, telegraphs from Bowling Green that u Stanton has been ordered to Wolden Pass; also the available force of Murray and Bledsoe to Jamestown, Tenn. Both come under your [my] orders.”
Where. Wolden Pass is I do not know. It is important I should immediately have a perfect understanding and communication with Colonels Stanton and Murray and Captain Bledsoe. There is reason to believe the enemy intends advancing in force upon East Tennessee. Whether the route by Cumberland Gap, by Jacksborough, or by Jamestown will be selected, cannot be definitely determined. I have seven cavalry companies scouting back to Barboursville on this road, four back to Williamsburg on the Jacksborough route, and I wish Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan to scout on the road from Jamestown back to Mon-ticello, and, if practicable, to Sta[e]gall’s Ferry, to get the earliest possible reliable information of the enemy, and communicate it to me by express messengers. I am moving two regiments to Jacksborough this morning. Two others will be placed at Big Creek Gap. Four will remain here or in the neighborhood.
I wish Colonel Stanton and Colonel Murray to take a strong position near Jamestown and throw up entrenchments, looking to the protection of the commissary stores and the stopping the enemy’s advance. Let the cavalry communicate to them promptly any intelligence received; and if any movement of the enemy is made in force, let information be

General Orders, J	[November, 1861?].
Since the army entered the State of Kentucky it has bought of willing vendors all it has consumed, and it has not in a single instance seized or taken anything from the owner without just compensation. Damages to private property in the erection of defensive works, removal of houses, and occupation of arable lands for public uses have been assessed by a board of officers, and paid for or assumed by the Government/ The appropriation by the troops of produce or of stock taken or killed (and cases of this sort will occur in every army, no matter how governed or disciplined) have been adjusted in a similar manner whenever the fact of the injury has come to the knowledge of the officers in command of this army.
The object of this army being to repel invasion from a sister State and to protect her population and maintain the right of the Southern people to self-government, private rights have been as far as possible respected and protected. We have in this respect made no dilference between Union men, as they call themselves, and Southern patriots. But for weeks past it has come to the knowledge of the general commanding this army that forays into the country around Cairo, Bird’s Point, Charleston, and Paducah, by large bodies of armed men from the Federal camps and posts, for the purpose of seizing and carrying oft* • everything belonging to those citizens adhering to the Government of the Confederate States, have taken place, and now are almost of daily occurrence. Within the past week it is known that a large body of men—cavalry, infantry, and artillery—marched upon the little village of Lovelaceville with a train of some 50 wagons, and seized and carried

off to Paducah a large amount of flour and wheat. To reconcile the owner to this act of robbery, those who seized his property arrested him and took him a prisoner to Paducah.

Richmond, November 1,1861. Brig. Gen. Humphrey Marshall, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : You will proceed to Prestonburg, Ky., and assume command of the troops at that place and its vicinity for the protection and defense of that frontier. You will report by letter to General A. S. Johnston at Bowling Green for such orders and instructions as he may have to communicate to you. You will consider yourself fully authorized to take into service such number of armed men as you may be enabled to raise, and cause them to be mustered in conformity to the laws of the Confederate States, and organized into companies, battalions, or regiments, as in your judgment the necessities of the case may require.
The Fifty-fourth Regiment of Virginia Volunteers, at Christiansburg, under Colonel Trigg, has been ordered to proceed without delay to Prestonburg. As you will overtake this regiment either at Christiansburg or on its march, you will attach it to your command, and likewise the battery of artillery under Captain Jeffress, now at Wytheville, giving to both such further instructions as you may deem proper.
Very respectfully, &c.,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
P. S.—Seven companies Virginia volunteers at Abingdon will also be placed at your disposal, as well as the three Virginia companies at Pound Gap, the whole to constitute a regiment, under Colonel Moore.
Headquarters Western Department,
Bowling Green, ify., November 1, 1861. Brigadier-General Tilghman, Commanding HopMnsville:
General: General Johnston directs you to draw back your command to Clarksville. Let your movement be a well-guarded one. Send your sick and baggage to the rear first, and cover the movement with your effective force. Arrived at Clarksville, employ your men in making the defensive works which will have been planned by Major Gilmer. A battery of Artillery (Maury’s) has been ordered to Clarksville for you. It is understood that a regiment of cavalry (Forrest’s) is on the north side of the Cumberland and below. Ascertain if this be so) if so, apprise the colonel of the new position you have taken up, that he may not be attacked unawares.
Colonel Gregg’s regiment of Texas troops ought to reach Clarksville to-day. This will be your authority to assume command of the regiment.
The value of the railway from Clarksville to this place is too well known to you to need explanation, but it must not be lost sight of in the pressure of other business.

Dispatch of -31st October received. Stanton has been ordered from Burkesville to Walker’s Pass; messenger dispatched two days since. Bledsoe and Murray to Jamestown. Stanton’s force is reported to be 2,000. He comes under your orders. Post him and Walker and Bledsoe as you think best.
W. W. MACKALL, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Executive Department, Nashville, Tenn.7 November 1, 1861. General Johnston, Bowling Green, Ky.:
Dear Sir : I am satisfied that the policy of the Federal Government is to throw a heavy force upon General Zollicoffer, or through other gaps west of Zollicoffer’s position, for the purpose of reaching the disaffected portion of East Tennessee and taking possession of the East Tennessee and Virginia Bailroad and cutting off* our communication with the army East.
I think it a matter of the highest importance that Zollicoffer should be re-enforced, so as to enable him to hold the gaps in question, and make the suggestion to you, knowing that if you concur with me in opinion, and will call upon the Government, the President will give you all the aid in his power.
Very respectfully,
ISHAM G. HABBIS.
P. S.—Excuse the liberty I take in making a suggeston that I know must have long since occurred to you; but the indications of this purpose accumulate, and our people are becoming so anxious upon the subject, that they would hold me blamable if I did not obtrude the suggestion upon you.
Clarksville, November 1,1861.
General A. Sidney Johnston :
Dear General : I returned home last night from Forts Henry and Donelson, where I went in company with Major Gilmer. Fort Henry is in fine condition for defense, the work admirably done, as Major Gilmer thinks, and the first regiment, under Colonel Heiman, the Tenth Tennessee, the very best I have seen in the service. They are healthy, and in fine discipline. I am glad to make this report, and to say the information I gave you lately was based on an untruthful representation, made by the major of that regiment, who was forced to resign his position. I now think from a personal inspection it is one of the best regiments in the Tennessee line.
Fort Donelson is in very bad condition. No work has been done of any

account, though Lieutenant Dixon, a young officer of great energy, will soon, I hope, have it put in a fine state of defense, unless Major Gilmer shall determine to fortify Line Port instead. He and Dixon were to go to-day to inspect that point and to determine which position should be fortified. I left them last night at 10 o’clock at Dover. Dixon returned yesterday from an expedition down the river, where he had gone to blockade it by sinking old barges in the channel. Two were sunk at Line Island, and six at Ingram’s Shoals, some 10 miles below. Captain Harrison, an old steamboat captain, familiar with this river, concurs with Dixon that the work is effectually done. They think it will be impossible for gunboats to pass Ingram’s Shoals even when the water is 10 feet higher than it is now. It seems to me the guns at Donelson, if well maimed, would be amply sufficient to defend this river against the Lincoln gunboats. Though Donelson is unfortunately located on the river, it certainly possesses great natural advantages against a land attack. A succession of deep ravines nearly surround it, including 10 or 15 acres of land thickly lined with trees in the right place, which, if felled with the tops outward, would protect it against cavalry, the approach of artillery, and almost of infantry. This is my military opinion. I rather think it will be supported by Major Gilmer’s.
With great- respect, your friend,
G. A. HENRY.
Dixon reported the gunboats in sight when lie finished the work at Ingram’s Shoals and came up the river.
Memphis, Tenn., November 1,1861. To His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President C. 8. A., Richmond, Va.:
Sir: We beg leave respectfully to call your attention to the military operations now in x>rogress in Northern Kentucky and the eastern portion of this State, and to submit to the Government at Richmond some suggestions as to the policy which we think should be adopted in reference to those persons (in each one of the sections mentioned) who have been misled and induced to assume an attitude hostile to the Government of the Confederate States. Our acquaintance with the people, together with the local and political influences, which have operated to seduce them from their proper allegiance, enables us probably to present the subject in a clearer light than it has heretofore been submitted. Your excellency is perhaps apprised that a large portion of our fellow-citizens in East Tennessee who have for some time past been greatly disaffected to our Government have of late signified their loyalty to the South by taking the oath of allegiance. Many of these, who had already fled from their homes and gone into Kentucky to assist in maintaining what is called the neutrality of that State, have now returned and joined the Army of Tennessee, having been assured that their property and former position would be restored to them. This policy, we think, if continued, will bring back to our support all who have left the State. There are, however, some yet who doubt whether or not they will be permitted to enjoy this immunity from arrest and punishment, who are in consequence banding themselves with those who are unfriendly towards us. We therefore wish to obtain authority from your excellency to say to them, that if they will lay down their arms, return 32 R R—VOL IV

to their homes, and become good and loyal citizens, they will be protected in the enjoyment of all their rights, alike with every one who submits to the authority of the Confederate Government. We are informed that a large body of this class of men are now assembled in the State of Kentucky, near the Tennessee line, who declare their intention of maintaining the neutrality of the former State. Knowing that this illusion will soon be dissipated, and fearing that they will by some means be induced to join the Federal forces, we are exceedingly anxious to make every effort to bring them to our support. We therefore desire to urge upon your excellency the importance of giving them such assurances of protection as will effect this object. Some of our most reliable and discreet citizens will visit Richmond for the purpose of conferring with you in relation to this matter, and can explain the reasons which induce this communication in a more full and satisfactory manner than we have written them.
Hoping that your excellency will take this suggestion under careful advisement, we have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,
* JOHN PARK,
Mayor.
We would respectfully request and urge upon your attention the fact that such has been the exasperation and vituperation of political parties and the ^prejudices of and against the present officers in command, that all proclamations heretofore issued by said officers have failed to have the due conciliatory effect, and that some direct communication from the head of the Government at this particular time would effect the most desirable results.

Sir: Under the very urgent necessity of supplying my command with arms, and in view of the very slow progress made in obtaining them from our own manufacturers, I have had my thoughts directed to other sources, and am satisfied a supply adequate to the wants of my own department can be obtained from Havana, Island of Cuba.
Arms in considerable numbers have already reached our southern coast, but the number is, of course, limited to the ability of private enterprise.
I have made an arrangement with gentlemen in whom I have the utmost confidence for making the purchase and bringing them into the country. The details have been a matter of careful consideration, and I have no hesitation in assuming the responsibility of the undertaking, provided it meets with your approval. I have made an arrangement tor borrowing the funds to carry out the enterprise, to be refunded at the pleasure of the Government.
This will be handed you by my aide-de-camp, W. B. Eichmond, who will give you any information desired in regard to this matter.

You will have some idea of it when I tell you that in endeavoring to get up a little command last evening to move on Princeton, I found that the First Mississippi had 151 for duty, the Third 128. Out of these, guards and pickets had to be taken, giving me only 100 men from each regiment, half of whom were really unfit for the night march (raining in torrents). I managed, however, to get together 400 men and two pieces of artillery, the poorest clad, shod, and armed body I ever saw, but full of enthusiasm. I soon found that half the infantry were so unfit, that the surgeon stated that humanity demanded they should not go. I was relieved by a courier,from my embarrassment and delayed until this morning, when a second courier relieved me entirely, by stating that the enemy had turned off from Princeton and [were] making northward. This morning I learn again that they have retired again (as their gunboats have done) towards the mouth of the river. You may therefore consider me relieved of the pressure for a few days.
Eight a. m.
I send you Colonel Machen’s note. Have just received telegram of the re-enforcement of Texans for me. I shall get my sick to Clarksville and hold on here. Shall begin to send the sick so soon as the weather permits. I still need cavalry, and must have them; 500 good men will be worth more to me and the cause in the next two weeks than I can well explain. You see I am still urgent. I trust you will endeavor to have this done. Will write again at noon to-day. I write, as the stage waits, of course in great haste.
Eespectfully, yours,

General Lloyd Tilghman:
Dear Sir : I proceeded yesterday in the direction of the supposed fortification on Cumberland. When within about 12 miles of the point I met the citizens of the country fleeing from their homes, with terrible rumors of a Northern army marching through the country in the direction of Hopkinsville from some point on the river, but could gather nothing reliable from any source, except that the Southern troops had left, carrying off their cannon. I remained until night in that region, and then turned to this point. Here I learn that they had obstructed the river at Ingram’s Shoals and had re-embarked their guns and gone up the river. The gunboat came up to the obstruction and flred a good many heavy guns, but for what purpose not known. She left and went down below Eddy ville, and possibly out of the river. She is a new boat, and has the appearance of being much more formidable than those here-

tofore in the river, mounting much heavier guns. I am starting to Eddy-ville, and if successful will be able to give, you a more satisfactory detail on my return, which will be as soon as practicable. No troops left, so far as I can learn, though much alarm exists about it. I was unable to get hold of information upon which I could rely so as to send a messenger last night.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. B. MACHEN.
Hopkinsville, November 2, 1861.
Col. W. W. Mackall :
Your dispatches through Clarksville received. I am more at ease. The enemy have retired towards mouth of river in part and part reported gone north. My scouts are from beyond Madisonville and Princeton and Eddyville, and my impression is the movement intended principally for your point. Shall iiusli reconnoitering well towards Ashbysburg and Rochester when able to do so. Can’t you send me some cavalry, say 200 ? I will hold my position yet. Have ordered up Colonel Gregg.

Nashville, Tenn., November 2, 1861. General A. Sidney Johnston, C. S. A., Bowling Green, Ky. ;
Sir : I have the honor to report to you that the obstruction at Eddy Shoals, or Ingram’s Bar, was completed Wednesday last, by sinking three barges, 120 by 27 by 8, filled with stone; also tw o smaller ones near the bar. This obstruction is complete against the gunboats for any rise less than about 12 feet over present stage. These boats contain about 1,200 tons of stone, and the boats themselves are made of 6-inch scantling. It may be possible that in a few weeks the current which sets in over the head of the bar between the sunken boats may wash out a channel. If so, it can be easily closed by sinking a small boat in the new channel. Lieutenant-Colonel MacGavock, commanding at Fort Done'lson, furnished a company of cavalry, three of infantry, and four pieces of artillery to protect the working party, but no enemy appeared. Captain Dixon, engineers, had charge of the force, and Cajit. H. H. Harrison wTas intrusted with the sinking of the boats. Two barges w^ere also sunk* at Line Island, effecting a barrier there, which may be made complete by sinking a small boat at the head of the island to close a small interval. The people on the river above Eddyville to Dover, 45 miles, are generally enthusiastic for the South, but a few Lincolnites are scattered about, who eagerly carry the news to Smithland. Captain Dixon and Major Gilmer of the engineers are examining the site at Line Port, with a view of fortifying it.
I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
MILTON A. HAYNES, Lieutenant- Colonel, Artillery.

Col. W. B. Wood,
Sixteenth Regiment Alabama Volunteers, Knoxville, Tenn.:
Sir : I have good reason to expect that the enemy is advancing toward East Tennessee, on the road to Jacksborough or that to Jamestown. Colonels Cummings’ and Newman’s regiments are by this time at Jacksborough, and this morning the Mississippi regiment will start, and this evening, I hope, Colonel Bains’ regiment and the artillery. Colonel Powell’s regiment is 20 miles this side of Jacksborough, at Willow Gap. The regiments of Colonels Battle and Church well, and the detachment of yours under Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, will at present remain here. I trust you got off my dispatches to Colonel Murray and Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan by express messengers to Jamestown. I have not heard a word from them, and feel some anxiety about it. I infer from dispatch from General Johnston that Colonel Stanton is in the same neighborhood. I remember the strong expression of your wish to be with us, and I would be pleased to gratify it, but certain indications in East Tennessee render your post now a most important and responsible one, and I must beg of you cheerfully to occupy it, and hold the balance of* your regiment with you until we can more clearly see what are the exigencies before us. I wish I could have you and all your gallant men with me, but in your present position, in present circumstances, your services are invaluable.

your action in stopping the supply of blankets at Nashville which had been collected for the army in Virginia, inasmuch as we had luckily succeeded in obtaining a certain number from Europe by the Bermuda with .which to replace those detained by you, and which served to supply our troops that were suffering in the mountains.
The President, however, begs that I should urge on you not to permit in your department a system of action which cannot fail to produce the most unfortunate results in every possible aspect of the case. Two of your subordinates have lately assumed the power to interfere with the passage of supplies destined to different points, and have subjected the Government to annoyances and embarrassments that paralyze its best efforts for the common defense. I will state them both :
First. General Pillow intercepted a supply of forage, collected with care and for urgent use in Alabama. The result is a breaking up of some cavalry forces collected by General Bragg for the coast defenses between Mobile and Pensacola, and bitter and somewhat intemperate remonstrance on the part of some of General Bragg’s officers, and an appeal to this Department for censure of General Pillow.
{Second. A wagon train was collected and supplied with clothing, bought and j>aid for out of an appropriation specially made by Congress for the relief of our suffering brethren in Missouri, w7ho are making so gallant a fight without an exchequer or an organized government. The clothing bought with this particular fund, and specially promised to General Price’s forces, was seized by General McCulloch, and distributed amongst his own troops without semblance of authority, and, so far as I am informed, without even stress of necessity.
To you, general, comment is unnecessary on such proceedings. They render the administration of the affairs of this Department on any systematical plan absolutely impossible. It was in this same spirit (that seems to have seized upon many of our leaders) that General Lovell sent a special messenger to Nashville for a supply of powder after I had refused to furnish any more to New Orleans until I had received some account of what had become of a large supply sent there within the last thirty days.
Our means are inadequate to furnish everywhere all that is required. We divide out to the best of our ability, as fairly as possible, according to the exigencies of the service, such supplies as w*e can command. This equitable system can only be conducted from one common head. Let me pray you to give such instructions to your subordinates as shall put an end to this reprehensible practice, and trust me that you shall have to the utmost extent of my power every possible facility and aid in the accomplishment of your arduous task in defending so vast a frontier as that which has been confided to you.
Your want of arms is felt by us as severely as by yourself. I have news of a cargo from Liverpool that must be off the. coast just at this time, and we are all most eagerly looking out for it. If the steamer succeeds in running the blockade safely I may be able to send you some 10,000 stands of arms, and thus put you at once on a footing to enable you to commence active operations.
The President has appointed Humphrey Marshall a brigadier-general, to take command of the forces collecting at Prestonburg. He goes w ith arms enough for a regiment, with a regiment of Virginians that is to join him at Obristiansburg, and still another will be with him in a few days. This will, we hope, suffice as a nucleus to hold together the forces now at Prestonburg and on the eve of dispersing, as w7e are informed, and enable Colonel Williams to succeed in uniting two or three

regiments more, thus forming a force sufficient to prevent the enemy from passing into Southwestern Virginia by the Pound Gap. General Marshall will, of course, report to you. I forgot to say that we have given him also a battery of six field pieces.
The President has also given to Hon. J. C. Breckinridge a commission as brigadier-general, with orders to report to you, so that he may take command of one of your two brigades of Kentuckians at Bowling Green. Colonel Preston has not been appointed a general. He may be taken on your staff, if you wish, or he will be appointed colonel to raise a regiment, or will be assigned as colonel to a regiment if you have companies enough to be now organized into a regiment.
I hope you have not bought the horses you speak of for Terry’s regiment with the public money. There is no act of Congress allowing it, and the accounts cannot be passed without a special law for that purpose. When Terry went to Texas to collect his regiment he was informed by the President in the most explicit manner that no cavalry could be accepted without their furnishing their own horses. Congress allows forty cents a day for the use and risk of a horse and pays for such as are killed, but has invariably refused to furnish horses for cavalry. When Terry’s regiment received leave to go to you instead of coming to Virginia, it was because we were led to believe that horses would be furnished them bj^ subscriptions in Tennessee; but the expression of your letter makes me fear that you have ordered the purchase with public funds, and this would be very unfortunate. The money for your supplies shall be, as you desire, deposited in bank in Nashville, but we cannot for the present send you gold.
In regard to your suggestions about some relaxation of the commercial restrictions on the interchange of products with Kentucky, I beg to say that the subject has already engaged the attention of the administration, but it is one on which there exists so much diversity of opinion and so much doubt in relation to the views of Congress, that we prefer to wait a few weeks and receive our instructions from the wisdom of our lawgivers.
Your views in relation to the present condition of Kentucky and to the course to be pursued in relation to the taxes by her legislature appear to me eminently just; but this letter has already reached such an extreme length, and the pressure on my time and attention is such, that I must defer further remark, as well as a reply to your suggestions about the appointment of officers, to another occasion, and remain, your obedient servant,
J. P. BENJAMIN,
Acting Secretary of War.
P. S.—If you can use secret-service money to sufficient advantage to justify its expenditure, I will place to your credit in the Treasury, and subject to your check, such moderate amount as you may deem necessary.

placed upon the exportation of provisions from a certain district immediately around me until I had made sure of what might be necessary for the necessities of my command. In that field my agents are now employed making contracts for wheat, corn, hay, and salt provisions, which contracts within a short time will be completed, after which the embargo I have imposed will be removed. The operation of this measure will be to make sure of army supplies, and, in the second place, produce a saving of $100,000 to the Government. My estimates are for an army of 50,000 men.
This measure, as might have been expected, has not met with special favor at the hands of speculators or public carriers by land or water, but it is not complained of by the producers.
To enable me to effect this object as soon as possible and with as little inconvenience as possible, it is necessary I should be placed in funds by the proper Department. The estimate for pork, beef, wheat, and corn I inclose on a separate slip of paper, and I shall be glad to be put in funds to make provision for them as early as practicable.
As this is a matter of the first necessity in our military operations, I have taken the liberty of addressing you directly on the subject, that no delays that may be obviated need occur. After these purchases are made the residue may be distributed to the country at large.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Governor of Tennessee, Nashville:
Governor : Since making my call upon you for troops of September 21st, 1 have ascertained that the ardor of our peox>le in defense of their rights has brought so many to our colors for the war in the Confederate States, and is bringing so many in Kentucky, that it is neither necessary nor judicious to accept unarmed volunteers for a less period than for three years or for the war.
Under this state of facts I beg your excellency to annul the call made at my request for twelve-months’ men, except such companies, battalions, and regiments as present themselves efficiently armed and equipped, and to disband all companies and regiments assembled without arms and not mustered into the service; and at the same time I trust you will be pleased to make known to the volunteers my appreciation of their patriotism in coming forward so promptly at your summons.
By my own orders I will disband all those unarmed troops raised under the call and who have been mustered into the Confederate service at the different rendezvous. Under the provisions of law the troops who have been mustered into the Confederate service will receive transportation in kind or by commutation to their homes, and I will direct my quartermasters to furnish transportation on the railways for all those who have joined the rendezvous, but who the public interest makes it no longer expedient to receive, to the point nearest their place of assembling.

﻿506	OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XII.
Nashville, Tenn., November 3,1861. Lieut. Col. W. W. Maoeall, Assistant Adjutant-General;
Sir : I have the honor to report my arrival at this place last evening, about 9 o’clock, by way of the Cumberland Biver. After, making a careful examination of the country around Clarksville and the Cumberland Biver as low down as Line Port, fifteen miles below Fort Donelson, I have now to report as follows, viz:
First. The Bed Biver, which empties into the Cumberland just below the town of Clarksville, furnishes the best line of defense for the town and the railroad bridge against any force advancing from the direction of Green Biver or from landings on the Cumberland Biver below Fort Donelson. To strengthen this river line (Bed Biver), the fords, one near the Hopkinsville Bridge, one just above the mouth of West Fork (a tributary of Bed Biver), one below the Bussellville Bridge, and one a few miles above the last-named bridge, should be destroyed, by felling trees to form an obstructing jungle, or abatis, and by cutting the banks so as to make them vertical. These fords are only possible at very low water, and have not been used for many months.
Having obstructed the fords, the two turnpike bridges and the railroad bridge over Bed Biver can be guarded by two emcampments—one just south of the Hopkinsville Bridge, the other between the railroad bridge and the Bussellville Bridge. Field x>ieees should be placed so as to sweep these bridges, or at least the approaches to them. For greater security breast-heights should be thrown up to cover them while used for fixed defense. Wooden platforms would aid much in traversing the guns, which should be kept on their field carriages for facility of movement when necessary.	*
To prevent our enemy from occupying the high ground just north of Bed Biver and to the left of the Hopkinsville turnpike, we must occupy it ourselves with a body of troops, and for greater security perhaps a small entrenchment ought to be thrown up on top of this hill.
Second. As to the defenses of Cumberland Biver below Clarksville, they should be at least as low down as Fort Donelson. Our efforts for resisting gunboats should be concentrated there, and to this end Captain Dixon will do everything in his power to hasten forward the works at that point. Line Port, 15 miles below, presents many advantages for defending the river, but as the works at Fort Donelson are partially built, and the place susceptible of a good defense landward, I advised Captain Dixon to retain the position and construct the additional defenses as rapidly as possible. To obstruct the Cumberland at points below Donelson, old barges and flats have been sunk at Ingram’s Shoals, a few miles above Eddyville, and at Line Island, 3 miles below Line Port. In all ordinary stages of w^ater the obstructions render the river impassable for gunboats and for any other boats at this time. Such at least is the judgment of Captain Dixon, who superintended the sinking of the barges.
Lieutenant Pickett did not report to me during my stay at Clarksville, which was from the 25th ultimo to the 29th, and I did not, in consequence, have any one I could place there to direct the commencement of the work for obstructing the passage of Bed Biver. I have just written fully to Brigadier-General Tilghman, giving him the result of my examinations, and as he has with him Mr. Morris, an intelligent civil engineer, I have advised him to obstruct the fords at once and establish the camps for guarding the bridges. I have, moreover, requested General Tilghman to telegraph me at this place should he wish my presence at Clarksville, and I would join him without delay. Gov-

Will yon please to send me written authority to employ negro labor for throwing up defenses at Nashville, Clarksville, and Fort Donelson, as well as at all other points where defensive works may be found necessary ; also for the purchase of intrenching tools.

Headquarters First Brigade, First Division,
Rocky Hill Station, November 3, 1861—11 p. m. Lieut. D. G. White, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : Reconnoitering parties sent by me to Glasgow, Cave City, and Brownsville returned to-day. They report no Yankee force at or near either of those places. Citizens stated to them that the enemy’s scouts had been seen at the mouth of Nolin River and at Horse Cave ; that 1,000 Federal cavalry had crossed Green River at Munfordville, and that General Ward had moved to Columbia with an army of 7,000 men. I inclose a rough diagram of the approaches to this post. All the roads marked may be traversed by an army except the one leading from here southeasterly to the Glasgow road and Bowling Green road. My cavalry pickets are posted at Chalybeate Springs, Roundtree’s, Bell’s, and Merry Oaks, thrown towards the ford below Brownsville, towards Brownsville, Mammoth Cave, Cave City, and Glasgow. Infantry pickets ere posted at Jamison’s, thrown both ways upon the pike, and towards Brownsville, and at Crook’s Mill, thrown towards Glasgow. Pickets are also stationed at commanding points all around the encampment.
The inclement weather prevalent since my arrival here, in connection with the extremely heavy guard duty required and the ill condition of the troops as to clothing and equipments, has greatly weakened my force. I am without medicines, and have not half the proper number of surgeons. The morning reports of to-day show my effective force to be as follows: Infantry: 70 officers, 163 non-commissioned officers, 1,088 privates; cavalry: 25 officers, 59 non-commissioned officers, 396 privates; artillery: 4 officers, 13 non-commissioned officers, 49 privates. Aggregate, 1,867.
In my opinion this force is not sufficient, especially when it is considered that it is largely reduced daily by sickness.

Piketon, October 28,1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of TPar, <7. 8. A. :
Sir : I reached this place last night, which is on Sandy River, 25 miles above Prestonburg, where Colonel Williams is now encamped. Colonel Williams has a force of about 1,000 men, who are deficient in ammunition. I sent down last night 4 kegs powder, 16 bags buck-shot, and 200 pounds lead, and we expect to-night to have an abundance of fixed ammunition, all sent by Capt. William Gibboney, of Wytheville. The country for a considerable distance up Sandy River is in great alarm as to Colonel Williams’ safety. I have not seen Colonel Williams, but will repair to his headquarters this morning. I have the most reliable information that the Federal forces at West Liberty and Hazel Green, which are from Prestonburg, about 40 miles from former and 47 from latter, amount to 4,000 men, fully armed, and with four pieces of artillery. On the 23d instant an advanced guard of Colonel Williams*, of 60 men, placed themselves near West Liberty, attacked a large Federal force from the bushes on the hill-side, in which the Federals suffered a loss of 30 killed and a number wounded. Our men did not lose a man. This advance of the enemy in such numbers will prevent our advance, if it will not drive our forces out of Sandy Valley.
I believe the importance of sustaining the occupancy of the valley of Sandy is fully appreciated at Richmond; if not, the railroad at Abingdon and Wytheville will be liable to attack. We should have a column here not only of sufficient backbone to hold on to this place and Prestonburg, but to advance into the county of Bath, so as to offer opportunities for our men to get behind us and to get the pork of Kentucky into the South. The command of Colonel Williams is much alarmed, and the population hereabouts still more so. The ax)proach of the enemy in such force has prevented many hundreds from enlisting and others from getting to the mountains. We think we may sustain our position, but it will be with much peril 5 and it is, I hear, the intention of Colonel Williams to hold on to the last extremity If we are confined to this valley, we shall soon consume the subsistence. We should advance so as to get full supplies, and for other reasons stated. If we could get two regiments immediately we could thereby gain a confidence which would cause a rush to our standard. One regiment is indispensable for defense, but two would enable us to advance. We need pack-saddles and their fixtures. Our basis of operations is at Wytheville^ which is 150 miles, on a tolerable mountain road. I hasten to lay these statements for your consideration.

the President’s consent, appointed him first lieutenant of artillery. This appointment is in the permanent army, and has, therefore, much more value than a captaincy in the Provisional Army. We are, however, as a general rule, making no appointments in the Regular Army from civil life, and under the acts of Congress cannot appoint any officers in the Provisional Army except to command troops. We can appoint field officers to troops, but have no commissions, to give in any other manner. This is not generally understood; hence repeated requests which we are unable to gratify. If increased rank is necessary to enable Lieutenant Rucker to command such troops as you wish to put under him, we can, after thus having made him an officer in the permanent army, give him temporary increased rank under the act of Congress NTo. 155, approved May 21, i861.

Wallace, imparting information with regard to the political sentiments of the people of East Tennessee, which he represents as extremely hostile to the Confederate Government, and that there is among them a large and well-armed force ready to act at an opportune moment. I have already ordered Stanton’s and Murray’s regiments and some cavalry companies from their stations in Fentress, Overton, and Jackson Counties to Jamestown, to join seven cavalry companies at that place, thence to report and await the orders of General Zollicofier, who has been notified; also ordered General Walker’s brigade forward and any troops who might be at the rendezvous at Knoxville. General Walker replied that his brigade was unarmed. There is no other available force under my orders with which to re-enforce General Zollicofier.
I have, in accordance with your orders, ordered the disbandment of all the unarmed troops that have or may be en route to the rendezvous under the call of the governors of Tennessee, Mississippi, and Arkansas, retaining only the armed portion, which, I presume, is but a small

proportion of the whole. The inability to arm those troops gives the enemy a great preponderance of force with which to operate against this department, which probably has been already anticipated by you.

[Subinclosure.]
Knoxville, October 29,1861.
Dear Governor : I don’t like to meddle in things that are in keeping of men so much more vigilant and wiser than I am, but I am constrained by the circumstances around me to believe that Zollieoffer and the railroads of East Tennessee are in a dangerous condition at present.
I am well aware that the views of the uoriginal panel” in East Tennessee is not much heeded abroad, but I am well satisfied that there is to-day a larger Lincoln force well armed in East Tennessee than Zolli-coffer has of Southern men under his command ; that this force is in such a state of organization that they can and will be concentrated in Zollicoffer’s rear whenever they are advised of a sufficient force in his front. These people are in full correspondence with the former in Kentucky, and know as well and better what is going on in the Lincoln camp than we do what is going on in our own.
Some large forces should be, as I think, sent immediately to Zolli-coffer’s assistance—not raw recruits, but men well equipped and drilled, and at their head an officer capable from ability and experience of taking command in case of any accident to Zollieoffer. There is no giving way in the hostile feeling in East Tennessee. This you may rely on, and time will convince you.
Truly, your friend,
C. WALLACE.

Dear Sir: By request of Mr. Samuel Tate I write to you this morning. He is just from East Tennessee, and says he considers the command of General Zollieoffer in great danger $ more from the rear than the front. Feelings of decided hostility are again being exhibited

by tlie citizens, and in his opinion there is danger of aid being given to Lincoln by the people of East Tennessee at an unexpected moment and seizure of the railroad. He requests me to suggest to you the necessity of rendezvousing several regiments immediately. I give you this information at his pressing instance. Election Wednesday. Kesult doubtful.

BEUBEK DAVIS.
Knoxville, Tenn., November 4,1861. Hon. Jefferson Davis, President,	:
Sir : I had intended to make the suggestions which follow several weeks since, but the menacing attitude of the enemy on the Poto* mac led me to postpone them till to-day. The splendid fight at Leesburg on the 21st ultimo and other incidents of the war encourage me to hope that you will not consider the suggestions unnecessary or inopportune.
The enemy intends to carry into effect the policy, long entertained and strenuously advised by Andrew Johnson and others, of invading East Tennessee. This may be attempted, not via Cumberland Gap, as generally apprehended, but via Jamestown and the several passes in Fentress County, where the mountain is much lower and the country more accessible. The inhabitants on that route are more rebellious and more disloyal to your Government. A radius of 50 miles, with Jamestown or Huntsville as a center, will embrace a population, both in Kentucky and Tennessee, of as anti-southern communities as can be found south of the Ohio. That- population is nearer to our railroad than any other point—much more so than that contiguous to Carter and Johnson Counties, also a disloyal neighborhood. Camp McGinnis is more vulnerable than Cumberland Gap, having fewer fortifications and fewer natural defenses. We need, therefore, to guard against invasion from that quarter; and while every one admits the bravery and vigilance of the officer in command (Captain Bledsoe, I believe), we all believe that the safety of the country demands that he be re-enforced. If you could spare General Elzey from the Potomac, with Col. J. C. Vaughn and the other regiments with him, and assign to them the disaffected country I have indicated as above, you will produce—1st. The entire acquiescence of the Tennessee malcontents, and make them assume at least a seeming loyalty and keep them on this side of the line. 2d. As these officers and their men have seen service elsewhere, they would inspire the enemy across the line with a wholesome dread of invasion—a respect for our experience as well as our prowess. 3d. It will excite (revive is not the word) the spirit of-volunteering, which I am humiliated to say is very low. Could our young men, our citizens generally, see Colonel Vaughn and his brave men among us and hear a recital of the vineibility of Lincoln’s minions, &e., the old spirit of Sevier and Jackson would return to our deluded and misled masses, the standard of patriotism would be elevated, and our young soldiery be excited from very shame to rally to the defense of Tennessee. 4th. The Tennesseeans on the Potomac know all these mountain passes, and are the very troops to cross them and fight beyond them. Let Elzey lead a brigade north from Camp McGinnis, Zollicoffer another in the direction of Lexington, and Buckner another to Louisville. They will scatter dismay in the Kentucky ranks and prevent them from embodying,

and thus enable our troops to make a simultaneous march through Kentucky, and expel every Yankee this side of the Ohio to their own North. I beg you not to think that any of us are afraid of being really invaded. Johnson and his late adherents in Tennessee intend and predict it, but the secessionists and our loyal people do not allow such an event to take place, aud some of us concur in the opinion that the policy I have mentioned will make it impossible.
Very Respectfully, vour obedient servant,
J. G. M. RAMSEY.
Memphis, November 4,1861. General A. Sidney Johnston, Bowling Green, Ky.:
Dear Sir : I arrived at home last night. I find the founderies at Nashville are prepared to work on a large scale, but have engagements for some time ahead; but in case of emergency I have no doubt you can get the guns they are making for the Government. I can get six guns a week cut and bored at Huntsville, from 6-pounder to 24-pounder howitzers. I can have completed here about twelve guns a week after the order is received and patterns made. The Parrott gun seems a failure; cast and wrought iron will not do combined. We are making a Dahlgren cast-iron 6-pounder gun that can be rifled, that will do, weighing about 900 pounds. Colonel Hunt tells me he has fifteen field guns here, 6-pounders, on carriages, not appropriated. He also has copper and tin to cast about fifty more, and is having them turned out about one per day. Would you prefer them rifled or not? How many brass 12-pounder howitzers would you like in proportion to 6-pounder smooth and rifled guns? Colonel Carroll tells me he is ordered to East Tennessee; is waiting for his guns to be repaired; says he can have it done at the rate of 100 per day. He says he will move 900 men this week. I think you had better write him to go, without waiting to have anything done to his guns except ordinary repairs. Colonel Reynolds has a regiment at luka, 100 miles east of here; no guns. General Walker has a brigade at Huntsville and no guns. M. Walker is sick ; his regiment has but few guns, about 100; expeers more this week. A Texas regiment is here, 1 learn, without guns. I have not seen them. Colonel Looney7s regiment here expects guns this week.
I have great fears for Zollicoffer’s safety if he does, not get help soon.
Could you not get the War Department to give us some submarine batteries on the river above here ? I have my doubts about stopping these iron gunboats, but I am sure we could blow them out of water with proper batteries. They would cost but little; the scarcity of powder is the only trouble. Fort Pillow and Columbus I fear, from what Captain Lynch said to me a few days ago, is deficient in quality as well as quantity of powder. Morgan, of Nashville, assured me when I was there that their mills were now making 2,800 pounds per day. We have made requisitions on them for 35,000 pounds for our forts above, but get no response. I have been running around all day to find out what I could, and write now in great haste to go by train in a few minutes. Let me know how many and what kind of guns you want, and I will try and get them made as rapidly as possible. Say whether you want carriages or not.
Yours, truly,
SAM. TATE.

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk:
General Johnston directs you to send 5,000 troops, with two field batteries, to Clarksville. Let there be a fair proportion of cavalry. Put General Pillow in command. Let him use the rail or march, or do both, in his discretion, but be prompt and say nothing of his destination.
W. W. MACKALL, Assistant Adjutant- General.
Hdqrs. First Division, Western Department,
November 4,1861.
General A. Sidney Johnston, Bowling Green, Ky.:
General : I have this evening received your dispatch ordering 5,000 troops of the force under my command to be sent forward to Clarksville. I telegraphed you in reply that measures were taken immediately to execute your orders. These measures are now being carried out. It is, however, due to you and to myself to submit to you, very respectfully, my views in regard to the proposed movement. Without attempting to undervalue the importance of force on the Cumberland and in experienced hands, as will be seen from my letter of the 31st ultimo, I am deeply impressed with the serious consequences that may follow from weakening the force at this place. Indeed, it was in the midst of a conference of all the general officers under my command, assembled for consultation, that your dispatch was received. We had agreed that in view of the information in our possession it was a matter of serious doubt whether we would be able to make successful resistance to the large force now being concentrated in our front with so small an army as that under our command. The fort is now nearly completed and armed, so that we have had time to turn to other dispositions and to consider plans for general defense. It was agreed by us all that to attack Paducah with its present defenses and the facility with which aid could be had by steamers from Cairo and its vicinity, while it might be successful, would be attended with great difficulty, and the prevailing opinion w^as that it would be not less difficult to hold it, should it be taken, with so small a force as ours. If that should be abandoned, then we must take the field in the direction of Mayfield to prevent being flanked, and occupy the strongest positions offered in that direction. To do this successfully with the force at my command would involve extraordinary exertion and good fortune. If then my force should be reduced by taking from it 5,000 men, I do not hesitate to say that for me to protect my flank with the remainder would be impossible. In that case the utmost that could be done would be to offer the best resistance possible, with the assurance that from the disparity of numbers isolation would be inevitable. We shall, of course, endeavor to do our duty, but I think it proper respectfully to submit these views as those which weigh upon my mind in view of the condition in which this command will be by the withdrawal of the force called for.

pressions maybe more clearly stated I have thought it best to send this letter by General Pillow, to whom I have communicated them very fully, and who will give you any information you may desire of our condition.
After consultation, I have thought it best to send the troops forward by land as far as to Tennessee River. They will there take the railroad, and will accomplish the journey in less time than ip any other way. I will get off a part of them, if possible, to-morrow.
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, Commanding.
Nashville, Tenn., November 4,1861. Lieut. Col. W. W. Mackall, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I did not mention in my communication of yesterday the want of additional guns for the proper defense of the Cumberland River and for other purposes. At Fort Donelson there are now only 4 32-pounders and 2 naval guns, an armament insufficient, I fear, to make a reliable defense against a fleet of gunboats. The number of guns should be doubled; say 4 additional 32-pounders and 2 of heavier caliber, 8-inch columbiads, or long-range Parrott guns, all with garrison carriages. Heavy guns may also be required for defending the Cumberland River near this city, but on this point I will report positively in a few days. For arming defenses against a land attack here or elsewhere a supply of 12-pounders should be obtained, say 20 to 25 guns, mounted on siege carriages, to be employed in conjunction with such field batteries as can be supplied here or from other points. In addition to the 12-pounder guns it will be advisable to procure some howitzers for throwing shells. In addition to the 4 32-pounders and 2 naval guns at Fort Donelson (that fire over the river), there are 2 small iron guns that were manufactured at Clarksville and a battery of bronze field pieces, which will be effective in the land defense of the place.

General Zollicoffer:
Sir : I have information that is entirely reliable that the enemy is approaching this point 6,000 strong—1,500 cavalry and the balance artillery and infantry. The infantry and artillery camped last night 5 miles east of Montieello, a portion of the cavalry in town, their pickets 7 miles below. Colonel Murray is at Camp Zollicoffer, in Overton County. I dispatched him yesterday, urging him to move to this place. Colonel Stanton, I understand, is at Celiria. I forwarded your dispatch to Colonel Murray last night, requesting him to forward to Colonel Stanton. Have heard nothing from either since we were at Albany. Captain Bledsoe, with his company, is at Camp Myers. I have with me not more than 500 effective men, and I have determined to retire, with the commissary stores, in direction of Pikeville, which is 15 miles from Brison’s Landing, on the Tennessee River. Fine road from here

to Pikeville. Bad road and great danger of being cut off by way of Montgomery has determined me to take former route. We will defend them the best we can until re-enforced. I am informed that the enemy understands that we have a large amount of stores here, and they wish to capture them by surprise. I have brought all my command up to this place, except our pickets back on the different roads, and we are felling timber in the strong passes behind us to obstruct Their advance. Let me hear from you without delay.
Yours, truly,
geo. r. mcclellaf,
Lieutenant- Colonel.
Knoxville, Tenn., November 4,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General;
Sir : The dispatches from General Zollicoffer state that he has reason to believe that the enemy with a force of 9,000 is approaching by Jacks-borough or Jamestown. Information from Assistant Adjutant-General Mackall says that there are about 10,000 men betweeij Camp Dick Robinson and Cincinnati. This information has been received by the Union men in East Tennessee, and they are openly preparing for rebellion. Men are arriving here daily from the adjoining counties, bringing information that the Unionists are talking exultingly of the approach of the Lincoln Army and their intention to join it. The state of the country here is evidently worse at this time than at any previous period. General Zollicoffer has taken all the troops from here, except about 200 infantry and one company of cavalry, and most of the latter are absent on special duty. The necessity for'a larger force at this point is urgent. Our commissary and quartermaster’s stores are liable to be seized at any moment, as also the railroad.
It is a great mistake to suppose that the people of East Tennessee are submissive or willing to acquiesce. They have only been held quiet by the force which was at Knoxville, and now that it is gone, they are evidently preparing for a general uprising if the Lincoln Army should make any advance into Tennessee. I need at least a regiment at this place to give protection to the stores of the Government and preserve quiet. There are three companies of infantry here under the late call of the governor for 30,000, but they have no arms. .
I communicate directly to the Department, because I think the exigency admits of no delay, and have no doubt it will meet with the approval of General Zollicoffer, to whom I send a copy.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. B. WOOD,
Colonel, Commanding Post.
Knoxville, Tenn., November 4, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War :
Sir : I have to-day written to General Cooper in reference to the state of affairs in East Tennessee and the necessity of re-enforcements being sent immediately; but as there is a misapprehension in reference to the feeling of the late Union party existing abroad, I have requested Mr. Archer, of Richmond, now on a visit here, to call on you and give you fuller information than I can write. In addition to what I have written to General Cooper, I will say that there can be no doubt of the

fact that large parties, numbering from 20 to 100, are every clay passing through the narrow and unfrequented gaps of the mountain into Kentucky to join the enemy. My courier, just in from Jamestown, informs me that a few nights ago 170 men passed from Roane County over into Kentucky. I do not believe that the Unionists are in the least reconciled to the Government, but on the contrary are as hostile to it as the people of Ohio, and will be ready to take up arms as soon as they believe the Lincoln forces are near enough to sustain them. I do not believe that the Southern men here are alarmed or nervous. They are as brave and fearless as any I ever saw, but they do live in constant apprehension that a general uprising and rebellion may take place at any day.
I submit the matter to the determination of the Department, assuring you that I will do all that I can with 200 infantry and one company of cavalry to prevent any disturbance.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Cumberland Gap, November 4, 1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Ko late indications of enemy. Begin to suspect the movement was a feint, and that their forces may be withdrawing to support concentration on General Buckner’s front.
F. K. ZOLLICOFFER,
Brigadier- General.
Cumberland Gap, November 4, 1861. Lieutenant-Colonel Mackall,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Bowling Green, Ky.:
Sir : After all the efforts I have known how to employ, I have at no time been able to procure any but uncertain information of the strength and movements of the enemy in my front. The population between here and Camp Robertson [Dick Robinson?] is generally hostile and igDorant. Of the few professing friendship, some are treacherous; others afraid to attempt to furnish information. I am liable, therefore, to error from want of reliable information. I am now inclined to suspect that the'enemy will make no forward movement toward East Tennessee, but will retire from this line to give support to a concentrated movement in General Buckner’s front. We have vague news to this effect from citizens, communicated through our cavalry scouts on the Barboursville road. Ko news yet from our cavalry scouting from Jacks-borough back towards Williamsburg and Pine Knot Tavern, in Kentucky. I have now five regiments concentrating near Jacksborough, with all our field artillery. Captain Shellaha [Sheliha?] is in that quarter, making reconnaissance, and I will employ the troops in making such defensive works as he may direct. The work here is still being pushed vigorously with the labor of two regiments and a half. Colonel Murray was in Overton County on the 30th. I have not heard from Colonel Stanton. Six cavalry companies, under Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan, were near Jamestown on the 30th. On the 2d instant I sent an express messenger through under a cavalry escort with letters, the object of which was

to concentrate the commands of Stanton, Murray, and McClellan near Jamestown.
It appears to me that the railroad facilities of the enemy, connecting Cincinnati and Louisville with Nicholasville and the Louisville and Nashville road, enable the enemy with great ease to bring up reserves, and, when I advance, glide them round and concentrate in my front $ and when General Buckner advances, glide them around the other way and concentrate in his front. They therefore seem to occupy a central position between us, and may with facility strike at our separate forces in detail. It appears to me if my main force could properly be placed nearer General Buckner’s, the two lines, within supporting distance of each other, would be able to advance more safely and effectively. If therefore it should meet your approval, I will as rapidly as possible endeavor to so fortify Cumberland Gap that the smallest possible force will be necessary here; will simultaneously endeavor to fortify or thoroughly blockade the passes near Jacksborough, and all the by-ways east and west of these passes, so as to set free as large a number of my troops as possible, and concentrate them upon some point in the open country near Jamestown, with the view of advancing towards Danville. The country is not so sterile through which to make a forward movement as the one in front of me, called “The Wilderness of Kentucky.” It cannot be more hostile, and my column would not be so much exposed to attack by overwhelming force in an isolated position without reserves or co-operation.
It may require some time to prepare this mode of defense for East Tennessee, but I think it can be made effectual, and leave us a much larger field force for aggression upon the enemy and in a more effective position.
As this will necessarily be a permanent post, I have authorized the regiments here to employ any surplus force more than can be employed on the fortifications in constructing some huts to shelter them.
The late cold, rainy weather here has been severe upon those who are thinly clad.
Yery respectfully,
E. K. ZOLLICOFFER,
Brigadier- General.

That order, then, will be executed.
In addition to General Pillow’s division, you will send another regiment, if necessary, to make the complement of 5,000 effective men.

Bowling Green, Ky., November 5, 1861. His Excellency Gov. Isham G. Harris, Nashville, Tenn. :
I am not yet prepared to muster out of service the volunteers at Camps Cheatham, Trousdale, and Red Sulphur Springs, and it is within my hopes that before the time of muster, say fifteen days, it may be in your excellency’s power to arm these troops, and thus enable me to retain them or some portion of them for the defense of your State, now endangered by the heavy masses in my front and those pressing on East Tennessee on my right and the line of the Cumberland and Tennessee to the west.
If you can arm these men, or any other portion of the quota called out and assembled, and will designate the numbers and the troops, and the time at which efficient arms can be put into their hands, I will, if the time be not too far distant, keep all such in service, and so try to secure my command from danger, and perhaps strike a heavy blow on the advancing enemy.

communication so precarious, I consider it best to address you from this point. I shall repeat my letter when upon the theater of my command.
Of the general condition of things on the eastern frontier you are probably already better advised than I am. I understand in general terms that Col. John S. Williams has succeeded in mustering some 600 or 700 men into the Confederate service, and that there are, in all, collected at that place some 2,000 Kentucky people 5 but of these tnany act in their own behalf and do not enter the service. My authority to muster troops into the service is estimated to be ample by the orders I have received from the Adjutant-General. Those orders contemplated the immediate use of two Virginia regiments (Trigg’s and Moore’s), and one battery of four pieces, commanded by Captain Jeffress, of Virginia; But I have been surprised to find that Moore’s regiment has no arms nor ammunition, camp equipage nor transportation, to give the expected mobility to it, and how long before these will be furnished I cannot guess. The battery is yet here, one of the caissons not having come up from Lynchburg, but 1 hope it will be able to move to-morrow. I have ordered Colonel Trigg to move from Christiansburg, but am not advised that he has done so up to this moment.
I shall proceed on my journey in the morning, though the officers of my staff have not arrived. Thomas Hawkins is in your own camp at Bowling Green. I wish you would communicate to him my expectation that he shall report to me as aide as soon as practicable.
I am, general, your obedient servant,

General A. Sidney Johnston:
Dear Sir : Inclosed you will find a requisition for 60 axes and helves for your approval. Major Gilmer and Captain Dixon ordered an abatis to be made to protect the rear at Fort Donelson on the Cumberland, and we have not a sufficient number of axes. I reached here this morning, and will return to the fort on Thursday. I wrote to General Polk by Captain Dixon to send one well armed and drilled regiment to Fort Donelson at once. We have there now Colonel Forrest’s command of cavalry, one company of light artillery, with a battery of seven guns and a sufficient amount of heavy guns. I also have five comx>anies of infantry tolerably armed, but not so well drilled as I would like, having been in camp only a short time. General Polk ordered Colonel Thornton’s Mississippi regiment to this post, but for some cause they did not reach there.
The people in the counties of Trigg and Lyon, in Kentucky, are calling on us every day for protection, and I think we are losing ground in that region simply because they are overawed by gunboats and small parties that come out from Smithland and steal everything that they can lay their hands upon.

Assistant Adjutant-General^ Bowling Green, Ky.:
Sir : I have no recent information of the enemy. Examinations of the mountains east and west of this gap for miles disclose various foot- % paths, requiring obstructions and sentinels in case an enemy should ’ attempt to throw light infantry over them. Having put in train every means of defense which occurs to me, and left Col. James E. Rains in command of the post, with his regiment, that of Colonel Churchwell, and a battalion of the Sixteenth Alabama Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, with seven cavalry companies to watch the roads to Barboursville, Manchester, and Harlan Court-House, I will to-morrow morning proceed to Jacksborough and look to the necessary work at the gaps near there. Four regiments are in that neighborhood, and one at Wilson’s Gap, 20 miles this side. Four cavalry companies are scouting back on the roads into Kentucky from Jacksborough. The 6-pounder battery of eight guns (inclusive of the two Parrott guns) has been sent to Jacksborough, to be ready in case the enemy should advance on that road with artillery. In the event of approach in this direction, we have guns enough in fixed battery here to hold the enemy in check until the Parrott guns can be brought up and put in position.

An express messenger is just in from Jacksborough, with dispatches from Captains Rowan and Ashby, of the cavalry. The former scouted to Huntsville and Chitwood’s, on the Kentucky line, took 2 prisoners near Huntsville, who state that there are 1,000 or 1,200 of the enemy encamped at or near Isabel’s Point, which I think is at the Forks of the Cumberland, under command of Colonel Hoskins. The latter took 2 prisoners from London, 1 of whom was at the Rockcastle Camp at the time of the fight. They say that the enemy are now 8,000 strong at London, fortifying, in anticipation of an attack from me.
Very respectfully,
F. K. ZOLLICOFFER,
Brigadier- General.
Cumberland Gap, November 5,1861. Col. W. B. Wood, Knoxville, Tenn.:
Sir : I will start for Jacksborough to-morrow, where there are five regiments. The letters you send me from Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan show that no force is advancing in that direction. The heavy movement he has information of “from Wild Cat to Crab Orchard” is in direction toward Camp Robinson, and not towards Jamestown or Jacksborough, and indicates a supporting movement to a concentration in front of General Buckner, as 1 have heretofore telegraphed General Johnston. My scouts from Jacksborough and Big Creek Gap out to Kentucky bear of no advance in that direction; but prisoners taken represent the enemy as fortifying near London, in apprehension of an attack from me. The man you mentioned who circulated the report of the approach of 30,000 of the enemy near the East Tennessee line was doubtless a Lincolnite, and ought to have been arrested.
I regret that you hurried a request to the Government for a regiment before applying to me for aid. Colonels Stanton and Murray have been ordered to Jamestown by General Johnston, and are, I hope, by this time there. The regiments here and at Jacksborough are busily employed making defensive works at the gaps, and I should regret to detail a single regiment unnecessarily; but if you still think the indications around you are of so pressing a character, write to me at Jacksborough, and I will send you a regiment without delay.
Yery respectfully,
F. K. ZOLLICOFFER,
Brigadier- General.

General Zollicoffer:
Sir: I had information from my pickets this morning, who were up the road within 10 miles of Monticello yesterday evening at sundown. There were at the town Federal troops; the number and character they could not ascertain. I have sent a strong picket to-day up both roads to Monticello, also to Albany. They have sent in a messenger at dark, and report that they have made no discovery of the approach of the enemy. I directed the different pickets to go as far up the roads as would be safe, and report back to-night or early in the morning. I shall dispatch again to-morrow, if we ascertain the movements of the

enemy. From the information I had yesterday of the approach of the Federal forces, and the small force here and the uncertainty of being reenforced in time, I sent the most valuable stores at Jamestown to Mr. Bledsoe, 18 miles on the road to Pikeville, under a guard. I am here at this camp, having fallen timbers in the other approaches, determined, if the enemy should present himself here, to annoy them and retard their advance to the last.
Since writing the above a messenger has arrived with reports from Monticello, with information that there are no forces of the enemy below Monticello, and perhaps none nearer than Camp Goggin, except their pickets. I had a note from Colonel Murray this evening, informing me that he would be up here in a day or so. I would again suggest, if we have the forces, we should move into Kentucky from this point. Let m6 hear from you.
Yours, truly,
geo. e. McClellan-,
Lieutenant- Colonel.
Hdqrs. First Division, Western Department,
Columbus, Ky., November 6, 1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, President C. S. A.:
Sir : You will remember with what reluctance I consented to accept the commission of major-general in the Provisional Army. You will remember also that the considerations inducing my acceptance were the duty which I felt I owed the country at whose hands I had received a military education, in connection with the difficulty of your finding a commander to whom you were willing to intrust the department you wished to assign to me. These considerations, supported by the conviction that u resistance to tyrants is duty to God,” warranted my turning aside from employments far more congenial to my feelings and tastes to devote myself for the time to the military service of the country.
I have been in that service now more than four months, and have devoted myself with untiring constancy to the duties of my office, with what efficiency and success the country must judge.
Within the last few weeks you have been able to avail yourself of a distinguished military commander, our mutual friend, who was not in the country at the date of my appointment, upon whom you have devolved, partly at my instance, the duties of the office I consented to fill.
It will be agreed, I believe, upon all hands, that a more judicious selection could not have been made, and that his military knowledge and experience will supply all that was needed. I have been willing to remain as second in command until the fortifications at Fort Pillow and this very important point were completed. This has now been substantially accomplished, and I feel that, as the necessity which induced me to take office no longer exists, and as the other general officers with whom I have been associated are men of ability and experience, I may be permitted to retire and resume my former pursuits.
I beg leave, therefore, to tender to you my resignation of my commission as major-general of the Provisional Army of the Confederate States.
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding.

Col. W. W. Mackall,
Assistant Adjutant- General, C. S.A., Bowling Green:
Sir : The arrival of the Texas battalion of infantry relieves me somewhat in that arm, but still leaves me very inefficiently provided with the important arm. of cavalry in a position such as this, and without which I cannot render the important service 1 might. The enemy, now a little more quiet (rendered so by the late low water in the Cumberland), on my left, will, now that the river has risen again very much, carry out their designs with their new gunboats, and endeavor to try the metal of Fort Donelson, with a cavalry force to move on my left again. These are their designs I know; and their preparations at Smithland prove the fact. The cavalry force is intended, I have no doubt, to prevent the delivery here and at Clarksville of a large number of hogs and beeves collecting at various points in the counties above. In looking at the military defenses of this county [country?], I keep in mind a wholesome amount of these two important sinews, and when I solve the problem thus, that the necessary force to guard my front and give me security here attains the end of covering these vast supplies, I can see in my own mind full justification of a reiteration of my request to have a force of not less than 500 cavalry sent at once to me.
My scout in the direction of Ashbysburg (within 5 miles) returned last evening; a large re-enforcement has lelt Owensborougli, and another regiment from Henderson. At 7 p. m. last night a courier from a safety committee at Henderson reached me. It is known there that the force referred to above is intended for this place. I feel that with such a number of sick, with but little improvement for the last three days, owing, I suppose, to this terrible weather, having now 750 cases, I cannot remove them, at any rate not until the weather improves. The thing is impossible, having any regard for the lives of not less than 500, who are too low to move with any chance of success. Again, the importance of a force here is immense and better appreciated from my stand point here than from anywhere else. I need not only more force, but I need some person besides myself to rely on in case of an accident. Should I fall, there is not a man, sir, who could manage over 100 men on the ground. They are good men, but with no military knowledge. The raw troops are very raw, and it will take good handling to make them at all steady under the first fire in action. Can you not send me my old regiment, with Lyon at its head % Lyon and Anderson will be worth the mere force of many more men. Lyon knows this region, and it is a difficult one, and the men know it. This regiment, with part of, say, Adams’ cavalry and Captain Woodward’s company, is suggested respectfully. I am endeavoring to get the country people organized, but with not much success. Please reply by telegraph to Clarksville and write fully by mail.
Bespectfully, your obedient servant,
LLOYD TILGHMAK, Brigadier-General, G. S. Army.
P. S.—I am just issuing a short proclamation. Will send copy tomorrow. I have written fully to Major Gilmer of the character of the new gunboats. They are very formidable $ vastly more so than is generally considered.

Sir : Hurried on to this point by an order from yourself, I failed to conclude a report commenced at Clarksville. To show you the speed with which our companies were got together and hurried to this place, I need only say that I was at Nashville on the 20th of September on my way to Texas to assemble our companies. When but six of our companies were ready I received a dispatch from the Secretary of War, directing us to u proceed to Memphis as soon as possible and report to General A. S. Johnston.” This dispatch was dated the 4th of October. The companies came on as soon as they could; two days after them our seventh company set out, and one week after the eighth and ninth companies also commenced their march. One of these companies marched 400 miles, and the shortest distance made by any company on foot is nearly 200. u We think we have a tenth company on the road. Immediately after seven companies reached Memphis we informed Colonel Walker, the commandant of the post, and let him know that we were partially armed, but not organized into a regiment. He stated to myself that he had informed you by telegraph that we were there

and “partially armed.” I received through him the order of General Johnston to proceed at once to Clarksville. I then dispatched to learn whether we should proceed as our companies arrived, or whether we should wait for our entire regiment. The reply came directing us to proceed as our companies arrived. We were out three whole nights in open cars and a steamboat; reached Clarksville in the morning, and it rained incessantly during the day, and our men were not in dry clothing whilst there. We received an order to march to General Tilghman’s aid, and came on as soon as we could exchange our guns, which were unht for use, for others furnished by the military board, and get ammunition.
Except a number of sick men on the road our nine companies are all here. The number is 749. Five of our number died on the way. From exposure to cold and wet on our journey we have more coughs and colds than I ever saw among the same number of men. Under General Tilghman’s direction we will organize and elect our officers to-day or to-morrow. We have the consent of the Secretary of War to that purpose.
Upon my arrival at this iflace I immediately made to Brigadier-General Tilghman a report concerning our arms as full as I can now make it. Captain Van Zandt’s company have 13 double-barreled shot-guns and 10 rifles in good order. They also have 9 double-barreled shotguns and 25 rifles out of repair. Capt. H. B. Graubury’s company have no guns that they brought with them. Capt. W. B. Hill’s company have 19 double-barreled guns and 8 rifles in good order. They have 20 rifles and 14 double-barreled guns out of repair. Capt. W. H. Smith’s company have 69 muskets in good order, but without equipments. These were guns loaned by the State of Louisiana to the State of Texas. Capt. Jack Davis’ company have 16 rifles, 3 of which are out of order, and. 16 double-barreled shot-guns, 2 of which are out of order. They brought other guns from Texas, but all their guns were appraised at Clarksville, and the number of those left cannot now be ascertained. Capt. It. S. Camp’s company have one musket, without equipments, 27 double-barreled shot-guns and 11 rifles, all here and in good order. They also have 31 double-barreled shot-guns and rifles (number of each kind not known) which were left at Clarksville. Capt. Wm. L. Moody’s company have 3 muskets, 13 double-barreled shot-guns, and 26 rifles, all here and in good order. They also have 12 other guns (kind not known) left at Clarksville. Capt. E. T. Broughton’s company have 31 muskets similar to those of Captain Smith’s company, and obtained from the same source. They have also one rifle. Capt. John Brown’s company had guns as follows, viz: 32 rifles, 12 double-barreled shotguns, 3 Mississippi rifles, and 2 yagers; all of which were appraised by the military board at Clarksville, as I am informed, and the men paid for them. Captain Brown’s men had other guns, which they sold at Memphis, as I am informed. This company was behind. The guns left by us at Clarksville were those not lit for immediate use; and in the hurry of departure we could not bring them. I sent back for them in order that they might be valued, but the military board refused to deliver some of them to the officer sent by me. Some he obtained. The board had loaned us other guns.
There is nothing for me to communicate now except that we are here by order of Brigadier-General Tilghman.
Very respectfully,
JOHN GREGG, Acting for Texas Volunteers.

Clarksville, November 7,18G1. General A. Sidney Johnston, Bowling Green:
Sir : I liope you will not consider me importunate, but the condition of tilings at Fort Donelson demands immediate attention. There are there about 800 cavalry and 500 infantry, and great want of organization and drill. They have not men enough to form a regiment, and no sort of order prevails. Some of the cavalry might be transferred to Tilghman, and five more companies of infantry ought to be sent there (to Donelson), so as to organize a regiment immediately. Captain Sugg’s Company, now ready to march, already sworn in and armed, can go to Donelson at any moment. There is another company at Camp Cheatham, Dr. J. B. Walton, commander, could also be transferred there. They have no arms, but are sworn in the service. Three other companies can be organized in a few days if proper energy is used.
The guns at Donelson are wholly unprotected, as they were at the date of Day last letter, and will probably remain so till the regiment is organized and some one is in command who will push on the work to completion. Captain Dixon is ready and willing to work, but he is not sustained. I strongly urge that Sugg’s and Walton’s companies be ordered immediately to Donelson, and the regiment be put in an organized condition as soon as possible. The abatis is finished at Donelson, but no work done to protect the guns. They are in a very exposed condition, for we learn the enemy’s gunboats have passed the place on the river where Captain Harrison sunk the barges. They constitute an ineffectual blockade, as our board here are advised.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Bowling Green:
Sir : The completeness of the artillery arm is so difficult to obtain that I have sent Lieutenant Dunlap to Clarksville and on to Nashville and Bowling Green, with a view to looking into the condition of the batteries being sent forward from Nashville.
Captain Griffith, commanding a battery, has arrived at Clarksville, but in a very incomplete condition; thus six pieces, with harness for four teams $ about ten rounds of fixed ammunition to each gun, and none of the et ceteras. Lieutenant Baxter, with 60 men and no guns, is at Clarksville. Lieutenant Dunlap is instructed to make requisition for everything to furnish completely two batteries, and I beg you will favor the application. You will have received the report of a board ordered to examine the pieces of artillery now here. I desire that they be replaced at once by new pieces. I repeat the request, that the general commanding allow me to draw from the* depots at Nashville and Memphis for all supplies until I equip my command. I will confine myself strictly to what is allowable by regulations. I am preparing pay rolls for commutation, clothing, money, and unless the depots can supply me with clothfbg I will have my own quartermaster to have them made. I need funds for quartermaster’s department for purchase of wagons, mules, harness, forage, and horses for artillery commands. The estimate will go forward to-day.

I hope to be able to accomplish something, but really fear my own weakness. A small party will join them from here to-night to head off their retreat by the only route they can escape me. I can do nothing with my weak cavalry force in preventing the driving off of hogs and cattle from the counties north of me. I hope you appreciate this matter.
The gunboat has passed behind me to Dover, and I think, from the firing, has tried Fort Donelson.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. \Chap. XII.
Headquarters Western Department,
Bowling Green, November 8, 1881. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War :
Sir : The great superiority of the enemy’s force has enabled him to place a heavy column, estimated at 20,000 men, in front of me, and to concentrate auxiliary forces of Kentuckians, supported by Federal troops, on my right and left, threatening flank movements. One of these movements has for its object Nashville, Tenn., which is one of our principal depots, where large supplies of subsistence for the army East and West are accumulated, and valuable manufactories of arms, powder/ clothing, &c., are established and in successful operation. The object of the other movement is the breaking up of the Memphis and Ohio Raih road, and the occupation of Clarksville, Tenn., which, if effected, turns the right of the column under General Polk’s command.
The effectiveness of the force here is considerably diminished by sickness (in most cases measles), and the same cause has left but a small portion of General Tilghman’s command at Hopkinsville, Ky., fit for duty.
These considerations have induced me to draw 5,000 men from General Polk’s command to cover the defenses of Clarksville. The Cumberland River defenses will also be thus provided for, besides enabling me to drive back the forces of the enemy concentrating at Hartford, north of Green River, designed, I think, to operate against Clarksville and Russellville, both of which are on the Memphis and Ohio Railroad.
Three regiments will garrison the fort at Columbus. After deducting them and the force ordered to Clarksville, 10,000 or 11,000 effective men will be left under General Polk’s command; a sufficient force for the defense of his front for the present, but much less than I would suggest for the contingencies of the future.
The country between Columbus and the Tennessee River is generally covered by a heavy forest with undergrowth and is intersected by numerous roads. It can be defended by a force inferior to the invading force. I am not apprised that the force of the enemy which may be put in motion in his front is superior to that of General Polk.
The iron-clad gunboats of the enemy have appeared in the Cumberland River, but were prevented from ascending higher than near Eddy-ville by obstructions lately placed there by order of General Polk. Boats loaded with stones and sunk on the shoals have also been placed in the river at Line Port.
Twelve miles above Line Port is the site of Fort Donelson. By this time it is in a state of defense, having, besides other guns of less caliber, four 32-pounders and a sufficient garrison. I have also sent to that point four other 32-pounder guns.
Fort Henry is located on the Tennessee River, about 12 miles from Fort Donelson. It is a strong work, and sufficiently garrisoned by an excellent regiment. There is a small supporting force at each of these forts, consisting at Fort Donelson of one regiment of cavalry and at Fort Henry of one regiment of infantry.
I find it extremely difficult to acquire reliable intelligence of the movements of the enemy, except that which the activity of our scouts enables them to furnish, and would be glad to have $5,000 deposited in a Nashville bank to my credit tor secret service.
I beg leave to ask that the staff of the disbursing department, particularly the commissary department, may be supplied at the earliest practicable moment with money.

Extensive preparations liave and are being made at Nashville, under the medical director, for the accommodation of the sick, who will be sent to that place at the rate of 250 per day, and more if practicable, till they are conveyed hence.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. S. JOHNSTON, General, tC. 8. Army.
This letter has been delayed in consequence of the cutting the direct railroad communication.
Since this was written General Polk has gained a victory over the Eederal troops opposite Columbus. They were routed with great loss, and I now consider his situation better than before the conflict.
The movements of the enemy now clearly indicate the correctness of the views expressed in the first part of this dispatch. I therefore find still greater reason for bringing forward the troops ordered from Columbus. Their movement has been delayed by the battle, but I hope they will be' in time to anticipate the enemy. I have received information that a gunboat of the enemy has been enabled by a rise in the Cumberland to pass over the obstructions placed in the river.

Knoxville, Tenn., November 8,1861. His Excellency President Davis :
Dear Sir: Many friends here have urged me to address your excellency this note. Heretofore I have declined to do so, on account of the extreme delicacy I feel in suggesting anything to the Government in regard to which it is to be presumed they are fully informed. What I have to say is in regard to General ZollicoffePs perilous position at Cumberland Gap, and the danger of invasion by the Lincoln forces of East Tennessee by way of Jamestown, Fentress County, Tennessee.
It is thought here, by all who are acquainted with things in East Tennessee, that re-enforcements, if practicable, ought to be sent forthwith. It is, I fear, a grand mistake to suppose the Union party in East Tennessee has lost its hostility to the Confederacy. At the election day before yesterday, with perfect unanimity, that party refused to cast a vote for men who had been its late leaders, because they were running for seats in the Confederate Congress 5 and if a force shall be thrown into East Tennessee or on the line, which now seems probable, and which General Zollicofter is unable to defeat, the flames of rebellion will flash throughout East Tennessee, the railroad will be destroyed, the bridges burned, and other calamities not necessary to mention will 34 r r—VOL iv

follow. I regard the state of affairs, from all the information I possess, as perilous.
Would it he consistent with the interest of the public service elsewhere and the security of the army on the Potomac to send Colonel Vaughn’s regiment, and indeed the brigade of which his regiment is one, to re-enforce General Zollicoffer ? If not, could there be any other troops sent to East Tennessee from any other quarter ?
Any volunteers that might be raised here would be wholly inefficient for want of arms.

Ten Miles from Jacksborough,
jNovember 8,1861.
I am pressing on to meet the enemy somewhere between Montgomery and the foot of the mountain towards Kingston, supposing they are making for Loudon Bridge. A reliable citizen from Huntsville, Tenn., just in, reports there general impression that the enemy are sending in a force by Chitwood’s, from Williamsburg and Cumberland Gap, in addition to the 6,000 by Monticello.
E. K. ZOLLICOFFER.
Brigade Headquarters at Oliver’s, Twenty-three miles from Montgomery, November 8, 1861. General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond:
Sir: On the 4th instant Lieutenant-Colonel McClellan sent me a dispatch, stating that he had information uentirely reliable” that 6,000 of the enemy—1,500 cavalry and the balance infantry and artillery—were encamped in 5 miles of Monticello, and were advancing towards Jamestown. He stated that he knew nothing of the whereabouts of Colonels Stanton and Murray, and that he had determined to retire with his cavalry force towards Pikeville, fearing he might be cut off if he attempted to retreat towards Montgomery.
I inferred that the enemy’s force would advance towards Loudon Bridge, through Montgomery, and conceived the plan of intercepting them at Winter’s Gap, in a mile of this place, or at the pass down the mountain, 18 miles from here, on the road from Montgomery to Kingston. I sent cavalry forward to pass up both roads and ascertain which way they were coming, I got the news two days ago at Cumberland Gap, and reached here this evening with my disposable force, a distance of 71 miles, one regiment having started from that gap and got up to within 15 miles of this position.
Just as I entered the road from Knoxville to Montgomery a messenger was passing from Colonel McClellan to Colonel Wood, at Knoxville, and I found he had a dispatch for me, stating that the information he had given on the 4th was founded in error. This letter is dated yesterday. He says there is a camp of the enemy 5 miles east of Monticello, but he does not know its strength or character. His pickets have been into Monticello. He is encamped at Camp McGinnis, 8 or 9 miles north of Jamestown. He says that he has not heard

of Stanton and Murray for two days, but understands they are approaching.
I have determined to fallback to Jacksborough and completely blockade the two wagon roads through the mountains in that neighborhood. I have written to Stanton, Murray, and McClellan to unite their forces, and make a stand in a strong position, if they can find it, where the wagon road ascends the mountain from Monticello to Jamestown, forming intrenchments for the infantry commanding the pass. I left the regiments of Colonels Church well and Rains at Cumberland Gap, busily engaged in completing the works there. Within a week or ten days I think the defenses there will be very strong. I think the Jacksborough routes can soon be made effectively impassable, and then I hope to move by the Jamestown route and advance.
If you will examine the topography of the country you will perceive I have passed to this point along a valley at the foot of the mountain. The road is good. To pass from Jacksborough direct to Huntsville or Montgomery or Jamestown direct, I would have to pursue a mountain road, poor and broken, and the mountain is generally 30 or 40 miles wide.

General Johnston orders you to send to-morrow morning 1,200 infantry and one half-section of artillery (including one howitzer), under an intelligent officer, to Jamestown and Tompkinsville. This force will be increased by a squadron from Colonel Terry’s command. This is the information reported to the general, viz: There are 400 or 500 of the enemy in Jamestown, and an additional force supposed to be at Tompkinsville. The orders to be given to the commanders are these, viz: Go to Jamestown, and if the enemy are there, and not in too great force, attack and destroy them. Proceed to Tompkinsville and do the same thing. Inform him in advance that he moves through a wooded country, and his infantry should cover his cavalry and artillery, with the exception of a few troops with the advanced guard to act as messengers. If possible examine the roads leading to Gallatin, as it is reported that attempts will be made by the enemy to reach and cut the railway in that district. Report from time to time, and return to this place as soon as these orders are executed or it is apparent they cannot be. Create the impression in the country that this force is only an advance guard.

Sir : I now renew my reply # to your favor of 22d ultimo on some points not before answered.
1st. I concur entirely in your view about the arrangement of the commissariat at Nashville, and I have ordered Capt. T. K. Jackson’s promotion to major in the Commissary Department, and specie has been ordered up from Savannah to be sent to him, so that he may obtain Kentucky bank notes for his purchases.
2d. The President and Cabinet consider that the act of Congress prohibiting the exportation of certain commodities from the Confederacy except through seaports is not applicable to such portions of Kentucky as are held by our armies under military rule. At the same time the policy of the Government would be violated by introducing articles not required for the consumption of the people. We therefore suggest, as the best plan, that you announce that you will issue licenses to loyal Kentuckians within your lines for the introduction of such Southern products as sugar, molasses, rice, &c. (but not cotton or naval stores), as shall suffice for the consumption of the inhabitants, taking care not to allow any to cross your lines into the section of the country occupied by the enemy.
3d. Whatever may be our rights, if we consider Kentucky to be in a state of war against us, it is not considered politic to exercise them as regards any taxation of the inhabitants. On the contrary, we think it would be advisable to issue a proclamation declaring that your army will protect the people against the collection of a tax to which they have not consented, and which has been imposed on them by a body of men assuming to be their legislators, but who were compelled by

the threats and duress of despotic power to levy taxes known to be in opposition to the will of the people, and intended for the prosecution of a war against their brethren which the people of Kentucky have solemnly denounced as unjust and unconstitutional at a time when they were able to express their will unawed by the legislature.
4th. Since my last letter the President has, as you requested, appointed Major Stewart a brigadier-general. You had written his name Stuart, and we were unable to find out who the officer was, till a letter from himself enabled us to locate him.
5th. The President has also appointed General Crittenden to be major-general, to take command of the Cumberland Gap district, where we hope to send re-enforcements almost immediately, and where the command will be too large for a brigadier. He will report to you by letter. With the addition of these two generals to Generals Breckinridge and Marshall, recently appointed, it is supposed that the number of your general officers will be sufficiently increased to enable you to organize your forces effectively for the present, and avoid the necessity for further appointments till the developments of the campaign shall indicate which of your officers really merit promotion to such high rank.
Gth. I fear it will not be possible to appoint a colonel for the Third Kentucky Kegiment to succeed General Tilghman, as proposed by you. The lieutenant-colonel has a right to promotion under the law, unless incompetent, and in that event the major must be promoted over him, just as in the regular service. The promotion must take place, unless you are able to report that there is no commissioned officer in the regiment competent to be colonel, in which event the President would be justified in making an outside appointment.
A petition has been sent to the President by the chamber of commerce of Memphis, remonstrating against the action of General Polk in interfering with the free commerce in grain. This action of General Polk is not approved by the Government, and is in violation of the policy we have made it a special point to pursue in all parts of the Confederacy. Our people have been so generous and cordial in yielding their support, and have been so unstinting in their sacrifices and contributions in this war, that it is due to them that the utmost confidence be reposed in their patriotism and readiness to aid in the supply of the Army. We prefer to buy at somewhat high prices to making any seizure or impressment of property. We have left commerce free in everything but the arms and munitions of war indispensable for defense. There is no danger of any deficiency in the supply of bread. It can always be procured at reasonable prices. Our people are jealous of their liberties, and impatient of any control over their private rights not clearly necessary. For these reasons the President thinks there was error of judgment in the embargo laid by General Polk on the trade in grain, and he desires that the obstruction to free commerce imposed by that embargo be removed.
We have as yet received only telegraphic dispatches of the results of the battle of Belmont, but enough is known to inspire us with liveliest joy, and to make us impatient for such further details as will enable us to express to the generals and their gallant troops our high sense of their conduct.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. P. BEKJAMIK, Acting Secretary of War.

John F. Tanner,
Of Messrs. J. R. Anderson & Go., Richmond) Va.:
I have just returned from Kentucky, and from the best information I could get I am satisfied that Zollicoffer’s command is in great danger, and Virginia and the Army of the Potomac are in great peril of beiug cut off by the line of road in Eastern Tennessee falling into the hands of our enemies, and unless the Government will send re-enforcements to that point, and that without delay, we are in the utmost peril. We have as much as we can do to protect Kashville and Memphis, and cannot spare a man. We now have ten or twelve regiments in the field without a gun. There is no wani^of men, but we are ruined unless we get guns. Go to your friends who have influence with the War Department, and urge them to help Zollicoffer, and do it speedily, unless they are willing to be cut off from the West, and suffer disaster and ruin. I regard this the most dangerous point we now have. There are as many enemies in the rear as in front. Do not delay. Cannot some of the troops in Western Virginia go into winter quarters at Cumberland Gap as well as anywhere else? We look alone to the Department to support this point. Walker’s brigade here cannot move for want of guns. Johnston has ordered it to support Zollicoffer, but Walker says he has not a gun and cannot move, and does not know when lie can.
Yours, truly,

Hopkinsville, Ky., November 11,1861.
Col. W. W. Mackall,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Bowling Green:
Sir: I am glad to be able to report uimprovement” in my whole command, and the gradual assuming of form and energy in every department. A thorough change in my entire hospital arrangement, by the use of appropriate buildings and the procurement of proper supplies, aided by thorough police, has produced the results usually attainable through such means. The cheerful and able assistance rendered me by those of my own staff, as well as many of the regimental officers, is deserving of high commendation. The command, however, is yet very insufficient for the objects I know you would desire to have attained, and as it seems my only hope is in a patient waiting for re-enforcements, I can only hope I may now he allowed a little respite from the constant danger, real, that has surrounded me for the last ten days.
The movements referred to in your last communication—the crossing of Federal troops over Green River—were watched by my scouts, who were thrown out as far as within 9 miles of Ashbysburg, and also to Pond River Bridge, on the road from Greenville to Madisonville. As the scouts retired by way of Madisonville and Nebo towards Princeton, Shackelford occupied Madisonville with 500 infantry and 300 of Jackson’s cavalry, whilst some 300 more of Jackson’s cavalry crossed Pond River at the point referred to above, coming out from Greenville; they (the latter) advanced to ‘‘White Plains” (see the map). The best information I could get led me to believe that there was a force of some two regiments of infantry moving up behind them from Greenville, or more likely from Calhoun, by way of Millport and Clark Cross-Roads, the whole of both forces to concentrate on Hopkinsville, by the Madisonville and White Plains roads.
The relative position of parties here described was that held this morning at 8 o’clock. I got a good position to meet them in, and could have successfully handled them, I am well assured. My right, comiiosed of the Third Mississippi and Kentucky battalion, under Colonel Davidson, resting on the right of the Greenville road, just south of the bridge (a very strong position), to be assisted by three pieces of artillery. My left, composed of the First Mississippi and a battalion of Texans, rested on the Madisonville road near Brenaugh Bridge, supported by three pieces of artillery. The center was held by the seven remaining companies of Texans on a cross road connecting the right and left, with one piece of artillery. The latter force was intended as a reserve, inasmuch as its front could not be reached easily, and the cross road gave easy access to the right or left. A small cavalry force co-operated with each body, and a small force left in the town.
Much to the chagrin of the men we were relieved at 5 o’clock of our anxiety by a messenger from Madisonville, giving me reliable information that the enemy, becoming alarmed, struck camp and retired precipitately to Ashbysburg; the Greenville force (exaggerated) having gone northward also. I still hold my positions on the two roads, retiring the Texan regiment back to town, and shall do so until my next messenger arrives, when I will resume my original ground. I will send you a map, which will give you full details. General Buckner will understand the ground I took. I do not complain of this disappointment 5 the men are instructed better in this way, and a repetition of it insures alacrity and vigilance. I never saw men more enthused and at the same time more steady. The scout referred to in the first part

of this, hearing of the crossing near Dyersburg, on the Cumberland, of one of those predatory bands of Germans (59) from Smithland, continued on towards the Cumberland, came upon their rear retreating. They escaped, losing one man, whom our scouts ran into the river, where he was drowned. The scout commanded by Captain Meriwether, a most valuable man, rendered good service throughout, especially in reassuring our people in a measure, and checking an attempt by the enemy to drive off stock.
I should remark that the beginning of the stampede at Madisonville was occasioned by the arrival, by an unexpected road, of the Jackson Cavalry advance from White Plains. The cry was raised by some one “the rebels are coming.” The shock was too violent, as one messenger declared, and they concluded to retire. Upon hearing of this whole movement by the enemy, I promptly sent a courier to the commanding officer at Russellville, requesting him, if practicable, to advance a small force towards Sulphur Lick, and cut off the retreat of any part of their force taking the Greenville road.
Should my force go on improving as it has done in the last few days, I feel satisfied that, with security against a fire in my rear from the Cumberland, I could deal them a heavy blow on Green River.
I am collecting by a simple process the means of transportation for my brigade, so that I may be able to act if circumstances permit. I would be glad to have some instructions on this point, so that I may not act too much at variance with the commanding generaPs views. You will remember that I came without instructions from him, save a verbal one. I have started with this people just as I mean to continue. The community are very bitter, and gave me much trouble at first. I have tightened the screws until I have them in complete control. The Federal troops have arrested many inoffensive Southern men, one of whom was whipped most unmercifully after being taken to Henderson, and then sent to New York Harbor. I have retaliated so far as the arrest goes, only arresting those, however, who are actively engaged in aiding our enemies. I have been obliged to arrest to-day three of the citizens of this place, who were reported as being actively engaged in arranging with the Union men to rise behind me in case the enemy had advanced upon my position to-day. I shall hold them for a while at any rate.
I neglected to copy my communication before the last, and am not sure that I mentioned to you that, hearing from Nashville that the governor had men in camp, but no arms, I wrote to him in my strait here that I could arm 500 from arms I had here. To this he replied yesterday that he would send me the men. May I ask the commanding generaPs approval of this % The men, I hear, will be here to-morrow. I can arm them well. The scouting parties have been successful in looking up the arms sent here to the Union men. A detachment came in to-day with two full boxes of new percussion muskets, which they dug out of a hole where a notorious character had buried them. With a view to greater efficiency, I have organized all the companies of Kentucky infantry into a battalion, and allowed them to elect, for temporary purposes, a lieutenant-colonel and major. There are nine companies in all, three of whom only have the requisite number authorized by law for a minimum company. The aggregate number is 58G. I see not much chance to complete the regiment. It is the same that Colonel Burnett, I believe, was to command, and he does not seem to interest himself much in filling it up. I desire to have instructions particularly on this point. Captain Wilcox, who commands a very good cavalry com-

pany, the same that was routed near Eddyville, represents to me that he needs some thirty horses to replace those taken by the enemy on that occasion. His company had been regularly mustered into service, but his horses were not valued. He lost quite a number of guns and saddles, bridles, &c. Captain Wilcox is a very efficient man. I desire some instructions also on this subject. The colonels of the First and Third Mississippi Begiments desire to know if, in making up their first pay rolls, they can embrace the period spent in the service of the State before being turned over to the Confederate States, inasmuch as the Confederate States were indebted to the State of Mississippi. My own reply was in the negative, but promised to lay the matter before the commanding general. You will therefore please advise me what to do.
Can the brigade quartermaster arrange at once for the commutation for clothing for this command, so that he may be able to pay for what is being made and refund what has been advanced for clothing by other quartermasters, or in any way arrange for a speedy equipment of the army here f If this can be done, I can in two weeks have the command in perfect order. I shall send forward an estimate for pay of officers, and funds for quartermaster’s department, such as purchase of artillery horses, mules, wagons, forage, &c. Under my instructions, I am organizing thoroughly my transportation department, so that I shall have full amount in case of need in front or rear. I will send forward in a few days nominations for my staff. Having no quartermaster regularly commissioned, I have appointed an acting assistant quartermaster, and. taken his bond for $30,000.
Bequesting your earliest attention to the several points mentioned, I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Maj. Gen. W. J. Hardee :
General : We have just arrived safely at this point. I left in Scotts-ville one man hurt by falling from wagon and two sick. The people of Scottsville, as a general thing, appear to be with us. We had an enthusiastic reception. We took them by surprise. Not so here; they knew of our approach Saturday night, and seem bitterly hostile. Nearly every house has some member with friend in the Lincoln Army. We have forded some streams that in very rainy weather are impassable. One of our skirmishers of the advance guard saw 40 or 50 cavalry and infantry, doubtless of the enemy, within a mile of this camp. I have a party now on their track. We can get nothing from the inhabitants, except that the men are all absent and gone to some camp, but where the camp is I can’t find out. I will start on my mission early in the morning.
Since writing the above I have positive information that the enemy (probably in small force) are somewhere concealed in our neighborhood. You may rely on my taking every precaution. The country from here to Barren Biver is admirably adapted to a surprise. The ford over this river is from two to three feet deep. I will not have enough provision to last the expedition.

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk:
My Dear Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of yours of November 6, which I had the pleasure to receive from your son, and to reply that I think the present condition of the service imperiously demands your continuance in the Army, at least until there is such change as will justify me in substituting you by another.
I did not expect General Johnston to relieve you of your special charge, nor is it possible that he should do so. His command embraces so great an extent of territory, that its successful defense must mainly depend upon the efficiency of the division commanders.
You are master of the subjects involved in the defense of the Mississippi and its contiguous territory. You have just wou a victory, which gives you fresh claim to the affection and confidence of your troops. How should I hope to replace you without injury to the cause which you beautifully and reverently described to me when you resolved to enter the military service as equally that of our altars and our firesides'? Whilst our trust is in God as our shield, He requires of us that all human means shall be employed to justify us in expecting His favor.
I must ask of you, then, to i>ostpone your resignation, and to be assured that I will not forget your desire to resume your functions as bishop of a diocese of the church, and will be happy to gratify your wish as soon as the public welfare will permit.

could get a number of tbe citizens to turn out and unite with such men as I could mount, but when I started my men, after a delay far beyond the hour appointed, there were but six of them to be found. The party, 21 altogether, is too small to effect much, and [I] fear will be able to bring back but little information.
Up to Monday there was no considerable body of troops in Greenville. No troops at all have been stationed there, but scouting parties of from 25 to 75 men are almost daily sent into the place and several miles south of it. The force at Caihoun is large, by report 6,000 to 10,000, and a considerable body—2,000 infantry and 300 cavalry—is reported to have been moved in a southwardly direction. They have recruited largely from the second Congressional district, and Calhoun has no doubt been their place of rendezvous. There is no doubt that cavalry has been passed from some point to Pond River Bridge, and perhaps a larger force than stated above. My information as to scouting parties scouring Mecklenburg County and coming south of Greenville is reliable.

No measure of precaution within our command shall be neglected, and the loyal citizens of East Tennessee may rest assured that every energy of the Government shall be exerted in their behalf and for the common cause in Tennessee, but it is impossible to withdraw General Elzey’s brigade at this time from the front of the enemy.

have definite information respecting Williams7 intentions,77 and “if Williams retires by Pound Gap your (my) forward movement must be from Abingdon, where your troops should be concentrated in that event.77
I left Wytheville the day before yesterday (Sunday, 10th), having ordered Moore to detach his major to move the two companies of his regiment which are on the road between Abingdon andjkmnd Gap immediately to Pound Gap, and to follow himself with the other five companies so soon as his arms arrived (for he had no arms for the five com-Xianies so late as last Sunday, and fie had no blankets or overcoats, and I did not intend to wait for them). I ordered Trigg to move on this road with Jeffries7 battery so soon as his transportation arrived (expected to arrive Sunday, and did so arrive). I would not wait for the caisson any longer, but ordered the gun and ammunition to be brought along, and a squad to remain and bring up the empty caisson. I came forward alone, and met the courier at Sharon, 18 miles from Wytheville, returning from Williams, and received there the intelligence from Williams that he occupied tfie night of the 8th “ in preparing to fall back in the direction of Pound Gap,77 and that he should “ fall back until I (he) can make a stand or am re-enforced. Our route will be towards Abingdon.77
I send inclosed herewith Colonel Williams7 letter to me,* remarking thereon that Colonel Williams was not personally in the action he describes, but it Was fought by Capt. Jack May; and I have learned from very cool and intelligent soldiers who participated in the fight that the action lasted about three-quarters of an hour—300 on our side against 1,500 on the other side; our loss some 5 or G killed, 15 to 18 wounded; theirs very heavy—from 175 to 200 killed and wounded. Their force consisted solely of infantry and artillery. The ambuscade was very X>erfect, and the action a very decided success.
I have no means of knowing at this moment whether the enemy occupies Piketon, for from all I hear from credible sources I think he has cautiously taken just what has been abandoned to him. I do not mean to intimate that any point has been abandoned unwisely or precipitately, for I have no means of forming a military judgment on these points, and I appreciate the sense of responsibility under which an officer acts who has charge of an undiscix>lined and badly-armed force; yet I see no reason for alarm, exactly, in the events which have transpired in the movements from Prestonburg to Piketon, &c.
Colonel Williams does not account at all for one of the columns he heard was moving upon his flank, nor does he estimate the size of the other on John7s Creek. The central one is properly estimated at 1,500 in sight at the action of the 8th, which occurred 12 miles below Piketon, and it may be that this force all came from Paintsville or all came from Prestonburg. My speculation is that the enemy by this time has occupied Piketon, and this judgment is founded on the idea that he will do so when he finds it has been abandoned. Where will he then go? Will he xmrsue Williams to Pound Gap, or will he let Williams go, and come through what he supposes to be an unobstructed country down upon this road, pass Buchanan County, descend upon Bichland, (20 miles from this x>oint,) destroy the salt works and the railroad between Wytheville and Abingdon, and hold a position at Richland until re-enforced ? This can be done, sir, by 300 cavalry, who would be perfectly unobstructed, and who could ravage all the country to the vicinity of Wytheville. The loss to us would be irreparable, for the whole Confederacy depends upon these salt works greatly.

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap, m
I have gravely considered the duty before me under the light of your dispatch and my position, and have determined for the present not to alter my instructions to Colonel Trigg, who, I presume, is on his line of march to this point, at any rate, to-day. My reason is this: The town of Jeffersonville is situated on the headwaters of the Clinch Eiver, 45 miles from Wytheville. From it to the westward open two valleys, which unite again in the county of Scott. Down one of these (the southern), running a little south of west, is a good* turnpike valley road to Lebanon 38 miles, thence to Hansonville 7 miles, making hence to Hansonville 45 miles. The road from Abingdon to Hansonville is 21 miles, and the regiment moving from Abingdon to Pound Gap passes Hansonville on the way to Gladesville. The distance from Wytheville to Abingdon is 56 miles by the road, or to Hansonville from Wythfeville 77 miles ; to which add the day’s march of Trigg to return to Wytheville, 16 miles, makes 93 miles to go to Hansonville. By this point to Hansonville, from the end of this day’s march, 73 miles, to wit: 45 and 28=73 ; so that if I must go to Pound Gap road, and leave this country open, by this point from where Trigg is to-night is 20 miles nearer than to return by Wytheville. The wagons must move by the road, and the companies cannot go forward without the wagons. Transportation cannot be had at Abingdon; so Colonel Moore intimated to me at Wytheville. Again, 1 mile from this town to the southeast the road from the Tug Fork of Sandy comes into the road hence to Wytheville, and a force may be approaching by that route to cut this line of communication, though I do not know such is the fact*
From this point to Eichland is 20 miles on the road to Piketon, and thence across to Lebanon road is 5 miles, but a bad road for wagons. At Eichland the road to Piketon makes a turn northward towards Buchanan Court-House. At Eichland my force would be within 30 miles of Hansonville, by which Moore must pass to the Pound Gap, and at that point I would cover the way to the salt works and Abingdon should the enemy follow the Wytheville road, which Colonel Williams leaves open, and yet pickets can communicate from the Tug Fork road. Eichland is the wealthiest neighborhood in Tazewell County, and most productive.
My plan is to send forward scouts on the Tug Fork road to ascertain if any force is coming in that direction; to send forward force of scouts on the Wytheville road, to see if he approaches by that direction; to move Trigg and the battery to Eichland, if proper to do so, and there to determine my course, whether to advance on Piketon by this road or to re-enforce Moore and Williams at Pound Gap, and contest that ground with the enemy, if he is pursuing Williams on that road. The people on this road are much alarmed at the aspect of affairs and have urged me to call out the militia. I know of no legal authority for me to do so, unless instructed by the President, and shall not exercise it unless so instructed. The officer in command of this brigade informs me he will send a messenger to Eichmond, and I avail myself of the chance to send you this, requesting that you will consider my views, and unless your own mind is made up (I mean the Secretary’s, of course), that you will leave the movements here to my judgment and responsibility, satisfied that 1 shall act only upon such reasons as have in view the public interest and the success of my arms. Had I listened to the spasmodic efforts of the popular mind I should have been launched into East Tennessee to guard the railroad and burning bridges or to defend Bristol.

same popular clamor—the offspring of excitement and alarm. I think it will be proper to avail ourselves of the militia, of which, I understand, this county can turn out about 500 and Buchanan about 150, and the counties west about an equal number, at least until the enemy is pressed beyond the gorges of the mountains should he attempt to pass them. I telegraphed you to let me have another battery, for which I made requisition while at Richmond. I repeat that request npw; also, I request urgently that another regiment or two may be sent forward if they can be possibly spared from other important fields of service, until I can call on General Johnston and get two of the new Tennessee levies.

Colonel: During my stay at Clarksville, from evening of 9th instant to morning of the 11th, I decided upon the position for a battery of three 32-pounders to command the river approach to that town; also as to the position for a small field work to hold the high ground commanding the road leading across the Hopkinsville bridges. Mr. Sayers, civil engineer, is now engaged in laying out the works and employing laborers for their construction. At Clarksville I also employed a competent person to establish a timber obstruction in the Cumberland River under the range of the guns of Fort Donelson.

through the quartermaster’s department chartered a steamer to go to Fort Donelson, to be employed in placing the obstructions in the river. Yesterday and to-day I have been making reconnaissances around this city, to determine the points for defense, especially against a force approaching by way of the river. The guns I proposed for this defense— 32-pounders and 8-inch columbiads—should be obtained with the least delay practicable. In this city no guns of these sizes ar§ being made.

Hdqrs. Advance Guard, Hardee’s Division,
Tomphinsville, Kg., November 13, 1861.
Major-General Hardee, Commanding Division, &c.:
General: We arrived at this place on yesterday evening about 5 o’clock. We did not find a friend along the whole road from Jamestown here; the houses were closed, the country apparently deserted. We saw a few women and children, but in almost every instance they were surprised and tried to run and conceal themselves at our approach; they have been told, and evidently believed, that we were burning, killing, and destroying as we advanced. One old woman met us with an open Bible in her hand, said she was prepared and ready to die, and j could not be convinced that we meant her no harm. As we entered this town, having sent a party in ‘advance to prepare for our encampment, I ordered the advance guard to fall back, our bands to the front, our colors opened, bayonets fixed, and the march at attention resumed, for the purpose of making the strongest display we could. In this order we got nearly to the center of this town, when I was so astonished at the utter silence and desertion, not having seen a human being but two, who both fled, and not having heard from the party sent in advance, that I halted, under the belief the enemy must be at hand, sent our music away, loaded a strong advance guard, and sent out skirmishers, and advanced in this way until we met the party sent out under Major Glenn to select a camp. I merely mention this as an illustration of the feeling existing among the people here. To-day most of the women and children have returned, but all the men (a dozen, perhaps, excepted) are absent in Grider’s camp at Columbia.
There is a rumor here that a detachment of Rousseau’s force, 10,000 or 15,000 strong, is advancing, and but a few miles from here. This I regard as too false to base any calculation whatever upon it. I am satisfied of one thing, there is no force on any of the roads leading to Gallatin, Tenn., and no very immediate danger to the railroad in that quarter from auy section of the country through which I have passed. The people here are under the impression that the Federals have possession of the railroad south of Bow ling Green, and that we are only waiting a favorable opportunity to get away from there. This and'the thousand other lies and influences brought to bear upon them have sent them by hundreds to Grider’s camp at Columbia. This is the nearest camp to us.. There are two regiments of Kentucky volunteers there, and hundreds have fled there in front of our advance. I am informed, however, they are dissatisfied with their officers, dispirited, badly armed, and many down with measles. I am reliably informed that there are few, 35 R R—VOL iv

if any, slave owners among them, and the majority are fighting for the $13 a month and other pecuniary inducements. Did my instructions permit an advance on their camp, I would not hesitate to make it. 1 believe they would leave, and even if they fought, unless strongly re-enforced, I believe we could destroy them. The alacrity with which they fled from this strongly defensible country, leaving their wives, daughters, and children to the tender mercies of supposed ravishers, murderers, and barbarians, shows they are not yet very formidable as soldiers.
I made it my special business and used every effort to convince the people we were friends to all but soldiers in arms against us and those giving them aid and information. I think on the whole we have succeeded. No insult or injury to the person of any one has come to my notice. I am sorry to state that on yesterday, for the first time, the same respect was not paid to property. Our teamsters, rear guard, and guard with the teams, and individuals who fell back under the pretense of being sick, stole some poultry and other things along the road. I think this conduct was confined to a very few; but it was witnessed by officers, who never exercised their authority to put it down, and it only comes to my knowledge now when it is too late to repair it.
On reaching the residence of Colonel Frame, a bitter enemy, in open arms against us, the chief circulator of all the slanders against us, a man who has ordered the plundering of all the southern-rights men he could find, I ordered his house, late headquarters of his camp at same place, to be searched for arms and ammunition. We found immense quantities of empty gun boxes, receipts for Lincoln guns sent through the country, and all other indications of a recruiting camp. I ordered one quartermaster to seize sheep enough on the place to do us for two or three days; also to take some tallow, sweet oil, and turpentine, which we were in great need of. I then ordered the house to be closed up and nothing else taken. Some unprincipled men took advantage of this circumstance to commence stealing on their own account.
In view of this state of affairs I immediately issued and caused to be read to the men the inclosed special order (marked A#).
Friday, November 15, 1861.
I found it unsafe to send a dispatch back, unless with such a force as I could not spare. I am camped here, 7 miles west of Tompkinsville, and expect to be at Jamestown or beyond by night. On the 13th, 12 m., I advanced on the Columbia road, with the intention of taking the Burkesville and Glasgow road home. My guides represented it to me as the best road, and as my orders were silent as to route returning, I thought it best to take the easiest and that which would most advance the object in view, which, as I understood, was to make a strong impression (on the people of these hostile counties) as to our strength and readiness to exert it. I feared a return by same route might be construed into a retreat, especially as the enemy were reported on this road, within a few miles of our camp. For these and other good reasons, which I will give when I get back, I determined to take this route. We started at 12 m., intending to make McRea7s Cross-Roads (9 miles distant, as I was informed by everybody at Tompkinsville, but which I found utterly untrue). I managed it so as to make the impression on everybody I would take a different road, and then suddenly turned off on this road. Two miles from town, my advanced guard jumped the enemy’s pickets. The Texas Rangers, 10 in front, gave chase, followed 4 miles, when they suddenly found themselves in

presence of 40 U. S. cavalry. Our men fell back and sent for re-euforcements. I sent on 20 more cavalry to join them, and ordered GO more to keep well in advance of our infantry and to keep up communication with the party in chase. By the time we had advanced 7 miles night was coming on, I found the Cross-Roads were 16 instead of 9 miles distant, and the enemy’s scouts were seen on our flanks and even in our rear.
In this state of affairs I halted the main body, taking up a strong position on Skaggs’ Creek. I could not tell whether we were approaching an army or a mere scouting party 5 I was completely in the dark.
1	knew nothing of the general movements of the enemy, not having heard from Bowling Green since I left. I knew, however, they were in great force in front and might get in our rear. In this emergency I determined to have our train loaded for any movement. A hotly pressed retreat through 50 miles of hostile country would, I feared, prove very disastrous, and I determined not to be caught in such a trap. I had false camp fires lighted on every surrounding hill, and a wide line of outlying pickets. In the mean time our cavalry pressed the enemy in the direction of the Cross-Roads so closely that they got confused and dispersed in the woods at McRea’s Cross-Roads. Our cavalry fell on the main body of the enemy’s cavalry, about 100 strong, and after a little skirmish, in which the enemy broke and left and got
2	of their men killed, other men and horses wounded, without damage to us, our cavalry fell back 5 miles to camp for the night.
During the evening and night we captured a number of U. S. dragoon horses, fully accoutered, a number of muskets, pistols, and sabers. A great deal of credit is due Major Harrison, of the Rangers, also Captain Phillips, volunteer, for the way they managed to disorganize and disperse this large body of the enemy’s cavalry in an unknown country in the night, and without one friend among the country people. My infantry pickets captured several U. S. horses, fully accoutered in the most approved style, within our lines. The truth is, the rush of the Rangers so dispersed and confused the enemy that they got lost and were wandering about in every direction, and this accounts for their appearance on our flanks and rear.
I sent Lieutenant Cage, of my regiment, with a dispatch to Major Harrison at midnight, ordering him to fall back on me. Cage and his escort lost their way, got almost into the enemy’s lines, and in returning were tired on by our cavalry picket, and returned the fire before the sad mistake was found out. Cage was shot in the leg, his horse was twice shot, and Bankhead, of the Rangers, was shot badly in the leg and arm.
Yesterday morning, finding the road clear beyond the Cross-Roads, the enemy all fled, and thinking [it] imprudent to advance, blindfold as I was, I commenced returning by the same route I came, and am here this morning. The Rangers advanced to and beyond the Cross-Roads and up the Glasgow road; they heard artillery in the direction of Columbia, and believe a force is advancing along that road. They left Cross-Roads at 1 o’clock yesterday and reached here, a distance of 23 miles, last night.
I doubt whether 'any force is advancing, and do not think the enemy’s cavalry will visit this section soon again. If energetic, the enemy may advance along the Columbia and Jamestown road and attempt to cut us off. I have sent a strong cavalry force ahead to guard against this. The road mentioned is a good one, and Jamestown is as close to Columbia as Tompkinsville. Our advance has been fired at twice from

P. S.—I will have a detailed report of captured property of the enemy made out and sent in.
Camp near Bowling Green,
November 13,1861.
Major-General Hardee,
Commanding First Division, Bowling Green, Ky.:
General : In obedience to orders I left camp on the evening of the 9th instant, in command of a squadron of dragoons, composed of the companies of Captains Gaines and Sugg, numbering 124 men. I encamped that night about 8 miles from Bowling Green. On next day I entered Morgantown about 3 o’clock, having previously turned my wagons off on the road to Rochester. At Morgantown I remained about an hour, sending scouting parties out in the direction of Bora’s Ferry and other roads, without meeting any opposition. Whilst in the town, I made inquiries as to the best points to cross the river for lumber to erect a bridge and for forage sufficient to support about 2,500 cavalry and artillery horses, and other matters relating to an advance of an army of 12,000 or 15,000 men. There were but three men left in this town, which, as I have before reported, is strongly opposed to us.
I learned from a reliable person, before entering the town, that the opposite bank at Bora’s Ferry was protected by some pieces of artillery. Anticipating another attack at that point, I encamped that night about 8 miles from Morgantown, on the road to Rochester. Some three or four men, who lived in the vicinity of our encampment, left soon after our arrival. I posted strong pickets on the roads leading to my camp, also a sufficient camp guard, and sent out patrols. 1 found the neighborhood entirely deserted by men, and learned that 18 men from that point had joined the enemy, and were in camp on the other side of the river.
On the next day I reached Rochester, which I approached cautiously, having heard during my march that a force, estimated at from 8,000 to 10,000 men, were to cross either on Sunday or Monday, with the view of taking possession of Russellville. After a careful reconnaissance, I entered the town, and found but three or four men. The opposite bank was unoccupied. After making inquiries as to the facilities for a large force to cross the river, &c., I marched out by the Russellville road, which I followed to its intersection with the Greenville road, on which I encamped, about 10 miles from Rochester, at a point called Berry’s Lick. From that point I crossed Gaspar River on next day, and encamped after a march of about 15 miles, and on next day, the 13th, I reached our camp at this place at 11 o’clock.
I found the people generally impressed with the idea that a large force of the enemy were on the point of crossing the river at Rochester, and that large re-enforcements had reached their camps from Indiana. They were also filled with apprehension as to the course our troops would pursue towards them. My approach to town was always anticipated by spies, and I have no doubt an exaggerated report of our number and objects of visit has already reached the camp of the enemy.
Very respectfullv, your obedient servant,
JAMES HAGAN,
Major, Commanding Department Detachment.

Headquarters First Brigade, First Division,
Oakland, Ky., November 13, 1861. Lieut. D. G. White, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I have information this morning direct from the enemy's camp, on Kolin, beyond Munfordville, up to yesterday morning. General Sherman was then there with his main force, and there were no indications of any intention to move. His strength ranges from 15,000 to 20,000. According to rumor, coming from so many sources as to seem credible, there is a Federal force at Litchfield of about 2,000 or 3,000 men. A reconnoitering party of the enemy appeared yesterday in Brownsville. The ferry flats at all the ferries from Mammoth Cave to Houcker’s [?], inclusive, were on yesterday moved to the opposite bank of Green Fiver, favoring the idea of a considerable force being in the vicinity. I this morning sent a party of 20 mounted men to that locality, instructed to ford the river and destroy the boats. I have had daily battalion drills since encamping here but no brigade drill. I have no officer who can drill the brigade, and I am not yet fully capable of doing so myself. I am occupied in study of battalion drill, and will undertake to drill the brigade as, soon as possible. If convenient, I should be very glad the general commanding the division would, as proposed in your letter of yesterday, come to this place and drill my brigade.
I am, very respectfully,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Bowling Green:
Sir : A battalion of Colonel Forrest’s cavalry having left the vicinity of Fort Donelson for want of forage and encamped on this side of the Cumberland, at Canton, I have made use of them since my communication of the 11 th in strengthening my force here, retaining them but for thirty-six hours. The command was distant from me only 25 miles, and being fresh, reached me in good order, Major Kelly in command, with about 300 men. To-day I have sent a small force, under Major Kelly, consisting of his own command, 250 infantry, and one piece of artillery, hoping to catch a force of some 300 from below, who have crossed at Foss’ Ferry, on the Cumberland, having in view the capture of a large lot of hogs ready for moving this way, and intended for the agent of the Confederate States at Clarksville (Dr. Blackburn, I think). If I miss them, the move will have a good effect in keeping our people assured and holding the* Hessians in check.
An act of Congress allows, upon application of colonels of regiments, the appointment of cadets for the purpose of instructing inexperienced troops. Colonel Gregg has a fine body of men, but has no one to drill them. He desires me to ask if the commanding general will permit this in his case; if so, I will nominate for him several that I know who are non-commissioned officers and privates in my old regiment, the Third Kentucky. My command still improves; are getting into their new hospitals.

Columbus, November 13, 1861.
Genera] Johnston :
In your dispatch of the 10th [9th?] you say “you have reported no imperious necessity for suspension of the order for the movement of General Pillow’s command.” Intelligence just received has created that imperious necessity. We have undoubted intelligence, making it indispensable that this command should remain in its present position, and that if possible we should have re-enforcements.
L. POLK.
Columbus, November 13, 1861.
Major Mackall :
General [Polk] is not so well. His physician advises repose as absolutely necessary. He directs me to recall my advance and suspend the column upon the ground of an imperious and overruling necessity, involving the safety of this post and of this command, and places me in present command.
We have had for several days intelligence, from sources which wTe know are entitled to full confidence, that the enemy are making preparations upon a gigantic scale to assault. To-day a deserter from Cairo, an artillerist from the fixed battery at Cairo, came in, and said that the movement will be made on this place in the latter part of the coming week. They are bringing all their available forces from the interior of Missouri and Illinois, and will invest this place with 30,000 men.
The state of things here General Polk considers as coming within the purview of Major Mackall’s dispatch, viz: that no report had been made by him showing any imperious necessity for the suspension of the movement of my division. He now makes that report, and seriously assures General Johnston that no necessity more important or urgent could exist. This dispatch is directed by General Polk, and has been read to him and myself. General Cheatham and General McCown all concur, upon full conference, in the statement of fact and opinion expressed.

I think if enemy penetrates Virginia, it will be by this road. Eichland covers the saltworks. Scouts sent forward to ascertain his route. My movements determine from Eichland or this place.

Sir. : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of [14th] this date, and to express the gratification which the announcement of soon being provided with a few thousand Enfield rifles affords me. I shall endeavor as far as practicable, in the urgency for immediate armament, to give those arms into the hands of the troops for the war who are now in the field and not efficiently armed, and then distribute the remainder among the volunteers for shorter periods. I have not been able yet to ascertain how many men have joined the different rendezvous under the call upon the governor of Tennessee. So far as heard from I believe not a large fraction of the number called and very few armed. Under the belief that by proper exertions many of them might be furnished with arms, and at the request of the governor, I have suspended my order for mustering out the unarmed men for fifteen days in Tennessee. The call upon Mississippi not being approved, the order for the discharge of the unarmed men there was not suspended except for those at the rendezvous. I shall further extend the time, to give the opportunity of arming them if possible. I shall soon have emptied the hospitals at this place by transferring the sick to Nashville. My force here has been much diminished by the number of sick.
On the 4th instant, anticipating that the enemy would send a column

OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE. [Chap. XIL
in the direction of Clarksville with the view of turning the right of General Polk’s line of defense, I ordered a division of that command to Clarksville. The battle of Belmont near Columbus intervening delayed the movement of the division, and finally General Polk, his generals concurring, suspended the movement, on the ground that in view of probable movements of the enemy against that position the force called for was necessary there. On the receipt of his telegram announcing that suspension of the movement of the force I reiterated my order for the immediate transfer of the division to his right at Clarksville to reenforce the force at Hopkinsville. He sends me this morning the following telegram, to wit:
A. S. Johnston :
General : We are informed beyond a doubt that there are from 20,000 to 25,000 men at Cairo and vicinity, recruits daily arriving, and that their intention is to march on this place immediately. I will nevertheless send on Pillow’s division, unless otherwise ordered immediately. I will be left 'with about 6,000 effective men. Our defenses are unfinished.
L. POLK.
I therefore revoked my order. General Polks force is stated far below wliat I have estimated it, and with a knowledge of the case as he presents it I had left but the choice of difficulties—the great probability of defeat at Columbus or the successful advance of the enemy on my left. I have risked the latter. The first would be a great misfortune, scarcely reparable for a long time; the latter may be prevented. I have, however, at Nolin, on my front, about 27 regiments, aud a large auxiliary force at Columbia, on my right. The force on my front will not attack here at present ; they will await the success of movements on my left. My force must soon be put in motion. I am making every preparation with that object. It has taken much time to provide transportation, which is nearly completed, and all else, for a force suddenly raised. A portion of my force is well armed and instructed; the remainder badly armed, but improving in all other respects. A good spirit prevails throughout.
General Zollicofier is taking measures to suppress the uprising of the disaffected in Rhea and Hamilton Counties, Tennessee, and if it is true that Williams has retreated through Pound Gap, Marshall could easily suppress the insurrection in Carter, Johnson, and other counties, and then unite his forces with Zollicofier. The force under Zollicofier, as everywhere on this line, should be re-enforced; but this you know without my suggestion. The effective force here is 12,500.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
A. S. JOHNSTON, General, 0. 8. Army.

General Tilghman will be retained by you at Hopkinsville until you are fully posted as to the country and the command.

Headquarters First Brigade, First Division,
Central Army of Kentucky,
Oakland, Ky., November 15,1861. Lieut. D. G. White, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I beg to call attention to the condition of the troops of this brigade enlisted for the term of during the war. By the extraordinary exposure to which they have been subjected discharges and deaths have more than decimated nearly every company. It is manifestly very desirable that these companies shall be recruited speedily up to full strength ; but that is impossible under existing circumstances. Regiments originally enlisted for twelve months, whose terms are now about one-half expired, offer superior inducements, and no recruits are obtained for the war. Unless something is done to counteract this, the strength of regiments enlisted for the war will be more and more reduced, and finally at no distant day their ranks will be so thinned as to destroy their organization. This is now almost the case in some of the companies of the Second Arkansas Regiment and First Arkansas Battalion.
I suggest, as the only efficient remedy, that the pay of soldiers enlisted or enlisting for the war be increased to $25 per month; that their commutation money be increased to $50 for each period of six months; that their pay be continued four months after expiration of service, and also that extra attention be given to their armament, equipments, &e., so as to make their service more desirable and attractive in all respects than service for shorter terms.
There are six-months’ companies armed with Minie muskets and Enfield rifles, while the Second Arkansas Regiment and First Arkansas Battalion, enlisted for the war, have the common flint-lock musket. If this was just oppositely arranged, it would seem more just, and would certainly be more politic.
I request that this communication be forwarded to the Headquarters of the Army at Richmond.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
T. 0. HIKDMAK,
Brigadier- General.
[Indorsement.]
Headquarters Western Department,

I do not doubt that greater inducements should be given men to enroll for during the war. The manner in which the men for short periods yet to serve are armed is due, I suppose, to the States from which they came.

E. K. ZOLLICOFFEE,
Brigadier-General,
Smith’s Cross-Eoads, Tenn., November 15, 1861. Major Commanding,
Second Battalion, Sixteenth Alabama Regiment:
I arrived at Washington on yesterday with my company, and there found about 250 citizens, armed as best they could be under the circumstances. Upon information that I gained from scouts and citizens living near Clift’s camps, I learned that his probable force at Salt Creek camp ground (which is 15 miles below Washington) was from 300 to 500, and there was a force of from 500 to 1,000 somewhere on the mountains at no great distance from his camp. I also learned that citizens from Bradley, Bledsoe, and other counties, who have heretofore acted with the Union party, have visited Clift’s camps, with the ostensible purpose of getting them to disband immediately.
1 deemed it necessary to move my command to Smith’s Cross-Eoads, miles below Washington, that I might be the better enabled to picket and watch their movements. I did so, and my command, numbering 325 men, arrived here late last evening. I immediately dispatched a small force to take possession of Blythe’s and Daughtie’s Ferries. Since my arrival here I have further information that a part of Clift’s force in the valley have gone, but there still remain with him about 180 men, who say they are determined to tight. If the programme, as 1 have it, is carried out, we have them completely cut off, except by the way of the mountains. Our cavalry force is sufficient to stop them in that direction, but I deem it prudent to await your orders.

Columbus, Ky., November 16, 1861. Col. John S. Bowen, Camp Beauregard:
Colonel : I thank yon for the intelligence afforded by your dispatch. Its contents are confirmed by that received from all other sources. The enemy is making preparations upon a large scale to invest this place. My opinion is that he will aim to avoid a conflict or assault on our works, but will surround my position, cut off our supplies, and aim to reduce the place by distress, at the same time harassing us with his gunboats. To provide for this state of things I have procured the fleet of Commodore Hollins, consisting of four gunboats and two floating batteries, mounting in all about 50 or 60 guns. I am making extraordinary efforts to prepare for the enemy’s reception. If you have not yet destroyed the cars I am willing for you to exercise your discretion as to the time of doing so, but do not take too much risk upon that subject. For the enemy to get possession of the cars would be a great point gained by him. If the enemy should throw his forces around my position and cut off communication with you (a possible contingency), you must be prepared to advance upon and attack him in rear; or, in certain contingencies, to dash upon Paducah (if its garrison should be greatly reduced) and seize that place. In other words, confiding much in your judgment, you must have and exercise a large discretion. I will keep you advised, as well as I can, of the condition of things here, and you must aid me in doing so. With the fleet of gunboats we will destroy the enemy in the end, but we will have hard fighting and plenty of it. If you do not want Wickliffe’s command jve can use him here most advantageously, but you must so fortify your position as to be able to maintain your own ground, and, if necessary, assail him around mine. I speak of Wickliffe, because Captain King said you did not want Wickliffe unless he and King could or would unite their commands.

If they have crossed, and the force is not overpowering, let him attack it. If, however, the enemy’s force is too great, direct him to take a strong position to await re-enforcements, or fall back to this place to receive them.

I arrested a man to-day who says he has just escaped from the North. I believe him to be a Northern spy. I took some Cincinnati papers from him. He says the enemy were falling back from Columbia to Camilsville [Campbellsville]; that they were in consternation ; that he met a party carrying some wounded to Columbia 5 that they seemed frightened, and did not stop to question him. One of the men killed at Cross-Roads was Lieutenant Clark, a

renegade Tennesseean, of Captain Dickenson’s company, U. S. Cavalry (he was shot in the stomach, and died in six hours) ; the other was shot below the left shoulder. Others were wounded.
I have examined into the circumstances of the pickets firing on each other. The picket stationed was not to blame. Mr. Cage and his escort got north of the picket and came galloping back from the direction of the enemy, riding captured horses with their gaudy trappings, and were mistaken for the enemy; and when the bring commenced, instead of calling out the name of one of the Hangers whom the picket would have known, they called, u It’s Cage! It’s Cage! ” This continued the picket, and they kept up the lire. I have x>aid out of my own pocket for the articles stolen by our men. Confidence is restored, all the houses open, and families returned. Trunks and other articles fou.ul by our flankers in the woods I had carried to the house and labeled “Returned by Southern soldiers.” The people all acknowledge they have been grossly lied to. Colonel Frame has another farm here at the river. I supplied our men with meat from it last night, and left word for the colonel that I would settle with him if he would come and see us at Bowling Green.

Nashville, Tenn., November 17,1861. General A. Sidney Johnston:
The following just received from General Pillow at Columbus:
Immense numbers of enemy are gathering on my front. I anticipate being entirely surrounded and cut off from supplies as fairly within the range of probabilities. The works at Fort Pillow are nearly completed and are entirely defensible. My force at Union City is entirely too weak to protect that flank. My judgment is that you should call out the militia of West Tennessee, should place 10,000 men in Fort Pillow, and the balance at Union City or that vicinity. I mean, of course, such as have arms. The works at Fort Pillow should be supplied with powder. We are very short here. We will hold the place and light to the end ; but I should be false to my duty to the country did I not place before you my sense of the'danger with which it is menaced.
If you concur in the opinion of General Pillow, I will call out the militia at any moment.

In turning over your command at Hopkinsville, in pursuance of Special Orders, No. 89, you will repair to the Cumberland, and assume command of Forts Donelson and Henry and their defenses and the defenses of the intermediate country. You will push forward the completion of the works and their armament with the utmost activity, and to this end will apply to the citizens of the surrounding country for assistance in labor, for which you will give them certificates for amounts due for such labor. You will make your requisitions for quartermaster, subsistence, and ordnance stores upon the chiefs of the several departments at these headquarters.
The utmost vigilance is enjoined. The general regrets to hear that there has been heretofore gross negligence in this respect—the commander at Fort Donelson away from his post nightly ancl the officer in charge of the field batteries frequently absent. This cannot be tolerated.
I will ask Governor Harris to-morrow for four additional armed companies, which he will send to Fort Donelson. These, with the six companies now there, will make up a regiment, when organized by the election of field officers. The colonel will command the fort.
You will then order Lieutenant-Colonel MacGavock to return to his regiment at Fort Henry. Your command is embraced in the division of Major-General Polk, to whom you will report monthly.

If General Johnston cannot fill your requisition, it will be impossible to do it from here.
S. COOPEB,
Adjutant and Inspector-General.
Memphis, November 18,1861.
General A. Sidney Johnston:
My Dear Sir : I have been unavoidably detained by our legislature. They have sent me to the C. S. Senate, which makes of mine a life of civil service. Had it been otherwise, I should have thrown up my position in the Provisional Congress and attached myself to your command for the war.
And here allow me again to express to you the high appreciation and grateful sense in which I hold the appointment and position with which you honored me on your personal staff. I had expected to join you for a few days on my way to Congress, but I find here that the Congress (meeting to-day) has not one Representative from Arkansas present, and that my presence is specially required there on account of the various treaties of amity with the numerous Indian tribes which are depending before Congress and the Government, and which, to secure them, must be ratified without delay. Not to be able to report myself to you at this day is matter of sincere regret, as it may deprive me [of] the power of fully ascertaining and personally representing your wishes at the capital. Yet in all matters and instances in which you may think my humble services can be of avail to promote your views, I beg you will not hesitate to command them by your letters.
There are persons enough to keep you advised of affairs on the Mississippi River far better than I can. I will venture, however, to call to your attention the war on the borders of Arkansas, in Missouri, Kansas, and the Indian Territory. You were aware of my earnest desire that the Missouri war should have secured your personal presence; but you were called to a more difficult and perhaps more glorious field, and though I could but regret the fact, I could say nothing against it. Now, the difficulty still exists that I had hoped was remedied. There is no superior officer in Missouri, no unity among the divisions of the army there. Price and McCulloch have had some, and are liable to still more, serious disagreements, and Colonel Borland’s command is wholly independent. No one short of a major-general, and perhaps even a general, can conclusively give orders and command their obedience.
The news here of the withdrawal of Hunter’s (Fremont) army I don’t believe. We are illy prepared in that quarter, yet I expect speedily to hear of a battle, and if we sustain a defeat our treaties will be worthless with the Cherokees and Creeks and with all other tribes except Choctaw's and Chickasaw's. Such a result would be deplorable, and could not be remedied for a great while, and never but by utmost energy and double the force now required for a complete success. I commend these matters to your attention and say no more. You are the better judge of their value and of all or any appropriate remedies.
Yet further I beg you to reflect, all the Confederacy supports the Kentucky war and is within reach, but Missouri makes the truest and most desperate struggle, and has almost no help but Arkansas, a feeble

## p. 563 (#571) ############################################

﻿Chap, xn.] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.----------CONFEDERATE.	563
State. Yet the most effective body of the troops of Arkansas have been called away to Virginia and Kentucky. That this should continue so I submit most respectfully, but seriously, does not seem to me to be either wise or just for Missouri, Arkansas, or the Indian Territories.
If • disaster befalls in your division, it must lie at your door, onerous as your duties are, unless it shall appear that you have fully comprehended the whole field of operations and made every , effort, not for means, but for adequate means, to sustain such high and imposing interests. You have not even a major-general west of the Mississippi River; a country as broad as all Austria, Prussia, and Germany.
It is not so with the enemy and ought not to be so with us. They know the value of Missouri. All Missouri is now in their hands. It w^as not so when you took command, and would not have been so could we have had your presence there. And Arkansas is threatened at two points, and in my judgment will be invaded as subsidiary to their opera1 tions on Memphis and down the Mississippi River. And I cannot regard it, with all respect for Colonel Borland, that he is the proper person to hold the chief command at such a point as Pocahontas, whether by military education or experience in the field. His statement that a column is moving against him I believe, and if not yet true, I am satisfied it must become so with the very first successes of the enemy in Missouri or upon the Mississippi River or in Kentucky.
We have done nothing to assail them in Missouri or to defend in comparison with their preparations. What is it all for ? If Price’s army disbands, we shall soon know. T doubt not you have thought of these matters. One defeat disbands the disorderly and illy-united army of General Price. Success alone can keep it together. The consequences in that State and this valley are too palpable to mention.
The responsibilities, my dear sir, of a command so wide-spread and of two wars at once so distant thrown wholly upon your hands I know to be stupendous and do most anxiously appreciate, and if you have not demanded an officer of the highest rank and experience and all other adequate war material for his operations subject to your orders only I hope you will do so promptly, and I shall be more than happy to receive any expression from you, as it will at once command every effort on my part to sustain you.
One other subject I beg to call to your attention: I understood that the Arkansas regiment formerly Colonel Hindman’s is greatly discontented. It is because of the action of General Hardee placing a stranger from another State over them, and the regiment protests. I learn the facts from Lieutenant-Colonel Bocage, who has resigned. I will not go into the many particulars he relates, embracing the protest of all the officers of the regiment, but will merely say that it is a course pursued towards the troops of no other State, and would be submitted to by no other State quietly. The State of Arkansas has no fame to bank upon that she can see her opportunities sacrificed to the personal preferences of General Hardee, and we all know that honor won by the Missourian, the commanding otficer, would inure to Missouri, if not also reflect upon Arkansas, that she had no man fit, in the opinion of the commanding officer, to lead them. I have protested to the Government against this course, and had wished to lay the matter personally before you, but find I cannot. I feel earnestly upon it, and you will pardon me if I have said too much in this or other respects.
And believe me, sir, with the warmest wishes for your glory and triumph to the end, yours, very truly,
R. W. JOHNSON.

Your rifles will reach you in a day or two. I have also ordered for you 500 sabers, being all on board; also several thousand accouterments, and sufficient cartridges for the rifles.
J. P. BENJAMIN, Acting Secretary of War.
Headquarters Western Department,
Nashville, November 19, 1861.
His Excellency Isham G. Harris,
Governor State of Tennessee, Nashville:
All my information goes to show that the danger is imminent of an invasion of the Confederate States through the northern line of Tennessee, by heavy columns of the enemy attempting to penetrate by the valley of the Mississippi; while other but little less formidable forces cover and threaten the capital by the line of the Cumberland.
I therefore call upon your excellency to assist me to repel and drive back these forces by the armed forces of the State, and beg you to this end to call forth every loyal Soldier of the militia into whose hands arms can be placed, or to provide a volunteer force large enough to use all the arms that can be procured.
A volunteer force is more desirable if it can be raised as promptly as the militia, as more economical and producing less inconvenience to the citizen; but now time is of the first importance, that I may cover the homes of your citizens and save them from the sufferings always attending an invasion. The force you may thus raise in East Tennessee will not be removed from the district until their homes are secure from danger both from the foreign and domestic foe.
I have selected Nashville, Memphis, and Jackson as good points of rendezvous, and at these points staff officers will be prepared to furnish supplies.
Companies will be transported at the expense of the Confederate States from any point at which they are organized to the railroad, and your excellency’s order for the movement will be authority to my officers to pass the same.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. S. JOHNSTON, General, O. S. Army.

Hon. J. P. Benjamin:
I have this day called for the whole force, militia or volunteers, of this State, that can be armed, to meet the advance of what I assume now to be the overwhelming force of the enemy through the Mississippi Y alley and between that river and this point. In my opinion a like call should be made on Mississippi, but in deference to the exhausted condition of that State, referred to in one of your dispatches—I cannot

here give the date—and the fear that this call might again interfere with your enlistment for the war, I have thought it proper to submit the case to you, and ask you to put that State in arms to repel invasion or to permit me so to do.
A. S. JOHNSTON,
General.
Bichmond, November 19,1861. General A. Sidney Johnston, Nashville:
You may call out all the armed men you can get from Mississippi, Northern Alabama, Kentucky, or Tennessee. Ho not call any from the sea-coast. You can use your discretion as to terms of enlistment of armed men, or you can call out the militia so far as armed. Do not give any of our arms to men enlisted for less than the war. We hope soon to receive 10,000 stand of arms from another quarter, and you shall have your full share.

Report of Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Butler7 U. 8. Army.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fortress Monroe, August 8, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the First Vergaont Kegiment were embarked on Monday morning for New Haven, their time expiring on the 9th instant, which would be the time of their arrival. I had arranged that Colonel Carrs regiment, the Second New York Volunteers, should be transferred from Old Point to strengthen Newport News.
You may remember that I said to you, when I had the honor of an interview at Washington on Saturday, that a demonstration on the part of the enemy would be made within the coming week. On my return, Tuesday morning, I found various indications thereof. On Wednesday, about 2 o’clock p. m., the patrol of Colonel Weber’s regiment discovered the enemy in force at New Market Bridge, about miles from Hampton. About 4 o’clock they took one Mayhew, a deserter, who had swum the creek near New Market Bridge and delivered himself up, and brought him to me for examination. From his statements I learned his name, Mayhew; that he is a native of Bangor, Me., who, having landed in Georgia as a seaman, was impressed in a Georgia regiment, known by the name of u Baker’s Fire Eaters.” He is intelligent, and appears to be truthful. He stated that live regiments, including two Louisiana; one Alabama regiment, under Colonel Ex-Governor Winston; one North Carolina and one Georgia regiment, with two portions of battalions of artillery, and 300 Louisiana Zouaves, a picked battalion, left Yorktown and Williamsburg on Sunday, and marched to tbe neighborhood of Big-Bethel, where they encamped until Tuesday. On Wednesday, at 11 o’clock, they inarched to New Market Bridge, where they formed in order of battle, expecting an attack from me. They had eight guns ; one rifled gun, two 32-pounder howitzers, two long- 21s, and three smaller guns. This force was under the command of General Magruder.-The regiments had numbered in the neighborhood of 1,000 men each, but had been reduced by sickness at Yorktown * Ma.ykew’s own regiment numbering but 650,325 being sick with the measles. As near as I could gather, comparing his account with the notes I had from others, the enemy’s force was a little rising 5,000 men, although Mayhew repre-sented it at 7,000. He further stated that it was understood in camp that an attack was to be made on Newport News, the force being then bivouacked but 5 miles from that point.
Dispositions were immediately made, such as seemed proper, for reenforcing Newport News in case of an attack, or repelling an attack upon the troops encamped between the fortress and Hamilton in case one was made. After riding through the camps and giving final instructions, I rode over to the bridge at Hampton, 30 feet of which nearest the town we had before removed, and at 11.20 o’clock, when I left, everything was still. A few minutes before 12 o’clock the enemy made an attempt to burn the bridge, and for that purpose attacked the guard thereon, who were protected by a barricade of planks. The enemy were driven back with the loss of 3 killed and several wounded. No casualties occurred on our side.
The enemy then proceeded to fire the town in a great number of places. By 12 o’clock it was in flames, and is now entirely destroyed. They gave but fifteen minutes’ time for the inhabitants to remove from their houses, and I have to-day brought over the old and infirm, who

by that wanton act of destruction are now left houseless and homeless. The enemy took away with them most of the able-bodied white men.
A more wanton and unnecessary act than the burning, as it seems to me, could not have been committed. There was not the slightest attempt to make any resistance on our part to the possession of the town, which we had before evacuated, as you were informed by my last dispatch. There was no attempt to interfere with them there, as we only repelled an attempt to burn the bridge. It would have been easy to dislodge them from the town by a few shells from the fortress, but I did not choose to allow an opportunity to fasten upon the Federal troops auy portion in this heathenish outrage.
The town was the property of the secession inhabitants of Virginia, and they and their friends have chosen deliberately to destroy it, and under circumstances of cruel indifference to the inhabitants, who had remained in their homes, entirely without parallel. Indeed, for two months past, since Hampton has been within the power of my troops, and during the month that we occupied it, every exertion was used by me to protect the property from spoliation and the inhabitants from outrage, and I can safely say that $100 would cover all the damage done there in occupied houses. That there has been some appropriation of furniture by the troops from unoccupied houses is most true, but it had been substantially all taken from them and stored in the Seminary building. I knew this course would meet the approval of the Commanding General, but in a single hour the rebel army devoted to indiscriminate destruction both public and private buildings, the church and the court-house, as well as the cottage of the widow.
I confess myself so poor a soldier as not to be able to discern the strategical importance of this movement. I had fortified the churchyard with earth embankments, which were not destroyed by the fire, while the hymn of praise and the voice of prayer went up in the church on the last Sabbath of its occupation by Massachusetts troops. The poor citizens were told by their friends that this destruction was to prevent the use of their village as winter quarters for our troops. But I am sure it never entered my mind, and, I take leave to believe, the mind of the Commanding General, that there was the furthest intention of wintering any portion of the Federal troops at this point outside the garrison. We had believed that we were to follow the track of our Northern birds southward with the approach of frost.
No demonstration was made by the enemy save the burning of a deserted village, and to-day nothing has been done by the enemy except to withdraw his troops across New Market Bridge. I regret the military necessity, to which I yield the cordial recognition of my judgment, which called for the withdrawal of the four regiments and a half, which caused the evacuation of Hampton5 not for our sakes, but because of the loss which has thereby been brought upon the inhabitants. This act upon the part of the enemy seems to me to be a representative one, showing the spirit in which the war is to be carried on on their part, and which perhaps will have a tendency to provoke a corresponding spirit upon our part, but we may hope not.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLER, Major- General, Commanding.

Report of Col. John W. Phelps, First Vermont Infantry.
Camp Butler,
Reuport JVews, Va., August 11,1861.
Sir : Scouts from this post represent the enemy as Saving retired. They came to New Market Bridge on Wednesday, and left the next day. They—the enemy—talked of having 9,000 men. They were recalled by dispatches from Richmond. They had twenty pieces of artillery, among which was the Richmond Howitzer Battery, manned by negroes. Their wagons numbered sixty. Such is the information which our scouts gained from the people living on the ground where the enemy encamped. Their numbers are probably overrated; but with regard to their artillery, and its being manned in part by negroes, I think the report is probably correct. If they did have 9,000 men, and have thus withdrawn, without effecting any other object than the burning of Hampton, their retiring may be looked upon as nearly allied to a defeat; for the barbarous fierceness of spirit which they have exhibited in the destruction of Hampton, one of the oldest towns of Virginia, and which connects her history with a glorious past, cannot fail to injure their cause. It is an act which must inevitably meet with disapproval in all parts of the country, unless, indeed, the sentiments of liberality and generosity which are naturally inculcated by our free institutions have become wholly extinguished.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Reports of Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder, C. S. Army.
Headquarters,
Williamsburg, Va., August 2 [?], 1861.
Sir : As soon as I heard of the battle of Manassas I sent a force, under Colonel Johnston (cavalry), of 2,000 men, to make a demonstration in the immediate vicinity of Fort Monroe and Newport News. On the appearance off this force Hampton was set on fire and evacuated, and the troops, or a greater portion of them, were transferred to Newport News. The bridge over Hamilton Creek, which the enemy had just rebuilt, was broken down by them tOjprevent pursuit. I had Newport News thoroughly and closely examined, and think there are probably 5,000 or 6,000 troops still there. It is naturally very strong; is now defended with a great many cannon, some of the heaviest caliber, besides a war steamer at the wharf and a very large one at the point of Newport News. The Vandalia is lying broadside with the only open field of approach for a storming party. In any approach, this party would receive a fire of guns and musketry from the ships and one from the work, crossing each other at right angles, and sweeping the approach. The enemy keeps strictly within his works. In our last encounter with him two of his officers were killed within a short distance

of Hampton, on the other side of New Market Bridge. I have had the whole country scoured to Hampton, and to within half a mile of the enemy’s camp at Newport News, and some 150 negroes brought up, the males to work on the fortifications and the rest delivered to their masters.
I sent yesterday 4,500 men to Young’s Milk and will join them there to-night. It is my intention to occupy and hold, if possible, the country between Fort Monroe and Newport News. I shall take some of the forces from here, and I shall' be guided by circumstances in my future operations as to Newport News. There is a great deal of sickness on the Peninsula among the troops. Colonel AVinston reported last week 1,450 sick at Yorktown. There have been, I am informed, nearly two deaths a day for some days past.
I went to a point opposite Newport News yesterday, and about 5 miles • distant, returning last night, and I estimate the state of things there from my own observation and that of Colonel Pryor, who has had an opportunity for a month of comparing the relative number of tents at different periods observable there.
I am, sir, very respectfullv, vour obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Headquarters, Bethel, August 9, 1861.
Sir: As soon as I learned the result of the battle of Manassas, I ordered about 2,000 men, under-Colonel Johnston, of the cavalry, to proceed to the immediate vicinity of Hampton and Newport News, to make reconnaissance of those places, and to be guided by the results. I directed him also to scour the country up to the enemy’s pickets, and to capture and send up to the works at Williamsburg all the negroes to be found below a certain line. These duties were well performed by Colonel Johnston,*and some 150 negroes were captured and delivered at Williamsburg. As soon as he appeared before Hampton a large balloon was sent up. Our force was reconnoitered, and a hasty evacuation of Hamilton took place. The enemy kept close to their lines, and our troops returned to Yorktown and Williamsburg on the 29th and 30th July. As soon as these troops were rested, I ordered, at Young’s Mill, in Warwick County, the junction of a part of the troops from Williamsburg with a part of the garrison from Yorktown—in all about 4,000 infantry, 400 cavalry, and two batteries of the howitzer battalion, under Major Randolph. Having established a depot of supplies at Warwick Court-House, 2 miles in rear of Young’s Mill, I marched this force to Bethel Church, leaving a commissioned officer and one man from each company to guard the camps and supplies at Young’s Mill and the Court-House.
On the 6th instant, in the afternoon, I took post with my whole force at Whitney’s farm, within a mile of New Market Bridge, which I had rebuilt, the enemy having destroyed it. My force was then placed between the troops at and around Fort Monroe aud those in garrison at Newport News.
In order to gain exact information of the force and movements of the enemy at Newport News, I had ordered Capt. Jefferson C. Phillips, of the Old Dominion Dragoons, to make a close reconnaissance of the place, which was done by him in his usual gallant and skillful manner. He succeeded in reaching a point far within the inmost pickets of the enemy, and at a distance of about 300 yards from the works, where he remained

until daybreak, an hour before which time troops were embarked in a steamer which came to the fort during the same night, but a large number remained behind. He could not ascertain whether this steamer brought troops or not. He, however, induced one of our farmers to visit the fort next day on business, and learned the departure of a Vermont regiment and the arrival of another, Colonel Phelps, of the Vermont regiment, late of the Begular Army, remaining behind in command. Bent also Private Joseph Phillips to reconnoiter the shipping and another part of the work, which he successfully did. He repre-proaehes to the works, which were extremely strong, and garrisoned with twenty-five guns. The next morning I displayed my force within a mile and a half of (Newport News) the work, with the hope of drawing the enemy out, but he remained close within his Entrenchments. Disappointed in my expectations that the enemy would give me battle, I moved the left flank to within a mile of Hanrpton, and there a late copy of a Northern paper, the Tribune, containing an official report of General Butler, commanding at Old Point, to the Federal Secretary of War, was placed in my hands. I have not the report with me, but will forward it by the next mail. In it General Butler announces what his intentions are with respect to Hampton, about one-third of which, however, had been burned by the enemy when they evacuated it. He states in substance that this evacuation was the consequence of the withdrawal of 4,000 of his best troops to go to Washington; that he intended to fortify and make it so strong as to be easily defended by a small number of troops; that he did not know what to do with the many negroes in his possession unless he x>ossessed Hampton; that they were still coming in rapidly; that as their masters had deserted their homes and slaves, he should consider the latter free, and would colonize them at Hampton, the home of most of their owners, where the women could support themselves by attending to the clothes of the soldiers, and the men by working on the fortifications of the town.
Having known for some time past that Hampton was the harbor of runaway slaves and traitors, and being under the guns of Fort Monroe, it could not be held by us even if taken, I was decidedly under the impression that it should have been destroyed before; and when I found from the above report its extreme importance to the enemy, and that the town itself would lend great strength to whatever fortifications they might erect around it, I determined to burn it at once.
The gentlemen at Hampton, many of whom are in the army under my command, seemed to concur with me as to the propriety of this course. I also hoped that the sight of the conflagration might draw the troops from Newport News at night, and made dispositions accordingly. The Old Dominion Dragoons, under Captain Phillips, one company of cavalry, under Captain Goode, and one company from York and one from Warwick, were selected to burn the town. The former and the two latter of these companies were composed of persons from this portion of the country and many of them from Hampton. To support this party the Fourteenth Regiment, under Colonel Hodges, was detailed, and ordered to take post near Hampton, to defend the party in the town from an attack from an unexpected quarter. New Market Bridge, between Hampton and Newport News, was again taken possession of, and the remainder of the force so disposed as to feel, while advancing upon, any troops coming from Newport News to the relief of Hampton. Several thousand of the enemy’s troops were encamped between Hampton and Fort Monroe, an(J had a strong picket guard on the bridge, connecting their positions with Hampton.

[Chap. XIII.
On arriving in town a portion of the two companies of dragoons and the York and Warwick foot proceeded at once to the bridge, and a sharp skirmish ensued between them and the picket, the latter giving way and retreating at the end of half an hour, with some loss on their side; only one man wounded on ours. Notice was then given to the few remaining inhabitants of the place, and those who were aged or infirm were kindly cared for and taken to their friends,, who occupied detached houses. The town was then fired in many places and burned to the ground.
This detailed operation, carried on within easy range of the guns of Fort Monroe and in the immediate presence of an enemy outside of the work five or six times as strong as the party engaged in it, was executed most skillfully, by Captain Phillips, of the Old Dominion Dragoons, ably seconded by Captain Goode, of the Mecklenburg Cavalry, and supported firmly by six companies of the Fourteenth Virginia Regiment, under Colonel Hodges. At about daybreak these troops returned, and after sleeping in camp for some hours the whole force returned and reoccupied Bethel, there not being sufficient fresh water below this place to supply either infantry or cavalry in such large bodies, the streams in that part of the Peninsula being all salt water.
The next day thirty wagons were sent to the houses nearest the enemy, under a strong escort, and returned laden with corn and oats. Since then the troops have been engaged in fortifying the position at Bethel. As soon as that is done they will move to Young’s Mill, which is a strong position, and fortify that, after which they will return to their respective posts, with tbe exception of the Fifth North Carolina Regiment, which will be stationed at Mulberry Island, to cover the works now being erected there.
The sickness among the troops in the Peninsula is grave, both in extent and character, all diseases taking more or less a typhoid character, and many deaths occurring—at Yorktown about two a day. Some idea may be formed of its effects when I state that the Fifth North Carolina Regiment, composed of twelve companies and over 1,000 strong, is now less than 400 for duty. Every precaution has been taken and every arrangement will be made to prevent the disease and alleviate its eftects, and the health of the troops now is reported as improving. Large numbers of the troops here have been sent across the York River to Gloucester, private families kindly offering to take charge of many of the patients. One or two regiments in Yorktown have remained healthy. They will be permitted to remain in their present encampments, and the rest should be encamped some miles from the works, but toward the enemy, at places supposed to be more healthy. The sickliest season has not yet arrived, and as this is by far the most unhealthy portion of the seat of war, I cannot too earnestly impress upon the authorities the necessity of attending promptly to the requisitions and suggestions of the medical officers as regards the sanitary condition of the troops in this Peninsula. Two hundred barrels of potatoes have arrived and been issued, and also a very seasonable supply of medicines; but as, in addition to the measles, ague and fever, bilious and typhoid fever, symptoms of scurvy are apparent throughout the command, a continued supply of potatoes and other vegetables, which I understand are abundant and very cheap farther South, is essential. Typhoid has been so prevalent and fatal at Jamestown Island as to make the withdrawal of the men from that post necessary. They will be encamped in the immediate vicinity on one of Mr. William Allen’s farms, supposed to be more healthy.

I have called out a large force of negroes, at considerable expense to the Government, to complete the fortifications upon which our troops have been so laboriously working. The troops can no longer do this work, and I respectfully request that the Quartermaster-General be directed to furnish to the assistant quartermaster-general of this department, Captain Bloomfield, the funds necessary for the payment of the laborers without delay, as a great many of them are free negroes, who have families, who must starve if they are not paid, and to all I promised prompt payment. There are, perhaps, 1,000 now at work on the Peninsula.
It is hardly necessary for me to say that I wish the sanitary condition of the troops to be as little known as possible, for obvious reasons.
Notwithstanding this state of things, those men who can take the field are in fine spirits, and so keen for an encounter with the enemy that I believe Newport News would be carried, though it is excessively strong, and garrisoned by troops and supported by a naval force more than equal to my own in numbers. I do not think it can be done, however, without a loss of one-half of our men in killed and wounded. It could not be held by us for any length of time if it were taken, as the troops from Port Monroe in much larger force could place themselves in our rear, and the position itself could be shelled by the eqemy’s ships, both in front and on the left flank. Its temporary possession, therefore, would not compensate for the loss necessary in taking it. One of the principal objects of my present operations has been to force the attention of the authorities at Washington to this Peninsula, to prevent further re-enforcements from being drawn from Fort Monroe and its vicinity for the army at Washington to this part of the State. This, I think, has been accomplished, as re-enforcements have arrived both at Fort Monroe and Newport News. I also caused the enemy7s telegraphic communications betweeif Old Point and Newport News to be destroyed. This I delayed until the last moment, with the hope of receiving a field machine from Eichmond in time to connect it with the enemy’s line, and thus ascertain their communications between Old Point and Newport News. As this field telegraph would be of essential use at Williamsburg on the long lines of defense, consisting of detached works, I beg that Dr. Morris, president of the company, may be ordered to furnish me one at that place without delay, accompanied by a skillful operator by sound.

Army, notifying me that I had been appointed a brigadier-general in the Provisional Army and assigned to the command of the Department of North Carolina and the coast defenses of that State. Accordingly, on the 20th of August, I issued the necessary orders assuming the command.
On the 26th of August I received a telegram from General Huger, stating that a fleet had just sailed from Hampton Roads, supposed to be for the coast of North Carolina. I immediately telegraphed the information to Governor Clark, and requested that all the available troops then within reach be sent to Goldsborough. On the 28th a steamer arrived at Wilmington, and reported that a large fleet of the enemy were assembling at Hatteras Inlet the day previous. Orders were at once sent to the troops at Goldsborough to proceed with dispatch to New Berne, and on the morning of the 29th I set out for that town, where I arrived that afternoon. About 11 o’clock p. m. a steamer arrived, with the information that Fort Hatteras had surrendered to the enemy about 10 o’clock a. m. on that day after a bombardment of near two days by a large fleet of the enemy, and that the garrison, numbering 580, including Commodore Samuel Barron and Col. J. A J. Bradford, were made prisoners of war. The facts were made known to the Confederate and State Governments, and more troops asked for.
On the 30th of August steps were taken to complete Fort Lane, the site of another battery for the defense of the Neuse selected, and the point for blocking that river fixed upon. The forces then at New Berne were Campbell’s regiment and Singeltary’s battalion. A few days after Yance’s regiment and Brem’s battery arrived. The former was forwarded to Bogue Banks, and was followed in a few days by Campbell’s regiment, upon a report of an intended attack upon Fort Macon by the enemy’s fleet.
With natteras in the possession of the efiemy it was readily perceived that our only hope for protection to the eastern counties would be to maintain the ascendency upon the sounds and rivers. Hence I drew the attention of the War Department to the subject in a letter, dated the 4th of September, recommending the construction of a number of gunboats, to be placed upon Pamlico Sound, and requested that the subject should be brought to the notice of the President himself.
About this time I received information from General Huger of his having sent the Third Georgia Regiment, Colonel Wright commanding, to the assistance of Fort Hatteras, but upon their arrival at Roanoke Island, learning that the fort had fallen, they landed, anti were engaged in putting the island in a state of defense. I requested that he would continue to occupy the island until I could send a force to relieve Colonel Wright’s command.
About the 7th of September, Brig. Gen. J. R. Anderson arrived at New Berne, with instructions from the War Department to report to me, to take charge of the coast defenses of the State. He was accordingly placed on that duty.
After satisfying myself that the enemy contemplated no immediate move from Fort Hatteras, and that the reports of an intended attack upon Fort Macon were without foundation, I proceeded to and established my headquarters at Goldsborough, on the 13th of September. My first object was to organize the staff corps of the department, and the second to collect the necessary forces. This last had to be done by application to the Confederate and State Governments, as I had no authority to raise troops. My plan was to place a sufficient number of troops at the exposed points, to hold the enemy in check should he

land on the coast, and to establish a reserve of four or six regiments at Goldsborough, to be sent to the coast only upon the landing of the enemy. At this time the force under my command was as follows, viz: The Eighteenth and Twentieth Regiments and Edmunston’s company of cavalry at Wilmington; Singeltary’s battalion, Brem’s battery, and Whit ford’s artillery at Hew Berne; the Seventh and Twenty-sixth Regiments on Rogue Banks; three companies of infantry and four companies of artillery at Fort Macon; two companies of the Seventeenth Regiment at Washington; and the Third Georgia Regiment and a detachment of the Seventeenth Regiment at Roanoke Island. Moore’s battery was at Raleigh, Lane’s and Parker’s regiments encamped above that city, and Clingman’s regiment at Asheville. These three regiments and the battery were sent by the governor to Wilmington, where they arrived early in October. He also sent the Eighth Regiment to Roanoke Island, where they arrived the latter part of September. Colonel McMillan’s regiment, Georgia volunteers, ordered to report to me, arrived at Golds-borough on the 21st September, and was sent to Washington.
On the 14th of September Major Hall, Seventh Regiment, was directed to proceed to Hyde County, with two companies of his regiment. His force was afterwards increased by the addition of two companies of the Seventeenth from Washington, three companies of the Thirty-third, and two companies of the Second Regiment, not complete when the regiment left for Virginia. They ultimately joined their regiment. Authority being granted, a number of companies for local defense and special service were being raised.
Early in September the blocking of the Pamlico River, 8 miles below Washington, was commenced, and a battery on each side of the river erected for its protection. It was soon perceived that it would be impossible for General Anderson to give proper attention to the entire coast. The plan of dividing the coast into three districts, and placing each in charge of an experienced officer, then suggested itself. With this view I wrote to the War Department on the 18th September, requesting that two additional brigadier-generals be sent to me. Only one, however, was ordered, viz, Brig. Gen. D. H. Hill, who was assigned by the War Department to the command of all that part of the coast lying north of White Oak River. Before allowing him to assume command of Roanoke Island I urged upon the Department, in letters dated the 1st and 7th of October, the propriety of establishing the District of the Albemarle, and placing it under an experienced officer, but this was not permitted. Had it been acceded to at the time, it is fair to conclude that the island would have been placed in such a state of defense as, with a reasonable force, it might have been successfully defended against General Burnside’s attack in February, and thus all our after-misfortunes on the coast avoided. I may dispose of this subject by stating that the district was finally established on the 21st of December, General Wise placed in command, and the district transferred to General Huger’s department. General Hill’s was named the u District of Pamlico,” General Anderson’s the “ District of Cape Fear.”
General Hill entered upon his duties about the 4th of October, and acted vigorously in placing his district in a state of defense. On the 21st of October I received notice from General Huger that a fleet was preparing to sail from Hew York for the South, and tendering assistance should a landing be effected on our coast, and on the 26th of October a telegram from the Secretary of War announced its having sailed, and that it was believed the enemy intended to land a force of

[Chap. XIII.
some 15,000 men below Fort Macon with the view of attacking New Berne. Having but thirty-five companies in that quarter, including the garrison of Fort Macon, and no reserve, I begged for re-enforcements.
On the 28th of October Col. G. W. 0. Lee, aide-de-camp to the President, arrived at Goldsborough with a regiment and a battalion of Georgia volunteers. The Secretary of War directed that these troops be held in reserve, and not sent to the coast until a landing was effected. Generals Hill and Anderson called out the militia of the neighboring counties, and such other preparations were made to resist the enemy as our limited means would permit. The fleet, however, had sailed, not for our coast, but that of South Carolina, and upon the fall of Hilton Head and other defenses of Beaufort, S. C., assistance was asked for by Governor Pickens. By authority of the Secretary of War General Anderson sent to South Carolina Moore’s battery, with Clingman’s and Radcliff’s regiments. At the time this force was considered but temporarily detached from this department, but it did not return to it until after the fall of New Berne. When it was ascertained that the fleet had passed our coast Colonel Lee’s command returned to Virginia.
The defensive works in both districts were pushed forward during the months of November and December. General Hill, who had done much in a short time to place his district in a proper state of defense, was, by direction of the Secretary of War, relieved by Brig. Gen. L. O’B. Branch the latter part of November. The force in the District of the Pamlico was increased by the addition of Spruill’s regiment of cavalry$ and the Thirty-first Regiment, which had been ordered by the governor to Beaufort County to complete its organization, was ordered to Roanoke Island to relieve the Third Georgia Regiment. It arrived at its destination on the 12th of December. A number of companies of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, for local defense and special service, had been raised. The year closed with rumors of another fleet being in course of preparation for a descent upon the Southern coast.
Being satisfied, from the reported character of the vessels to be used in this new expedition, that it was designed for our sounds, I addressed a letter*to the War Department on the 3d of January, 1862, drawing attention to the want of troops in this department, and urged that a large reserve force be sent to Goldsborough and placed at my disposal. I also wrote to Governor Clark on the same day, requesting that the newly-formed regiments, though but partially armed and suffering much from sickness, be sent to me. Soon these regiments were reported in readiness to break up their camps, and on the 8th of January the movement commenced. The Thirty-third, Thirty-fifth, and Thirty-seventh were sent to New Berne, and the Thirty-fourth Regiment halted at 'Goldsborough, to wait for its arms, which had been promised by the War Department.
On the 17th of January I received information from General Branch of the arrival at Hatteras of forty-two steamers and a number of sail vessels, and after information confirming me in the opinion that Burnside’s expedition was assembling at that point, on the 24th of January I again addressed the War Department, stating that the expedition was of such a magnitude that to resist it successfully our forces should be largely increased, and drew attention to my letter of the 3d of January relative to a reserve force being placed at Goldsborough.
On the 22d of January I requested Governor Clark to call out the militia of Edgecombe, Pitt, Beaufort, Greene, Wayne, Lenoir, Jones, and Craven Counties, and direct them to report to General Branch. The

defensive works in General Branch’s district were pushed forward with industry, and that gallant officer spoke hopefully of his ability to defend New Berne.
On the 30th of January I wrote to the War Department relative to the high stage of water in the Roanoke, and the capability of the enemy’s gunboats ascending that river as high as the bridge at Weldon, should they pass Roanoke Island; requested that, in the event of the island falling into the hands of the enemy, upon the news reaching Richmond, that at least a light battery be sent to Halifax, to which point I would send a regiment of infantry, the only troops I could spare; represented my deficiency of troops, and requested to be informed what re-enforcements I might expect in case of the fall of Roanoke Island or an attack on New Berne.
On the 10th of February a telegram from General Huger announced the fall of Roanoke Island. The Thirty-fourth Regiment was at once ordered to Roanoke for the defense of that river, and the governor having sent down the Thirty-eighth Regiment, it was dispatched to Weldon, to protect the bridge at that point. Two pieces of artillery, with an undrilled detachment, having been sent to me, were ordered to the same point; also Captain Tucker’s company of cavalry. I wrote to the War Department what had been done, and requested additional forces be sent to that section, as the force then en route were only sufficient to check the enemy should he attempt to ascend the river. Finally, Captain Meade was sent to locate batteries on the Roanoke. This officer had been sent by me a few weeks previous to examine that section of the country. He furnished me with a map of the country and a memoir of his observations. On the 26th of February I received an order from the War Department transferring the counties of Martin, Halifax, Bertie, and Northampton to the department of General Huger.
The headquarters of the Tenth Regiment (artillery), Col. J. A. J. Bradford commanding, was established at Goldsborough February 16, 1862.
With the view of concentrating the forces in the District of the Pamlico the Seventh and Twenty-sixth- Regiments were sent to New Berne. Major Hall’s command was withdrawn from Hyde County, and the two companies of the Seventh and the three companies Thirty-third Regiment sent to New Berne, and the two companies of the Seventeenth to Washington. The batteries on Huggins’ and Harker’s Islands were withdrawn, and the garrison of Fort Macon reduced to five companies of artillery, the greatest number that could be sheltered in the fort in case of siege, the surplus troops sent to New Berne, and the fort supplied with seven months’ provisions.
On the 27th of February I made, by direction of the War Department, a report of my forces, their disposition, and my means and plans of defense. In it was stated, “You will perceive that a large increase to the force at New Berne should be made to place it on an equality with the force that attacked Roanoke Island,” and concluded by, “ You will perceive that the force under my command is very inadequate to the defense of so extensive a coast against an enemy who has possession of our sounds and can direct his large columns against any point he may elect.” On the 3d of March I received a telegram from the Secretary of War, directing the withdrawal of the troops from Washington and the sending them to Suffolk, Ya.
To satisfy myself that the defensive works at New Berne were such as they should be, I ordered a board of officers, to consist of Colonel Lee, 37 R R—vol iy

infantry, Lieutenant-Colonel Crasen and Major Thompson, artillery, and Captain Meade, engineers, to assemble at New Berne on the 7th of March to examine the works, and to recommend such alterations and additions as might appear proper, and in order not to delay they were to indicate from time to time the proposed alterations and additions to General Branch, who was instructed to carry out the recommendations of the board as speedily as possible. This board would have been ordered to assemble at a much earlier day but for the impracticability of securing the services of Captain Meade, an engineer, in whose capacity I had great confidence, and who I had been compelled to send to erect batteries on the Roanoke, as before stated.
I went to New Berne on the 7th of March, and on the 8th inspected the river defenses in company with General Branch and the board. I had gone to New Berne with the intention of remaining there for several days, but found myself so unwell on the 9th as to render a return to Goldsborough advisable.
On the 13th of March I received a note from General Branch announcing the advance of the enemy up the Neuse. The fact was telegraphed to the governor and the War Department, and re-enforcements asked for. I sent orders to General Anderson to send up Lane’s regiment, the only troops sufficiently near Wilmington to be available for the occasion, and I replied to General Branch’s note that I would join him as soon as I had satisfied myself that I had done all I could at Goldsborough in collecting re-enforcements. Colonel Lane’s regiment arrived and was forwarded on the night of the 13th; also Captain Atwood, of the Twentieth Regiment, with a part of his company, who, being on furlough and just arrived at Goldsborough, volunteering for the service, were armed and sent down. No other re-enforcements reached Goldsborough.
My intention of going to New Berne was frustrated by a painful attack of sickness, which confined me to my bed. The news of the fall of New Berne reached me on the evening of the 14th of March. General Branch’s report of that affair has been published. As it was evident that we had been overwhelmed by vastly superior numbers, I dispatched General Anderson to Richmond on the 15th of March, to represent to the President the necessity of sending a force sufficient to cope with that of the enemy, and desired him to say to the President that, not having confidence in my health or ability to command such a force, I hoped a general of superior rank would be sent with the troops.
After the fall of New Berne the troops retreated by the several roads leading to Kinston, hence that place was selected tor reassembling General Branch’s forces. General French arrived at Goldsborough on the 16th of March, and was sent on the 17th to take command of the District of the Pamlico. On the 18th, Clingman’s and Radclift’s regiments, having arrived from South Carolina, were sent to the camp near Kinston, and General Ransom, having reported, was sent to the same point. I designed, as soon as the camp and garrison equipage lost at New Berne could be replaced, to push the troops as far down as Bachelor’s Creek, and thus confine the enemy as near New Berne as possible. On the 19th of March, 1862, I was relieved from duty in the State of North Carolina on account of ill health.
I may be permitted to conclude this rapid sketch by stating that we failed to make timely efforts to maintain the ascendency on the Pamlico Sound, and thus admitted Burnside’s fleet without a contest; we failed to put a proper force on Roanoke Island, and thus lost the key

to our interior coast; and we failed to furnish General Branch with a reasonable force, and thus lost the important town of New Berne. What I claim is that these failures do not by right rest with me.
As to the habit of intemperance, so recklessly attributed to me by certain newspapers in this State soon after the fall of New Berne, I have to say that the charge is without foundation, as can be established by the certificate of the medical director of the department, with whom I was in daily official intercourse, and who was my medical adviser for four or five months preceding that event, and the statement of Surgeon Wyatt M. Brown, C. S. Army, who was my attending physician on the 14th of March, 1862.

[Chap. XIII.
our fleet arrived off Hatteras Inlet about 4 o’clock Tuesday afternoon. Such preparations as were possible for tbe landing were made in the evening, and at daylight next morning dispositions were made for an attack upon the forts by the fleet and for the landing of the troops.
Owing to the previous prevalence of southwest gales a heavy surf was breaking on the beach. Every effort was made to land the troops, and after about 315 were landed, including 55 marines from the fleet and the regulars, both the iron boats, upon which we depended, were swamped in the surf and both flat-boats stove; and a brave attempt being made by Lieutenant Crosby, IJ. S. Navy (serving with the army as port captain at Fortress Monroe), who had volunteered to come down with the steam-tug Fanny, belonging to the Army, to land in a boat from the war steamer Pawnee, resulted in the beaching of the boat, so that she could not be got off*.
It was impracticable to land more troops because of the rising wind and sea. Fortunately, a 12-pounder rifled boat gun, loaned us by the flag-ship, and a 12-pounder howitzer were landed, the last slightly damaged. Our landing was completely covered by the shells of the Monticello and the Harriet Lane. I was on board the Harriet Lane, directing the disembarkation of the troops by means of signals, and was about landing with them at the time the boats were stove. We were induced to desist from further attempts at landing troops by the rising of the wind, and because in the mean time the fleet had opened fire upon the nearest fort, which was finally silenced, and its flag struck. No firing had opened upon our troops from the other fort, and its flag was also struck. Supposing this to be a signal of surrender, Colonel Weber advanced his troojis already landed upon the beach.
The Harriet Lane, Captain Faunce, by my direction, tried to cross the bar to get in the smooth water of the inlet, when fire was opened upon the Monticello (which had proceeded in advance of us) from the other fort. Several shots struck her, but without causing any casualties, as I am informed. So well convinced were the officers of both Navy and Army that the forts had been surrendered at this time, that the Susquehanna had towed the frigate Cumberland to an offing. The fire was then reopened (as there was no signal from either) upon both forts.
In the mean time a few men from the Coast Guard had advanced up the beach with Mr. Wiegel, who was acting as volunteer aide, and whose gallantry and services I wish to commend, and took possession of the smaller fort, which was found to have been abandoned by the enemy, and raised the American flag thereon.
It had become necessary, owing to the threatening apjiearance of the weather, that all the ships should make an offing, which was done with reluctance, from necessity, thus leaving the troojJS upon shore, a part in x>ossession of the small fort, about 700 yards from the large one, and the rest bivouacked upon the beach, near the place of landing, about 2 miles north of the forts.
Early the next morning the Harriet Lane ran inshore for the purpose of covering any attack upon the troox3S. At the same time a large steamer was observed coming down the sound inside the land, with re*enforcements for the enemy, but she was prevented from landing by Captain Johnson, of the Coast Guard, who had placed the two guns from the shix> and a 6-pounder cax>tured from the enemy in a small sand battery, and ojjened fire upon the rebel steamer. At 8 o’clock the fleet ox>ened fire again, the flag-ship being anchored as near as the water allowed and the other ships coming gallantly into action. It was evi-

dent, after a few experiments, that our shot fell short, and increased length of fuse was telegraphed, and firing commenced with shells of fifteen seconds’ fuse.
I had sent Mr. Fiske, acting aide-de-camp, on shore, for the purpose of gaining intelligence of the movements of the troops and of the enemy. I then went with the Fanny, for the purpose of effecting a landing of the remainder of the troops, when a white flag was run up from the fort. I then went with the Fanny over the bar* into the inlet. At the same time the troops under Colonel Weber marched up the beach, and signal was made from the flag-ship to cease firing.
As the Fanny rounded in over the bar, the rebel steamer Winslow went up the channel, having a large number of secession troops on board, which she had not landed. We threw a shot at her from the Fanny, but she proved to be out of range. I then sent Lieutenant Crosby on shore to demand the meaning of the white flag. The boat soon returned, bringing Mr. Wiegel, with the following written communication from Samuel Barron, late captain in the U. S. Navy:
Fort Hatteras, August 29, 1861.
Flag-Officer Samuel Barron, C. S. Navy, offers to surrender Fort Hatteras, with all the arms and-munitions of war. The officers allowed to go out with side-arms and the men without arms to retire.
S. BARRON,
Commanding Naval Defenses Virginia and North Carolina.
And also a verbal communication, stating that he had in the fort 615 men and 1,000 more within an hour’s call, but that he was anxious to spare the effusion of biood.
To both the written and verbal communications I made the reply which follows, and sent it by Lieutenant Crosby:
August 29, 1861.
Benj. F. Butler, major-general, U. S. Army, commanding, in reply to the communication of Samuel Barron, commanding forces at Fort Hatteras, cannot admit the terms proposed. The terms offered are these: Full capitulation; the officers and men to be treated as prisoners of war. No other terms admissible. Commanding officers to meet on hoard flag-ship Minnesota to arrange details.
After waiting three-quarters of an hour, Lieutenant Crosby returned, bringing with him Captain Barron, Major Andrews, and Colonel Martin, of the rebel forces, who, on being received on board the tug Fanny, informed me that they had accepted the terms proposed in my memorandum, and had come to surrender themselves and their command as prisoners of war. I informed them that as the expedition was a combined one from the Army and Navy, the surrender must be made on board the flag-ship to Flag-Officer Stringham as well as to myself. We went on board the Minnesota for that purpose. On arriving there, the following articles of capitulation were signed, which I hope will meet your approval. [See Appendix A.]
1 then landed, and took a formal surrender of the forts, with all the men and munitions of war, inspected the troops to see that the arms-had been properly surrendered, marched them out, and embarked them on board the Adelaide, and marched my own troops into the fort, and raised our flag upon it, amid the cheers of our men and a salute of 13* guns, which had been shotted by the enemy.
The embarkation of the wounded, which was conducted with great care and tenderness from a temporary wharf erected for the purpose, took so long that night came' on so dark that it was impossible for the pilots to take the Adelaide over the bar, thereby causing delay.
I may mention in this connection that the Adelaide, in carrying in the troops, at the moment that my terms of capitulation were under

[Chap. XIII.
consideration by the enemy, had grounded upon the bar, but by the active and judicious exertions of Commander Stellwagen, after some delay, was got off. At the same time the Harriet Lane, in attempting to enter over the bar, had grounded, and remained fast. Both were under the guns of the fort. This to me was a moment of the greatest anxiety. By these accidents a valuable ship of war and a transport steamer, with a large portion of my troops, were within the power of the enemy. I had demanded the strongest terms, which he was considering. He might refuse, and, seeing our disadvantage, renew the action. But I determined to abate not a tittle of what I believed to be due to the dignity of the Government, not even to give an official title to the officer in command of the rebels. Besides, my tug was in the inlet, and at least I could carry on the engagement with my two rifled 6-pounders, well supplied with Sawyer shells.
Upon taking possession of Fort Hatteras I found that it mounted ten guns, with four yet unmounted, and one large 10-inch columbiad all ready for mounting. I append the official muster roll of Colonel Martin, furnished by him, of the officers and men captured by us.*
The position of the fort is an exceedingly strong one, nearly surrounded on all sides by water, and only to be approached by a march of 500 yards circuitously over a long neck of sand, within half musket range, and over a causeway a few feet only in width, and which was commanded by two 32-pounder guns, loaded with grape and canister, which were expended in our salute. It had a w’ell-protected magazine, and bomb-proof capable of sheltering some 300 or 400 men. The parapet was nearly of octagon form, inclosing about two-thirds of an acre of ground, well covered, with sufficient traverses and ramparts and parapets, upon which our shells had made but little impression.
The larger work nearer the inlet was known as Fort Hatteras. Fort Clark, which was about 700 yards northerly, is a square redoubt, mounting five guns and two 6-pounders. The enemy had spiked these guns, but in a very inefficient manner, upon abandoning the fort the day before. I had all the troops on shore at the time of the surrender of the forts, but re-embarked the regulars and the marines.
Finding it impossible without a delay of the fleet, which could not be justified under the state of facts at Fortress Monroe, and owing to the threatening appearance of the weather, I disembarked the pro'visions, making with the provisions captured about five days’ rations for the use of the troops. On consultation with Flag-Officer Stringham and Commander Stellwagen I determined to leave the troops and hold the fort, because of the strength of the fortifications, its importance, and because, if again in the possession of the enemy, with a sufficient armament, of the very great difficulty of its capture, until I could get some further instructions from the Government. Commodore Stringham directs the steamers Monticello and Pawnee to remain inside, and these, with the men in the forts, are sufficient to hold the position against any force which is likely or, indeed, possible to be sent against it.
The importance of the point cannot be overrated. When the channel is buoyed out any vessel may carry 15 feet of water over it with ease. Once inside, there is a safe harbor and anchorage in all weathers. From there the whole coast of Virginia and North Carolina, from Norfolk to Cape Lookout, is within our reach by light-draught vessels, which cannot possibly live at sea during the winter months. From it offensive operations may be made upon the whole coast of North Caro-

lina to Bogue Inlet, extending many miles inland to Washington, New Berne,and Beaufort. In the languageof theehief engineerof the rebels, Colonel Thompson, in an official report, uit is the key of the Albemarle.” In my judgment, it is a station second in importance only to Fortress Monroe on this coast. As a depot for coaling and supplies for the blockading squadron it is invaluable. As a harbor for our coasting trade, or inlet from the winter storms or from pirates, it is of the first importance. By holding it, Hatteras light may again* send forth its cheering ray to the storm-beaten mariner, of which the worse than vandalism of the rebels deprives him. It has but one drawback, a want of water; but that a condenser, like the one now in operation at Fortress Monroe, at a cost of a few hundred dollars, will relieve.
I append to this report a tabular statement of the prizes which have been taken into that inlet within a few days, compiled from the official documents captured with the fort. [See Appendix C.]
I add hereto an official report of the chief engineer of the coast defenses of the rebels. [See Appendix B.]
Please find also apiiended a statement of the arms and munitions of war captured with the fort, as nearly as they can be ascertained.*
While all have done well, I desire to speak in terms of especial commendation, in addition to those before mentioned, of the steadiness and cool courage of Col. Max Weber, whom we were obliged to leave in command of a detachment of 300 men on a strange coast, without camp equipage or possibility of aid, in the face of an enemy GOO strong, on a dark and stormy night; of Lieutenant Colonel Weiss, who conducted a reconnaissance of 20 men; of the daring and prompt efficiency of Captain Nixon, of the Coast Guard, who with his men occupied Fort Clark during the first night, although dismantled, in the face of aa enemy of unknown numbers.
I desire to commend to your attention Captain Jardine, of the New York Ninth, who was left in command of the detachment of his regiment when the unfortunate casualty to the Harriet Lane prevented Colonel Hawkins from landing.
Permit me to speak of the efficiency of the regulars, under Lieutenant Larned, who worked zealously in aiding to land their comrades of the volunteers overwhelmed with the rolling surf.
I desire especially to make acknowledgments to Messrs. Wiegel and Durivage, volunteer aides, who planted the American flag upon Fort Clark on the second morning, to indicate to the fleet its surrender, and to prevent the further wasting of shells upon it; a service of great danger from the fire of their own friends.
I make honorable mention of young Fiske, who risked his life among the breakers, being thrown on shore, to convey my orders to the troops landed, and to apprise them of the movements and intentions of the fleet; also my thanks for the valuable aid of Captain Haggerty, who was employed in visiting the prizes in the harbor while we were agreeing upon the terms of capitulation.
Of the services to the country of the gentlemen of the Navy proper I may not speak, for one ought not to praise when he has no right to censure, and they will be appropriately mentioned, I doubt not, by the commander, who is capable to appreciate their good conduct. But I am emboldened to ask permission, if the Department shall determine to occupy the point as a permanent post, that its name may be changed by general order from aFort Hatteras” to uFort Stringham.”

But of those gentlemen who served under my immediate command I may make honorable mention, as I have before done, of the zealous, intrepid, and untiring action of Lieutenant Crosby, who took an armed canal-boat, the steam-tug Fanny, from Fort Monroe to Hatteras Inlet, in order that the expedition might have the aid of a steamer of the lightest draught.
Captain Shuttleworth, of the Marine Corps, deserves well for his loyalty and efficiency in his active detachment of marines.
Much of the success of the expedition is due to the preparation of the transport service by Commander Stellwagen, and the prompt presence of mind with which he took the troops from their peril when the Adelaide touched on the bar is a rare quality in an officer in danger.
Although Captain Faunce, of the revenue service, now in command of the Harriet Lane, was unfortunate enough to get his vessel on one of the numerous sand bars about the inlet, it happened, I believe, in consequence of a determination, creditable in him, to aid me by being near to cover the troops in landing.
Captain Lowry, who had the George Peabody in charge, brought in his vessel with safety, with the troops, wdio were pleased with his care and conduct. He still remains at the inlet.
In fine, general, I may congratulate you and the country upon a glorious victory in your department, in which we captured more than 700 men, 25 pieces of artillery, 1,000 stand of arms, a large quantity of ordnance stores, provisions, 3 valuable prizes, 2 light-boats, and 4 stand of colors, 1 of which had been presented within a week by the ladies of New Berne, N. C., to the “ North Carolina Defenders.”
By the goodness of that Providence which watches over our nation, no one, either of the fleet or army, was in the least degree injured. The enemy’s loss was not officially reported to us, but was ascertained to be 12 or 15 killed and died of wounds, and 35 wounded.

Fort Hatteras, July 25,1861.
Colonel : The day before yesterday we hoisted onr glorious flag over Fort Clark, a strong battery I have nearly finished, of five heavy 32-pounders, about half a mile from Fort Hatteras, which secures to us a cross-fire upon the bar and the entrance to this inlet. I now consider this inlet secure against any attempt of the enemy to enter it. Onr force of men I think rather weak to resist a land attack, in case the enemy should effect a landing in the bight of Hatteras. If we had three or four additional companies here I should feel quite safe even in that event.
As I have before remarked, this inlet is the key to Albemarle Sound, and it cannot be too strictly guarded. We certainly are under the espionage of the United States steamers, as they are seen every day or two in the offing, although they keep without the range of our guns. If 1 had received the 10-inch columbiad, we could have damaged them some on their last visit, three days since.
We now have two privateers in this harbor, besides the war-steamer Winslow, the Gordon, of Charleston, Captain Lockwood, armed with three guns—a fine large steamer. She returned this morning with a prize brig laden with three hundred and sixty hogshead of molasses. We have also a saucy-looking little pilot schooner, the Florida, mounting one 6-pounder rifled cannon. She captured a prize two days since, took her crew out, and sent her in with her own men. A United States steamer gave chase to the prize, and they were obliged to beach her on Nagg’s Head. She, of course, is a total loss.
Yours, respectfully,
W. BEYEBSHAW THOMPSON,

Report of Col. Max Weber, Twentieth New Yorlc Infantry.
Fort Hatteras, NT. 0., September 5,1861.
Sir : I take the first opportunity which is offered to me by the arrival of a steamer from Fortress Monroe to report to you the action of the troops who were landed and acted under my command in the capture of Fort Hatteras.
On Wednesday morning, the 28th ultimo, at 10 o’clock, the landing of the troops commenced. The surf was running very high, and continued to run higher and higher, so that but 318 men could be landed. The condition of these troops was of course a very bad one. All of us were wet up to the shoulders, cut off entirely from the fleet, with wet ammunition, and without any provisions; but still all had but one thought—to advance.
I appointed Captain Yon Doehn, of the Twentieth Eegiment, who has been acting adjutant of Camp Hamilton for the last three months, to act also here in that capacity, had the troops formed in line counted, and reported to me as follows: 45 men of the regular artillery regiment stationed at Fort Monroe, Captain Larned and Lieutenant Lodor; 45 men of marine soldiers of the Minnesota; 68 men Ninth Eegiment New York Volunteers, Captain Jardine; 102 men Twentieth Eegiment New York Volunteers; 28 men Union Coast Guard, Captain Nixon; 28 men, sailors (artillery), making a total of 318 men.
I had all reasons to be very cautious, having but a small force, and the more, as we saw the enemy re-enforce the fort all the time.
Our distance from the first fort (Clark) was about 3 miles. I sent Lieutenant-Colonel Weiss, with 20 men of the Twentieth Eegiment, to make a reconnaissance, and ordered Lieutenant Wiegel (ordnance officer of General Butler’s staff) to accompany him. The latter soon returned, with the report that Lieutenant Colonel Weiss took one cannon (dismounted), and that the troops commenced to evacuate the first fort. I then ordered Captain Von Doehn and Captain Hoefiiing’s company of the Twentieth Eegiment to re-enforce Lieutenant-Colonel Weiss, and to take possession of the fort (Clark). This order was carried out immediately. Lieutenant-Colonel Weiss occupied the fort, him self took the first secession flag, and hoisted the American. Myself followed with the rest of the troops, when the Navy commenced firing upon us, shells bursting right over us and in our midst, so that a further advance was impossible. Two shells burst in the fort, wounding one of my men slightly in the hand.
I still held the fort occupied, sent an American flag along the beach, and the firing ceased.
I then ordered Captain Nixon, with his 28 men, to take possession of the fort during the night, put out pickets towards the second fort, and to watch the enemy very carefully. Captain Jardine with his company occupied the beach near the second fort, in order to prevent the enemy from cutting off bur troops in the first fort, and myself with the rest of the troops retreated to the landing place, where we bivouacked.
During the night nothing of importance occurred. The next morning, as soon as the firing of the fleet commenced, I advanced with all my forces, ready to take the second fort as soon as the firing would cease. I ordered Captain Meyer’s company and Adjutant Kluckhuhn, of the Twentieth Eegiment, to cross the beach where the camp of the enemy was evacuated. A color and quartermaster’s stove were found

there. (The color was afterwards delivered to Commodore Stringham, who claimed the same.) A rifle 6-pounder was also landed, and I ordered Lieutenant Johnson, of the Union Coast Guard, to advance with it as far as possible and to fire upon the secession steamers, which was done with great success ; they soon left entirely. We remained thus four hours in this position, the shells bursting over us, when at last the white flag was hoisted On the second fort.
Captain Nixon, the nearest to the fort, prepared immediately to meet the enemy, and was the first who entered the fort. Lieutenant-Colonel Weiss, Captain Yon Doehn, and myself followed; the troops remained 50 yards distant from the fort. I ordered also the surgeons—Dr. Fritz, of the Twentieth Begiment; Dr. Humphreys, of the Ninth Begiment; and Dr. King, of the Navy—to assist dressing the wounded*
I take also the opportunity of mentioning Captain Larned and Lieutenant Lodor and the marine officers, who have rendered me great assistance, and I am greatly obliged to them for their support during the whole expedition.
Though the troops of my regiment had but little occasion to distinguish themselves, I think it still my duty to say that all of them did their duty in every respect.
I have the honor to be, vour most obedient servant,
MAN WEBEB,
Colonel, Commanding Fort Hatter as,

Report of Commander John P. GiUis, TJ. S. Navy,
U. S. Steamer Monticello, Hampton Roads, Ya., September 5, 1861.
Sir : Previous to our leaving Hatteras Inlet with the Harriet Lane in convoy we had cruised along and oft* the coast to the southward; ran close in to Ocracoke Inlet several times. The fort near the beacon-house had apparently no guns mounted, and there was no evidence of its being occupied. In Portsmouth, a small town near by to the southward, a white flag was hoisted on one of the houses, and a number of negroes came down to the beach waving another. Some two or three small schooners were seen in the sound. They left for the interior.
This fort and inlet could readily be taken possession of and held by a small force.
The steamer Peabody, with supplies, arrived at Fort Hatteras on the 4th instant.

﻿Chap. XIII.] CAPTURE OF BATTERIES AT HATTERAS INLET, N. C. 591
on the following morning, at about 10 o’clock, I first visited Captain Rowan, of the TJ. S. steamer Pawnee, in order to report my arrival and the object of my coming, and to solicit such aid as he might be able to render me in the way of boats, &c. He very kindly put a boat at my disposal whenever I might want it.
The two forts or batteries lately captured by our troops are situated on a long sandy island known as Hatteras Island. They are on the southwest end of the island; the larger one, Fort Hatteras, being about one-eighth, and the smaller, Fort Clark, about one mile from the inlet. The sketches accompanying this report will better show the relative positions of the forts and inlet. Fort Hatteras is situated S. 50° W. from the inlet, and at a distance of about one-eighth of a mile. It is a square redoubt, with pan coupes at all the salients. It is constructed of sand, well revetted with sods from the neighboring salt marshes. Its command is about 10 feet above the level of the ocean at high water. It completely commands all the approaches by land and sea. With guns of long range it can successfully defend itself from any fleet, and is so placed with reference to the land approaches that any assaulting column must experience a heavy fire during a long time before reaching it. There is room in the fort for twenty large guns—four on each face and one in each salient. At present there are twelve guns mounted, their positions and caliber being indicated in the accompanying plan.* As most of the guns are on the land and sea fronts, I suggested to the commanding officer the propriety of placing some guns on the front looking toward the approaches by Pamlico Sound.
A causeway leads from the fort to the landing. It is made of sand, filled in between two parallel rows of plank, driven in the sand and covered with sod, thus raising the road about 2 feet above the sand. This causeway is of importance, as with a high tide and easterly wind the whole of the beach up to the foot of the exterior slope is covered with water. On the causeway, near the beach, I found a 10-inch colum-biad, together with its carriage and platform. This gun is, at the suggestion of Captain Rowan, being mounted on the causeway near the water. In this position it has a great horizontal range of fire, and will effectually prevent our shipping from being annoyed by the enemy’s light-draught gunboats. A wharf and storehouse for provisions are absolutely needed if the position is to be held during the war, for the fort has just room enough for its own garrison, and the beach, for before-mentioned reasons, is not a secure place to place provisions. The magazine and bomb-proof shelter is large, but its top being about 5 feet above the interior crest, renders it a conspicuous mark for the enemy’s artillery. It is as well constructed as possible, having at least 6 feet of sand on top of the wooden casing. The floor of the magazine is on a level with the site, below which it could not be sunk on account of the water.
Fort Clark, a redoubt of irregular figure, is situated about three-fourths of a mile from Fort Hatteras, and bearing from it S. 49° E. It is midway between the sound and the ocean—the crest of the exterior slope on the ocean fronts nearly coinciding with the ridge of sand. It has about the same command as Fort Hatteras. On the sea fronts and the front farthest from the inlet the parapet is eighteen feet thick, and armed with 8-inch navy guns. The tenailled front, looking towards Pamlico Sound, has its parapet but 5 feet thick, and was arranged for a musketry defense. Since the capture of the fort three rifled and one old 6-pounder have been mounted on the latter front, small mer-

Ions having been erected to cover the cannoneers. The gorge of the work looks towards Fort Hatteras. The fort is of but little importance, as the enemy cannot approach it from the sound. No danger is apprehended from the ocean, and if the enemy approach by land, a battery of field pieces would offer more resistance. The magazine and bombproof shelter, though not as large, is constructed similarly to the one in Fort Hatteras.
On the morning of the 5th instant I made a reconnaissance for about 3| miles from Fort Clark of the island. The narrowest part of the island is between the two forts. It continues to widen for some 3 miles. At about half a mile from Fort Clark a growth of small live-oak commences, accompanied by marshes and a rank undergrowth. On questioning the inhabitants, I was informed that water might be found almost anywhere by digging wells between high and low water marks. I visited several of the wells, some dug by the enemy, and all were filled with water, and from those that are in use I tasted quite good water. There is no doubt but that there is an abundance of water. At present Fort Hatteras is supplied by water from wells about 3 miles from it; but were wells properly dug in the fort, I have no doubt that plenty of water will be found.
With reference to the subsistence the country affords, I would report that there are many beeves, hogs, and sheep on the island. All the inhabitants that I conversed with unite in complaining of the vandalism of our troops, some houses being completely rifled. Such conduct on the part of our soldiers is but little calculated to conciliate those who may be most useful to us.
In conclusion, I would suggest that some guns of heavy caliber and long range be placed on the fronts of Fort Hatteras, looking towards the inlet and sound. The fort is well situated, and I am not able to suggest any improvements in its construction. All the damages occasioned by the late bombardment are fast being repaired by our troops. The following is the list of the ordnance stores and tlieir condition:
159 32-pounder cartridges, charge eight pounds powder; 75 8-inch navy gun cartridges, eight pounds powder; 15 32-pounder loaded shells; 29 32-pounder cartridge bags; 40 kegs F powder; 400 pounds cannon powder; 801 32 pounder balls; 148 8 inch navy shells, not loaded and without fuses; 10 32-pounder canister; 8 32-pounder grape.
Believing that I have now reported on every point desired by you in your instructions, I have the honor to be, general, your obedient serv-nat,

﻿Chap. XIII.] CAPTURE OF BATTERIES AT HATTER4S INLET, N, C. 593
On the 28th instant, having arrived at ITatteras Inlet in the steamer Winslow, I received a message from Colonel Martin, commanding the Seventh Regiment North Carolina Volunteers, on shore, that he wished to hold a conference with me. I immediately went to Fort Hatteras, accompanied by Colonel Bradford, colonel of artillery and engineers and chief of ordnance of North Carolina, and Lieutenants Murdaugh and Sharp, C. S. Navy. I found the colonel very much exhausted from exposure and hard fighting, which had lasted from 8 a. m. until after dark, during which period of time he had been driven from Fort Clark (after spiking the guns) to Fort Hatteras, the ammunition in the former magazine having been expended. I was exhorted by him and Major Andrews, commanding the post, to assume command of the fort, to which I assented, Colonel Bradford volunteering to assist me in the duties of defense.
In assuming this grave responsibility I was not unaware that we could be shelled out of the fort, but expecting from New Berne the arrival of a regiment of North Carolina volunteers at or before midnight (the fleet having put to sea and appearances indicating bad weather), we designed an assault on Fort Clark, three-quarters of a mile distant from Fort Hatteras, which had been taken possession of by a party landed from the shipping, but unfortunately the regiment did not arrive until the following day, after the bombardment had commenced; and when the time came that I deemed evacuation or surrender unavoidable the means of escape were not at my command.
On the next morning, at 7.40 o’clock, the fleet—consisting of the Minnesota, Wabash, Susquehanna, Cumberland, Pawnee, and Harriet Lane, other steamers being in company—took their positions and opened fire. In addition to the batteries of the ships, the enemy had during the night erected a battery of rifled field guns near to Fort Clark, which also opened on us.
During the first hour the shells of the ships fell short, we only firing occasionally to ascertain whether our shots would reach them, and wishing to reserve our very limited supply of ammunition until the vessels might find it necessary to come nearer in; but they, after some practice, got the exact range of the 9, 10, and 11 inch guns, and did not find it necessary to alter their positions, while not a shot from our battery reached them wTith the greatest elevation we could get. This state of things—shells bursting over and in the fort every few seconds—having continued for about three hours, the men were directed to take shelter under the parapet and traverses, and I called a council of officers, at which it was unanimously agreed that holdiug out longer could only result in a greater loss of life, without the ability to damage our adversaries, and just at this time the magazine being reported on fire, a shell having fallen through the ventilator of the bomb-proof into the room ad joining the principal magazine, I ordered a white flag to be shown, when the firing ceased, and the surrender was made upon the conditions of the accompanying articles of capitulation.*
The personnel of the command are nowr prisoners of war on board this ship, where everything is done to make them as comfortable as possible under the circumstances, Flag Officer Stringham, Captain Van Brunt, and Commander Case extending to us characteristic courtesy and kindness. We are to be landed at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor.

Report of Brig. Gen. Joseph K. F. Mansfield, TJ. S. Army.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fort Monroe, October 5, 1861.
Sir: I have the honor to report to the Lieutenant-General commanding that yesterday afternoon the steamer Pawnee arrived from Hatteras Inlet, and brought the captain and crew of the steamer Fanny, a steamer that had been chartered as a tender and defense at the inlet. (I should have made this report by yesterday’s mail if I had not been at the time of the above arrival at Newport News and did not return till after dark.) It appears that the steamer Fanny left Fort Hatteras about 6 a. m. on the 1st instant, with ammunition and supplies for the Twentieth Indiana Regiment, stationed some 40 miles on the beach northward, at a locality called Chicamacomico, or Loggerhead Inlet. She had on board Capt. I. W. Hart, Sergeant-Major Peacock, and about 23 Dien of the Twentieth Indiana and Ninth New York Regiments, with a Sawyer gun and a large supply of ammunition and stores for the troops. When within 5 miles of her destination she met the IJ. S. naval steamer Putnam, which turned round and convoyed her to anchorage in 6 feet of water off the landing some 3 miles. The Putnam put on board the Fanny a rifled cannon and ammunition therefor, and then started for Fort Hatteras. At the same time stated she had seen a rebel steamer westward, and gave as reason for returning that she was short of coal. In about an hour and a half after, say at 2.30, a large flat from the shore came alongside the Fanny and received a load of supplies, such as tents, bread, &c. In about two hours after, three steamers approached from the westward, and at a long range commenced an attack. Not a shot struck the Fanny, and some eight or nine shots were fired at the enemy, one of which took effect. Then the cable was slipped and the Fanny was run ashore some 2| miles still from the beach, and the crew abandoned her in a boat, and the officer in charge, Captain Hart, hoisted a white flag, and surrendered before a gun was fired on either side. The captain of the Fanny, John M. Morrison, left in a small boat with his sick son. The mate, George K. Ridgely, and engineer and others of the crew remained until the white flag was hoisted. Some ammunition was thrown overboard, but the guns were not thrown overboard nor the boat sunk, as was recommended by the mate and engineer. The steamer Fanny was an excellent boat for the station, and her boiler and engine in excellent order. The above facts I obtained from a personal examination of the captain, mate, engineer, and a deck hand separately.

Norfolk, October 5, 1861.
Sir: As I informed you by telegraph, Col. A. R/Wright, commanding Third Georgia Regiment, writes from Eoanoke Island, dated 2d instant, stating u We received information yesterday morning that the Yankees were about landing men near Chicamacomico, and immediately left this post, taking 150 men on board the steamers Curlew, Raleigh, and Junaluski, Commodore Lynch being in command of these vessels. At 5 p. m. we came in sight of a steamer (Federal), which proved to be the Fanny, having on board a quantity of quartermasters and commissary stores for the Twentieth Indiana Regiment, in command of Captain Hart. After an engagement of thirty-five minutes the Fanny surrendered, and we made prisoners of the entire force—47 men, 2 officers, and 1 negro. The Fanny mounted two rifled cannon, and made a gallant resistance, but the superior weight of our guns gave us the advantage. The gun of the Curlew was manned by a crew from Captain McWhorter’s company of this regiment, and worked their gun beautifully. All behaved well. We had to return for want of fuel, and I am now engaged with all my men cutting wood, and as soon as I can get a supply we will return and endeavor to capture the Federals who are encamped at Chicamacomico. We cannot send the prisoners up to-day for want of fuel. Indeed, we are almost helpless here on this account.” Yobody hurt. I will do all in my power to assist the forces at Roanoke to push on.

Sir : I have the honor to report that, on the -11th instant, a scouting p>arty, sent below by me, was fired on by the enemy, and one of our men, a private of Captain Adams7 company, Third Eegiment Virginia Cavalry, was wounded slightly in three places. The fire was returned, and after the third discharge from our artillery, the enemy, whose force proved to be a regiment, fled. I have reliable information that several of them were killed or wounded.
On the night of the 12th an ambuscading force was sent forward by me. While the troops were moving into position on the morning of November 13 two of my vedettes approached the infantry position of the Georgia Legion, at the time commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Garnett. From some cause, after a short parley, they turned and rode off at full speed. At this a fire was opened upon them without orders from the commander. I regret to report that in the effort to cause the fire to cease (many of the officers being in front at its commencement), Major Bagley was killed, Captain Morris and one private wounded, and Colonel Garnett’s horse shot under him.

JANUARY 3, 1862.—Reconnaissance from Camp Hamilton to Big Bethel, Va.
Report of Col. Max Weber, Twentieth New York Infantry.
Headquarters,
Camp Hamilton, Va., January 5, 1862.
Sir : I have the honor to report :
According to your order I undertook a reconnaissance towards Big Bethel Friday, January 3, to ascertain whether the enemy still occupied or had evacuated said position. I started from Camp Hamilton at 9 a. m. with the Union Coast Guard, under command of Col. D. W. Wardrop; six companies of the Twentieth Regiment New York Volunteers, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Weiss, and three companies of the Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Cavalry, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Spear, and reached Little Bethel at 10 p. m. Leaving four companies at the most important positions to cover our retreat, I assigned the principal task to the cavalry, for the purpose of attaining my object by surprising the enemy, who had thus far never seen any cavalry on our side. I therefore marched within 2 miles of Big Bethel and took position with the infantry to cover the retreat of the cavalry. I ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Spear to advance cautiously; to charge and secure the pickets which he might fall in with; to proceed as near as possible to the intrencliments until he should meet a superior force or receive a round of artillery. Lieutenant-Colonel Spear executed this order most satisfactorily. Within a short mile of Big Bethel he met the first mounted picket and attacked it forthwith. Upon discharging their pieces they took to flight, likewise the second picket. Lieutenant-Colonel Spear pursued them within the intrenchments, and from there observed the enemy in full run on the road to Yorktown. The enemy being in advantage with their fresh horses, Lieutenant-Colonel Spear discontinued the pursuit.
The intrenchments, which are of inferior strength, comprise the surface of half a mile. They are qualified to quarter 2,000 or 3,000 men, and can mount about eight or ten cannon. Preparations for winter quarters half finished and timber block-houses and a quantity of boards were found within the intrenchments.
After a short stay I ordered the cavalry to return, and marched back to Camp Hamilton, where we arrived at 6 p. in., ail well.
The object of the reconnaissance met with perfect success. It is ascertained that the enemy has evacuated Big Bethel, and is most likely concentrated in full force at Yorktown.
All the farm-houses and barns on the road to Big Bethel were found burned down and destroyed. The whole country presents a sad picture of desolation.
I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

correct idea of tlieir numerical force, but should judge from 4,000 to 5,000. There were no vessels or encampments of any kind either at York or Back Bivers or at New Market Bridge. On a branch of James Biver, about 5 miles from Newport News, on the opposite side, there is a vessel at anchor. On the left bank of James Biver, about 8 or 9 miles from Newport News, is a large encampment of the enemy, from 150 to 200 tents, also an encampment in the rear of the Pig Point batteries of from 40 to 50 tents. At Norfolk two large skips of war are lying at anchor in the stream, one of which appeared all ready for sea, with sails bent, &c. No operations at Tanner’s Creek. I illustrate what I saw by the accompanying hasty diagram.* The guns which 1 discovered in a previous ascension proved to be only heavy field pieces mounted on carriages. Along the coast below Sewell’s Point no batteries or enemy were visible.

The President of the United States having assigned Brevet Major-General Wool to the command of this department, Major-General Butler begs in a final order to take leave of the troops lately under his command.
He is happy to acknowledge the alacrity and cheerfulness of the officers and men under duties most fatiguing and perplexing, because inactive, and he only regrets that he cannot award praise to all.
He begs to make honorable mention of the uniform good conduct of the Twentieth Begiment New York Volunteers; the Union Coast Guard, under great difficulties for want of organization, under Captain Helleday, and the corps of mounted men at Camp Hamilton; to the men and a large portion of the officers of the First New York Volunteers, who under great embarrassments have maintained the discipline and efficiency of this regiment. Especial praise is awarded to the Ninth Begiment, under Colonel Hawkins, except in a single instance, which the regiment as well as the general sincerely regrets, and which the subsequent good conduct of the regiment will entirely obliterate.
High commendation is given to Colonel Carr and the officers and true men of the Second New York Begiment, who have withstood the misrepresentations of newspapers, the appeals of partisans, politicians, and the ill-judged advice of friends at home, and the influences of bad associates, and remained loyal to the flag of their country. Very great credit is due them.

The Seventh New York Begiment, owing to the unfortunate disagreement among the officers, have not attained that efficiency in their discipline and drill which the country requires of them. The Tenth Begiment and companies of the regular artillery, being more immediately under the command of Colonel Dimick at the Fortress, are brought to the notice of the general from the favorable report of the commandant. The general’s official connection with them has been very pleasant, and he desires to bear testimony to the faithful discharge of their duty. The unattached companies of Massachusetts volunteers have by their good conduct merited approbation, and the command of Captain Davis deserves special commendation.
The general desires also to bear testimony to the ability and efficiency with which the quartermaster’s and commissary departments have been conducted.
The general takes leave of the command of the officers and soldiers of this department with the kindest feelings towards all, and with the hope that in active service upon the field they may soon signalize their bravery and gallant conduct, as they have shown their patriotism by fortitude under the fatigues of camp duty.
No personal feeling of regret intrudes itself at the change in the command of the department, by which our cause acquires the services in the field of the veteran general commanding, in whose abilities, experience, and devotion to the flag the whole country places the most implicit reliance, and under whose guidance and command all of us, and none more than your late commander, are proud to serve.

It is reported to me that seven of the artillery officers have been appointed in the quartermaster’s and commissary departments. I have been compelled to take Captain Churchill for assistant adjutant-general. This leaves but five artillery officers. Notwithstanding, however, Captain Churchill, although his duties are exceedingly onerous,

attends to the duties of his company. From this circumstance, not finding a volunteer officer fit for the duty, I have been compelled to take Captain Raynolds, of the Topographical Engineers, for aide-de-camp, which I request may be approved. I require two more, as the assistance of Captain Raynolds is indispensable in the office of the acting assistant adjutant-general.
The Tenth New York Regiment is attached to the garrison of Fort Monroe, but are wholly unfit for the position. As soon as 1 can make the arrangements, I intend to exchange this regiment for another and a better one.
To operate on this coast with success (I mean between this and Florida) we want more troops. At any rate, I think we ought to have a much larger force in this department. If I had 20,000 or 25,000 men, in conjunction with the Navy, we could do much on this coast to bring back from Virginia the troops of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia; but the arrangements should be left to Commodore String* ham and myself. I do not think it can be done efficiently at Washington. We know better than any one at Washington attached to the Navy what we require for such expeditions.

All such persons or others residing within the pale of this command, engaged in farming, cultivating their fields and gardens, tending their flocks or herds, or bringing provisions or supplies to the several camps or posts for the use of the troops, and pursuing peaceably their ordinary avocations, and who do not communicate, directly or indirectly, with the rebel forces, and who may comply with such orders as may be given them, will be protected in their persons and property. Any violation of this order by officers or soldiers, or any parties interested, will be severely punished, and those who force a safe-guard, on conviction before a court-martial, will be punished with death.
II.	The attention of all who are embraced in this order, and of all others whose business brings them within the limits of this command, whether by land or water, is called to the fifty-sixth and fifty-seventh articles of war, as follows:
56.	Whosoever shall relieve the enemy with money, victuals, or ammunition, or shall knowingly harbor or protect an enemy, shall suffer death, or such other punishment as shall be ordered by the sentence of a court-martial.

C. 0. CHURCHILL,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fort Monroe, Va.7 September 3,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : I had the honor to receive your communication of the 2d instant, in which you request all the muskets we can spare. I have directed 1,500 stand of arms to be sent, which leaves of muskets and rifles in store but 557. I will send these to you if we have, as reported, 1,000 stand at the batteries at Hatteras Inlet. These I will send for this evening, and probably they will be here in two or three days. I am apprehensive, however, that many of the latter are in a very bad condition, and will require repairs and cleaning.
With your letter I received one from Major-General Butler, in which he states that “ by a unanimous vote the Cabinet approved of holding the forts at Hatteras,” which I think ought to be done, provided we can be supported by the Navy. Without the latter it could not be done without several more regiments. I shall, however, send this day for the force there, 812 rank and file, thirty-seven days7 rations for each man, and 200 32-pounder shell for fourteen 32-pounder guns. I will also send an engineer to examine the batteries and position, and to. report to me what may be necessary for its defenses. I do not, however, feel authorized to do more until I receive official orders on the subject from proper authority and what is desired. It is not enough for my action in the case to be merely notified of the decision of the Cabinet, unless it is officially transmitted by proper authority. There should be no delay in the matter.
The xiosition and batteries must be defended by both Army and Navy. As far as I am informed of what is desired by the President or Secretary of War, I will adopt measures to secure the position. To do so, however, requires two more regiments. I may do it with a less number of troops with efficient aid from the Navy. The position, as it appears, should be maintained, as I consider it the most important on the Southern coast.
In order that I may, with as little delay as possible, learn the views of the administration on so important a subject, I send this communication by Captain Raynolds, of the Topographical Engineers, who I could wish might be confirmed as aide-de-camp, with the rank of major. He has been acting in that capacity since I assumed command.
In conclusion, allow me to call your immediate attention to what is herein contained. We have a prize, and I do not wish to lose it.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Your letter of the 3d instant, improperly addressed to the Secretary of War, has been referred to the General-in-Chief. Besides the regiment the arrival of which is acknowledged by you the 2d instant (the Sixteenth Massachusetts), the governor of New York was requested, about a week ago, to send you three additional regiments, which may begin to arrive in a week from this date. That re-enforcement will enable you to hold your posts in Hampton Boads and in Hatteras Inlet. Your reported acts in respect to the latter are approved, over which you will continue to exercise command, consulting from time to time the naval commander in Hampton Boads, and obtaining from him such assistance as he and you may deem necessary to enable you to execute your duties.
The general suggests for your consideration whether it may not be expedient to send a company or larger detachment of regulars to serve as a basis of discipline for the principal work in Hatteras Inlet.
The above is written at the direction of Lieutenant-General Scott.

Sir : Colonel Butler will hand you this communication. The object is to obtain from you your views in regard to the keeping and defending the position recently captured at Hatteras Inlet. Besides vessels of war—how many I am unable to say—we have 812 rank and file at the inlet. How well they are commanded, being volunteers, I am unable to say, from the circumstance that I have not been long enough acquainted with the officers to pronounce upon their ability or efficiency to command. If the Government intends to hold the position I ought to know the fact, in order to know how to perform what may be required from the army or the troops in this department. With a sufficient number of vessels of war the present force, with the addition of some 400 or 500 rank and file, might defend the position. A communication, however, should be kept uj> between Fort Monroe and the inlet, not only to furnish additional troops, if required, but to supply the troops with water, provisions, and ordnance stores. For this x>urpose we should have two first-rate steamers, but certainly one. All the water to supply the troops must be taken from Baltimore. Some light-draught vessels of war, such as cquld traverse the sound, should be furnished. These should not draw more than seven feet of water—at most eight feet— and they should be armed with rifled guns. The prize is too great to be lost, but to defend it properly and securely, it will depend on the Navy. Without vessels of war it cannot be defended but by a large military force.
It is rumored by passengers from North Carolina and Virginia that the people are determined to retake it. It will be well, however, whether true or false, to be on our guard and prepared for coming events. As

also the artillery left by Captain Larned. It is reported to me that some of the troops who landed at the inlet committed depredations on the inhabitants. You can assure the inhabitants that I will not only j)unish the offenders, but will see justice done them, at least to the amount taken from them, which was yesterday ordered, if it could be found, to be restored to them.
I hope you will forewarn all who may be guilty of such infamous practices, for the severest jiunishment awaits such conduct.
You will send by the steamer when she returns all the small*arms taken at the capture of the troops and forts.
You will report to me by return steamer the state of your command and whatever may be necessary to a right understanding of its condition, and what may be considered proper to make it all it should be for the defense of the position.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN E. WOOL,

Fort Monroe, Fn., September 13, 1861. Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, General-in- Chief:
General: On the. 11th instant I reported that I sent to Hatteras Inlet one company of artillery and five companies of the Ninth Regi-ment New York Volunteers, commanded by Colonel Hawkins. The steamer Spaulding returned this morning with 500 men of Weber’s regiment (Germans). By this conveyance I received two reports from Colonel Hawkins, dated 7th and 11th instant, with four other papers, marked A to D. (Copies of all inclosed.) They show that an artillery officer is much wanted at Hatteras Inlet. Fortunately Brigadier-General Reynolds arrived this morning. He will proceed to-morrow with the two remaining companies of the Ninth. He will also take lumber with him to build a wharf and storehouse.
I am anxiously looking for more troops, not only for this place, but for Hatteras Inlet. It is uncertain when they may be required at the latter place. We have only 300 regulars (artillery) at this place and Newport News. To fill the seven companies we require 260 recruits. We have one company of volunteer cavalry, 90 strong. Taking away 30 men, drivers, from the light battery, will for the present break up that light battery. It is said that the cavalry volunteers will soon be ordered to Washington. This will deprive me of all means to make reconnaissances beyond the pickets. Proper reconnaissances cannot be made without cavalry. Before these are taken from me I earnestly hope a squadron of the U. S. cavalry or dragoons will be sent me. I cannot get along well in this position without light artillery and cavalry. Before sending any more troops than those that will embark to morrow to Hatteras Inlet, I will wait for a report from Brigadier-General Reynolds by the return steamer.
1 have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN E. WOOL,
Major- General.

[Chap . XIII.
During the afternoon of the 30th a delegation, on behalf of the citizens of this island, waited upon me, and placed in my hand a paper, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, and marked A. In answer to this communication I requested that as many of the citizens as could should meet me the next day, for the purpose of arranging terms by which they might be permitted to remain here. Agreeably to my request about thirty came to see me, and the terms contained in an oath, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, and marked B, were agreed upon. On my part I have agreed verbally to give, them all the necessary protection against the vigilance committees which infest all parts of the State, and are organized for the purpose of suppressing Union sentiments and pressing men into the service of the Confederate Army, and to afford them such other protection as may appear necessary. Two hundred and fifty have taken the oath, and they are still coming in.
I am informed by some of these people that secret Union meetings have been held in several of the counties bordering on the Pamlico Sound, and that they would openly avow themselves true to the United States Government if they were sure that they would be protected against the violence of the secessionists. It is also thought that a Union convention would be called at once, and that these counties would vote themselves back into the Union, and take up arms to defend themselves if necessary.
In view of the foregoing facts, I would suggest that a force of at least 1,000 men be scattered through one or two of the counties which are supposed to be Union in their sentiment; that the people call their convention and vote, and that the United States forces at hand afford them such protection as may be necessary. Could this be done now, I have no doubt that one-third of the State of North Carolina would be back in the Union within two weeks.
I am over-anxious that these suggestions should be acted upon at once, and that I may be allowed to continue in the work which I have commenced. These people who look to me for protection I have already taken a very deep interest in; I sympathize with them in their misfortunes, and would do anything for them in my power. I fear that if I am superseded the promises I have made will not be carried out, and that the measures I have commenced will fall to the ground.
I regret to be compelled to state to you that the conduct of the men and some of the officers of the Twentieth Regiment New York Volunteers has been that of vandals. They have plundered and destroyed. The first night they were on shore they visited one of the encampments which had been abandoned by the enemy. I am informed that this party was under the charge of three or four commissioned officers; that they first commenced breaking open trunks left behind by the officers and men who had abandoned the camp. After they had broken all the trunks and boxes open, and partly destroyed what they did not want or could not carry away, they then set fire to the buildings, and everything except a few tents was consumed. After this they went to Fort Clark, where they had a repetition of the above. By these two transactions the United States has lost a large amount of valuable property, consisting of arms, cooking utensils, medical stores, &c.
The next day they commenced breaking open private houses and stores, and I saw party after party come in, some of them headed by commissioned officers, loaded clown with the results of their plundering. This conduct continued until I was compelled to adopt the most severe and stringent measures. You will see by the inclosed copies of letters, marked C and D, what I have done, and I hope it will meet with your

approval. I believe that such creatures as these will do our cause more harm than good, and that they are a disgrace to the arms they bear and the flag which is over them.
Suggestions.
First. Koanoke Island, which commands the channel between Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds, should be occupied at once. It is now held by the rebels* They have a battery completed at the northern end of the island and another in course of erection at the south end.
Second. A small force should be stationed on Beacon Island, which is in the mouth of the Ocracoke Inlet, and commands it.
Third. Two or three light-draught vessels should be stationed between the mouths of the Neuse and Pamlico Rivers; this would shut out all commerce from New Berne and Washington, both of which have been entrepots for privateers.
Fourth. There should be at least eight light-draught gunboats in Pamlico Sound.
Fifth. Beaufort should be occupied as soon as possible.
All of these things should be done, if at all, immediately. Seven thousand men, judiciously placed upon the soil of North Carolina, would draw 20,000 troops from the State of Virginia. I wish, if you agree with me, and if you should deem it consistent with your duty, that you would press upon the Government the importance and necessity of immediate action in this department.
If it is proper for me to report to you, you will in that event please receive this as a report.
Most faithfully, your obedient servant,
RUSH C. HAWKINS,
Colonel Ninth Regiment N. Y. Volunteers, Comdg, Fort Clark.
Maj. Gen. John E. Wool,

Fort Clark,
Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, September 11, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report the reception of your favor of the 10th, the contents of which have been carefully noted; also the orders forwarded by Captain Taylor. For my answer, in part, I would refer you to my inclosed report of the 7th, which should have been transmitted by the steamer George Peabody.
I take great pleasure in announcing to you the continued strengthening of my belief in the loyalty of the citizens of this State who inhabit the counties bordering on the Pamlico Sound. The sincerity of the people who live upon the strip of land running from Hatteras Inlet to Oregon Inlet is not to be doubted; they have all taken the oath of allegiance, which you will perceive is a strong one, and have shown every disposition to assist me in every manner possible, such as furnishing me with supplies, giving information of the movements of the enemy, &c. I have sent three of the most intelligent of their number to the other side of the sound, for the purpose of informing the inhabitants of the real intentions of the Federal Army and ascertaining what the real feeling is among the people.
My belief is that troops could be raised here for the purpose of suppressing rebellion in North Carolina upon the assurance that they would not be called on to go out of the State. I have been unable to secure any considerable amount of property plundered from the inhabitants. That which I have been able to get hold of has been returned. I presume .	39 R R—VOL iy

[Ciiap. XIII.
that $5,000 will pay for all the property taken, and I would suggest that the Government make provision for paying it as soon as possible.
The people upon this strip of land have been peculiarly situated. Since the secession of this State their means of subsistence have been completely taken away from them, and now they are mostly without food or clothing, and in the winter, unless something can be done before, there will be great suffering among them. Cannot the Government send them flour, meat, cloth for clothing, and some shoes ? Each dollar spent in such acts of charity would bring scores of friends over the whole South.
If Fort Clark is to be occupied, two of the 32-pounders should be removed, and in their place two 9-inch guns should be substituted. This would make the defense on the water side complete, and these guns could be brought to bear on the land approach. A field howitzer and one 12-pounder gun should be added to the face fronting the land. I have mounted in this fort the two 6-pounders captured from the enemy and two more loaned me by the flag-officer of the squadron, which make eight guns ready for service.
Fort Hatteras should have at least six of the 32-pounders removed, and substituted in their place at least three 9-inch guns, two 8-inch, and one rifled gun of large caliber and longest range. The number of troops to remain at each fort should be designated at once, and suitable barracks built immediately for their accommodation. The soil is of sand; the tides rise very high; strong winds prevail here during the winter, and, in my belief, tents would be of no service whatever. There should be sent here, for the exclusive use of Forts Hatteras and Clark and the encampments in the immediate vicinity, a strong light-draught (say from 4 to 6 feet) steamer, with four or five substantial row-boats and one light one for the officer in command.
The sand is so deep that horses are of little or no use, and all communication and transportation must be by water. An abundant supply of fuel should also be sent without delay. I cannot see the use or necessity of holding Fort Clark. It is a mere outpost at best, and could be easily taken by surprise in the night.
Fort Hatteras, with the guns mounted as above mentioned, the Pawnee inside and one vessel with heavy guns outside, could defend itself against the combined Confederate force in the daytime. Perfect security could be gained by digging a ditch across a neck of sand to the south of the fort, and thus surrounding it completely by water.
I still adhere to all of the suggestions contained in my former report, and would most respectfully urge the importance of immediately occupying Roanoke and Beacon Islands. The ball moves too slowly; one success should follow another in quick succession.
Four prizes have been taken since our forces landed—three from Saint Martin’s, W. I., and one from Halifax, IS". S. The latter had a valuable cargo of army supplies, and the three former had salt and molasses; all owned in North Carolina. The total value of vessels and cargoes is about $225,000.
The detachment which came here with me is in good health and spirits. The men have worked willingly and well, and have undergone all privations without a murmur.
I am, dear sir, most faithfully, your obedient servant,
RUSH C. HAWKINS,
Colonel Ninth Regiment N. Y. Volunteers, Commanding Forts Hatteras and Clark.

To the Commander of the
Federal Forces at Hatteras Inlet:
Dear Sir : We, the citizens of Cape Hatteras, do ask of your honor that you will allow us to return to our homes and property and protect us in the same as natural citizens, as we have never taken up arms against your Government, nor has it been our wish to do so. We did not help by our votes to get North Carolina out of the Union. Believing that your clemency will not allow you to treat us as rebels, who have always been loyal citizens, we do earnestly request, for the sake of our women and children, that you will comply with our wishes, as we seek protection from your honor.
Yours, very respectfully,
CITIZENS OF HATTEEAS.
P. S.—Please let us know by the bearer what we can depend upon,

We, the undersigned, do solemnly swear that we will true allegiance bear to the United States of North America; that we will not take up arms against said Government, or hold any communication with its enemies, or aid or comfort its enemies in any way whatever, and that we will give to the commandant of Fort Clark any information we may obtain or receive of the approach of the enemy; and in case we are called upon we will assist the commandant of said fort in his defense thereof against any and all the enemies of the said United States of North America, and we will always, under any and all circumstances,; support the Constitution of the said United States.

Fort Clark, N. C., September 2,1861.,
Col, Max Weber :
Deaf Colonel : I learn with great regret that your men and others under your command still continue to commit depredations against the property of the inhabitants of this island. It seems that they pass from the fort, over which you have command, to the land above by boats. This must and shall stop. These people are worthy, loyal citizens, and have taken the oath to support the Constitution of the United States, and they ought to and shall be protected in their rights of property and person, and I shall in future use all the power under my control to see that they are protected. This passage by boats must cease from this date, and if it cannot be prevented by any other means, I shall use my artillery against all the boats I may see pass. I have promised these people protection, and intend to keep my promise good.
Yours, very truly,
EUSH C. HAWKINS.
Colonel, Commanding.

under my command commit wanton destruction of property or depredations against the inhabitants of the island, for you may be sure that I dislike and hate those plunderings and destructions just as much as any one can do, and think them perfectly unworthy a soldier; but I wish you had informed me of these facts in a more friendly way than you have done. Your last remark—to fire with artillery against the boats before you received even an answer to your letter—sounds almost offensive, and seems to indicate that I agreed with those disorders.
Allow me, therefore, to explain to you my orders concerning these boats:
First. No boat can leave without my permission and an officer to accompany it, and only for a certain purpose.
Second. Every boat returning is searched by the adjutant.
Third. The reasons for dispatching boats are: To get water, boards, and some cooking apparatus, because we have none, and meat, &c., for me and the officers, which we gave receipts for. We have but four barrels of water, and officers as well as men have to cook with salt water. We have no barracks and but few tents, and most of us have to sleep without shelter. Though General Butler told me to make requisitions for all I wanted, I have not done so, because I expect a steamer from Fort Monroe. You see, colonel, till then I cannot stop these expeditions to the island, but if your pickets will watch them, you will greatly oblige me. I remark on every passport for what purpose they are sent. Trespassers please deliver to me, and I shall punish them severely.
I think our condition and responsibility require us to support each other as much as possible in case of an attack of the enemy, as well as in providing for the troops of our command.

General : I have this moment received your communication of the 12th instant, directing four artillery companies to Washington—the four companies about 200 strong—leaving one company in Fort Monroe, one at Newport News, and one at Hatteras Inlet, about 50 strong. We are thus, as you perceive, left with only about 130 regular artillery for Fort Monroe and Newport News, the most important post on the coast and the key to all the States south. It would appear that you sent the letter by an officer, who transferred it to Captain Stringhanffs secretary, who staid a night in Baltimore, and consequently delayed its reception one day.
At the same time I received a letter, dated the 12th, from headquarters, ordering Brigadier-General Reynolds, now at this post, to repair to the Army of the Potomac.
I also received a letter from Major-General Dix, containing the names of fifteen persons taken into custody by order of the Government, and “ transferred to this post for safe-keeping/7 with the directions oi the Secretary of War u to keep them in close custody, suffering no one to communicate with them, and to convey them at once to Fort Monroe, there to remain in close custody until they shall be forwarded to their ultimate destination.77

My Dear Sir : Since conversing with you I have concluded to request you to frame an order for recruiting North Carolinians at Fort Hatteras. I suggest it be so framed as for us to accept a smaller force— even a company—if we cannot get a regiment or more. What is necessary to now say about officers, you will judge. Governor Seward says he has a nephew (Clarence A. Seward, I believe) who would be willing to go and play colonel and assist in raising the force. Still, it is to be considered whether the North Carolinians will not prefer officers of their own. I should expect they would.
Yours, very truly,

The commanding officer of the IT. S. forces at Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, is authorized to accept the services of such loyal North Carolinians, not to exceed one regiment, as in his neighborhood may volunteer to take up arms for the United States, and to designate a regular officer to muster them into service.
The recruits will be organized, in the first instance, into a battalion, or regiment, according to numbers. The mustering officer will make timely requisitions for arms and other necessary supplies, and the commanding officer will, on the recommendation of the volunteers, propose such persons as he may deem suitable to officer the companies, battalion, or regiment, that they may, if approved, be commissioned by the President.

intended to send more men to Hatteras, but have withheld them because of my regular troops having been withdrawn to Washington.
I would be much gratified if you would tell me what I am to do with the negro slaves that are almost daily arriving at this post from the interior. Am I to find food and shelter for the women and children, who can do nothing for themselves ? Thus far we have been able to employ in various ways most of the adults. It appears to me some positive instructions should be given in regard to what shall be done for the number that will be accumulated in and about this post during the approaching winter. I hope you will give me instructions on this very important subject. Humanity requires that they should be taken care of.

Fort Monroe, September 18,1861. Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States :
Sir : The bearer of this letter, Colonel Cannon, has been acting on my staff as aide-de-camp for about two weeks. From his ability and opportunity for information, he has become familiar with many important questions relating to this department, and will be able to explain various circumstances connected with it that concern the public service, and for this purpose he goes by my direction to Washington. Among the topics to which I would again respectfully invite your attention through him is the necessity for additional aides, in regard to which I had the honor to address you yesterday. Major Cannon will explain to you the case of Lieutenant Harris, whom you appointed aide-de-camp on my recommendation, yet the appointment is withheld at the Ordnance Bureau, as I am informed, to my very serious inconvenience, having no regular officer as an aide.
The state prisoners arrested in Baltimore (the mayor and others) have been here for several days in close custody without any direct authority or instructions from the Government, the only official communication to me on this subject being an extract from a letter addressed to General Dix and sent me by the latter. I have written to the Secretary of War in regard to them, but have received no reply. Major Cannon can explain fully their condition, and the difficulty I have in keeping them safely, from the crowded state of the fort, without injury to their health from insufficient air and ventilation. Major Cannon can also explain fully my situation as to the force at my disposal. The regular troops have nearly all been withdrawn to Washington, and about 1,000 men, barely sufficient for the purpose, have been sent to Hatteras Inlet from this command, reducing the force at this post, the most important position on the Atlantic coast, to so low a point as to put it out of my power to make any forward movement, and almost invite an attack from the enemy.
It was my intention to have sent more troops to Hatteras, but in consequence of the reduction above referred to I have been precluded from doing so.

General: Your communications of the 17th* and 18th are received. In regard to the letters sent or received by flags of truce, I would suggest that for the present they be examined by volunteer officers whom you might detail for that purpose. I would much prefer that this examination should be made under the direction of the Post-Office Department, and will endeavor to effect some arrangement that will relieve you from this labor.
I am also informed by the Adjutant-General that he has already sent you two aides-de-camp. Ordnance officers are much needed, and for this reason I cannot consent to the appointment of Lieutenant Harris as your aide, unless it is absolutely necessary that you should have his services in that capacity. I send herewith tire appointment of William P. Jones as an aide, in accordance with your recommendation. Captain Whipple has been assigned to you as assistant adjutant-general.
The state prisoners now in your custody should be sent at once to Port Lafayette, New York Harbor. You will, as early as practicable, send to General McClellan at this place all negro men capable of performing labor, accompanied by their families. They can be usefully employed on the military works in this vicinity.

Fort Monroe, September 22, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir: I have received this morning your communication of the 20th instant. In regard to the examination of letters by flags of truce I would state that I have no volunteer officers to spare for this duty, and none that would perform it efficiently. I have received a letter from the Assistant Postmaster-General on this subject approving of their transmission to the Post-Office Department. As I have 1,500 letters waiting examination I shall, without attempting to examine them, await instructions from the Postmaster-General.
The two aides whom I suppose you refer to as sent me by the Adjutant-General are my personal friends, who came here to relieve me, at my request, when I was without assistance and pressed by a heavy official correspondence in addition to my other duties. They have declined pay or emoluments, and bear their own expenses, thus making no charge to the Government. They are distinguished for capability, efficiency, and promptness, but I may be deprived of the relief they

afford me at any time when otlier duties compel them to return, as these gentlemen informed me ivhen I asked their aid.
I make this explanation in reference to my present or future applications for additional aides. I haye no officer of the Eegular Army as aide, and Lieutenant-Colonel Oram, ordered here on duty as topographical engineer, is willing to perform that duty, and act also as my aide. I shall therefore ask the President that Major Cram, who is probably lieutenant-colonel by his seniors being retired, be appointed aide, with the rank of colonel, as it seems there is no other officer of the Army available for this position, and his ability and long service will render him especially useful to me. I understood from Colonel Cannon that you were willing to assent to this arrangement.
I am only awaiting the arrival of a steamer to forward the State prisoners here to Fort Latayette, and expect they will leave to-morrow or Tuesday.
I have called for an immediate report from the proper officers as to the negroes here, in reference to General McClellan’s request, which will be ready in a day or two, and I shall then forward as many as can be spared from the public works in progress at this post and upon which they are engaged, viz: A new redoubt, railroad and other roads, bridges, &c.
I would again repeat that I have here but one permanent aide, Captain Jay, a civilian; the other two, Messrs. Cannon and Hamilton, whose services are purely gratuitous, will probably be called away shortly, and I shall then have but two civilians. Major Jones and Captain Jay, and with the aid of all these gentlemen, and the volunteer services of Lieutenant Colonel Cram in addition, I am occupied from o o’clock in the morning until 9 or 10 in the evening, and sometimes later, in the discharge of the multifarious duties that devolve upon me, incident from the peculiar position of this department.
In conclusion, I would remark that I have just received dispatches from Hatteras Inlet. I think they are of sufficient importance to claim your immediate attention. I have inclosed copies to Lieutenant-General Scott.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN E. WOOL,

Commanding Department of Virginia, Fort Monroe, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to report that your communication of the 18th ultimo is at hand and contents duly noted.
On the 12th instant I ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Betts to take four companies of my regiment and proceed 2 miles up the west side of the island and there to establish a camp. My reasons for this step were that I had no place for them elsewhere. I wanted an advance post, for the purpose of checking any approach of the enemy by land, securing good water, and a healthy location. A picket is thrown out some 2 miles beyond this camp, thus bringing under my immediate observation and control some 6 miles of the lower end of the island. This camp, in honor of yourself, has been named Camp Wool.
On the 15th instant I learned through one of the citizens that the enemy were carrying off the guns from Beacon Island. On the morning of the 16th instant an expedition, consisting in part of the Union Coast Guard, under the charge of Lieutenants Rowe and Patten, and a detachment from the crew of the steamer Pawnee, under the charge of Lieutenant Maxwell, U. S. Navy, the whole under the command of Lieutenant Eastman, of the steamer Pawnee, embarked on board the steamer Fanny and one of the launches belonging to the Pawnee, and X>roceeded immediately to Beacon Island, where they found a large battery, mounting twenty-two guns, four of which had been taken away the day previous on the steamer Washington to New Berne. Eighteen guns still remained, four 8-inch navy guns and fourteen navy 32s, all of which were destroyed and left in a perfectly useless condition by the men under the charge of Lieutenant Eastman. A boat’s crew of the expedition then proceeded to the town of Portsmouth, where they found four more guns, one mounted and three buried in the sand on the beach. These were also destroyed.
The bomb proofs at the battery, four in number, were then destroyed. All the wood work of the battery, together with a large pile of lumber, was then burned. A light-shiji, which had been towed from its moorings by the rebels, with the intention of taking it to Washington, was also burned. The expedition then returned, bringing with it some eighty shells taken from the battery.
While deprecating the loss of property, I rejoice in the belief that we have with little expense and labor inflicted another most serious blow upon the enemy, and too much credit cannot be awarded to the officers and men composing this expedition.
I am more and more confirmed in my belief of the entire loyalty of the people of this part of the State. Doubtless as you approach the

interior you will find a greater number of secessionists. The three men mentioned in my former report have returned from the opposite shore, bringing the information that the citizens who were frightened from their homes when they heard that our forces had landed have returned, and that their recent voice is for peace under the old Government. Secret meetings have been held at a place called Middletown, and they have resolved to allow our forces to land without molestation if we will come in a force strong enough to protect them from the vigilance coin-mitteesf Meetings, I believe, have been held in other towns, but owing to the secret manner in which they were conducted, I have not been able to learn what has been done at either of them.
In order to counteract the falsehoods so industriously circulated by the rebels I have issued a communication, a copy of which is herewith inclosed, and marked A. Copies have been sent to all the principal towns in the State in such a manner that I am confident that many of them will reach their destination.
I am daily in receipt of information, the most of which I believe to be correct. The following is a summary of all I have received since my last report:
1st. Since the taking of Hatteras, Fort Macon has been roofed with railroad iron, new guns added, and largely re enforced. The town of Beaufort is now occupied by a large force; I believe that there are about 1,500 men at the fort and about 3,000 in and about the town.
2d. Fifteen vessels have been sunk in the Neuse Fiver, below New Berne. The fort or battery below the town of New Berne has been strengthened and new guns added; at the town there are two regiments of infantry, two or three squadrons of horse, and a section of artillery.
3d. Pamlico Biver has had a row of piles driven across it some 8 or 10 miles below the town of Washington; a small body of troops are stationed at this town.
4th. Foanoke Island lias but one battery, instead of two, mounting seventeen guns, and a garrison of 2,200 men, and 800 more are expected there to-day from Norfolk.
5th. Norfolk has no protection in the rear and a very small force in the town.
Information has been received that some 2,500 of the troops at Foanoke Island and to arrive are within the next fifty hours going to try to effect a landing on this island some 38 miles above here. Their intention is to blow up the light-house on Cape Hatteras, and then to attack Fort Clark, burn villages, carry off the loyal inhabitants, &c. I am only waiting for further intelligence, which will determine my course. Should I be confirmed in the belief that the last above-mentioned information is correct, I shall meet the rebels when they attempt to land with a force of 700 on shore, and the steamer Fanny, with three ship’s launches, on the water, carrying 200 men and five guns.
I do most sincerely trust that you will urge upon the Government the great and important necessity of taking Foanoke Island and occupying it immediately, so as to enable us to control the commerce of both sounds, Albemarle and Pamlico; also the great necessity of six or eight gunboats, not drawing over 7J feet of water. Without them we are almost helpless on the waters of these sounds; with them we could totally annihilate all water communication between the States of Virginia and North Carolina and between the sea-coast and main land, and prevent any landing of troops on the island.
My present force, including officers and men, amounts to 940. I consider Fort Clark at best but little protection against land forces. A

determined storming party of 1,000 men could carry it against any resistance I could make with my present force. I should then retreat to Fort Hatteras, which, with the aid of the ships, could be defended against the assault of a very large force.
Should the Government send gunboats and 10,000 men, I would then recommend that Eoanoke Island should be taken and held and that an advance should be made towards New Berne. Beaufort might be taken by storm, but Fort Macon would have to be taken by regular approaches ; this, of course, would take a larger number of men than could be sent here at present.
If it is decided to hold Fort Clark, a considerable amount of timber should be sent here to support the sides of a ditch, which should be made at once. A large amount of work should be done upon this fort, and I only await the arrival of material and your orders to commence. The store-houses and barracks to be built at Fort Hatteras should be commenced at once. This will also take a large amount of timber, which should be sent immediately. With Boanoke Island in our possession, it will not be necessary to have any considerable force at this point. One vessel inside and another outside, with men enough to man the guns of the forts, will constitute a sufficient force to hold the fort against all comers the rebels can bring.
You can rest assured that no effort on my part will be neglected for our proper protection.
I am, most faithfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Two very intelligent fugitive apprentices have just arrived from Boanoke Island, where they have lived for the last eight years with one Samuel Jarvis 5 they seem to be quite intelligent and honest, and are well known to some of the citizens here.
According to their account there are at this time 1,500 troops on the island: 1,400 Georgians and 100 North Carolinians. The latter were formerly at Oregon Inlet. One thousand more North Carolina troops were to land there yesterday from Norfolk, and more are expected every day, until their whole number will amount to 8,000; then they are to land, hang the people who have taken the oath of allegiance, blow up the light-house, and retake the forts.
General Smith, of Georgia, is in command of the post, and Colonel Wright, of the same State, in command of the largest battery. These officers have frequent intercourse with Mr. Jarvis, who is an ardent secessionist, and communicates his views freely to his family in the presence of his servants. The above is what he has been heard to say within the last three days.
The rebels have six or seven small tug-boats and about twenty barges or flats at the island. This would seem to indicate that they intend to effect a landing somewhere 5 and where can it be if not at the point designated in my report of yesterday ?
To-night I shall start for Chicamacomico for the purpose of selecting a suitable ground for a camp, after which I shall return and send up

all the force I have to spare, with two pieces of artillery. This force will be encamped there permanently, unless otherwise ordered by yourself. I know that there is great objection to separating so small a command as mine, but these people, who have taken the oath of allegiance, must be protected, though at the cost of every life under my command. What may not be said of a government which is too weak or unwilling to protect its own loyal subjects against its own rebels0?
The inclosed outline will give you an idea of how the rebels are situated and the location of their batteries, drawn from information which I am quite sure must be correct.
I hope you will send me at least 1,000 men within the next four or five days, and one or two rifled guns, if. you have them to spare. I should prefer if possible that you send me no Germans.

General : Permit me to call your earnest attention to the condition of this most important position in the possession of the Federal Government. You made the remark when I conversed with you on the subject that the loss of Fort Monroe would be the loss of the Union. I mentioned to you that I had not more than enough of artillerists to man ten guns. I also mentioned the few men detained of the four companies recently ordered to Washington were necessary to aid in instructing volunteers for artillery service.
I also mentioned to you that Newport News was threatened by the Confederates, in order to aid in getting to sea two steamers in James River, and also the Merrimac at Norfolk. This ship is constructed to resist cannon shot. I have this morning seen the flag-officer in the Roads (Goldsborough), who more than confirms all that I have said on the subject, and that it is settled that an attempt will be very soon made to get these vessels to sea. In order to facilitate this movement an attempt will be made to get jiossession of Newport News.. We have guns, but not artillerists sufficient to man them, at Newport News. I hope you will at once send back the four companies of artillery recently sent to Washington. If you do not send us these, or some other com-lianies of artillery to supply their places, I trust you will not hold me

responsible for any disaster that may befall us at Newport News. The danger, I assure you, is imminent. This subject I presented to the President in Cabinet council, when I assured them of the intentions of the rebels, and that it was their design to attack Newport News, and, as it was reported, very soon. The flag-officer is satisfied that such will be the case. He says there is no mistake as to their, intentions. He further expresses his apprehension that they will succeed in capturing Newport News and that the steamers may get to sea. He also says the Merrimac is so constructed that no cannon shot can make an impression upon her.
If it is the intention of the Government to strengthen my position and the Navy, no time is to be lost. Why should this position, more important than Washington, be left, as it is, without means of defense? If from this fact any injury should result from it, it might prove no less fatal to the Union than to the administration. I send this by Major Jones.

You have been informed of the disgraceful surrender of the Fanny at Hatteras Inlet. Apprehensive that Colonel Hawkins had committed a great error in placing his troops at so great a distance from his batteries, I regretted extremely the withdrawal of Brigadier-General Reynolds. I am not without apprehension that we shall hear of further disasters, as the Pawnee has been withdrawn, leaving a very limited naval force, upon which we placed our main reliance for protecting our batteries. I shall send with Brigadier-General Mansfield 500 troops. The force on his arrival at Hatteras will exceed 2,000, and be sufficient to protect and defend the batteries and stores until I can learn what force will be sufficient to maintain the position. It will be unfortunate, indeed, if we lose Hatteras Inlet and Newport News, and from present appearances both are in danger.
• I have received an order from the Secretary of War to send the officers and men of the four companies of artillery recently sent to Washington. These men in part are used for the instructing of volunteers for artillery service. As soon as these men can be used at the guns I will send those men to Washington.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

It is the desire of the Navy Department, in which, the Secretary of War and the General-in-Chief concur, that you put the Eipraps in the hands of the Navy, giving them charge of the guns and batteries there, and they will be responsible for the defense of the work and the channels commanded by it, of course under your general command.
It is probable the Navy Department will soon have such a number of men at the Eipraps as will enable the naval commander to detach, on your request, small parties to aid you in making up expeditions, when they may be deemed advisable.

Sir : The major-general commanding the department directs that you repair to Hatteras Inlet, relieve Brigadier-General Mansfield, and assume command of the troops in that neighborhood and in North Carolina. In directing the military operations in that quarter you cannot be too careful to guard against being surprised by the enemy, and in all cases to treat the people it would appear are favorable to the preservation of the Union with care and kindness, and protect all who will take the oath of allegiance.
It is unnecessary to say that you will be careful, in establishing your encampments, not to separate your regiments too tar from each other, at least not beyond supporting distances. As soon as you can you will not fail to send a special report of the condition of the troops and conduct of those who preceded General Mansfield, and to report how it happened that the Fanny was so disgracefully surrendered to the enemy, and the losses sustained by the Government.
We have not yet received any returns from the regiments nor any reports of their condition. These will receive your attention as soon as practicable, and you will transmit such reports and returns to these headquarters.
In conclusion, you will do all in your power to protect the inlet, and report all that you may deem necessary for that purpose.

mandecl by Colonel Brown, out of supporting distance, endeavors to throw the whole blame on the Federal Government. His language is highly insubordinate, and which I shall not fail to treat in a proper manner.
By Brigadier-General Mansfield’s letter you will perceive we have a very small naval force at the inlet. He requires several light-draught vessels of war for the sound.
In consequence of the loss of clothing, camp equipage, ammunition, &c., large requisitions have been made to supply losses of the Twentieth Indiana Regiment. Clothing we have not on hand to issue. We have a large number of men greatly in want of clothing at Camps Hamilton and Butler. Many men parade with only drawers and shirts. I have again and again urged the Quartermaster-General to send us clothing. He, however, has it not on hand.

[Inclosure Xo. 1.]
Headquarters, Fort Clark, Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, October 8, 1861.
Sir : The reason of not having the post report, it was impossible to get any report of the Twentieth Indiana Regiment. They arrived at this post on September 28, but did not leave the steamer until they embarked on the boats for Chicamacomico. The colonel commanding the post sent a report from Colonel Brown. Unfortunately the tug Fanny was captured and the messenger made a prisoner. Colonel Brown, with his command, retreated to this place (Fort Clark), arriving here on October 5, and I have not yet had a morning report of the regiment.* The adjutant informed me that they had lost their roll-books, and that they did not even know the names of the men composing their companies, and that he should have to make out new ones. Supposing you did not wish an incomjfiete return of the troops at this post, I have delayed until a perfect return could be made. At the same time there has not been any means of sending them, even had they been ready. According to the instructions on the regimental return, the return should not be sent to headquarters until completed (see note 4, on the face of the return).
One reason why I made no report of the capture of the Fanny was this: Captain Rowan said he should not call at Fort Monroe, but proceed immediately to Washington. Another reason was, I could not get at the truth relating to her capture; consequently did not wish to make any report until I could make one the truth of which could be relied upon.
It is evident to me, from the tone of your letter of the 6th instant, that a change in your feelings towards me has taken place. I do not wish to know the reason for the change nor do I ask it. I suppose that I shall be blamed for the recent disaster at this post. If such is the case, I have only to say that I am ready, eager, and willing to go before the country and give all the particulars in relation to my course since I have been in command at this post, and then let the people iudge between me and the criminal neglect of the Government in not heeding my suggestions.

If I have within me any part of my nature which is good, it has all been brought to bear in this cause. I entered it because I wished to punish those people who were trying to destroy our Government. I was willing to sacrifice life and everything else, if necessary, in the performance of my duty, without honor or reward. I was willing to work without pay and to undergo any hardships which the service could impose upon me. But how.different is the feeling now. I feel that I have an ungrateful and unappreciating Government at my back, which cannot or cares not to discern the difference between those of its servants who have its interests truly at heart and those who work for pay only.
Sending a new commanding officer here to step into my shoes, after all the dirty work has been done, to supersede me, indicates that all confidence in my ability has been lost. This touches my pride. Next to doubting my integrity this is the most tender point in my nature, and now I have only to say that if by return mail you should inform me that you will accept my resignation, I will send it at once. One word more and I have done. I do not seek promotion. Brigadier-generals are made of such queer stuff nowadays, that I should not esteem it any very great honor to be made one. I had supposed, when I entered the service, that, if I should live to the end of my term, I might come out a very respectable colonel, but nothing more.

Headquarters, Fort Hatteras, Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, October 8, 18G1. Sir : After leaving you on the afternoon of the 6th instant we proceeded in the steamer Spaulding without accident, and arrived at Fort Hatteras on the 7th at 8.30 a. m. I learned on my arrival that the Twentieth Indiana Regiment had fallen back before the enemy from Ohicamacomico to this inlet. The circumstances were as follows :
The day after the loss of the steamer Fanny Colonel Brown sent to Fort Hatteras his sick and extra baggage. On the 3d instant (Thursday last) the steam-tugs Putnam and Ceres arrived at Chicamacomico with live days’ supply of provisions, which they landed immediately and. returned to Fort Hatteras. On Friday the camp was approached by a fleet of some nine steamers and sail vessels, besides flats, with the intent to land south of the camp and cut off the command from Hatteras. The command of Col. W. L. Brown, being but seven companies—say 500 strong—and the enemy supposed to be at least 2,000 strong, Colonel Brown immediately, by orders received from Col. R. C. Hawkins at that moment, took up his line of march on the east beach for Hatteras lighthouse, when he was met by Colonel Hawkins, with his command, and

finally the whole command fell back to this station, with a loss on the part of Colonel Brown of 3 sergeants, 2 corporals, and 24 men, stragglers. He sent back a party to burn and destroy his camp, which was supposed to be partially done, and fell into the hands of the enemy.
On the afternoon of yesterday I visited Fort Clark—say 1 mile northward of this fort—and continued still farther northward, to Camp Wool —say 4 miles—and thence 3 miles farther northward, to our last picket— say 7 miles from this fort. I inclose orders I have given, NTos. 1 and 2.* The enemy, if they have not retreated to Boanoke Island, must be some 30 or 40 miles off. I shall, at all events, hold the position we now occupy. Our pickets have a full view of the balled or sand beach to the light house. We have within our present limits abundant wood and water; but we should have the command of this sound (Pamlico), which we have not, for want of suitable small steamers, drawing from 3 to 5 feet of water. The only naval force now here is the Stars and Stripes, five guns, drawing 9 feet of water; the General Putnam and Ceres, of two guns each, drawing 6 feet each. I was surprised last evening to find that the Susquehanna and Monticello had left for the North before dark. We have now no vessel outside to watch the march of troops down the beach to attack our front. We can hold the woods on the west side of the peninsula, but about half the breadth of the peninsula, from our pickets to Fort Clark, is sand beach, 1,000 yards wide, and difficult to defend with our small force.
I will thank you to order by the next steamer for this place the articles mentioned in the memorandum herewith, and proper receipts will be returned. I am much pressed for time at this moment.

The weather has been intolerable, and the exposures have been great. There are 90 sick of the Twentieth Eegiment, and 136 sick in all.
If you can spare the lieutenant of the Ninth Eegiment from your office he should be with his regiment. We want a post quartermaster, and I shall have to make a detail from the volunteers.
There is a great deal to be done here to insure a safe position. It was reported that the enemy had landed in force at Chicamacomico, and that his steamers were off that shore. We will soon find that out.

Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort,
October 14, 1861.
Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, Washington, D. C.:
My Dear General: I am this morning just from Hatteras Inlet. I was there just one week, having left here on Sunday. Yesterday morning the steamer Spaulding arrived at Fort Hatteras with Brigadier-General Williams, who relieved me yesterday, and at 4 p. in. I left Fort Hatteras, and got here at 6.30 a. m.
At Fort Hatteras I made a report to General Wool of the retreat of the Twentieth Indiana Eegiment (seven companies) from their advanced position of 40 miles northward. Under the circumstances, Colonel Brown probably did well. No guns were fired by him at the enemy nor was he attacked. We lost some stragglers on the road; not a man killed, that I have heard of, except an old inhabitant shot by the rebels.
I do not understand the report of the Navy in this matter. The rebels had landed only about 500 out of about 2,000 supposed to be on board their fleet of 9 steamers and vessels, besides flats, that approached the landing. I did not learn that a vessel of the rebels was taken or sunk or that a man was killed by the shells from the ship of war. I did hear that they carried off all the small fishing vessels belonging to the inhabitants.
The command at Hatteras Inlet is now all well, and I presume no attack will be attempted on it. The two regiments have about 1,900 men, and are well posted at Fort Clark and Camp Wool, and with the shipping and the artillery of Fort Hatteras could repel an attack of 5,000 with ease.
This position is no base for operations into the interior. All such commands, unless very strong, would be exposed to be cut off from supplies, and it is a circuitous route. There would be no object in disturbing a few little towns and robbing them, thereby making the people inimical. I have recommended improvements at Fort Clark. The two regiments are good and pretty well drilled, and with some target practice will do well. It is not improbable on an emergency that the Ninth New York could be spared from this place, protected as it is by the naval tags. I will remark here that the tugs draw too much water and cannot effectu-

ally navigate the sound. They can all, however, move outside, and with their guns afford great defense by taking in flank any force that might approach from the northward, the only place they can advance on the inlet by land. I consider the inlet extremely well protected, as it is but twelve hours7 steaming from Fort Monroe.
At high water the sea comes up to the exterior slope of the parapet of Fort Hatteras, so as to leave but a circular sand ridge dry towards Fort Clark.
I had the pleasure to escort Mrs. Butler and her daughter from Baltimore, and received your note. Mrs. Butler went to Norfolk the day of our arrival here.
A regiment has just arrived here, by order, from New York, and has gone into camp to await further orders. It is from Bhode Island, and its further destination is not known here. It was taken on board at Fort Hamilton, New York.
I believe I have given you all the information in this quarter that is material. General Wool assigns me to-day to the command of a brigade over the bridge. I shall endeavor to do my duty there till required at some duty I can do better.
I trust this will find you well, and may God spare your life for your country’s good and a blessed future !

There are many political considerations of extreme importance which, in the opinion of the President, render it inexpedient to abandon our position at Hatteras Inlet. In a military point of view it is important to hold it, both to preserve our prestige and to maintain a base for ulterior operations projected in that direction. I have carefully studied the ground from the charts of the Coast Survey, with the assistance of Colonel Woodbury, of the Engineers, and the two gentlemen of the Coast Survey who were employed in the surveys of that region.

situations, I am led to believe that the late storm was one of unusual severity, and that similar effects are not likely to be produced for a long interval of time. There is a possibility that the cut between the two forts may soon be closed by the operation of natural causes, and If it remains open, the point on which Fort Hatteras stands may remain an island instead of being entirely washed away, as General Williams seems to anticipate. If it remains an island, I would suggest that measures be taken to prevent the washing away of its site in ordinary weather by means akin to those used in protecting the dikes of Holland. If the point should be entirely washed away, it will then be necessary to select a new position for our batteries.
The accompanying tracing will serve to explain the views I entertain as to the disposition of the troops and the arrangements that should be made to resist an attack coming from the direction of the light-house.
I would suggest that a line of defenses be thrown across the narrow neck near the head of Duncan’s Creek. By using abatis and stockades freely no great amount of earthwork need be done. A few guns placed in battery there will effectually cover the approaches by land.
From the description I have received of the ground in the vicinity of the church, it would appear that suitable locations can be selected there for huts for the mass of the troops. I suggest the propriety of constructing huts for the troops there, retaining in the batteries only men enough to guard against surprise, and relieve these every day. I have given instructions that the quartermaster at Baltimore forward at once to Fort Monroe, for shipment to Hatteras, lumber sufficient to hut two regiments and for the necessary storehouses.
The landing of supplies can be much facilitated by building a wharf on the inner side of the island, and their transportation by making a corduroy or plank road, or by coating the sand with mud from the marshes.
You will please send Captain Stewart or some other competent officer of engineers to Hatteras for a few days to select the positions for the new defenses, roads, camps, &c., and to commence their execution. I would also be glad to have you send a fresh regiment to replace the Indiana, and within a reasonable time one to relieve the Ninth New York. It would be good policy to change the regiments at this rather disagreeable station every one or two months.
The huts should be constructed to accommodate about half a company each, or at least 20 men. If stoves are necessary for the comfort of the men, they will be ordered on your requisition. Until the Navy is prepared to control the sound, it seems inexpedient to hold the lighthouse. I understand that the lens was destroyed long since and has not been replaced. Assistant Secretary Fox informs me that in thirty-five days at most they will be prepared to throw an effective force of suitable gunboats into the sound. We may then venture to re-establish the light, and I shall then be glad to concert with you offensive measures of some importance in that inland sea.
Will you be good enough, general, to give me somewhat in detail an account of the condition, position, &c., of your own troops and defenses— as well as those of the enemy—together with your views as to offensive operations from the base of Fort Monroe. Have the enemy any defenses at Lynn Haven Bay and Little Inlet 1 I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,

Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fort Monroe, November 11. 1861. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, Commanding the Army:
General : Agreeably to your instructions of tlie 6th, received on the 8th instant, I herewith transmit a statement of what I consider necessary for defensive, and to a certain extent offensive, operations in this section of Virginia, excluding Norfolk and its surrounding country.
1st. The enemy have, as reported by deserters as well as other persons, 25,000 men stationed between Yorktown and James Biver. I think, however, this is a very great exaggeration of their forces, which I do not believe exceed 12,000; certainly not beyond 15,000. They appear to have a large proportion of cavalry and artillery, and their men appear tolerably well clothed, and, as the deserters say, have plenty to eat.
2d. The Federal troops, with the exception of a single company of artillery, are volunteers, and some of the regiments have been but recently raised. The aggregate of all the forces stationed in Fort Monroe, Camp Hamilton, and Newport News, called Camp Butler, amounts to about 9,000. The rank and file are generally young and active, and with capable, intelligent, and enterprising officers would very soon make good soldiers. We are, howTever, improving; but for the want of proper officers, capable of giving instruction, I have been little else than a schoolmaster since I took command of the Department of Virginia. These remarks will apply to all the volunteers. To make them what they appear, highly respectable, I have been compelled to rise early and sit up late. But without light artillery I would nttempt no serious demonstration against the enemy, who appear to rely very much on their cavalry and artillery. The recent inspection by Colonel Cram, aide-de-camp, acting as inspector-general—and he makes a very good one—shows the arms in the hands of the volunteers are generally bad. He says in a recent report that awe require 5,000 stand of the best infantry muskets to replace the comparatively worthless arms with which several of our regiments are now wholly or in part armed, several of which having not more than two companies well armed.77 To which I w ould add that I exchanged with the Indiana regiment a day or two before it left for Hatteras 150 arms, which exhausted most of the serviceable muskets in the arsenal. Those received from the regiment, as Lieutenant Baylor, ordnance officer, informed me, wrere not reparable.
3d. In Fort Monroe I have a company of artillery, and have nearly or quite 200 volunteers under instruction for that service. For the first company I have only Lieutenant Lodor. For the 200 volunteers I have only Captain Mendenhall. Under his instructions they have made considerable progress in the maneuvering of heavy guns. Of all the artillerists instructed and being instructed I could not efficiently man ten heavy guns. I have no light artillery, although we have a few men called light artillery at Camp Butler. Altogether we have over 100 men, but only two officers that properly belong to them, to wit, Major Boberts, recently promoted, and Lieutenant Lodor. Captain Mendenhall, recently promoted, has been ordered to join his company. I have retained him to instruct the volunteers. Second Lieutenant Sanger is at Newport News, but he belongs to the company at Hatteras Inlet. He lias charge of the artillery of that post and a few light artillery in charge of a 6-pounder and 12-pounder howitzer. I have not referred to Lieutenant-Colonel Nauman nor Major Wyse, because neither can be of any service. Lieutenant-Colonel Nauman reported to me highly intox-

icated, and it is said be sympathizes with the rebels. I hope you will order him to some other deparcment. Major Wyse, I apprehend from reports made to me, is no better. He applied for leave of absence, and I gave him leave for a month. I want subaltern officers—lieutenants capable of instructing the rank and tile in the drill and maneuvers of the piece. I applied again and again to Lieutenant-General Scott for officers, but my applications were not noticed. I have applied on several occasions for the appointment of second lieutenants of artillery, but I received no response. I thought it singularly strange that Fort Monroe should be left in its present condition, certainly the most important position on the Atlantic coast, and from which at all seasons of the year expeditions could be fitted out against any of the Southern States. The extent of the work, with its present garrison, is its weakness. Besides, it is filled and surrounded with wooden buildings. I would, of course, demolish these if we should be seriously threatened with a-siege.
4th. In conclusion, I would urge that three light batteries, three squadrons of dragoons—two for Gamp Hamilton and one for Camp Butler— be at once furnished this command; of the light batteries, one for Camp Butler and two for Camp Hamilton. These should be composed each of four 6-pounders and two 12-pounder howitzers. These are required for both defensive and offensive operations, should it become necessary. They are, however, indispensable for reconnaissances and demonstrations towards Bethel, Yorktown, &c. Volunteers will seldom attempt to resist batteries or cavalry without the same corps to sustain them and set them an example. I should indeed be glad to have a few artillery companies to man our heavy guns in Fort Monroe.
Of the enemy and their positions in and around Norfolk I have no certain information. At Sewell’s Point there are two batteries of some twenty guns or more. At Craney Island and at Pig Point are several batteries of heavy guns. At Lynn Haven Bay there is no permanent battery established. I have not been able to arrive at any correct conclusion of the forces of the enemy in and about Norfolk, the number having greatly varied within the last six weeks.
I herewith inclose a report, just received, of some colored men who have just arrived from Nansemond. This will be handed to you by my aide-de-camp, Maj. Le G. B. Cannon, who will make such explanations as may be necessary for you to understand fully this communication, and can inform you fully of all matters connected with this command.
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

with five others, all colored, came from Nansemond Eiver last night in a small boat:
He says that there are two batteries on the Nansemond Eiver, about one and one-half miles apart—the first about four miles from the mouth— both on the left bank. Each mounts four guns, about 24-pounders. The first is shaped thus: V V V V. The first is garrisoned by forty men of the Isle of Wight regiment, the second by eight.

The Petersburg cavalry company is at Chuckatuck. There are thirteen regiments of South Carolina troops at the old brick church near Smithfield, commanded by Colonel Pender. At Suffolk there are 10,000 Georgia troops. They have been coming in for the past three weeks in small detachments. This man says that the farmers are starving their negroes to feed the soldiers.

Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fort Monroe, November 20, 1861. Col. Thomas A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of War:
Sir : Herewith I inclose to you a petition for arms from captains of the Delaware regiment, approved by the colonel and Colonel Cram, acting as inspector-general. The latter is an excellent inspector, and well qualified to judge of the quality of muskets and rifles. On the 11th November I reported to Major-General McClellan that we required
5.000	stand of arms to replace those unfit for field service in the hands of troops under my command.
Allow me to call your attention to expeditions fitting out for the South. Without the slightest notice to myself of such expeditions or any orders to supply them, they call on me for ammunition and other supplies. I earnestly request that you will give me orders on the subject; that is, whether it is the intention that I shall supply expeditions calling at this post. With such orders I will make arrangements accordingly.
The Constitution has just arrived, with 1,900 men. In their hurry to sail large supplies were left on the wharf, to be brought by some other vessel or vessels.
Brigadier-General Phelps has called on me for sugar, hay, coal, ammunition, and wagons. The ship has fifteen days’ coal on board and ammunition for small-arms. She has no cannon except one, for which the caj)tain said he had ammunition. The gun belonged to the ship, and not the United States. I have given for the use of the soldiers seven barrels of sugar and four tons of hay to feed their cattle, but nothing else. The ship Constitution is a very large one, and I have no doubt could have carried all that might have been required for the use of the troops. It was said by Major-General Butler that she could carry
3.000	troops, with supplies.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Gatlin, of July 17, 1861, with regard to the necessity of erecting additional batteries at points designated for the coast defense of North Carolina, and has further stated the proposition on your part to take charge of these operations if approved of by this Government, provided this Government would advance to you the sum of $50,000 in Confederate bonds.
These documents have been referred by the President to this Department for reply. This Department acknowledges the necessity for these works of defense, and approves of the plan proposed by Brigadier-General Gatlin. The proposal of your excellency to take charge of the construction of these works is also accepted, and the sum of $50,000 in Confederate bonds will be placed at your disposal for the purpose.

Major : By direction of Brigadier-General Magruder, commanding the Department of Yorktown, I have the honor to call your attention to the barbette gun-carriages in the works at Yorktown. These carriages are carelessly constructed, of very inferior pine timber, and are already much damaged from slight exposure to the weather and from their use in the exercise of the men at the guns. These carriages are so low that the guns cannot be used at ranges attained with the slightest depression without damage to the parapet. The general commanding the department, considering that the safety of the post depends very materially on this battery, earnestly requests that other properly constructed carriages be furnished him immediately.

My Dear Sir : This will be handed you by the late minister to one of the South American States, the Hon. Mr. Wheeler, of North Carolina, who has spent a night with us.
In one hour the enemy can land 20,000 men if he pleases at this point, mouth of Warwick River, 12 miles from Newport News, and if I can have the Quartermaster-General to send me thirty canal-boats, loaded with sand or stone, 1 can defend this position and a line from it across the Peninsula, and thus keep the Federal troops below all the time. There are hundreds of canal-boats unemployed which could be got. A steamer is necessary to bring the boats down, and a Navy officer detailed to bring them down and sink them. I have explained the matter to Mr. Wheeler, in hopes that his personal representations may have some effect. Please introduce him to the Secretary of War, and ask the Secretary to give the order to have this done without delay. There is a work going up on Mulberry Island, just above this river, and this work can be taken in rear by the enemy, landing on this river (Warwick River). If these boats are sunk at the mouth of this river, where the channel is 400 feet wide, it will secure the work on Mulberry Island.

There are troops stationed at Matthews Court-House, I am told, but they have not reported to me, and I believe they are very inactive. Some murmurs, I learn, have been made as to their inactivity, and the inhabitants who have written or spoken to me on the subject seem to look to me for protection.

"Whenever your men are at drill, or on duty connected with placing guns in position, or during an action, Captain Henderson, or the Navy officer assigned to the naval battery, will have command. Captain Henderson, or other naval commander, will designate the hours and length of drill, and will have exclusive charge of magazines and ammunition for the guns. You will also furnish him with such details as he may require to mount or dismount guns, to repair gun carriages, and clean and take care of the guns. You will have command of your company when not on drill, and will have exclusive control of the internal regulations of your camp and company. You and your officers will attend all drills, and he assigned such duties,' compatible with your rank, as Captain Henderson may order. You will make no regulations for your camp which will impede Captain Henderson in the proper discharge of his duties.
Inclosed is a copy of General Lee7s order in reference to the subject-matter of your communication, and by which, in addition to the above, you will be guided :
As there are no sailors in the service, it is impossible to serve river batteries by them, and artillery companies must perform this duty. Naval officers, from their experience and familiarity with the peculiar duties connected with naval batteries, tlieir management, construction, &c., are eminently fitted for the command of such batteries, and are most appropriately placed in command of them. In a war such as this, unanimity and hearty co-operation should be the rule. Petty jealousies about slight shades of relative command and bickering about trivial matters are entirely out of place and highly improper, and, when carried so far as to interfere with the effectiveness of a command, become both criminal and contemptible. Within the ordinary limits of a letter, it is impossible to provide for every contingency that may arise in a command which is not centered in a single individual. It is therefore hoped that mutual concessions will be made, and that the good of the service will be the only aim of all.

I desire to move the greater part of the troops from Williamsburg and Yorktown farther to the front and to within 10 miles of the enemy, and to maintain my position there; but I have not the necessary means to transport the baggage, rations, and forage of the troops all at the same time; indeed, not more than one-third of these means. I must, therefore, establish depots of provisions ahead before I move, say 10 days7 supply of rations at Warwick Court-House and at Harrod7s Mill, each place about & miles from here and 20 miles from Williamsburg. I wish to do this without loss of time. I hope to be able to get 6,000 men in the field. This would be

60.000	every 5 days, 10,000 of which should be sent to Williamsburg and 50,000 to this place, I could keep my position in front. Please let me know as soon as you receive this if it can be done.

My Dear Sir : In pursuance of the very satisfactory interview which we held with you this morning, we proceed to submit to you, very briefly, the objects of that interview in writing, as you desired:
Some six weeks ago General Magruder, commanding in the Peninsula, made a requisition on the slaveholders of the counties of Charles City and New Kent for one-half of their farm operatives, to throw up intrenchments at Williamsburg. The requisition was promptly complied with. The much longer detention of the slaves, which has delayed the thrashing of the wheat crop, has engendered some little feeling of discontent among some of our people, who begin to question the legal authority of the proceeding; nor has this disquietude been allayed by the fact that many of the slaves* have returned to their masters, which has been followed by a hope to recover the fugitives [sic J. To allay all discontent, we ask to be informed, not for ourselves so much as for others, of your opinion of the legality of this proceeding on the part of the general, your opinion being entirely sufficient to quiet all further uneasiness.
We also submit whether it would not be altogether proper that the officer having charge of the laborers should give a certificate for the negroes of each proprietor, so as to protect the master against possible contingencies of loss.
We are, dear sir, truly and respectfully, vours,

Raleigh, N. 0., September 2, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : The loss of Fort Hatteras exposes so many points of attack and invasion, some of them of great importance from their connection with the railroad and public works, that 1 must ask for the immediate assistance of four regiments—two to be sent to New Berne and two to Wilmington. General Gatlin called on me for more troops (as many as I could spare), but did not specify what number of men or at what post they should go. Acting on my own judgment, I ask for the assistance of two regiments to go to each place; one to each place immediately, the others to follow afterwards. If convenient, the North Carolina regiments in Virginia might be preferable on many accounts, particularly the First Regiment, whose term of service expires in November (six months). I would suggest that General Gatlin’s command is too extensive to be overlooked by one man, being nearly 300 miles of sea-coast, besides many inland points of great distance, and far separated from each other. This I hope you will regard as a mere suggestion.
I telegraphed to you this morning that I shall write you for these four regiments, giving you as much notice as I could, particularly as I was not aware that your arrangements with your Quartermaster’s and Commissary Departments were completed.
Very respectfully,

There are seven 42-pounder carronades, four long 32-pounder guns, and two long 42-pounder guns, furnished by the Navy Department; four 24-pounder howitzers on held carriages furnished by the State armory at Richmond, and four long 24-pounder guns expected from the same quarter. Ten men to a gun would require 210 men, but to provide for casualties and sickness it would be well to increase the number to at least 15 men to a gun, or 320 for the whole number. There are also two brass 12-pounder held pieces on the wrorks

not assigned to any company. Should these be retained for the defenses of this post, it increases the deficiency of men for the artillery. We have now six 8-inch columbiads in the naval battery, to which the companies of Captains Peyton and Bouton have been assigned, and two 9-inch Dahlgren guns and three 32-pounder Navy guns on the land side, to which the company of Captain De Gournay has been assigned. These companies are not more than sufficient for the guns committed to them, and Ave have no other artillery companies at the post except the howitzer battalion, which is frequently required in the field, and have their own batteries of field guns. I respectfully suggest, therefore, that four companies of artillery be ordered here to serve heavy guns. I presume that the redoubts recently determined on will be defended by field artillery, except that one situated in apple orchard, and [ have not included any of them except the last mentioned in my estimate. I consider those redoubts as very important for the defense of the place. Without them the enemy can approach our present lines by means of ravines under cover until they are within 500 yards, and they may also plant batteries on a commanding point 800 yards from our inner line. Although our defenses will be somewhat extended by the redoubts, they will be considerably within the lines occupied by Cornwallis.
I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
GEO. W. RANDOLPH,
Major of Artillery.
Richmond, September 3,1861. Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Anderson, Richmond, Va.:
General : The President having conferred upon you the commission of brigadier-general, Provisional Army Confederate States, you will proceed to North Carolina, and report to General Gatlin, at Goldsborough, N. C., for duty connected with the defenses of the coast of that State. Reserve forces must be held at Wilmington and Goldsborough. A battery will be erected below New Berne, and immediate attention given to Roanoke Island for obstructing the passage leading to Albemarle Sound, by erecting a battery at that point. One regiment of Georgia volunteers has been sent from Norfolk to Roanoke Island, and the governor of North Carolina reports two regiments at mouth of Cape Fear River, five companies at Fort Macon, one regiment and two battalions at New Berne, besides a light battery ; two regiments organizing and ready to move (supposed from Raleigh), and any number of volunteers offering, but scarce of arms. The whole force available in North Carolina at different points is equal to seven regiments, one battalion, and one light battery. Besides, a large number of heavy guns for battery purposes have from time to time been sent to the State, and, if required, an additional supply may be forwarded, as also an additional force to the extent of our means, which are limited. The men for battery or artillery purposes need not be supplied with small-arms, as these will be required for the infantry.

Sir : I inclose a copy of a letter from Colonel Crump, commanding at Gloucester Point, and also one from Major Randolph,* stationed at York-town. I desire to impress upon the department the urgent necessity of sending at as early a date as possible the five companies of artillery asked for. It appears there is one at the Pair Grounds at Richmond, and Captain Jordan, of the artillery, at Jamestown Island, assures me one company, commanded by his brother, could be obtained from Lynchburg. It is desirable the whole five companies, from whatever quarter drawn, should be sent down at once, as they are needed for the defense of the two posts named in the communications.
I am, general, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER, Commanding Army of Peninsula.

General : I have the honor to report that there are now five large guns placed on the fortifications in rear of the Point, viz, two short 32-pounders, one long 32-pounder (barbette), and two 42-pounder car-ronades, and have no company to take charge of these guns, the guns having been worked by one of the companies at the water battery, who in case of action would be compelled to stay at their post, and these five guns without even a boat’s crew. I therefore respectfully ask that a company be furnished without delay to take charge of these guns. There is now an artillery company at the Pair Grounds at Richmond, under the command of Captain Jeffress, who is a fine officer, and I should be pleased to have him, if possible.

the place and in the prevention of a landing, so far as it may be in your power, leaving a party of dragoons at Mrs. Curtis’ farm, to inform you of the landing of any troops on Warwick Biver while you are at Mulberry Island Point,- and in the latter case you will make such a distribution of your troops as will enable .you to defend the causeway and approaches from the land side against the troops that may land on the Warwick Biver. Should, however, you be attacked yourself (while at Mrs. Curtis’ farm) by ships seeking to enter the'inouth of Warwick Biver, you will defend the position, if the work is sufficiently thick and strong to protect your men, whom you will keep under cover as far as possible. But if you find the work untenable, you will pack what baggage you can in the wagons with you, unless they be required for the sick and wounded, strike your tents and pack them up in the woods, withdraw your force under cover of the trees, and remain there until the enemy passes up the river. Then you will take position, as before ordered, on Crawford’s farm, and make arrangements to defend the causeway across the marsh and other approaches leading to that place. Should they attempt to land, however, at or near Mrs. Curtis’, you will attack them from the woods, by issuing from the woods, and endeavor to cut them to pieces, if not in force much greater than your own, and regardless of the fire of the ships ; remembering always that if you cannot prevent their passage up the river or drive them off, you will take position, as before indicated, at Crawford’s farm, to defend the approaches from the land side to the work.
Should the enemy engage the battery at Day’s Point, you will not quit your post until he succeeds in passing it, when you will also march (let it be clone in perfect order), taking your artillery with you in any case. In case of an attack there or anywhere, when you are accompanied by artillery, remember to place your horses and caissons in such a way as best to screen them from the enemy’s fire. On the approach of an enemy, send notice to the work on Mulberry Island Point, to Warwick Court-House, to Cockletown, and Yorktown, and by a special message direct to Colonel McLaws, at Williamsburg. In a few days there will be 2,500 troops at Warwick Court-House, and the same number probably at Cockletown. Beport the state of your command, the progress of your work, your ability to defend your position, or otherwise; send anything of interest at least every other day.

The British ship Alliance, at Beaufort, communicated with a British war steamer off the port yesterday, which informed them that the blockading fieet would attack Fort Macon to-morrow. I hope the fort is ready, but they have no gunners who can manage the guns, and the same complaint is made at Fort Caswell. Can it be supplied with officers who understand the use of guns'?
HENEY T. CLAEK.
Executive Department, Raleigh, N. CSeptember 7, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War :
Sir : Allow me to call your attention to the situation of the forts and batteries on the coasts of North Carolina. They are garrisoned with our volunteers in sufficient force, but their officers are all taken from the ordinary occupations of civil life, with no military instruction or education except what they have acquired amidst the labors of camp life, and I hear serious complaint of the inefficiency of all the gun batteries from the want of instructors or suitable drill-masters.
The forts on the sounds have been captured, and I am glad to know that Fort Macon had recently had some attention from the Navy officers who are now out of employ. But Fort Caswell and the batteries at the mouth of Cape Fear Eiver are in urgent need of suitable officers for that purpose. I have received a petition from the people of Cape Fear to send them aid in this particular, and they suggested that probably Captain Whiting or Capt. John A. Brown could be sent to them, and I should be pleased if these gentlemen or any others might be sent them.
Allow me a further suggestion, that, as our coast is now invaded and possessed by the enemy in a vital point and threatened at various others immediately, the command is too extensive for the observation and care of one. The Cape Fear must have several regiments, and is distinctly and widely separated from the defense of Pamlico and Albemarle, and General Gatlin’s undivided attention is now demanded at one of the three divisions. I don’t know what duty or division is assigned to General Anderson, but if it is confined to the coast defense, that is over 300 miles long, with no facilities of travel, and a portion of it divided by the actual possession of the enemy. Under these circumstances I would suggest the assignment of General Hill to the Cape Fear forces. His military experience and success would give decided tone to that command.
Very respectfully,
HENEY T. CLAEK.

Department Headquarters,
Williamsburg, Fa., September 7,1801. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General, (7. S. Army:
Sir : Additional re-enforcements have arrived at Newport News, and our lower picket has been driven in to-day. The enemy’s re-enforcements are now all sent to Newport News, none being kept about. Old Point, as has been the case up to this period. His parties are advancing farther up the country than usual.
I have ordered about 2,000 men to take post at Warwick Court-House, under Colonel McLaws, with one battery of artillery. There will be, after their departure, about 1,500 men left at Williamsburg, and 1,000 of these will be advanced to within 5 miles of Warwick Court-House as soon as the wagons return. Warwick Court-House is a healthy position, and 2 miles in the rear of the line of defense (that is, from Young’s Mill to Harrod’s Mill), the advantage of which, when occupied by the enemy, in command of both flanks, by his vessels of war, I have had the honor to explain in person to his excellency the President. These flanks are on Warwick Eiver and on the Poquosin Eiver. The first emptying into the James Eiver, and the second into York Eiver, 12 miles below Yorktown.
For the sake of health, as well as with a view to defense, I have encamped at and within 2 or 3 miles of Harrod’s Mill, at the head of Poquosin Eiver,* about 3,000 men (infantry and artillery) on the York road, and intermediately all the cavalry except one company, half of which is kept here and the other half at Yorktown, for express duty. One regiment and a battalion of two companies are also at Mulberry Island Point, covering the fortifications on James Eiver, now being erected there, opposite Harden’s Bluff. I have left only two regiments at Yorktown. The Fifth North Carolina Eegiment, which had (when heard from a few days ago) only 230 for duty out of 1,150 (total strength), is in Gloucester County, at a healthy position 6 miles from Gloucester Point, and I fear no great improvement in its sanitary condition can be expected until after frost.
The troops near Harrod’s Mill are under the immediate command of General Hill. I shall take command of the forces in front within a few days, as soon as it is possible to get through the arrangements necessary for their transportation and supplies, and for the organization of the artillery here, a portion of which I am endeavoring to supply with horses or mules, caissons and harness. An excellent gun carriage for a 32-pounder has been manufactured here under my orders by Captain Morrison, of the artillery, the ordnance officer stationed here. I have also detailed a party of workmen from the Warwick volunteers, and put in operation, with the assistance of Captain Carter, of the Virginia Ordnance Department, a large saw-mill, on Warwick Eiver, where there is already a large quantity of seasoned timber of the best quality. I have also erected earthworks for heavy guns at the mouth of Warwick and Poquosin Eivers, but have no guns of that description to place in them. This is necessary, to enable me to hold the line of defense, above mentioned, between Young’s and Harrod’s Mills, interrupted by the enemy’s ships of war.
I have caused four additional canal-boats, loaded with stone, to be sunk in the Swash Channel, near Mulberry Island Point, and hope soon to be enabled to sink twenty-five others across the mouth of Warwick Eiver j but these latter will be of no avail unless the embankments which I have caused to be thrown up on the shores there can be furnished with the heavy guns above mentioned. I have written to Captain

Ingraham, of the Navy, for six heavy 42-pounder guns, with their carriages, implements, and ammunition. I desire that these should be sent to Yorktown, to be transported thence at night by water to the mouth of the Poquosin River, below the blockading steamers, which can easily be done, and thence to Jamestown in a lighter or lighters, towed by* a light-draught steamer, thence to the mouth of Warwick River.
I also requested re-enforcements when in Richmond, as I considered the position at Yorktown as too vital a one to be permitted to depend any longer upon the chances of a battle in the field. If re-enforcements, therefore, can be spared, I would like to have them for Yorktown and ‘Williamsburg in sufficient force to be in some degree independent of the troops in front of enemy below; but I have great confidence in the troops under my command, and believe that they will do their whole duty under any circumstances. As additional security to the work going up on Mulberry Island Point, I have requested Captain Tucker, of our steamer of war Patrick Henry, so to place his ship as to assist in its defense, which he has promised. Should re-enforcements be sent, a portion should come to Williamsburg via James River, and a portion to Yorktown. There is no infantry at Jamestown Island at present, Colonel Hodges’ regiment and two companies of infantry, under Major Patton, formerly there, being now required at Mulberry Island Point as a covering force.
The land defenses at Gloucester Point require about 1,000 men more to man them. There should be a regiment’at Jamestown, to prevent the enemy landing at the lower end of the island and taking the batteries afterwards in the rear. This supposes, of course, that their ships have passed our river batteries below Jamestown Island, which is not by any means impossible. With a regiment there, that island, I think, could not be taken. The landing of the enemy in rear of Gloucester Point can be effected easily and without opposition, an extensive shore and many navigable rivers affording every opportunity; hence the importance of that position being protected on the land side by strong works. These I have had strengthened, but there are not men enough there to defend them properly.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER, Brigadier-General, Commanding Department.

Sir : You will keep a strong picket at Denby Church, in front of Young’s Mill, and one in the woods at the head of the mill-pond, near Miranda Walks 5 encamp your troops in the strongest positions, and establish your guns in the most commanding placesat or near Warwick Court-House, in front or rear, as the ground may offer the greatest advantages. If there be a cavalry guard at Young’s farm you will direct it to report to you at once the appearance of a fleet off the mouth of Warwick Eiver and the landing of an enemy on either side of that river. Should the enemy land on the Mulberry Island side of the river, you will march your whole force down the Mulberry Island road to take him in rear, if he should attempt to attack Colonel Hodges on Mulberry Island Point, permitting him first to engage with Colonel Hodges before attacking him with all your force with the greatest vigor. Should he land on Young’s farm, which is the eastern side of the river, you will remain in your position at or near Warwick Court-House, taking care to call in your pickets at once from Miranda Wall’s and Denby Church, which is the name of the church in front of Young’s Mill, and will have the enemy watched at Young’s farm. You will also place a picket on Warwick Eiver, which at that point is said to be half a mile from Warwick Court-House. About this spot you will consult Captain Curtis and his officers, they being acquainted with the country. Should the enemy advance upon you by Young’s farm, you will fall back to Blow’s Mill, taking your position on the west or Williamsburg side, and there defend it, in all cases sending information of his movements by express to General Hill, who is near the cavalry camp, and to the commanding officer at Williamsburg, as well as the commanding officer at York town. In case it should be absolutely necessary to retreat farther, you will fall back upon the works at Williamsburg.

less, until a naval officer could be sent to relieve him. When in Richmond, ten days ago, I was informed that Lieutenant Fauntleroy, of the C. S. Navy, had been ordered to report to me at Yorktown, to fill Gap-tain Henderson’s place. He has not yet arrived, and I am much in need of his services. About the same time I ordered Major Randolph to report to the Navy Department the utter worthlessness of the carriages in this battery. He informed me that the Navy Department had immediately ordered every barbette carriage for these guns (8-inch columbiads, six in number), and that they would be furnished—probably one a week. I have not heard of the arrival of any as yet. Please do me the favor to let me know when to expect them.

Camp Georgia, Roanolce Island, September 11, 1861. Brig. Gen. B. Huger :
General : The two wagons and four mules sent down by the quartermaster from Portsmouth arrived here last evening. I shall for the present endeavor to get along without the wagons, and I am to-day getting two howitzers, 12 and 24 pounders, which we brought down from the navy-yard, moved down by the mules to. a point 5 miles below here, to protect us from a landing in our rear. I shall use the front wheels and axles of the wagons for limbers for these pieces, and think I shall get a pretty good battery of light artillery fixed up during the day. I have a 24-pounder brass field piece which is so heavy that with the teams sent I cannot handle it. I propose to place it this morning at Weir Point to operate upon the channel there until we get the battery completed. If I could get horses and harness for this piece, it would be much more effective placed on the lower end of the island. If possible these horses and harness should be sent at once. The battery at Pork Point is now ready to give the Hessians a warm reception.
The work on the Weir Point battery is underway, and shall be pushed as rapidly as possible. I need not call your attention to the fact that the force on this island is entirely inadequate to the proper defense of this point. I shall do all that man can do, but feel very much crippled for want of men. The North Carolina companies here are completely disorganized and demoralized. I can hope nothing from them.
Since commencing this letter I have received a communication from Edenton offering to furnish horses for artillery service, and also offering a small company of cavalry for vedettes on the island. I have no doubt I can get horses here cheaper than they could be bought in Norfolk, but I shall take no action in the matter until I hear from you. The citizens of the surrounding country have been very kind and obliging to us, ministering largely to our wants, and are still anxious to do more. I have some 200 negro laborers, and could easily increase the number to double that amount, but think that, with my own men and what we now have, we can get along for the present. We have some sickness among the men—bilious fever—but no cases as yet of a very serious character.

Richmond, September 14,1861. Governor Henry T. Clark, Raleigh, A. C. :
Brigadier-General Gatlin, being the commanding general of the forces in North Carolina, must exercise a sound discretion in distributing the troops for the defense of that coast. The importance of maintaining a sufficient garrison at Fort Macon need not be here urged further than to state that the fort must be defended against attack at all hazards, and that the garrison must not be reduced beyond the possibility of such defense. General Gatlin has been instructed to use his best exertions to call troops for local service for limited periods under a recent act of Congress, a copy of which has been furnished him, and it is hoped he wrill be enabled in this way to supply the necessities of Hyde County. The cavalry regiment from your State under Colonel Ransom had better be retained in the State for purposes of defense until further advised.

You will visit these rivers and the exposed places of these counties in person, and, after communicating with the commanding officers of the volunteers and militia in service in these counties, you will make such disposition of their forces and give such orders as in your judgment the security of the property of the citizens and the defense of the coast may demand, and you will make a report to me of what you have done with the least possible delay. And you will also recommend anything necessary for its defense that you may not have power to execute. You will consult with the commanding officers of the troops in Middlesex also, and make a report of the state of defenses in that county. You will communicate to all these commanding officers the inclosed order.

Brigadier-General Huger:
General: I am directed by the commandant to apprise you that already fifteen of the guns laid aside for the defenses of Norfolk and its vicinity, on the requisition of the engineer, approved by yourself, have been otherwise disposed of by the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, and to suggest the propriety of the speedy removal of the remainder to the custody of your own ordnance officers. The commandant also recommends the garrisoning of the outworks for the defense of this yard between Paradise and Scotch Creeks, previous to and preparatory to laying the platforms and mounting the guns, which would not be safe without a guard. There is as yet but one magazine among them all. Some definite understanding between the engineer and myself as to the kind of carriages to be used there is desirable. Your twelve last 21-pounder shells from Bichmond will be ready to-day, with navy fuses.

forced to the conclusion that but little dependence can be placed upon land batteries for its defense. After a careful reconnaissance I am persuaded that the defense of this sound must be made at the marshes, 7 miles below, with floating batteries and gunboats, there being no soil wherewith to construct redoubts. But, general, if my information be correct, there is another point demanding immediate and serious consideration.
The fortification at Oregon Inlet, being on the south side thereof, was of course untenable, with Forts Hatteras and Clark in the possession of the enemy ; but if, as pilots represent to me, a fleet outside can sail within a mile of the beach, thus covering an advancing force towards Norfolk, it seems to me important that the northern side of the inlet be fortified, with a strong sustaining force at hand, and the troops upon this island be held in constant readiness to be conveyed across Roanoke Sound, to re-enforce the former.
I respectfully suggest, if the information I have received be confirmed by experienced pilots, that you send an officer, in whose judgment you confide, to accompany me to the inlet.
Before this I would have made a reconnaissance of that locality, but that 1 had not a vessel of sufficiently light draught at my command.

Col. Werner T. Jones,
Ticenty-first IlegH Virginia Militia, Gloucester County, Va.:
Sir : Brigadier-General Magruder directs me to inform you that the county of Gloucester is one of those included by special orders of the adjutant-general of the Virginia forces in the department under his orders, and that he considers the militia force called out by you as necessarily forming a part of his command. He instructs me further to direct that you take no steps towards discharging any portion of the militia under your immediate command, and to state also that, in deference to a difference of opinion, no doubt sincerely entertained by you as to your obligations to obey him, he has referred your letter, addressed to Colonel Crump, which will be accompanied by a copy of this communication, to the same headquarters from which he received his instructions. General Magruder directs me to say that he considers the militia called into service by you as efficient auxiliary forces for the accomplishment of the purpose he has in view, and would regret if any difference of opinion between yourself and him should deprive the country of their services. Should you decide to keep the militia in service, in accordance with the wishes of General Magruder, you will please inform the headquarters at Yorktown as to the date on which you entered into active service, and send the names of the field, staff, and line officers of your command. I am directed by General Magruder to add that it is very desirable to have in service as many troops from the country threatened with invasion as possible, not only from their natural desire to defend their own homes, but because of their more thorough acquaintance with the country. The general, therefore, hopes that your command may be increased, instead of diminished, and that, should he be deprived of your services as an officer in commission, you will nevertheless communicate freely with him on the subject of those public interests which have been intrusted to your charge.

Sir: I have just received your note of the 16th. You are authorized to have the two 9-inch guns mounted on the land defenses at Yorktown transferred to the center battery, and to mount two heavy guns (82-pounders) on the land side in their stead.

supported by field artillery, I am of the opinion that this point, thus prepared, can be successfully defended. But until the naval expedition which is now fitting out by the enemy shall have chosen its destination, I think it prudent to have these guns also mounted at York-town, probabiy on the water side, if space can be had; if not, on the land side, and for this purpose you will direct Lieutenant Douglas or Mr. St. John to cause platforms to be laid without delay, and to have these gnus put in position at once. When the expedition shall have sailed from these waters they can be removed to Ship Point, for which latter purpose you will direct, in my name, Lieutenant Douglas to cause platforms to be made forthwith, so that when we move them they may be placed in position without loss of time.

Department Headquarters,
Williamsburg, Fa., September 19,1861. Captain Lynch, Chief of Bureau of Ordnance:
Sir: Several weeks ago Captain Henderson was detached from the Yorktown naval battery, but no officer ordered in his place. I applied to the Navy Department for an officer, and was informed that Commander Fauntleroy had been ordered to repair to Yorktown in his place. He has not arrived. I have since written once ox twice on the subject, but have received no answer. As Yorktown is perhaps the most important point on the coast at which there is a naval battery, I beg that this may be attended to as soon as possible.
The heaviest ships can be brought against naval batteries at the mouth of York River, and in great numbers. It is obvious, therefore, that the heaviest guns should be placed there. This subject has been again brought to my notice by Col. G. W. Randolph, Chief of Ordnance, an officer in whose judgment I place great confidence. He says in a letter just received:
If the expedition fitting out at Washington should come here, and bring with it a large number of 10 and 11 inch Dahlgren guns, the odds against us would be very-great. Should our batteries be silenced, the lleet may pass up and land troops at defenseless points, and either take the James River batteries and the fortified lines of the Peninsula in reverse, or march on Richmond, passing by them. Guns of equal caliber are necessary to put us on an equal footing with the enemy.
I concur fully in this opinion, and would respectfully recommend that six of the long 32-pounder rifled guns, said to be now in Richmond, be placed in battery at this point, or that six of the 10 and 11 inch Dahlgren guns be sent, if possible. I would also report that I fired two shots from the 8-inch columbiad at Spratley’s farm, opposite Hog Island, on James River, with 15-second fuses and charges of eight pounds, giving the guns the highest elevation which its casemate carriage would admit. The river is about If miles wide, and the shells fell short of the other side and exploded in the water, showing that the charges were too small. The carriage, however, was a good deal injured even by these small charges; and if the charges were increased to ten pounds, it would be shattered after a few rounds. This carriage is like that on which similar guns are mounted in the naval battery at Yorktown— almost entirely worthless. The columbiads at Jamestown are mounted on equally unreliable carriages. I indulge a hope, however, from the

They are very incomplete, and my troops have worked until they are too sick to work any longer. I have ordered detachments of dragoons to bring them. They have done and will do it. If these gentlemen are sustained in their refusal, no negroes can be had when wanted. The laws of Virginia do not specify negroes, but it is a necessity of war. If sustained, I will carry out my plans. I have already the sanction in writing of the Secretary of War to this course, but will use the free negroes as far as possible. I have never called for more than one-half of the male working hands. I inclose one of my proclamations on this subject.

Brig. Gen. B. Huger,
Commanding Forces in Norfolk, Va. :
General: I have finished the earthwork for a six-gun battery on the maiil-land, nearly opposite Weir Point, at a place called Roberts’ Fishery. The men returned from the work yesterday,1 having been engaged there thirty-six hours. The lumber and other material necessary to complete it has been ordered from Plymouth, and will be here to-day or to-morrow. The Weir Point battery is nearly finished, and I will finish to-day a field work, about 6 miles below the ^jVeir Point battery, at the causeway, across the marsh, on the center of the island. To complete the defenses of this island a small battery ought to be erected on Midgett’s Hammock (or Island), to command the channel of Roanoke Sound. Boats drawing 4£ feet of water can avoid our batteries by coming up on the east side of the island through Roanoke Sound. The point I have indicated for a battery is about midway the eastern shore of the island, and the guns can be placed within 800 yards of the farthest side of the channel. Vessels drawing over 18 inches of water must come within 700 or 800 yards of the battery. I do not know whether the enemy have as light-draught vessels as that, but if they have they can got through Roanoke Sound.
Colonel Shaw’s regiment arrived here about midday yesterday, and I had indulged the hope that I should be relieved by him. I beg, if I am to remain here, that I be permitted to have the men’s clothing, shoes, tents, and cooking utensils brought down from our old camp. The work which they have been engaged on here has worn-out their clothing and shoes; many of them are barefoot, and when I send to the camp at Portsmouth for the clothing and shoes left there, the officer in command refuses to let the articles come, because we are to return soon. I am very anxious to return to my old command, and think now that the defenses here are so nearly completed that I might be withdrawn. At any rate, I beg, if I am to remain here permanently, that I be informed of it as soon as possible.
Major Lee, who will hand you this letter, can give you full information as to the state of the defenses here. He goes up to attend to the securement of our clothing, tents, &c., left in our old camp.

The following indorsement was forwarded to the Secretary of War on the letter from George Minor, Chief of the Bureau. I have acquitted myself of my duty only when all the facts in this case are made known to the Secretary of War and President. They are these:
First, the carriages for the naval batteries at Yorktown, under Captain Henderson, are so utterly worthless (being made of pine), that the guns will dismount themselves after a few fires; second, their manner of construction prevents their being elevated sufficiently to explode a fifteen-second fuse, and therefore their greatest range cannot be attained; third, carriages of a good pattern (barbette of the army) were promised one month agp by the Navy Department, but have not come; and, fourth, the water at the mouth of York River is so deep and ample, that the largest ships, &c., in any number can attack our batteries, and with our present carriages we cannot reach them.
I respectfully request, therefore, that the President, through the Secretary of War, be made acquainted with the exact state of this battery. This request is made with no other object than that he may have an opportunity of forming his own judgment as to the relative importance of the places to which these carriages may be assigned.

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Fa.:
General: I am persuaded from all the indications that the enemy design very shortly to land on this coast in force with a view of invasion, and considering the fact that by taking this harbor they will command the Cape Fear River, which penetrates the heart of this State, as well as the railways terminating here, thereby cutting off communication between important points of the country, I know of no point the seizure of which would give them so great advantage. I therefore think it imperative to organize a force here on a much larger scale than seems to have been proposed.
You are aware that the defenses here are divided by the river into two main classes, each of which must be nearly self-sustaining. These are again subdivided by the various inlets, islands, and narrow strips of sand bank.
I recommend, as the minimum force with which we may hope to cope successfully with the enemy, 2,000 infantry, two light batteries, and two

companies of cavalry, to be posted eacb side of the river, say at Smith-ville on one side and at Confederate (Federal) Point on the other, and a reserve of 2,000 men at Wilmington (these forces in addition to the garrison of Fort Caswell, 300); Teek’s Island, 100, and of Fort Fisher, on Confederate Point, 300. To make up this force it will be necessary to send here immediately four full regiments of infantry, three companies of cavalry, aud horses and all the equipments for three,light batteries, including the caissons and carriages, for which I have already made requisition on the Ordnance Department, viz, caissons for twelve 6-jiounders and two 12-pounders and four G-pounder gun-carriages. The harness for the light batteries I will endeavor to have made here. In my opinion the safety of this position is so surely menaced that the immediate supply of the forces and munitions named above may alone prevent the loss of all. And in addition to the force above mentioned, which may be overpowered by numbers, I recommend most earnestly that three regiments be posted at Goldsborough as a reserve, to be moved here or to Beaufort as circumstances may require.
Having no doubt of the willingness of the authorities and people of this State to do all in their power to repel the invasion, and as the danger is so imminent, I take the liberty of inclosing a copy of this communication to his excellency the governor of the State, with a request that he will send me without delay the required force in regiments or companies, provided you have not enough at this time subject to your control for this service.

Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Acting Secretary of War:
The occupation of Hatteras by the enemy gives them the command of the population on the sea beach, and affords them a fine position from which they can make inroads into our adjoining counties, and rumors have been quite current that our citizens on the banks had taken the oath of allegiance, being confined on the island, out of reach of intercourse or assistance, and that their influence and example were spreading on the main*land.
I have just had information from there which assures me that none beyond the island had been infected ; but seven or eight islanders had come over into Hyde County, bringing proclamations with them, and offering inducements to the citizens to take the oath of allegiance* These persons were immediately arrested, and are now held as prisoners.

Hon. J. P. Benjamin,
Attorney-General and Acting Secretary of War:
Sir : Since the fall of Hatteras, with a few exceptions, the inhabitants of the island commonly called the Banks, under the fear of the enemy’s guns, have taken the oath of allegiance to-Lincoln’s Government, but the people of the main-land, separated from these Banks by Pamlico Sound, remain firm in their devotion and loyalty to the Confederate cause. The enemy has attempted communication with the people in Hyde County, and, through the post-office in that locality, to disseminate documents to influence the public mind in North Carolina. Major Hall, of the Seventh Regiment North Carolina State troops, now in the Confederate service, and in command of the forces in Hyde County, has recently arrested eight men from the Banks, most of whom had been at the headquarters of the enemy and taken the oath. They had in their possession manuscript proclamations (one of which is herewith transmitted) issued by the officer in command to the authorities of towns and villages, as well as certain private citizens in the State. It is very desirable that the prisoners thus taken should be removed from that section of the State. I suppose General Gatlin has reported to the War Department in full on this subject, but I wish especially your opinion as to the legal course to be taken against these prisoners. I herewith inclose a copy of our law of treason against the State, as defined by the recent Convention of our State. It may not reach the offense of all, if any, of the prisoners who have taken the oath to support the Constitution of the United States or others who simply had the proclamations referred to in their possession, besides a letter addressed by one who had taken the oath to a citizen of the State advising submission to the Federal Government.
As to the military defenses of this (eastern) part of the State, I am doing all in my power, in conjunction with Generals Gatlin and Anderson. I take it for granted that they keep you fully advised on the subject, but I cannot refrain from referring you again to the urgent necessity which exists for more arms and munitions of war for the troops destined for the defense of the coast. The President has informed me that no troops for this defense can be withdrawn from Virginia, but 1 earnestly trust that if soldiers cannot be spared, I may at least hope that the requisitions for arms and powder and other munitions may be speedily and favorably attended to. I desire to impress upon the Confederate Government the great and pressing importance of defee-ding the coast of North Carolina against actual and threatened invasion.

their transfer, and not, as heretofore, from their acceptance by the State. This change of the rule will not only be inconsistent, but will work much wrong to our State, and also to the volunteers. All our volunteers in Virginia have been paid from their acceptance by the State. Why should a distinction be made against those serving the Confederacy in North Carolina? I think if you will look into it you will not allow another act of injustice to be done to North Carolina.
We turned over commissary stores to your commissary officer, and I am informed that your officers now make requisition for money on our officers, and have been paid. Besides the arms sent to Virginia in the hands of our volunteers, we have sent to Virginia 13,500 stands of arms, and now we are out of arms, and our soil is invaded, and you refuse our request to send us back some of our own armed regiments to defend us, and we are left to chances of buying a few odd arms which may be gathered up. We have disarmed ourselves to arm you, and now the additional grievance is added that our volunteers in Virginia are paid from the first step in the service, while volunteers who remained in this State are not to be thus paid.
The recent invasion compels us again to buy a navy for our protection, not receiving it from the Confederate States. We are denied powder, on the ground that we have received more than any other State, without adverting to the fact that the powder has been made into cartridges and sent back to Virginia with every regiment, and now we are driven to the expense of a powder-mill.
These facts are mentioned not as eomx>laints, but as some inducement to continue the order of payment as it has been done heretofore.

Instructions have already been sent to the district attorney at Goldsborough to indict for treason the men who brought over the proclamation from the Banks, and there seems to be no ground to doubt their conviction.
Immediate attention will be given to replacing Lieutenant-Colonel Bridgers, whose resignation you announce in your letter of 25th, if, indeed, this has not already been done by the general in command.
I now proceed to make answer to your excellency’s letter of 27th instant, in connection with that portion of the letter of 24th which refers to the military defenses of North Carolina. The order in relation to the payment of the North Carolina troops, to which the letter of the 27th is principally addressed, was given by the Adjutant-General under a misapprehension, and had been revoked some days previously to the receipt of your letter. I cannot, however, refrain from some observation on certain other statements in the letter of the 27th instant, lest the silence of this Department be misconstrued into the admission of the truth of the ieproaclies it has pleased you to lavish on the executive department

of this Government, and in relation to which your excellency has been most strangely misinformed.
You state that you are compelled again to buy a navy for protection, not receiving it from the Confederate States. If, as appears to be implied, your excellency means to assert the navy received from your State has been diverted to other purposes, and your State thus deprived of naval defense, you will doubtless be pleased to learn how grossly you have been deceived. Not only are the vessels received from your State retained for her defense, but large and costly additions are now being made to the full extent of the resources of your State in shipbuilding. New boats are contracted for, and all boats already existing that can be converted into war steamers have been ordered to be purchased.
You further state that you are denied powder, on the ground u that you have received more than any other State, without adverting to the fact that the powder has been made into cartridges and sent back to Virginia with every regiment.77
Feeling much disturbed that any State should have such good ground of complaint, I was preparing for the delinquent officers the just rebuke which such conduct would merit, when I learned from them that since the fall of Fort Hatteras there had been sent to your State 2,200 rounds of field ammunition, which remained some time at Goldsborough, as being in excess of your wants; that Captain Lawrence had been furnished with all the powder he required on application to the Ordnance Bureau; that there is now here at your disposal for public defense all the powder and fixed ammunition that can be necessary; and I have been unable to trace on the books of the Department; any such ground of refusal as is suggested by your letter.
It is true that we have not been able to furnish your State all the cannon powder you desire, and in this respect you share the fate of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana, all of which make the same complaint. But rest satisfied with the assurance that the Government is straining every nerve to increase its supply of that article; that it is establishing factories at numerous points, and supplying the material for the manufacture to private factories; that it is distributing its supply as fairly as it can between the points threatened with immediate attack, and will daily add to that supply as its means increase. Each of those States has established powder mills, as North Carolina has done, and I feel persuaded your excellency, on being apprised of these facts, will not continue to believe that your noble and patriotic State could possibly have been treated with designed injustice by the Confederate Government. The labors of this Department deprive its chief of the repose even of the Sundays, as your excellency will perceive by the date of this letter; and it is, therefore, impossible for me to learn to what fact your excellency alludes when you state that the Confederate commissaries are making requisitions for money on the State officers. I cannot conceive how such a thing can be possible, still less that your officers should pay such requisitions, and still less again that the remedy of the evil complained of should not have been found in your orders to your own officers to refuse honoring requisitions utterly illegal and unauthorized. I will, however, make the proper inquiries of the Commissary-General to-morrow, and trust to be able to give you a satisfactory reply.
In conclusion, may I not pray your excellency to rest assured, in spite of any apparent evidence to the contrary, that it is not only improbable, but imjiossible, that any officer in high position in this Government can

have the remotest intention to do injustice to any one of the Confederate States ? Believe me, your own solicitude for your gallant and patriotic State cannot exceed that felt, not only by the President, but by every member of the Cabinet. Pray consider that the war has recently assumed such formidable dimensions as to make it impossible that human beings can satisfy all the exigencies of all the people at every point that may be exposed or threatened with attack.
In Missouri, in Kentucky, in Western Virginia, oh the Potomac, in the Peninsula below the city, on the whole Southern seaboard, in Western Texas, everywhere, ceaseless efforts and vigilance are required. I feel sure that, in view of this extended field of labor, you will rather be disposed to aid in patriotic effort to defend your own coast by hearty co-operation than to complain of neglect or injustice which may possibly occur from other causes, but never from the absence of an earnest desire to do everything in our power in defense of your State.

Richmond, October 1,1801.
Brig. Gen. D. H. Hill,
(Care General Gatlin,) Goldsborougli, V. (7.:
Sir: Your letter of 29th ultimo* has been received and submitted to the Secretary of War, who instructs me to inform you, in answer, that the suggestion in respect to the transfer of the First North Carolina Regiment from Virginia to your command in the district of country assigned to you is under consideration, but cannot be determined until the President’s return to Richmond.
In answer to your several interrogatories, I am further instructed to state that you are subject to the orders of Brigadier-General Gatlin, commanding in North Carolina, and your brigade reports will necessarily be made to him. Being in command of a section of country confided to your care, you must exercise your judgment in making such arrangements for its defense, &c., as the means at your disposal will admit, without awaiting the sanction of the commanding general of the department. These arrangements will necessarily include all objects of defense and attack, such as the erection of batteries, the sending forth expeditions, and the engagement of the enemy. You are in no sense subject to the orders of the governor of North Carolina, as you are not acting under his authority, but under the authority of the Confederate States.
In respect to marauding parties caught in the act of burning and plundering, you must act according to the exigencies of the case, and with due regard to the rules of civilized warfare.
I am, respectfully, &c.,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.

General B. Huger,
Commanding Forces at Norfolk, Ya.:
General: I feel very anxious to increase the armament of Fort Macon by adding to it four rifled cannon. At this time they have but five long-range guns in the fort, viz, one 10-inch and two 8-inch coluin-biads and two rifled cannon. This number cannot be very effectual against such large batteries as the fleet may be able to bring against it. I am aware that you have nothing to do with this matter, but I have tried every means (official) to get the guns, as also the x>rojectiles for the guns sent me from Norfolk, but have failed, and now, if you will not come to my assistance, in using your influence with Commodore Buchanan, I must give up the matter. The rifled 32-pounder has but seven projectiles. Ninety-three additional are desired$ or, in case no other gun or guns can be furnished, then a much larger supply would be required. Please do me the favor to see the commodore and try to induce him to supply my wants. If he agrees to furnish the whole or part, I will, upon being informed, send a messenger to see them safely to this point.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. C. GATLIN,

Dear General : Having been placed in charge of this part of the coast defenses, I would add my strong solicitations to those of General Gatlin. There is much apathy among the people. They do not want to have their towns destroyed, neither are they disposed to do much for their protection. We are greatly in need of cannon powder. If I could get a supply from Norfolk (as none can be had in Richmond), I would be able to fit up enough of small craft for the effectual defense of the river. Our batteries, too, are badly supplied with that essential article. Anything that you could do for me would be most gratefully appreciated. I will send a machinist in two days to Richmond, to get models of rifle balls of different calibers to be sent here. I know that you will assist him in every way. A letter addressed to me at New Berne would reach me.
Yours, truly,
D. H. HILL.
New Berne, N. C., October 2,1861.
S. Cooper, Adyutant-General G. S. Army:
Sir : I find things here in much confusion, but I trust to be able to make an efficient defense if the enemy allow a delay of ten days. We need cannon powder badly, fuses, and friction tubes. We have no fuses at all, and the shells have to be loaded with sand. We also need a regiment of cavalry as pickets and scouts. As the enemy can land at so many points on this flat coast, it is impossible for infantry to give notice of his approach or reach with rapidity the point of landing. A lew more regiments of infantry are also needed very much. If authority is granted to me to raise them and recommend to the President their field officers, they can be raised without difficulty. I understand that the vesting of the appointing power in the State executive has been an obstacle in the way of raising troops, as many of these appointments have been of a political character. Again, the system of particular individuals setting out to raise companies is also objectionable. The soldiers feel bound to vote for the men who raise the companies, though it may be that these men are least qualified to command. I am told that the troops to be raised would prefer tor me to designate beforehand not only their field but also their company officers. Would this be legal I
There are quite a number of sailors of the merchant service here who are anxious to get guns on their small craft to operate in the sound. Could I muster these men into service ?
Are the naval officers commanding the Beaufort and other Confederate vessels in these waters subject to my orders This is a point of great importance, which the President ought to decide. The co-operation of the Navy is essential to the defense of the sound.
With great respect,

Brigadier-General, G. 8. Army.
P. IS.—I have omitted the most important matter. We need an experienced artillerist to command Fort Macon. It is at present in charge of Major Sloan, a merchant. I would be glad to get the services of three artillerists from the Confederate Army. If these cannot be procured, I would respectfully suggest that Lieutenant Pierson, of De Gournay’s

Intrenched Gamp, October 2,1861. Maj. Gen. B. Huger, Commanding Department of Norfollc, Va.: General : Yesterday I made a more minute reconnaissance of the country in the immediate vicinity of SewelPs Point, and determined upon advantageous locations for all the several forces at present designed for the support of that position, and at once gave directions for the immediate concentration of the Second North Carolina and Forty-first Virginia Regiments upon the ground respectively prescribed for these two commands. The remaining five companies of the North Carolina regiment at Ward’s farm were moved forward to-day and the Forty-first will be accordingly transferred to-morrow. I would now respectfully request that, in view of your previous conclusions with reference to the command of this position, the batteries, fort, and forces thereof be transferred by your order to the immediate jurisdiction of the brigade, in order that I may, by proper directions, place the same under the command of Colonel Chambliss. I would also respectfully urge that one, and if possible two, of the artillery batteries may be at once located with reference to the defense of the position, and in like manner be made subject to the authority of the brigade. I shall visit SewelPs Point to-morrow, in company with the governor of Virginia, and will see you on Tuesday or Wednesday.
I am, general, your most obedient servant,
WILLIAM MAHONE,

Department Headquarters,
Yorktown, Va., October 2, 1861. Colonel Hunt, Commanding Post at Williamsburg, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication in relation to the affairs of your post. I am aware of its wants in defensive means and its incompleteness of preparation, and I left orders with the engineers and other officers of the general staff; but I thank you for your suggestions, which I approve.
You will cause the three 42-pounder carronades to be mounted as soon as the engineers can provide platforms. These, and such other guns as may be left behind by the artillery officers ordered to the front, you will station for the present in the redoubts (from Tutter’s Neck to Fort Magruder, inclusive), in such manner as you think proper, after consultation with the senior engineer, Lieutenant Boswell. You will cause the ammunition and the necessary means for serving these guns in action to be ready for use, remembering that you cannot be attacked until the enemy’s fleet shall have passed three strong batteries, 15 or 20 miles below you.
As soon, however, as you hear of an attack below on the forts, you will march the Zouaves without delay to Spratley’s farm, to assist the Louisianians in defending that place. At the same time you will man

[Chap. XIII.
the forts with the four companies of your regiment now with you, who will act both as artillerists and infantry, and Colonel Marigny will have orders from me to fall back promptly to your assistance on the lines in front of Williamsburg, the few troops in that town being marched out for that purpose also. At the same time orders will be given by me for four regiments, with the other six companies of your regiment and Montague’s battalion, with four batteries of field artillery, to fall back rapidly on Williamsburg, three of the regiments to proceed directly to Spratley’s farm by means of the lighters, which I have had moored near the mouth of College Creek. Of the field batteries, three will be sent rapidly round by the road to Spratley’s, whence two of them could be withdrawn for front defense, should the enemy land. As soon as you are perfectly certain that an attack in force is made on the forts below, you will immediately telegraph to Richmond for heavy re-enforcements, one regiment of which will stop at Jamestown Island, and report to Captain Jones, of the Navy, for my instructions.
As soon as you receive this letter you will send to Captain Jones for a navy officer, to teach a detachment from the battalion of your regiment, now at Williamsburg, the service of the 42-pounder carronades, and you will detail the officer of your regiment (of whom you spoke to me as being a good artillerist) to teach the rest of the battalion the use of the field pieces which you will have placed in position in the redoubts. The men of the battalion will have their small-arms at hand, to act as infantry in case of need, and their services as artillery will be temporary.
You will direct Captain Geddy to keep his company of cavalry together and to drill them twice a day, and particularly to see that his men feed and groom their horses thoroughly. You will please be very sparing of leaves of absence to these men, as it is hard to keep them together.
Regulations of the Army and the orders of this department will be your guide for the management of your post in other respects.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I beg to state that General Huger, commanding at Norfolk, concurs with me in these opinions.

We have sent from Norfolk to North. Carolina, up to July 15, 203guns; in addition, up to 2d October, 39—in all 242 guns, including six rifled 32-pounders.

Two additional were ordered yesterday to North Carolina.

Sir : I am instructed by General Magruder to state that, in consequence of the arrival of six additional regiments on the Peninsula without being accompanied by any means for their future transportation, he is seriously embarrassed in his contemplated change of position. The main body of troops have taken up a line some distance below their former location, and it is of the utmost importance that their supplies should be kept in advance some days, in order to facilitate any rapid movement against the enemy. The present number of wagons is inadequate for this purpose, and consequently the movements are greatly restricted. The roads in this neighborhood are exceedingly rough and bad in winter, and it is certainly requisite that the supply of wagons should be one to each company on hand. The number of ambulances is extremely limited, some of the regiments having none whatever; and, in case of a severe action, would not be sufficient for one-half the army. The number of wagons required to make out our quota is forty-five and the number of ambulances fifteen. These are absolutely necessary for the efficiency of the command.
I am, sir, yours, respectfully,

For some considerable time our militia have ceased to have any organization, but our legislature, which has just adjourned, has revised our whole militia system, and it is now undergoing a reorganization, and I doubt whether a call now would effect to much extent the desired object. Their great deficiency in arms presents another difficulty.
Among the acts just passed by our legislature is one authorizing the formation of companies for u local defense and special service,” similar to an act (229) of the Confederate Congress, which it is hoped will supersede the necessity of calling out the militia.
Under these circumstances I would respectfully suggest the propriety of postponing the call for the militia. I need not add that in the mean time I will give every attention to increase the efficiency of the militia.

Asa Biggs, judge of the Confederate court, in reference to an unhappy state of feeling among a portion of the citizens of this department. If I am correctly informed the feeling is not confined to Washington County, but has its ramifications along the sounds in many settlements. I have, by establishing troops at such points as the limited means at my disposal permitted, attempted to restore confidence and control the more openly disloyal. Some arrests have been made. The District of the Pamlico is now in some sort of security, but that of the Albemarle, excepting the forces at Boanoke Island, is yet without troops. I must again urge my request that an active and discreet officer be sent to me, in order that I may establish and place him in command of the District of the Albemarle. It is large enough and of sufficient importance to occupy the entire attention of such an officer, nor does the matter admit of delay.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. C. GATLIN, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
[Inclosure.]
Williamston, N. C., October 3, 1861. General Gatlin, Goldsborough, N. C.:
According to your request I now address you to give information of the state affairs in this section. This week I have been visited by two intelligent and worthy citizens of Washington County, who consider themselves quite unsafe in the present situation of affairs. They represent that in consequence of the volunteers being taken a way from their county it leaves it doubtful whether there is a reliable majority of the people in case of invasion, and while the number is few that make any demonstration by word even of their disloyalty, yet there is that indifference which excites distrust. An attempt has been made to obtain guns for the fortification of the Roanoke River. They were promised at Norfolk, but they have not arrived, and there is no prospect of preparation. We think the river ought to be put in a state of preparation, and troops ought to be ready to sustain the fortifications in case gunboats of the enemy should pass the fortifications on Roanoke Island ; and then it is thought that the presence of a battalion at least of troops in Washington County would suppress the feeling of disloyalty which it is feared exists in that county; certainly it would give a sense of security to the people there which does not now prevail. That county is subject also to approaches up the Pamlico River and across the country through that portion of the county which is thought to be

most disaffected; and these approaches can be made without coming into contact with onr forces higher up the river or those stationed in Hyde County. It is seriously feared that an attempt will be made to make a lodgment by the enemy in some part of the Albemarle County for the winter, and if they are prevented by the forces on Roanoke Island they will attempt it up the Pamlico River, disembarking at some point not defended, cross the country, a distance only of 15 or 20 miles, and occupying Plymouth or some point on the Roanoke, with the hope of accessions to their strength from the disaffected population of Tyrrell, Washington, and Beaufort Counties5 and therefore these gentlemen think there should be force in the county of Washington to protect the river and be on the alert to resist any invasion that may be attempted from the Pamlico River. I regret to hear there is fear to be apprehended from any disloyal feeling, but these gentlemen assure me it is so, and unless it is corrected soon, it will probably increase as taxes are imposed and collected. What we need is some discreet, intelligent officer sent to plan, direct, and control our defenses and preparations for defense. We want an intelligent head. The people are willing to work or fight, but their energies need direction. Our region of country is entitled to attention. It would be exceedingly difficult to dislodge the enemy if it be true that we have so many disloyal citizens in that county. I hope and believe the state of things is somewhat exaggerated, but I hope it will claim your earliest and promptest attention.
Yours, respectfully,
ASA BIGGS.

General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General 0. S. Army:
Sir: There have been within the last few days two deserters from the enemy’s ranks, who bring very reliable and important information, which I desire may be laid before the Secretary of War without delay. One of these is an intelligent boy, a native of Saint Louis, Mo.; the other a Northern man, who has lived, and has a sister and other relatives, in Savannah. The statements of these men, who don’t know each other, and who deserted on different days, are corroborated by information through many other reliable sources. The important points are the following, to wit:
1st. It has been fully determined upon to attack Yorktown by water first, and then, if unsuccessful, by land and water at the same time.
2d. Re-enforcements to the number of 30,000 men will be sent to Fort Monroe and Newport News immediately, of which 5,000 arrived since last Monday.
3d. Seventy brass rifled field pieces, for field service, and 500 horses are now at Fort Monroe in charge of the regulars, and a great many covered wagons.
4th. The men of the command at Newport News have been informed that no quarters will be built for them there this winter, but that they will winter in Yorktown.
5th. General Wool, in a speech to his troops at Newport News on Monday, just a week ago, announced to them that their march would soon be for Yorktown.
6th. Troops are arriving at Fort Monroe and Newport News in considerable numbers daily. They are generally sent to Newport News at

night, to avoid being seen by General Huger7s troops at SewelPs and Pig Point.
It is absolutely necessary, therefore, that the arrangements for the defenses of Yorktown should be made without delay, and should be in some degree commensurate with the importance of that place. The subjects to which I have repeatedly invited the attention of the War Department, and which have not been attended to successfully, are as follows:
1st. The supplying a battery of six rifled 32-pounder guns for the water defenses at Yorktown, rendered absolutely necessary there, as ships of the heaviest draught of water and in any number can attack that place from positions beyond the reach of our present guns. It is the key to Richmond, and therefore the most important point on our coast, as it is also the most assailable point.
2d. Some 250 artillerists were required by Colonel Randolph, approved by me, to serve the guns already here, but none have arrived.
3d. The ammunition for the Navy guns here is extremely limited, not more than 50 rounds for each gun. There should be at least 200 rounds each. The answer to requisitions on this subject, both from the Navy Department and the Army ordnance officer, is that there is no powder. If it is so, great injustice has been done to the public interests by not having sent a sufficient supply to Yorktown, for the reasons above given. Requisitions have been made almost weekly.
4th. Furnaces for heating shot for the Navy batteries, w7hich have been repeatedly promised by the chief engineer, Colonel Talcott, have not been made, though I understand the castings are ready. These have been promised for four months, and are rendered the more necessary from the few rounds of time shell (fixed with fuses) furnished.
Other requisitions have but partially been attended to, to wit: The six carriages in the Navy battery, on which six 8-inch coluinbiads are mounted, are worthless, as they will be destroyed by the shock of fire of our own guns after a few rounds. Four of these have been rejjlaced by four good carriages lately, but the two others it does not appear it is the intention to change. Again, shells are furnished without fuses. I asked for eight regiments more. Five have been ordered here; four have arrived. The fifth, that of Col. Howell Cobb, has not yet arrived. It is nowT most needed here.
I do not write in a complaining or fault-finding spirit $ far from it. All have done their best, doubtless; but I do not think the extreme importance of Yorktown to the whole South, through its bearing upon Richmond, the most strategic point of all, has been properly kept in view, and it is my highest duty to present these facts plainly to the Secretary of War. There are now required, therefore, at this point alone:
1st. A battery of six 32-pounder guns, rifled.
2d. One hundred and fifty rounds to each additional for the guns already here.
3d. Ammunition for the 32 pounder rifled guns asked for.
4th. Two hundred and fifty artillerists, say four companies, of 60 or 70 each. These ought to be had easily, as no other arms are required for them than their cannon.
5th. Furnaces for heating shot for the Navy batteries.
6th. Two army barbette carriages for the remaining two columbiads in the Navy battery, already furnished with four army barbette carriages.

7th. Col. Howell Cobb’s regiment, Sixteenth Georgia, not yet come.
8th. Four more regiments, if possible.
The six 32-pounders are the most essential. Without them the enemy will at his leisure dismount our guns and pass up to within forty miles of Richmond, in our sight, without our being able to raise a hand to prevent it, thus turning all the works on James River and those in front of Williamsburg.
I have the honor to be, very respectfullv, your obedient servant,

Since writing the above I have received a letter from Richmond stating that two 32-pounder *rifled guns will be sent here and four 24-pounder rifled guns, the former by the Navy Department, the latter , by Colonel Gorgas; also that one 8-inch rifled columbiad, now being finished at the Tredegar Works, may possibly be procured. If the Secretary will order the latter in addition to the two 32-pounders rifled, and four 24-pounders rifled, and the proper ammunition, and in sufficient quantity, to be sent here, I think I can insure the safety of Yorktown. The men, furnaces, gun-carriages, &c., asked for can be furnished, I presume, with less difficulty.

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General C. 8. Army, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: Col. Howell Cobb’s regiment has not yet arrived, and I understand is still detained in Richmond for want of arms. I beg that they may be furnished, as I am in great need of the service of that regiment. There are but about 9,500 nou-eommissioned officers and men for duty in this department, with seven posts to garrison, and the enemy to be met in the field besides. The artillery companies, asked for yesterday and some time since, are for this post. In addition to these 250 artillerists, I require the following artillery companies to man the batteries already constructed or being constructed, viz: Williamsburg, three; Mulberry Point, one; Young’s farm, one; Ship Point, one; and Back River, one. As these companies do not require arms, I suppose they can be raised and dispatched at once. I have directed a copy of this letter to be sent to Governor Letcher, who may furnish some of them. Col. T. R. R. Cobb informs me that he was promised by the Secretary of War the return to his Legion of the artillery company which belongs to it, and which is now, I believe, with General Lee. In view of the large preparations now being made at Fort Monroe for field artillery, I have the honor to request that this may be done as soon as possible.

the muzzle of the piece. It was so at Bethel. I at first thought it was owing to the cement between the fuse and shell, and had that carefully removed, but with the same result. I think, therefore, it must be in the composition. I cannot remedy that, and, as I expect to meet the enemy soon, must beg you to send me the proper quantity of good fixed ammunition. I have ordered my ordnance officer to make out the necessary requisition. The friction tubes also are worthless; not those made of brass, but those of lead or mixed metal. I think they came from the Virginia Armory. 1 tried many, and not one would explode. We shall be ruined unless you can send me good shell and spherical-case shot and good friction primers. Please let me know, on receipt of this, if you can send them.

Headquarters Army of the Peninsula,
Yorktown, Fa., October 8, 1861. His Excellency John Letcher, Governor of Virginia:
Sir: I have examined into the state of the defenses on the north side of the York River, and found that on the coast of Gloucester, Matthews, and Middlesex Counties no works have been erected, and that there are in Gloucester about 180 militia troops, under Colonel Jones; in Matthews, about 500 volunteers, with four small pieces of artillery, and a small force of volunteers in Middlesex.
Colonel Crump commands at Gloucester Point, and I propose to place all these troops under his immediate command, in order that I may have one head to carry out my orders in relation to the defense of these counties. I have already caused an inspection to be made of this coast by Colonel Crump, and have received his report. I have also sought and obtained an interview with Colonel Jones, commanding the militia of Gloucester, and he seems to agree with me as to the best available means of defending this coast. That there will be a descent upon it sooner or later by the enemy I do not entertain a doubt, and I think it will be in the course of this autumn or the ensuing winter. The enemy will attempt to get a foothold to operate upon the many slaves in these counties, and will then be guided by circumstances. If he be repulsed in his first attempt, he will probably abandon it. To prevent his success, it is necessary to fortify the mouths of the rivers leading into these counties. This can be done rapidly and easily by building inclosed redoubts, and placing in them guns of long range. But as, from there not being deep water in these rivers, his vessels must be of very light draught, I am of opinion that ten 4-pounder rifled guns, one or two in each fort, will be sufficient to repulse him or to deter him from making the attempt.
The forts will be good substitutes for a large number of men requiring more small-arms than we can spare. As it is obvious that the enemy will make his great attack this autumn and winter, I think all the militia of Gloucester, Matthews, Middlesex, King and Queen, and King William Counties should be called out and ordered to report to Colonel Crump at Gloucester, if arms of any kind can be furnished them. At all events, the ten rifled guns (4-pounders, of which Virginia, I am told, has forty) cannot be better employed than in the manner here indicated. I beg, therefore, that you will cause that

P. S.—I have the honor to recommend that Captain Jordan’s company of artillery at Jamestown Island be furnished with a light battery, to remain in this department. Seventy rifled field guns are now at Fort Monroe, preparing for the field, as reported to me by intelligent deserters.
Headquarters Army of the Peninsula,
Yorlctown, Fa., October 8,1861. Col. Andrew Talcott, Richmond, Va. :
It is a matter of great moment that the defenses at Harden’s Bluff and Mulberry Point should be as strong as possible. The work at Mulberry Point can contain two more guns; that at Harden’s Bluff I have not seen, but Captain Myers, the engineer in charge, informs me that several more guns could be mounted there to great advantage. The river is better commanded at that point than at any other below Jamestown; and if it can be rendered safe there, troops as well as field guns could be used below. I therefore respectfully invite your attention to it as having a bearing upon my operations below. I think, however, that the attack will probably be made at this place, as the great depth and expanse of water here will enable the enemy to attack with ships of any size and in any number, his fire being concentrated at a great distance upon any one of our batteries at a time. It is easier for a fleet to succeed at Yorktown than on James River, and the advantages of success here are much greater, since by it all the works on James River would be at once turned. I am pleased, therefore, to learn from Mr. St. John that there is a prospect of our getting rifled guns of large caliber here soon.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, *

General: In reply to yours of the 1st instant* I am instructed to say that the assignment of General Hill cannot be changed, nor is it necessary that it should be. The senior officer at Roanoke Island would necessarily command the defenses at that place, while General Hill will have supervision of the whole district to which he has been assigned. General Huger has asked to be relieved from the command and supervision of Roanoke Island, as being entirely beyond the limits of his present command at Norfolk, and it was for this reason and the necessity for having a superior officer in that section that General Hill was sent to the North Carolina coast.
I am, respectfully, &c.,

Dear Sir:	*	*	*	*	*	*
The object of my present letter, therefore, is to propose that the governor signify through the public press, that he will call out the militia in the counties bordering on the sound if volunteers enough are not raised by the 20th instant for the defense of the State; the commander of the district to be judge of the proper complement of men.
We are very much in need of three batteries of light artillery. I understand they can be purchased in Eome, Ga., and one battery received in fifteen days from the date of the order. I most earnestly urge the immediate purchase of these guns. There ought to be a battery on Shackelford Banks to prevent the landing of the enemy, &c.

The major-general commanding the Army of the Peninsula announces to the troops that he has received reliable information that the enemy will soon advance. Seventy rifled field pieces and 500 artillery horses, with a large number of wagons, are at Fort Monroe ready for the field. The commanding general of the troops at that post and Newport News has proclaimed to his men that no quarters will be built for them, but that they will fight for their winter quarters and find them at York-town.
From Saint Louis to Washington, from Washington to New Orleans, the command is: “Onward to the destruction of the South.’7 Let us, therefore, stand ready to welcome these strangers to “hospitable graves.77 The commanding general knows too well the high character of the troops under him to believe that any would desire to fle absent upon an occasion like this. Sickness of friends, pecuniary interests, and temporary physical disability, which in ordinary times would be good reason for expecting leaves of absence, can no longer be so considered. Therefore no leaves to officers Or furloughs to soldiers will be granted until the month of January, and not then if they shall be considered injurious to the interest of the army. No leaves or furloughs based on certificates of disability will be granted to leave the department, the climate here being now healthy and the hospital accommodations good. In cases where surgeons recommend furloughs on account of sickness, the patients will be sent to the hospital at Bigler’s, or some one of the hospitals attached to the army, where they will be well cared for, and returned for duty when able to perform it.

You will order the guns of Stanard’s section to be replaced by two guns (12-pounders preferable) from the remaining batteries. I request that you place below Smith’s, or opposite to his farm, the Second Louisiana Regiment, one or two pieces of artillery (one a rifled piece), and one company of cavalry, the rest of your force to be kept just in rear of the pickets and out of sight of the enemy, who will probably come by the main road with cannon, and will have flankers for about 200 yards. Your men ought, therefore, to be at least 400 yards from the road, concealed, with the pieces also concealed. If the picket is attacked they can retire, and will probably be followed. When they are in the open field you can open fire upon them with artillery and infantry. Keep them engaged until they are attacked in rear, then charge with all your forces; but you must judge of the

I hope this will meet you there, so I inclose it to Colonel Wright. You will see and find out in a day or two what has been done and the many things left undone far better than I can tell you.
I shall be very glad to have you there. I first took Roanoke Island to prevent the enemy getting a position in the sound. I considered it most important. They now, unless they move across to the main-land, must keep all their troops in Fort Hatteras or stretch out on the beach. Chieamacomico shows they cannot stand on open ground. If they extend up the beach we must run them again.
More troops have no doubt gone from here there. General Mansfield is sent there.
I do not see how a large number can stay in or near Hatteras in winter ; and if we can deprive them of the use of the light, Hatteras will not be over-agreeable or easily reached.
There is great activity at Fort Monroe and Newport News; troops arriving and departing. They threaten me with a large force in front; so many vessels. I fear to reduce my force, but if there is a chance at the Hessians your way, I am ready to help you.

Headquarters,
Mouth of Warwick River, October 17, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Acting Secretary of War:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, and in answer state that I found two 32-pounder guns at Mulberry Point some six weeks since, and was told by Captain Fitzgerald, then in command there, that he had taken them from the steamer Teazer, in order to have something to fire with while the work was being prepared for heavy guns. I learned subsequently that the Teazer has been laid up for repairs in Richmond. I therefore had these guns, which were lying idle at Mulberry Island Point, transferred to the work then being erected at the mouth of this river, where they are now in position with one other gun, a long 32-pounder. I send a map of the lower peninsula, which I had prepared solely from observation, but which is sufficiently correct to show the line I occupy.
The lowest fort on James River, on the left bank, is Mulberry Island Point; opposite is Harden’s Bluff fort, both strong on the water fronts. By a glance at the map it will be seen that if the enemy can land at the mouth of Warwick River, he can march to Mulberry Island Point and take the fort there in rear. The troops on my line from the mouth of Deep Creek, which is the same as that of Warwick River, to Harwood’s Mill, at the head of Poquosin River, cannot go to the succor of Mulberry Island Point without making a march of some 20 miles around the head of Warwick River; besides, the right flank of my own line is below Warwick River. That flank must be secured and the fort at Mulberry Island Point, both in full sight of the enemy at Newport News, now at least 8,000 strong. I have therefore caused one regiment (500 strong) to take post at Land’s End, on the right, at the mouth of Warwick River, and have thrown up an intrenchment there, but these guns of the Teazer are necessary for the armament of this intrenchment. I have caused rifle-pits to be made to protect the men, and sunk canal-boats across the mouth of the river. I had two old 32-pounder guns without carriages at Williamsburg. I have made field carriages for them here (at Williamsburg), and have had them placed in position on the left bank at the month of this river. These obstacles at the mouth can easily be removed by the enemy unless I have a strong battery or batteries to prevent it. Some days since I received a message from Lieutenant Minor, of the Navy, saying that he could send me a heavy 32-pounder for the light 32-pounders, weighing 31 cwt. I answered that such an exchange would be very beneficial to my operations, but that the heavy gun ought to be sent down at once and before the other was taken away.
With this explanation I am ready to deliver up the two light 32-pounders, but beg that at least one heavy one be sent to replace them, and 1 respectfully suggest that as the enemy may attack us at any moment, it would be advisable to have the heavy gun in battery before the light ones are removed. The Teazer had better besenttoMul-

berry Island Point with the heavy gun and land it there. I will leave orders with Colonel Hodges, commanding the troops at Land’s End, to send for it, put it up, and then to send over to the fort at Mulberry Island Point the two light guns, or, should the Secretary of the Navy or yourself prefer it, I will send the two light guns to Mulberry Island Point at once. I will mention that I informed Capt. William Blair, of the Navy, by note, of my having taken the two light 32*pounders, Capt. William Blair being in charge of the naval defenses of James River. They were not in position, and were entirely useless where they lay. I heard nothing more on the subject, and presumed everything was satisfactory.
I have the honor to send a report of Colonel Randolph, chief of artillery.* I beg that an indorsement be made on this report directing that the ammunition which will be required by Colonel Randolph for this battery be furnished without delay.

Sir : There are two good gunboats here, the Uncle Ben and Mariner. The former has been purchased and prepared for service, wanting only a good rifled gun for her bows, which I understand will come from the Norfolk navy-yard. The Mariner, supposed to be worth about $16,000, could be purchased, and I understand from the Secretary of the Navy he would like to purchase her. These two boats, with a powerful forward gun and one young, energetic Navy officer on each, would, in my opinion, be of great service here, cruising at and near the mouth of the river. There are constantly hovering on this coast vessels of the enemy of various descriptions, some steamers and others said to be sailing barks. Two days ago a very large steamer came near to the beach, with a great many men on board. Occasionally they entice pilots on board, and sometimes negroes. I am of opinion that these gunboats, commanded by suitable officers, by watching an opportunity, could occasionally run astern of some of these vessels and capture them. They could also daily visit the various forts, carrying supplies, and exert a good moral effect. I therefore suggest to the Department that it would be well to ask the Navy Department to put them both in service.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
J. R. ANDERSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Chap. XIII.
Portsmouth, Va., October 18, 1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:
Sir : I have the honor to make the following report of the condition of the defenses intrusted to my care:
Fort Macon has but four guns of long range, and these are badly supplied with ammunition, and are on very inferior carriages.
New Berne has a tolerable battery, two 8-inch columbiads and two 32-pounders. It is, however, badly supplied with powder. This is also the condition of Washington.
Hyde, the richest county in the State, has ten landings, and only one gun—an English 9-pounder, of great age and venerable appearance.
Boanoke Island is the key of one-third of North Carolina, and whose occupancy by the enemy would enable him to reach the great railroad from Bichmond to New Orleans. Four additional regiments are absolutely indispensable to the protection of this island. The batteries also need four rifled cannon of heavy caliber. I would most earnestly call the attention of the honorable Secretary of War to the importance of Boanoke Island. Its fall would be fully as fatal as that of Manassas. The enemy has now 8,000 men at Hatteras, and Boanoke Island will undoubtedly be attacked. The towns of Elizabeth, Edenton, Plymouth, and Williamston will be taken, should Boanoke be captured or passed. The inhabitants of those towns have been most criminally indifferent about efforts to fortify them.
I came up last night to this place to get rifled guns, but none can be procured without an order from the Secretary of the Navy. I have written to him on the subject, but fear that no attention will be given by him to the matter. With ten additional rifled guns and a few more regiments I trust to be able to hold the line intrusted to my care. At present I must pronounce my entire inability to do so.
With great respect,
D. H. HILL,
Brigadier-General, C. S. Army.
Portsmouth, Va., October 18,1861. Hon. S. B. Mallory, Secretary C. S. Navy:
Sir: Having been placed by the honorable Secretary of War in charge of the coast defense of North Carolina from Fort Macon to the Virginia line, I have the honor to call your attention to the following statement of the condition of the fortifications. I make my report to you because the only hope of getting the proper ordnance is the navy-yard in this place.
Fort Macon cannot be held without four more efficient guns of long range. There are but four guns now of long range, and these are illy supplied with ammunition and are mounted on very inferior carriages. The battery at New Berne is well constructed and has two heavy
8-	inch columbiads, but the ammunition is very scarce.
Washington has two good batteries as far as the earthwork is concerned, but the guns are of inferior caliber.
Hyde, the richest county in the State, has ten landings, and only a
9-	pounder field piece, an old English gun.
Boanoke Island is the key to one-third of North Carolina, and its possession by the enemy would enable him to seize the great railway connection between north and south of the Confederacy. This all-impor-

taut island is in want of men and guns. It should have at least six more rifled cannon. Feeling that everything depended upon holdingdt, I came up last night to apply to the Navy Department for ordnance and ordnance stores. I found Commodore Forrest, Captain Fairfax, and General Huger fully as much concerned about the island as I was, but they could do nothing for me without your order. Under these circumstances I most earnestly appeal to you for six additional rifled cannon, four for Fort Macon and two for Koanoke Island. There ought to be, however, four at least for the latter place. 1 am confident that Manassas itself is not more important than it.
With great respect,

Headquarters of Forces, • Roanoke Island, N. (7., October 18,1861.
Maj. Gen. B. Huger:
General : Your letter of the 16th is just received. I am greatly embarrassed. I am ready to go to Hatteras, and would have been there to-day, as the weather is just right—wind from the southwest—but for an order of General Hill, a copy of which I herewith inclose. I have a number of flats or large fish-boats, enough to transport and land 1,200 or 1,500 men. The commodore’s fleet is here, and he is willing and anxious to make the attack. I do not believe the enemy are 8,000 strong, as General Hill seems to think, and, if he wishes, can whip him with 1,200 or 1,500 good men, just such as I have here. I do not like the idea of letting the rascals off without another flogging. For God’s sake, and our country’s too, send down a few more men and let me go at them. I send the Cussatuc back immediately. There is no other boat here. All the barges have been sent to Norfolk. I am very sorry that General Hill interposed and ordered me to remain on the defensive. I thought, and still think, that he should not have given me this order, as I was acting under orders from you; but I was left no discretion and had to obey. The men under my command are, as you know, here with but little clothing. The winter is fast approaching, and, if possible, I would like to get the overcoats we captured on the Fanny to give out to the men. Will you do us the great favor to write to Commodore Lynch or the Navy Department in relation to our getting them. Please allow me to suggest that the quartermaster begin to make arrangements for our winter quarters at Norfolk, if we are to return there. It seems a difficult matter to get our batteries ready for action. Ammunition and the implements to work the guns at Weir Point battery are still wanting. The battery at Boberts’ Fishery is complete 5 carriages up, but no guns to mount. The small battery on the Boanoke Sound (Midgett’s Hammock) will be commenced to morrow, and I shall push on the work on an intrenched camp as soon as possible.

I wish this communicated to the Secretary of War immediately:
Sergeant Dougherty, of the Washington Artillery, Captain Smith, at Hampton, whom I deem a very intelligent and reliable man, has reached this point from the other side of Poquosin River, and reports that he was informed late this evening by his father-in-law, who*resides there, that he was just from Fox Hill, and ascertained that some 22 large ships of war had arrived at Old Point within the last week, also 17 gunboats; that he ascertained this fact from men living inside the enemy’s pickets; that a movement was contemplated on Yorktown, with 30,000 men by land and a simultaneous movement by water with the large shipping. The gunboats were intended for the Poquosin River. Three deserters attempted to escape yesterday from Colonel Levy’s regiment. Two of them were captured by my men; the other, it is supposed, made his way to the enemy. A well-executed map was found of the works at Pensacola on the person of one of them.
Very respectfully,
CHAS. MALLORY,
Colonel One hundred and fifteenth Regiment Militia.
I have received a similar letter from General Pemberton. This information may be relied upon. The left flank of my position is open to the enemy. If he lands there, I will be obliged to fall back on York-towm. Heavy re-enforcements will be necessary to keep him back below my present position and to keep in check a large force which may land on the Poquosin River. The steamer Logan is laid up until Tuesday, broken down. Troops can be sent by James River, to land at Grove Wharf. If the enemy should come up James River, then to land at Jamestown Island. The 10-inch rifled columbiad has not arrived.

Headquarters Forces Roanoke Island,
Gamp Georgia, October 20, 1861. Maj. Gen. B. Huger, Commanding Forces, Norfolk, Va.:
General : The commodore sends up this morning one of his gunboats for repairs (the Raleigh), and I avail myself of the opportunity to let you know that we are still in statu quo. I have no news from the enemy. We have had for two days bad, rainy weather, and yesterday afternoon we had a severe blow from the southwest. I hope the rascals will be driven from Hatteras before many days by Providence, as it seems that we can’t get at them. Commodore Lynch contemplates removing in a day or two his fleet from this quarter and going round to New Berne. If he leaves we will not be able to make any offensive demonstrations against the enemy for want of water transportation. I was greatly in hope that we would be able to give the Hessians a blow before he left, but I almost give it up now. I am ready to start at a moment’s notice, and even without the expected re-enforcements; indeed, I should have gone yesterday but for the written order of General Hill forbidding it. I have been compelled to charter the Cotton Plant, as she is the only boat down here that can get about from the different defenses in progress here. The Navy have had her until yesterday, when at my request the commodore turned her over to me. She is a very poor boat, but we are compelled to have some means of transportation between the different batteries.
The engineer is engaged now in perfecting the floating battery defenses, and if the weather permits we will commence the battery on Roanoke Sound to-morrow. General #Hill directed some addition or alteration to be made (as I learn) to the Pork Point battery. I don’t know what they are or how they are progressing, as he said nothing to me about it. I thought that it was due to me as the senior officer here that he should have given his order and direction through me•, he, it seems, thought otherwise, and has left me in the dark as to his intentions and operations here. I hope soon to be relieved; indeed I (and the whole regiment) rely on your promise that we should be withdrawn from here and ordered to rejoin our old command. We are more anxious now than ever. So long as you remain in command here we are content to remain, but as this place is assigned to the command of General Hill, we beg to be removed as soon as the interest of the service will permit.

Sir : I have reliable information that the enemy will attack this place with 30 ships of war and 22 gunboats by sea and 30,000 men by land. My left flank, on the Poquosin River and above, is most unsafe, aud I can bring but 8,000 men into the field, leaving out regiment and some artillery in the works at Yorktown and Williamsburg, respectively. I want infantry to beat back the enemy, who will land below Yorktown, on York River. If besieged here, they will be sent to Williamsburg, and could, after the crisis passes, in any case be liberated for other points. I send an express to-day with fuller information, but no time should be lost. The steamer Logan will not be ready until Wednesday. These troops can be sent by Grove Wharf or can be landed at Jamestown Island; the former preferable if the enemy be not ascending James River when the steamer passes Jamestown Island, as he may enter both James and York Rivers at the same time. Six thousand men at least are neeessarv.

Hon. Secretary of War :
Sir : Brig. Gen. D. H. Hill, in a report upon the condition of certain coast defenses of North Carolina, informs me that “ Fort Macon cannot be held without four more effective guns of long range ”; and he calls upon this Department to furnish him with “six additional rifled guns, four for Fort Macon and two for Roanoke Island.” I regret to say that I cannot furnish these guns, and respectfully refer the subject to you. Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. R. MALLORY,

Yorktown, October 23, 1861.
S. Cooper, Adjutant- General:
The enemy can land anywhere on the coast of York River within 8 miles of this place below us, and between such point of landing and this place there are no defensible positions. Heavy re-enforcements are therefore necessary, as I consider this post in imminent danger. Everything has been done that could possibly be done with the means at my disposal. If there are not means to afford them in Richmond, I would respectfully suggest that all the cavalry companies there may be armed with rifles or shot-guns, be dismounted, and sent here forthwith, and that all the armed infantry disposable be also sent, with the full supply of ammunition. The enemy’s fleet at Fort Monroe amounts to seventy sail. Please send down also 50,000 cartridges for the Minie muskets, 30,000 for the Enfield, 20,000 thousand for pistols, 50,000 for Sharp’s carbines, and 150,000 for the percussion muskets, and send the proper proportion of caps for each. I am much embarrassed for transportation. Please send 20 ambulances and 50 wagons. All these things have been required for repeatedly, and have no doubt been supplied as fast as the proper departments could do so, but they are now absolutely necessary. I cannot too strongly urge upon the Department the sending immediately such heavy rifled cannon as can possibly be spared, with the ammunition and everything that may be necessary to them, and particularly that the flannel cylinders may be filled there with the proper charges of powder. Colonel Gorgas will oblige me by letting us know what is the proiier charge for the rifled 10-inch guns already sent and for any other rifled guns that may be sent.

Executive Department,
Raleigh, JST. GY., October 25,1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Acting Secretary of War:
Sir : I have received various rumors of large fleets and expeditions fitting out at New York and Fortress Monroe, supposed to be designed for our coast. I will make all preparation in my power to repel any invasion, but my resources are now restricted almost to the militia, and they are unarmed, undrilled, and some not yet organized; but with all their imperfections they have been ordered to hold themselves ready with whatever arms and ammunition they have. We feel very defenseless here without arms, and 1 will not again repeat to you that this has been effected by our generosity to others, but I allude to it in reference to another claim we have on the Confederates of Virginia. We see just over our lines in Virginia, near Suffolk, two or three North Carolina regiments, well armed and well drilled, who are not allowed to come to the defense of their homes, and two of them posted remote from any point of attack. This is not a criticism on their military position, but rather a suggestion of anxiety to have their services when we are so seriously threatened.
I understand that the President objects to sending back any troops, lest he should accomplish the very design of the enemy in drawing off forces from the defenses of Virginia, but the enemy’s designs may change, and finding North Carolina defenseless, may think they can damage the Confederacy as much in North Carolina as in Virginia, and policy as well as experience will prompt the enemy to assail the weakest point. We are threatened with an expedition of 15,000 men. That is the amount of our seaboard army, extended along 400 miles of territory, and at no point can we spare a man, and without the use of arms can’t increase it. Our forts might resist their attacks and landing, but out of reach of the forts we cannot concentrate a force of any magnitude. We have now collected in camps about three regiments without arms, and our only reliance is the slow collection of shot-guns and hunting rifles, and it is difficult to buy, because the people are now hugging their arms to their own bosoms for their defense.
Having been fairly notified of the President’s policy, I would not press this again except that you may be properly apprised of our situation and slender means, with a hope that when a change of policy was discovered on the other side and their demonstrations on our coast became settled invasion, there might be a corresponding change on our side.
Very respectfully,

Sir : The quartermaster general of this department has had a draft in his possession for six weeks of $179,000 (about) for the payment of six or seven regiments under my command, among others the First North Carolina Regiment, whose term of service expires in fourteen or fifteen days. These regiments have not been paid since 30th of June, and the men and officers evince much dissatisfaction. I have been assured by the acting quartermaster here (Captain Bloomfield, assistant

## p. 691 (#699) ############################################

﻿CnAP.xm.] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—CONFEDERATE.	691
quartermaster, being absent, sick) that he has sent a special messenger three times to Richmond with this draft, and that each time this messenger has presented the draft at the Treasury several times, and he has not been able to get the money, the statement there being that they could not get the notes. I beg that this be made known to the Secretary of War. Nothing except an unavoidable necessity should prevent the troops being paid.
The artillery horses which have been furnished this department are, almost without exception, worthless. The order has been given, no doubt properly, by the Quartermaster-General, but only the vilest refuse has been sent here. I must have at least one hundred good artillery horses. I have not a single battery in the Peninsula furnished altogether with horses except Randolph’s navy howitzers, which were furnished before I left Richmond. The pieces here are drawn by miserable horses, the caissons by miserable mules, and the harness to a great extent plow harness. The roads are now almost impassable. Of course the field artillery will be useless or lost.
I was willing to submit to these things in the commencement and for a reasonable time, but further neglect in these matters is criminal, and I hope the attention of the departments whose duty it is to furnish these-supplies will be called to this neglect.
The friction primers received from the Ordnance Department (a fresh supply), only received a few days since, to supply the place of others which were worthless, turned out to be worthless themselves, and I send a special agent—an officer who can be illy spared from here—to get from the Ordnance Department the means of firing the guns. I wish also at least fifty more wagons and twenty ambulances, with horses and harness for same. They can be had, and should be sent here. Requisitions have been made and repeated, messengers have been sent again and again, and standing agents kept in Richmond to procure these supplies, but with very inadequate results, both as to quantity as well as quality. I need now artillery harness for at least two hundred horses. This is a low country, the roads are flooded with the rains, and these means are necessary here if anywhere. I am informed by the Quartermaster-General that I must depend upon this country (I presume from West Point down) for forage, and when I send agents to purchase, I find that the forage is being purchased by agents of the Quartermaster’s Department from Richmond. Again, no forage can be had in this Peninsula unless it is hauled by our wagons, and I have not wagons enough to move the troops. The artillery and cavalry horses are dying for want of long forage. I am endeavoring to remedy this, but cannot do it without at least fifty wagons more.
I hope that you will bring this letter to the notice of the Secretary of War, and that he will order from the Quartermaster’s Department one hundred good horses for artillery and fifty good wagons, with four mules and four sets of harness each; twenty ambulances, with the horses and harness corresponding for each. From the Ordnance I wish regular artillery harness for two hundred horses, in the proper proportion of lead and wheel, and friction primers of the best kind.
I should not request that these things should be ordered by the Secretary except that I shall not be otherwise able to obtain them, at least in any reasonable time.
No re-enforcements have yet arrived.

I will endeavor to obtain further intormation if possible, and transmit it by telegraph, for which purposes the operator at Richmond had better be ordered to sit up. Since writing the above a special messenger, one of my own men, has brought reliable information from the neighborhood of Hampton, and states that there are thirty regiments this morning between Hampton and Fort Monroe; that part of the fleet had set sail with other troops—destination not known; that a considerable quantity of artillery are with the thirty regiments now between Hampton and Fort Monroe, and that it is stated there that by 3d November they will drive our troops from Yorktown, and in six weeks they would be in Richmond. The statements in regard to the number of troops are deemed to be reliable. They were doubtless in that number and position this morning.

The enemy’s fleet has just left Hampton Roads. Our spies in Washington report that the expedition is aimed at Wilmington, Smithville, and Fayetteville Arsenal. Keep a good lookout, and telegraph us the instant it shows itself. There are about 1,500 Georgia troops at Golds-borough. If the fleet approaches you, telegraph also to General Gatlin, at Goldsborough, to forward the Georgians, with their field battery, to your aid, and we will send further re-enforcements. I dare not send more troops now, as the information may not be correct.*

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:
General : I have the honor to inclose herewith a letter from Brig. Gen. D. H. Hill, containing a partial report of a tour through his district. You will perceive that he strongly urges that two regiments be sent to Roanoke Island to take the place of Colonel Wright’s. The post is of such importance that could I have done so I should long since have re-enforced it, but I am unable to send a soldier there without withdrawing them from points already insufficiently defended. I must, therefore, request that the general’s letter be submitted to the President, hoping that he may see some way of furnishing the required force. I have repeatedly urged upon the governor the necessity of sending every man he can arm to the coast. His reply has been that he can send men, but has no arms with which to furnish them.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant.

Fort Macon, N. C., October 27, 1861.
General R. C. Gatlin :
Dear Sir : I must again repeat my earnest convictions that the occupation of Shackelford Banks by a regiment of infantry and a battery of artillery is essential to the defense of Fort Macon. I learn from Captain Pool, stationed on the Banks, that in the last twenty-eight days the Yankees have been employed twenty days in sounding the approaches to the Banks. They have landed in small parties several times, and have sought to gain all information from the Bankers about the island, the force on it, width, extent, &c. Should the enemy occupy it, he could establish a mortar battery against the fort and drag their surf-boats without difficulty across into Core Sound. Let me entreat you to send a regiment to occupy the Banks.
In regard to a battery, I wrote to the governor three weeks ago that he could get one from Rome, Ga., in ten days. He replies that it is the business of the Confederacy to furnish the battery.*
# # # * # ^ # #
I am very much troubled about Roanoke Island. They have three formidable batteries, but badly located and without adequate infantry support. I went to Norfolk, and succeeded in getting two rifled cannon for that point, shell and powder, three carronades for Hyde and two rifled cannon for Washington, and the promise of rifling two more for Pungo River. I established a battery at Pun go, but could get nothing but two 24-pounders with carriages and two without. The occupation of that river by the enemy would cut off Hyde and serve as a place of operations against Washington.
General Huger told me that he could not spare Colonel Wright, and wranted you to supply his place immediately. There ought to be two North Carolina regiments on Roanoke besides Colonel Shaw’s command. There is bad feeling between the North Carolina and Georgia troops. Should we attempt the recapture of Hatteras, Roanoke is the proper place to start from. The newspapers could not inform the enemy about

the expedition if started from Roanoke Island. I am having a line of defense thrown up to defend the approaches to New Berne, Washington, Hyde, and Roanoke. The spade has been set agoing everywhere I have been, even in lazy Elizabeth. I have also got the promise of a. little work from Beaufort. Should it be done, the age of miracles is not yet over.
I will go to-morrow to Swansborough. I understand that there is a large amount of cotton in the neighborhood, which is attracting Yankee cupidity. I will direct its removal to the interior. The Yankee force at Hatteras is said to be 8,000. I fear for Roanoke Island. That place and this are the weak points in my department. Two more regiments should immediately be sent to Roanoke Island, one with a battery to Shackelford Banks.

Sir : I have had the honor to receive your letter of October 25, in regard to the condition of North Carolina. The dangers which have threatened or may still threaten your State have not escaped the solicitude of the Government, and no effort has been spared or will in future be spared to provide against every attack. Before your letter was received a regiment, a battalion, and a battery of artillery had been ordered to Goldsborough, to be in readiness to re-enforce any point which might be threatened with an attack, and three more regiments were held in readiness in Richmond for the same purpose. I trust your excellency will believe me when I assure you that your own solicitude for the safety of North Carolina cannot be greater than ours. No safeguard which we can command for your defense will be overlooked. The safety of all parts of the Confederate States engages equally the solicitude of the Government, and the people of North Carolina may be encouraged in their efforts for their own defense by the assurance that no assistance which the Government can afford them against the common foe will be withheld.

He regrets that he has neither the re-enforcements to send nor the means to send them, but feels convinced, from the state of the enemy’s fleet, that you will not be attacked at present by water. He hopes that the 32-pounders, the arrival of which at Gloucester he accidently heard of, will reach you very soon, conducted by Lieutenant Bayley, whom you sent for them. Though he takes great interest in your situation, he must inform you that the counties of Accomac and Northampton have not been assigned to this department. Nevertheless, he takes the liberty of suggesting that, as he understands from Lieutenant Parramore, your bearer of dispatches, that you can bring into the field (militia and all) about 2,500 men, with various arms, accompanied by eight pieces of artillery, it would be the best policy to march upon the invading foe the moment he crosses the line, and attack

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond:
Sir : It becomes my duty to report that, in pursuance of the instructions of the honorable Secretary of War to “send all the force I could possibly spare to the aid of South Carolina in the event she should be attacked/7 I sent two regiments of infantry and one field battery of six brass pieces (Captain Moore7s). It will be understood that this is a force I thought I could spare when the enemy had passed this point and actually attacked our brethren in another State, but it is a force which cannot be spared after the emergency has passed, looking to the general defense of this part of the coast, especially since the withdrawal of the reserves from Goldsborough. If these regiments are likely to remain in South Carolina long—and in any event to be prepared for attack—I respectfully request that two of the three regiments which I learn from his excellency the governor of North Carolina he has organized, but for which he has no arms, be armed if practicable, and ordered to report to me as early as practicable.
Whilst the matter of sending this force to South Carolina was left to my judgment I did not hesitate a moment, and I am well assured that those to whose assistance they were sent would promptly have come to my aid if the attack had been made here, and it is proper that I should remark upon the alacrity with which my orders were obeyed by both officers and men without exception. Indeed, the only difficulty with me vTas to say who should not go when all were volunteers for the post of danger.
It is due, too, to the militia of the neighboring counties that I should formally announce to you that when I conceived it my duty to call for their assistance on occasion of the recent apprehended attack, they almost to a man rushed to their country7s standard, each man with a weapon. Bo universal wras the turn-out, that I found it prudent to detail detachments to return to the counties for police purposes.

Eastern Shore of Virginia, giving the amount- of infantry and cavalry in that country at 800 volunteers, eight pieces of held artillery, which can be furnished with horses, and about 1,000 or 1,200 fighting men of all ages, who can be variously armed.
1 learn also that there are six 32-pounders at Gloucester Point, en route for the Eastern Shore. Colonel Smith, the commanding officer there, calls upon me for re-enforcements, stating that there are from 3,000 to 5,000 of the enemy near the Maryland line, I presume awaiting re-enforcements. I have answered him that I have neither the reenforcements nor the means of sending them if I had, the only steamer, the Logan, within my command being broken down and not likely to be repaired for some weeks. I advised him to attack the enemy as soon as he crossed the line with all the force he had.
All this has no doubt been represented to the War Department, but as these counties have not been attached to my command, I am without information as to the line of policy adopted at Richmond in respect to them.
While I sympathize deeply with the inhabitants of these counties from their present extreme peril, I am nevertheless of the opinion that it is impossible to prevent the enemy overrunning them, and that the present is the best opportunity to withdraw the troops and munitions of war from that region. The political question, however, is one for the Government and not for me, and upon that subject I offer no opinion.
I have the utmost confidence in the gallantry of these citizens, and from an interview with Colonel Smith, the commanding officer, I am favorably impressed with his ability.
Should an action take place at present between the forces opposite each other, I entertain a strong hope that a victory on our side will be the result, and that the enemy thus repulsed might find such other occupation for his arms as would relieve this region from further molestation.
In the mean time, if the Government considers me in any manner in command of the troops on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, I shall be happy to receive instructions.

Sir: I beg leave to state that Dr. William S. Morris, president of telegraph company, has failed to send forward the materials and chemicals necessary to keep the telegraph lines in operation which I have constructed with so much labor, and that I have sent Mr. Conner, one of the telegraph operators, to Richmond for the purpose of getting the necessary chemicals, and not having returned, so far as I have learned, I presume Dr. Morris has kept him also. For the want of these articles the line is seldom in operation between Yorktown and Richmond even. The enemy have advanced 5 miles from Old Point to-day, and have occupied an important position, which he may desire to fortify, but which I do not wish him to do. It is nearly half way between his two positions at Old Point and Newport News, he having probably at each of these places troops superior in numbers to my own. In front of this advanced position there is a narrow but deep and unfordable river 2* nevertheless, if I can find, the means of crossing it and driving away this force by attacking it in flank and rear, I will endeavor to do it, if he attempts to fortify it. I have refused to send the men from this department which Dr. Morris, president of Southern Telegraph Company, requires, as their services are necessary to me, and I hope the War Department will sustain me in it, and cause Dr. Morris to send Mr. Conner back, with the necessary chemicals and wire, forthwith.

I regret that I am not able to fill your requisitions for arms. If we had them to spare they should cheerfully be placed at your disposal for the purpose designated. The supply just received by the Fingal is by no means so large as has been represented. We received but 9,000, and these have been divided between Generals Lee and A. S.

Headquarters Army oe the Peninsula,
Yorktown, Yan November 25, 1861. Brigadier-General McLaws, Commanding at Young’s Mill, Ya.:
Sir : I have lost and am losing the services of the efficient body of engineers who have been in the service of the State of Virginia since the war, and who have been engaged m constructing most of the defensive works on this Peninsula. It is not possible to do without these officers, as the line of our Army cannot furnish military engineers. These officers are all of them well educated, and many (such as Mr. St. John and Captain Rives) distinguished for great talent and energy. All have devoted themselves also to military engineering, and all are highly qualified for the duties required of them. From the very large number of points requiring defense, there are of necessity a great many works. Those on the water must be completed and properly armed or they cannot be defended, however devoted the garrison may be. The last storm almost entirely destroyed the works at Mulberry Island Point, on James River. The work is in sight of the enemy. Negroes have deserted from it and informed the enemy of its situation. They will attack it, I presume, as soon as they can make preparations, and, if they carry it, as they probably will, in its present state, a great disaster may happen. It was under the command of Captain Noland, late IT. S. Navy, then in the service of Virginia. He has resigned, as he could not obtain the rank of major in the provisional or volunteer service, and would have been ranked by the two captains, who had been under him, and who, from the nature of the service, cannot know the duties with which Captain Noland is familiar. 1 beg that Captain Noland may receive the rank of major, Provisional Army. I do not write in a spirit of complaint. I know the difficulties which surround the President, and, for one, fully appreciate them, and explain them to

others; but the great, if not insurmountable, embarrassments produced by the loss of the engineers at this moment and of the services of the Navy officers I am obliged to make known to the War Department.
Mr. St. John, of the engineers, under Colonel Talcott, is acting chief engineer in this department, employed as engineer by Colonel Talcott, and appointed by me to act as chief. His services are beyond price. His energy and talent exceed any that I have ever witnessed. No provision, I am told, is made for him, but he remains steadfast to his post, and I hope the President will have it in his power to bestow upon him the commission of captain in one of the corps. He is recommended in the strongest terms, I understand, both by Colonels Leadbetter and Talcott, and mine, in his favor, cannot be made as strong as his own merit. His loss will be irreparable.
I have just returned from below, having secured a supply of about 20,000 bushels of corn and other forage. A regiment of the enemy was routed within 3 miles of Hampton by a display of a few cavalry, under Captain Adams, Third Virginia Cavalry, and three shells from a section of Sands’ battery, commanded by Lieut. Walter H. Robertson, Virginia Artillery. One man of Captain Adams’ company was wounded in three places on our side, and 3 or 4 of the enemy killed and wounded.
The enemy made an unsuccessful attempt at ambuscade a few days after, within a mile of Hampton. Another party was flushed by a discharge of one of the rifle pieces of Maurin’s Louisiana Battery.
On the 22d instant, at 12 o’clock at night, two of enemy’s steamers fired forty-six shots on our picket guard on James River, just below Warwick, injuring no one. They must have been 3 miles from the shore, yet their shells reached at least half a mile inland. The shell appears to be percussion. I sent one to Colonel Gorgas on account of the excellence of the range and for examination.
There are but twenty-tour guns at Yorktown and Gloucester Point, both bearing on the water point. There are not more than an average of fifty rounds of ammunition per gun. I have exhausted all the means of representation in my power to obtain more guns and ammunition, and can do nothing more than to keep the fact before the Department, by stating it from time to time.
The engineers (Colonels Leadbetter and Talcott), before the fall of Port Royal, represented that fifty was the smallest number of guns by means of which a successful defense of this place could be expected.
I hope, in view of the great public interests involved and of the excellence of the officers themselves, that the President will have it in his power to commission all of the engineers who have been and are employed on this Peninsula.
The following are the names of the officers who have served and are serving with me:
Mr. A. L. Rives, captain, Virginia Engineers; I. M. St. John, chief of engineer department; E. T. D. Myers, captain, Virginia Engineers; Mr. Clark, on duty at Gloucester Point, as principal engineer; J. R. Boswell, first lieutenant, Virginia Engineers; M. Derrick, engineer, now at Mulberry Island Point; J. R. Crump, first lieutenant, Virginia Engineers; R. L. Poor, second lieutenant, Virginia volunteers; Mr. Morton, engineer, assisting Mr. St. John; Mr. Dade, engineer, assisting Mr. St. John, and W. Belleyens, second lieutenant Virginia volunteers.
All the above names, I presume, are handed in to the office of the Chief Engineer, Colonel Leadbetter.

Sir: I think Matthews and Gloucester will certainly be attacked very soon. I am informed of it through gentlemen who have left the Eastern Shore, and have heard the fact stated by the enemy. I have no doubt of it. There were six 32-pounders here on their way to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. They are of 45,000 pounds’ weight, and are the very pieces to be put in position at once on the coast of Matthews and Gloucester. Captain Page, of the Navy, has been ordered to send them back to Richmond by the Navy Department. Three were shipped yesterday and three to-day. Please see the Secretaries of War and Navy, and get them ordered back without delay. An inspection of the map will show you what disastrous consequences must follow their invasion, if successful, both to the people of that region and the operations of the Army of the Peninsula. There are but few men on the Gloucester side of York, and none can be spared from here. Something must be done at once or it may be too late. I shall order out all the negroes that may be necessary at once to build works, but must have the cannon, if possible. I have not been able to get the guns or the promise of them before; therefore did not think it right to take the hands from their owners to construct works which without guns would be useless. I am now in hopes that the immediate vicinity of the enemy may induce those in power to send me guns, particularly those six 42 pounders now on their return to Richmond. Please ask them to send me also as many artillery companies, with or without guns, as can be sent, and at least four regiments of infantry—all that you can get. I write the substance of the above by telegraph.
Very respectfullv, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Major-General, Commanding.

Executive Department, November 28,1861. This letter, received to-night, is respectfully referred to the consideration of the honorable Secretary of War. The letter is so earnest in its language, that I lose no time in laying it before you.
1 am, truly,
JOHN LETCHER.
Yorktown, November 26,1861. His Excellency John Letcher, Governor:
Please ask the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy to cause the order to Captain Page, of the Navy, to send back the six 42-pounder guns intended originally for the Eastern Shore of Virginia to be countermanded, and these guns ordered to be used for the defense of Gloucester and Matthews. These guns are now at West Point, en route to Richmond. Ask for four companies of artillery, with or without pieces; also, if possible, four regiments of infantry—as many as you can get.

JNO. WTTHEES, Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters Department of North Carolina,
Goldsborough, November 29, 1861.
General S. Cooper,
A djutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va,;
General : In accordance with Special Orders, No. 240,1 have ordered Colonel Jordan’s regiment of North Carolina volunteers to proceed to Eoanoke Island.
Under instructions from these headquarters, dated the 11th ultimo, Brigadier-General Hill assumed command of the forces upon that island, as being included in his district. Brigadier-General Branch has relieved Brigadier-General Hill in command of the District of the Pamlico.
Having more than once addressed the Department on the subject of establishing another district in the Department of North Carolina, I renew the subject at this time with some diffidence; yet the removal of Brigadier-General Hill and the appointment of a successor of less experience makes it advisable that I should represent the necessity of a division of the district now commanded by Brigadier-General Branch. General Hill, with all his activity, was never able to make a tour of his command in less than fifteen days, such is its extent coastwise. As it is impossible that one officer can give proper attention to the whole district, I beg respectfully to recommend that it be divided, and that a district be formed out of it and a small part of the District of the Cape Fear, embracing the country along the coast from New Eiver to the Neuse Eiver, including the waters of the latter. Within the limits of the proposed district there are now stationed three regiments of infantry, five companies of artillery, three of cavalry, and a number of local companies, and within the remaining part of the District of the Pamlico there are four regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and a number of local companies; quite troops enough in either to require the entire attention of a brigadier-general.
Permit me to recommend that Col. Eeuben P. Campbell, of the Seventh Eegiment of North Carolina State troops, be appointed a brigadier-general, and assigned to the command of the proposed district, which may be denominated the District of the Neuse. Colonel Campbell resigned his captaincy in the Second Dragoons upon the secession of North Carolina, and was appointed to his present command, in which he ranks next after Colonel Bradford, who is the senior colonel in the State service.
Hoping that these suggestions and recommendations will meet with favorable consideration, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. C. GATLIN,
Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Richmond, Va., December 5,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Dayis, President G. S. :
Sir: You did me the honor to request that I would address you a note, by way of memorandum, on the subject of want of guns at the mouth of York River. I therefore present the following statement:
1st. There are twenty-six heavy guns at the mouth of York River, to defend the entrance, and four looking up the river to fire upon ships, should they pass the mouth.
2d. Three rifled pieces, constituting a part of the above, have about 100 rounds of ammunition each, the rest about 46 rounds each.
3d. The chief engineer, Colonel Leadbetter, and Colonel Talcott, Chief Engineer of State of Virginia, having inspected the work, at my request, a month since, state that fifty is the least number of guns with w hich a successful resistance can be anticipated. It will be seen that I have but twenty-six for defense against an approaching enemy. The minimum required is therefore twenty-four guns, and there should be 100 rounds (the usual allowance is 200) of ammunition to each gun.
I reported the opinion of these distinguished engineers to the Adjutant-General about a month since and made the proper requisitions, but neither the guns nor the ammunition have been furnished, except two rifled guns, which are included in the number above reported. The Secretary of War has promised five, to be forwarded within a few days. I have the honor to request that twenty-four guns of the heaviest caliber, with 100 rounds of ammunition to each gun, being the minimum recommended by the engineers, be ordered to York town as soon as they can be got ready; six to be furnished to Captain Page, of the Navy, at Gloucester Point, and two to Captain Maury, of the Navy, at the naval battery at Yorktown, by the Navy Department, and the rest, eighteen, including those ordered by the Secretary of War, to be furnished by the Ordnance Department, with their carriages, and without delay.
The President is so thoroughly acquainted with the subject, that I will not fatigue him by repeating the urgent reasons, already given him verbally, for this immediate supply.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Major-General, Commanding.

Richmond, December 6, 1861. Major-General Huger, Commanding, c£c., Norfolk, Pa.;
Sir : The Secretary of War directs that you proceed as fast as possible to erect bomb-proof batteries at Sewell’s Point and at all your other batteries not already provided with such proofs, according to the iflan herewith inclosed. He also desires you to report which of your batteries are and which are not now provided with bomb-proofs.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. H. CHILTON", Assistant Adjutant-General.
Williamsburg, December 7,1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
I have received reliable information from Old Point that Yorktown will be attacked within a week by 40,000 troops, by land and water. All told, I have only 11,000 troops on the Peninsula fit for service, and require more troops, if possible. I request that Colonel Armistead’s regiment be sent to Gloucester Point, as the citizens in Richmond can guard the prisoners. 1 have also requested the governor to call out the militia of the counties about Richmond. Heavy re-enforcements of infantry and a large force of cavalry have been landed at Old Point.
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Major- General, Commanding.
Yorktown, December 8, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
I have information from an eye-witness of undoubted reliability that there were 10,000 men on parade at Newport News yesterday and troops were also landed there to-day. As I telegraphed to-day, I have not the slightest doubt of an attack by overwhelming force. They report 40,000 men. I am making the best arrangements I can to receive them, and feel assured that McClellan’s plan is to keep an army occupied at Manassas whilst he makes his real attack here. No doubt the heaviest fleet the enemy can possibly bring will also attack us by sea. We have an average of about 50 rounds per gun, which will last us at the longest not more than five hours. I have had a meeting of most of the colonels to-night, and have taken the line of the Warwick River, which I had previously prepared in some degree, the flanks of the front line being exposed to shipping, and therefore could not be defended without heavy re-enforcements. I think I can arm 1,500 men, if they are sent me, with the muskets of the sick and absentees. Please say if my telegram that Yorktown is to be attacked by 40,000 men by land and water has been received. It comes from a source in every way reliable. Our chances are these: The ships may be beaten oft' and the land forces of the enemy be defeated, or the ships may succeed and the land forces be defeated. In either case we are safe. If the attack by the ships be on York River or James River, and the lower batteries are passed, the troops for the defense of Williamsburg will proceed immediately to that place. Those to constitute the garrison of Yorktown could not probably hold out long without a sufficient supply of ammunition. The number

of troops in Yorktown in that case would be about 3,500. We will do our best to defeat the enemy, but it is proper that the facts should be made known to the Department.
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Major-General, Commanding.
Richmond, December 9, 1861. General J. Bankhead Maoruder, Yorktown:
Your dispatches received. It is not believed that any such forces as are represented to you can possibly be within the enemy’s line. The unarmed regiment ;you desire will be sent to receive the arms you have at your disposal. It is quite impolitic to call out an unarmed militia, and no call for them can be sanctioned. We have no news whatever of any fleet at Fort Monroe threatening your department, but are glad to find that you are vigilant and hopeful.
J. P. BENJAMIN,
Secretary of War.
Richmond, December 9, 1861. General J. Bankhead Magruder, Yorktown, Ya.:
Sir : Your requisition for additional forces has been received through the telegraph. You have just returned from this city, where you passed some days, and must have been satisfied of the extent of our meaus and wants. This is the only answer that can just now be made to your requisition; but it is proper to say in this connection that, in communicating your wants to this Department, it is deemed unsafe to employ the telegraph at this time. They had better be conveyed by express and uith caution.
Very respectfully, &c.,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
P. S —The Twenty-third Regiment of Georgia Volunteers is ordered to report to you; then to be armed as you have suggested.
Yorktown, December 11, 1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:
I can properly arm 2,000 men. The works at Jamestown Island are left without defense by infantry, and those at Williamsburg have neither infantry nor artillery to defend them, as all the artillery except three guns is in front on field. The call I made for militia would not produce probably more than 1,000 men. Many of these would be armed with shot-guns. I want them to hold the works at Spratley’s, at Jamestown, and at Williamsburg, so that if the enemy should pass our posts below, on James River, he may find these works occupied; otherwise he would of course occupy our own works in our rear. I cannot but think it hard that I am. not permitted to call upon and arm the posts in defense of the country. This description of troops will do well behind breastworks. I beg that the Twenty-second Georgia Regiment, promised me, may be sent without delay. If there are any regiments in Richmond without

arms, please send them to me. I have field artillery here not manned, field light guns, three 12-pounders and three 24-pounder howitzer guns. If there are artillery companies in Richmond waiting for light batteries, please send me two, at least, and I will give them guns and horses. I am in immediate want of five. I am not surprised that our batteries are taken by the enemy when we cannot get artillerists to serve them, and when infantry are drilled as artillerists they are frequently ordered away and new infantry placed at the guns, as was the case with the two Alabama companies recently ordered away from here. I had to substitute two Mississippi companies of Taylor’s battalion for them. I hope the President will authorize the governor to call out the militia asked for, as the objection seemed to be a want of arms, which I can in a great degree remedy.
Bespectfully, your obedient servant,
J, BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Major- General, Commanding.
Yorktown, December 11, 1861.
J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
Sir : In addition to the militia called for by me by telegraph to the governor, I think I can also arm such of the regiments from Richmond as cannot bring arms with them. I have placed in depot at Williamsburg and Jamestown Island about twenty days’ rations each for 10,000 men. If I am forced from below by overwhelming numbers I am sure that with the small number of troops I now have Yorktown would soon be invested, and I doubt of its being able to hold out long after the ammunition of the large guns is exhausted. Though I think we shall make a strong fight, perhaps drive them entirely off, they will bring against us their Port Royal ships of war and all others they may have. As it will take some time for the militia to assemble, I hope they may be ordered out at once. I have the honor to request that General Cooper will cause a telegram to be sent to Savannah to know, if possible, whether the Wabash and Susquehanna are still on the waters of South Carolina or Georgia. From the magnitude of the naval preparations, and especially from the size of the ships, I may infer on which river— York or James—the attack will be made.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGBUDER,

Yorktown, December 11,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General C. S. Army:
General : Having received a circular from the governor of Virginia directing the colonels of militia to respond to the call of any of the Confederate generals, I have called into the field the militia of Charles City, James City, and New Kent $ those counties being in my department. I have done this because, in consequence of the large number of sick and absentees and the necessity of operating with my whole force in the lower country, Jamestown Island and Williamsburg have been left for the present without any infantry garrison. I have also been informed by the adjutant-general of the State of Virginia that the Nineteenth and the One hundred and seventy-ninth Militia Regiments, city

of Richmond; the Thirty-third, Henrico; the Seventy-fourth, Hanover, and Twenty-third and One hundred and ninety-seventh, of Chesterfield, will be added to the above. I have supposed that the course pursued by the governor in authorizing the calling out of the militia had met with the approbation of the Department, as the services of these troops are absolutely necessary on the Peninsula. I beg that this call may be sanctioned by the Department. I think I can arm all those who may come without arms.

Headquarters First Brigade,
Smith field, Va., December 14, 1861.
To the Hon. Secretary oe War:
Sir : In every respect the battery at Hardy’s Bluff is the most important of the defenses on James River in this vicinity. It is supported, nevertheless, by the very inadequate force of five companies, which number only 350 in the aggregate. Of these, one company, and that the largest, is detached a distance of some 2 miles, to protect a work at Stone House wharf. Under these circumstances I beg leave respectfully to recommend that the force at Hardy’s Bluff be increased by the addition of five companies, so as to constitute a full regiment. The officer in command, Lieut. Col. F. H. Archer, is a soldier of experience, ability, and the most zealous devotion to the cause. If it were admissible, I would venture to suggest that his services already entitle him to promotion. The suggestions I presume to offer in this communication are prompted by a deliberate conviction of public necessity.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

men to you, one of wliom will bear this communication. This step is not taken from an ignoble desire to avoid the responsibility, but from my knowledge of the extent of the disaster which must ensue if the enemy shall be able to penetrate the country by this route. My left flank, which I had hoped would by this time have been made secure, is entirely exposed, and I cannot possibly prevent the enemy landing on it in any force he may choose. I have neither the guns to mount there nor the works to put them in. The latter have not been commenced, for I knew I could not get guns to place in them even if finished. There is not time now to erect them for any immediate defense. It must, therefore, be defended by troops, and I have not troops in numbers sufficient for that purpose, at the lowest calculation. I venture to suggest that perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 volunteers might be temporarily ordered to me from North Carolina, as that State must be deeply interested in the results here. With these I could defend, I feel assured, successfully this flank, and with the few militia I asked for, and whom I could arm, I could man the works at Williamsburg and Jamestown, and make the Peninsula secure against a land attack. As guns were made they could be furnished for this place and the James River, and we could then defy the Federal Government in this quarter.
I beg to commend the gentlemen, Col. Hill Carter, Colonel Randolph, chief of artillery, and Mr. St. John, chief engineer, of the latter of whom I spoke to you when in Richmond, to your kind attention.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

Executive Department,
Raleigh, A. <7., December 16, 1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Confederate States:
Sir: The possession of Hatteras affords the enemy a position or nucleus to form expeditions, almost without observation, to radiate to different points, even in opposite directions. To be in front, we must be in constant occupation and vigilance of the entire circumference of two large inland sounds. The sounds may be suddenly and at any unexpected time filled with a superior and overwhelming force of gunboats and steam-tugs, so that their navigation for any purpose is very hazardous and rash 5 and yet both of these sounds, with all their tributaries and seaport towns, are under the command of one brigadier-general.
A glance at the map will satisfy you it is too extensive a command even if it were readily accessible, but the precarious navigation of the sounds not only separates the command, but requires a circuitous inland route for either officers or their orders. Let me therefore respectfully ask of you to divide our coast defense (now two divisions) into three or more.
An examination of the map, or any further inquiry into this subject, will satisfy you of the propriety of this suggestion.
In connection with this subject I will invite your special attention to Roanoke Island, which separates the two sounds. Here are the fortifications and batteries on the west of the island to prevent the passage of the enemy from Hatteras or Pamlico into Albemarle.

## p. 712 (#720) ############################################

﻿712
OPERATIONS IN N. C. AND S. E. VA.
[Chap. XIII.
The channel in front of the batteries is 3J miles wide, with no obstructions to aid the guns in battery, and any fleet that can navigate the sound can run this channel (certainly in the night) without being hurt by the guns. It was understood that this was to have been done immediately after the fall of Hatteras, but it is yet so imperfectly done as to amount to no protection. A little promptness may even now effect much; for the possession of Albemarle Sound would entail one of the heaviest calamities of the war, not only to North Carolina, but would cut off Norfolk, and secure its capture or starvation. The direction of a superior engineer officer at Roanoke Island for a few weeks might now render the most material service of the war.
My favorite idea of defending the towns, rivers, and sounds on our coast was to recapture Hatteras. I don’t think there has been a day since its capture that 3,000 men (selecting the opportunity) could not have retaken and destroyed itj and in lieu of its recapture it is feebly and insufficiently guarded by 15,000. Having failed to impress these views on the various commanders, I must now urge the fortification of Roanoke Island to defend one-half of the exposed territory; and it is necessary for the superintendence of a separate command, as the other positions on Pamlico require, and generally obtain, the attendance and vigilance of the commanding officer.
Most respectfully, yours,
HENRY T. CLARK.
Yorktown, December 17,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Sir : I have this moment received information (of the truth of which there is no doubt) that a larger number of troops than have ever been at Fort Monroe is now there, under orders to march up the Peninsula at a moment’s warning. My informant does not know for what signal they are waiting, but I feel assured it is the appearance of the fleet trom Annapolis at Yorktown. I deem it important to communicate this.

II. The commanding general has the honor to announce to the garrison of Yorktown that, after a minute and most rigid examination of the defensive works at this post, he has entire confidence in their ability, when defended by the gallant soldiers of our Confederacy, to resist the most powerful attacks of the enemy with any number of ships. The enemy cannot succeed in getting possession of our works under any circumstances whatever.
The commanding general, therefore, congratulates the troops on the prospect wffiich the expected sailing of the enemy’s fleet from Annapolis affords them of repulsing an insolent foe, whose object is to invade our land and destroy our homes.
There is much more apparent than real danger from an attack by skills, and the gallant manner in which the attempt on Pensacola was

defeated by our comrades there, as well as the state of the works here, justilies the confident expectation of the commanding general of a result still more glorious to our arms. Should this fleet turn its guns against another point, our brother soldiers elsewhere will esteem themselves fortunate in having the opportunity to drive them from our waters.
At the signal which has been fixed upon by General Rains, the commanding officer of the garrison, the men will repair promptly to their several posts. The batteries will be kept in a constant state of preparation, shot will be ready heated in the furnaces, and those intrusted with the important duty of ascertaining the approach of an enemy and giving the alarm will exercise the utmost vigilance to insure its successful performance. It is recommended to the commanding officer of the post to cause the men to retire at an early hour, for a few nights at least, and to be stationed at their posts one hour before daylight. This arrangement is suggested to avoid, as much as possible, fatiguing the garrison.
The commanding general will station himself in the midst of his troops, and, having the greatest confidence in their gallantry, again congratulates them on their approaching triumph.
By command of Major-General Magruder:
HENRY BRYAN, Assistant Adjutant-General.

General S. Cooper:
Sir: In answer to my application to him, Major-General Huger informs me that he has referred to you the whole matter of my calling out the militia in the counties on the south side of James River. I have now the honor to state that as this militia is required to defend the works at Jamestown Island and Williamsburg, which they can quickly reach, I have directed that, by virtue of the authority granted me by the governor of Virginia, I will order the commanders of this militia to hold their forces in readiness to march at a day’s notice to the above-named posts, which are almost without garrisons. I understand from Col. George W. Randolph that the President has sanctioned the ordering out the militia for the purpose above mentioned. This will make those works secure, I think, against any attempt by James River.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Cooper, Adjutant-General G. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I have been able to strengthen this work (Yorktown) greatly within the last week by bringing guns from other points where they were in my opinion less needed. I stated by telegraph, as I state to the troops in the inclosed order,* that I think
See p. 712.

## p. 714 (#722) ############################################

OPERATIONS IN N. C. AND S. E. VA.
[Chap. XIII.
the defenses of this place will be successful against any ships the enemy can bring to attack it. At the same time I think it proper for me to state, in order that the Department may not misunderstand me, what I could not state in orders or by telegraph, that I think the enemy, if he be persevering, may dismount some of the guns and may exhaust our ammunition, and therefore may pass up the river; but he cannot take the place by water, even if he silence our guns by exhausting our ammunition or by dismounting them, if the men will light to the last, as I have no doubt they will. I therefore say, that whilst I hope guns and ammunition may be sent as soon as they can be spared, I entertain a confident belief that, strengthened as the works have been within a few days past, they will resist successfully any naval attack the enemy can bring against them at this time.
I have also strengthened my advanced line and left flank, caused the sick to be sent to the rear, established depots for the heavy baggage on the second line, and ordered all my available troops to the front line in light marching order, to give him battle there, without yielding an inch of ground to the west of that line. This is the line I originally intended to defend, and this decision is taken in opposition to the advice of some of my best officers. I believe it affords, however, a greater chance of success, as the country east of that line affords better fighting ground than that west of it. I have ordered the troops into winter quarters on this advanced line, and will keep them there, I hope, whatever may happen. Bethel, the most advanced position, is held by about 1,000 men. Two regiments, looked upon as part of the garrison of Yorktown, are on the left flank of the second line, and one regiment on its right, where it has always been. If it had been convenient to have sent more troops it would have been safer,- indeed, it would have been only ordinary prudence to have done so. But I am satisfied that the Government has done its best to sustain me and I will omit no effort to insure success, whether the enemy attacks me now or hereafter. I send a copy of my order of battle, which I have only communicated to the commanding officers and directed them to keep as private as possible; also a copy of an order to the troops of the garrison here. As I expect the attack here first, I remain here. When it is repulsed, should there be a land force, I shall command in the field. I learn that the militia from the vicinity, especially from the south side of James Kiver, can soon be brought to Williamsburg, where the works are without a garrisop, and I shall, therefore, content myself with directing them to be held in readiness to march, if necessary, to that place, the commanding officers to report the number of the militia and the number of arms they can bring with them. In the mean time I shall cause such arms as are not in use in regiments to be deposited there, with ammunition and provisions, to be in readiness for them. I have armed some militia under Col. Hill Carter, and stationed them at Jamestown Island. As soon as the sick sent to Richmond shall be sufficiently recovered I will thank you to have them sent in squads of 8 or 10 to join their regiments. I learn this morning, since writing my order of battle the day before yesterday, that 6 regiments left Fort Monroe very recently—destination unknown.
There are now forty-three guns at this place and Gloucester Point bearing on the water side, being seven less than the minimum prescribed by the engineers.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Major-General, Commanding.

General S. Cooper:
Sir: I am informed that negroes can be hired by the year for $100 each, the Government agent giving bonds, payable at the end of each quarter. I have pressed negroes because the Government could not hire them heretofore. Now that it can hire them, I would by all means recommend that it should be done—100 for Gloucester Point and 500 for the Peninsula, exclusive of the quartermaster’s department. Without this I am sure the works ordered by the Government and those that in the opinion of the engineer are necessary to secure the works already ordered will not be completed and made safe. I will forward a request of the acting chief engineer to-morrow on this subject; but no time can be lost, as the day of hiring is the 1st of January next. The quartermaster’s department alone would require a large number. This plan will not interfere with the farmers, and will be cheaper in the end to the Government. Colonel Bandolph and Mr. St. John, the former being chief of artillery and the latter chief engineer here, concur with me in opinion as to the propriety of this course. I beg an answer by telegraph.
I am, sir, very resx)ectfully, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Department of North Carolina,
Goldsboroughy January 3, 1862.
General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va. :
General : The current report of another fleet being about to sail South induces me to draw the attention of the Government to the want of troops in this department.
Since the 1st of December two regiments of infantry and a battery of artillery have been sent from Wilmington to South Carolina and one regiment of infantry from Washington to Boanoke Island, thus decreasing the force nearly 3,000 men. To replace this force the governor can furnish but some 800 well-armed effective men. Two other regiments are in camp, but are very unhealthy and without arms.
Should any point on the coast be attacked, I shall not be able to concentrate, without unreasonable delay, any other force than that serving in the immediate vicinity, as I have no reserve. I must therefore beg that a reserve force be sent to this place, with a competent commander, and placed at my disposal.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. C. GATLIN, Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Yorktown, January 3,1862.
General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General:
About 300 of the enemy’s cavalry advanced to-day as far as Bethel, which is occupied only by a picket, and attempted to set fire to the wooden church, which is the only building there, but upon the appearance of our cavalry they retreated, and were followed some distance. I do not know whether this is a real advance or not. The papers s ate that the Minnesota, Commodore Goldsborough, belongs to Burnside’s fleet, which is now rendezvousing at Old Point. I judge by the draught of water of this frigate, and from the fact of their having four bomb vessels, that either Yorktown, James River, or Norfolk will be the point of attack. It will be well if the Patrick Henry and Jamestown remain as they are, between Harden’s Bluff and Mulberry Point.
I would respectfully suggest that the steamer from Newport News with the exchange of prisoners be not allowed to come above Hay’s Point battery, which is.our lowest battery on James River.
Your telegraph announcing the arrival of the fleet at Old Point has been received.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

General Cooper, Adjutant-General:
Just returned from inspecting left flank of position. Works advancing rapidly; hope to prevent a landing; will prevent an advance. Forty-seven guns now mounted here. Should the fleet now at Fort Monroe attack us, will beat it off. Bethel not occupied by us except by a picket ; only one building there, a wooden church, not burnt; the enemy in too great a hurry. *1 sent strong forces of all arms to Bethel and below; the enemy had retired to Fort Monroe and Newport News. It would be well to have the Teazer, if ready, join the Patrick Henry and Jamestown between Harden Bluff and Mulberry Island.

We have reliable information that the Burnside expedition at Fort Monroe is destined for Pamlico Sound and New Berne. The batteries at New Berne are slight, and manned with inexperienced volunteers, and there are only two imperfect regiments there. We have no arms for volunteers or militia. Will you send us troops from Richmond or some of our own regiments from James River % Can we have arms for three regiments from the recent arrival at Wilmington t

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Headquarters Department Op Norfolk,
Norfolk, January 6, 1862.
Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
Sir : In obedience to the orders of the Department of War, Brigadier-General Wise has assumed command of the military department assigned to him, and left here on Friday, 3d instant, to visit Boanoke Island and other points within his command.
As I have been fully occupied with my front, and the position of Boanoke Island has been without my control, I hardly know what to do to strengthen this important position (I consider it the kev to Albemarle Sound) until I get the reports of General Wise.
All the work that has been done there has been done by my direction, and with the assistance of the Navy (Commodore Forrest, commanding dock-yard, and Captain Lee, the executive officer, having aided me most materially) all the batteries have been erected, gun-carriages and ammunition supplied. I cannot see that any one else has done anything towards its protection, except the sending of two regiments of North Carolina troops there. Much of the work I recommended has been neglected. One very important thing—obstructing the channel—has yet to be done. I have now sent the means, and directed General Wise to prosecute the work with all vigor. I have dispatched all the most necessary supplies, but powder I have none to send.
I regret I had not the preparation of the defenses of this place during the last few months. With the disposition to a panic apparent in that section of the country, if the flotilla of the enemy now assembling under the guns of Fortress Monroe makes a dash at Boanoke Island, I do fear a stampede. As soon as powder can be obtained I must beg you to send me some.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. HITGEB, Major-General, Commanding.
P. S.—I beg to refer to my reports concerning the part I took in occupying Boanoke Island from the 31st August last.
Headquarters Department of Norfolk,
Norfolk, Va., January 7, 1862. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War:
In reply to your letter of 25th ultimo, informing me of the passage of an act by Congress allowing army rank to be conferred upon such officers of the Navy as are commanding batteries on shore, I submit herewith the names and rank of such officers, viz:
1.	Commander B. F. Pinkney, commanding Fort Norfolk and inspector of batteries, to rank as lieutenant-colonel.
2.	Commander Charles F. McIntosh, commanding Fort Nelson, lieutenant-colonel.
3.	Commander W. L. Maury, commanding SewelPs Point battery, lieutenant-colonel.

5.	Lieut. R. R. Carter, commanding Pig Point battery, major.
6.	Lieut. B. P. Loyall, assigned to Roanoke Island, captain.
7.	Bvt. Capt. J. S. Taylor, formerly lieutenant in the Navy, who has not been appointed in the Confederate Navy, but has received the appointment of second lieutenant C. S. Army and brevet rank of captain (a most valuable artillery officer), commanding Lambert’s Point battery, now ordered to Roanoke Island, to rank as major—he to resign his former commission in the Army.
The only other naval officer holding a commission in the Army is Bvt. Capt. Jas. F. Milligan, signal officer, who is second lieutenant C. S. Army and brevet captain. He was in the revenue service, resigned, and took service under the State of Virginia. He might retain his present commission, or be appointed captain, as considered best.
The three batteries at Cedar Point, Barrel Point, and Pagan Creek, lately in charge of Commander R. L. Page (relieved and ordered away), have at present no naval officer in charge of them.
The batteries at Day’s Point and Harden’s Bluff, James River, in First Brigade, have been in charge of naval officers. They were ordered there from Richmond, and have not reported to me. I would recommend a commander for rank of lieutenant-colonel, and lieutenant commanding battery the rank of major.
As the pay of the navy rank of these officers is more than they would receive in the rank above mentioned, I presume they would be paid (as the act refers only to rank) as heretofore, except Capts. J. S. Taylor and J. F. Milligan, who have no navy rank, and must receive the army pay.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. HUGER, Major-General, Commanding.
Headquarters Department of North Carolina,
Goldsborough, January 9, 1862.
General S. Cooper,
Adjutant-General C. 8. Army, Richmond, Va.:
General: I have received a communication from the adjutant-general of North Carolina of the 7th instant, informing me that the Thirty-third, Thirty-sixth, and Thirty-seventh Regiments of North Carolina troops were under orders for New Berne, and the Thirty-fourth for Wilmington, N. C. All these regiments, it is understood, have been or will be paid by the State to the 31st December, 1861. They are to be turned over to the Confederate service as soon as they arrive at their destination. Six companies of the Thirty-third went down last night, which, with the three now in Hyde County, make nine in the service. The tenth, I learn, is nearly completed. The other regiments will follow as fast as transportation can be provided. To avoid the necessity of making out pay rolls for a few days, cannot the transfer of these regiments be made to take [effect] from the 1st January, 1862 ?
1 learn that the Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth Regiments are fully and well armed, but the other two imperfectly so. All, I am informed, are considerably reduced in effective men by sickness, principally measles and mumps.
Very respectfullv, your obedient servant,
R. C. GATLIN, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Chap. XITL
C. S. S. Sea Bird,
Off Roanoke Island, January 10, 1862. Hon. S. R. Mallory, Secretary of the Navy:
Sir : I understand that it is contemplated to improve the navigation of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal. To carry out improvements, which will very much enhance the usefulness of the canal, I further learn that the co-operation of the Government is indispensable.
Being enabled to speak from experience, I feel justified in saying that without the use of the canal heretofore, supplies from and imperatively requisite repairs at Gosport navy-yard could not have been received or effected. The vessels composing the squadron under my command could not without regular supplies and effectual repairs have been kept together, and by consequence, acting dispersively, would have been prevented from periodically maneuvering in sight of the enemy, and thus up to this time deterred him from venturing within Pamlico Sound, the great reservoir of the waters of North Carolina this side of Cape Pear.
Although very great facilities have been afforded by the canal, through which every vessel of the squadron save one has repeatedly passed, the occasional lowness of the water, consequent upon prevalent northerly winds, has repeatedly caused delays highly detrimental to the service. I therefore most earnestly recommend the canal to your fostering care, the more so that a large portion of its stock will be confiscated by the Government, and submit to your better judgment a consideration of the proposed improvements.
I have the honor to be. your obedient servant,
W. P. LYNCH,

Department Headquarters,
Yorktown, January 10, 1862.
General S. Cooper, Adjt. Gen. G. S. Army, Richmond, Ya.;
Sir : The vedettes, as I am informed by an official communication from General McLaws, report that the enemy the night before last was sounding the Swash Channel above the mouth of the Warwick River.
I think it not improbable that an attempt may be made to land between Land’s End and Mulberry Island fort and to carry the fort from the rear. I believe that with the assistance of the ships of war and the fort under the command of Mr. C. St. George Noland, its present commander, late of the Navy, the attack, if made, will be unsuccessful.
I spoke to the Secretary of War on the subject of Mr. Noland’s commission, and recommended him also in writing. He is acting as commanding officer of this fort (naval battery it was), much to the gratification, I believe, of the captains who rank him; but as he is an officer of great merit and a gentleman of honor and delicacy, he feels the neglect of the Government acutely, and considers himself, as he really is, in a false position. I beg leave therefore to recommend him again to the favorable consideration of the Department, and, as he would have had high rank had he remained in the U. S. Navy, would suggest that the rank of lieutenant-colonel be tendered to him.
I have not the boat to send him which he needs, and respectfully request that an order be sent to the Quartermaster’s Dejmrtinent in Richmond to send him without delay a boat of the description he requires.
I am, sir, very respectfullv, your obedient servant,

His Excellency the President of the Confederate States : Dear Sir : I understand that my lines of defense are under discussion at Richmond. I know I can expect from you the justice to postpone any decision until I can report at length, which will be in a few days. In the mean time I will venture the remark that I have taken not only the best but the only way of successfully defending this Peninsula with the means at my disposal, and that its defense will be successful. I did not call out the militia, though at one time I had determined to do so, but merely requested to be furnished with the strength of certain regiments to prepare arms for them, which arms I could procure from the colonels of regiments, belonging, as they informed me, to their States. I only desired to prepare for the emergency of a landing in this Peninsula or on the Rappahannock, which I now think more probable, or for an attack on James River. These arrangements required time. I therefore anticipated the emergency. Colonel Randolph informed me that I was authorized by you to do this; that is, to call out all the militia I could arm.
Yery respectfully,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
