﻿PREFACE.
By an act approved June 23, 1874, Congress made an appropriation “ to enable the Secretary of War to begin the publication of the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion, both of the Union and Confederate Armies,” and directed him “ to have copied for the Public Printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order.”
Appropriations for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16, 1880, has provided “for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10,000 copies of a compilation of the Official Records (Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year ”5 and that “of said number, 7,000 copies shall be for the use of the House of Representatives, 2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, and 1,000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments.”
This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be obtained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.
The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:
The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with the correspondence, orders, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed, is to be accompanied by an Atlas.
In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &e., not embraced in the “reports” proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate) in chronological order.
The 2d Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners.

PREFACE.
The 3d Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specially to the subjects of the first and second series. It will set forth the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in-Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities.
The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and Confederate authorities given in that series.

Report of Capt. Nathaniel Lyon, Second U. &. Infantry.
Saint Louis Arsenal, May 11,1861.
Sir: In compliance with instructions from your office of the 30th ultimo, I accepted, swore in, and armed 3,436 men and 70 officers of the loyal citizens of Saint Louis, as a “ reserve corps,77 for the protection of Government property and enforcement of its laws, on the 7th and 8th instant, and should probably have still further proceeded in receiving further offers but for events to which I will now advert. The steamer J. 0. Swan arrived at Saint Louis on the night of the 8th, with a large supply of military stores, including, as I was informed, muskets, ammunition, and cannon taken on board at Baton Rouge, and there obtained from the arsenal. The boat arriving in the night, great industry was used to transport these stores during the night (and before being likely to be exposed in the morning) to the camp of what is called the State militia, and which is made up for the most part of what has for a long time been known as a body of rabid and violent opposers of the General Government, and who have, during this time, been a terror to all loyal and peaceful citizens.	*
Their extraordinary and unscrupulous conduct, and their evident design, and of the governor of this State, to take a position of hostility to the United States, are matters of extensive detail and of abounding evidence. Having appealed to the South for assistance, every appearance indicated a rapid accumulation of men and means for seizing Government property and overturning its authority. I accordingly foresaw that under the extraordinary measures of the governor and legislature of this State aggressions would soon commence against the General Government on the part of these opposers of it, and of all who were in such a state of hostilities, willing to support the State against the Government. Of this there can be no doubt, as also that the issue would be taken by the State as soon as she felt able to sustain it. It was therefore necessary. to meet this embarrassing complication as early as possible, and accordingly I proceeded yesterday with a large body of troops, supported by artillery, to the camp above referred to, and which is situated in the western part of the city, at what is known as LindelPs Grove, between Olive street and Laclede avenue, and arrived at 3.15 o’clock p. m., and demanded of General Frost, the commander, a surrender of his entire command. Copies of the correspondence are herewith inclosed.* Of the stores from Baton Rouge Arsenal, so far as understood, there were found three 32-pounder guns, one mortar, three mortar beds, and a large supply of shot and shells in ale barrels. All these artillery pieces were in boxes of heavy plank, and were addressed “ Tamoroa, care of Greely & Gale, Saint Louis,” u I. C. R. R.,77 to whom no deli&£?y was made, this being a guise to cover the movement, and

. Greely & Gale being known as strong XJnion men saved them from close scrutiny. No doubt many arms, the mortars corresponding to the beds, and other war materials were received, agreeably to numerous reports made, but which can be obtained only by a thorough search over the city. Of the material besides tents, baggage, camp equipments,, &c., left in camp by the troops, were 1,200 rifle muskets of United States manufacture, late model, .58 caliber; 6 field pieces, brass; 25 kegs of powder; from 30 to 40 horses, and several arm chests of arms understood to be like the 1,200 muskets mentioned.
During the surrender of Camp Jackson and their passage into our lines a mob attacked our force, a published account of which will be transmitted. The prisoners, some 50 officers and 639 men, were marched under guard to this post, previous to which Camp Jackson was taken possession of by two regiments of volunteers and two companies of regulars, under command of Captain Sweeny, who remained in possession all night, bringing the entire camp equipage and munitions of war into this arsenal this morning. To-day the prisoners were all released (with the exception of one captain, who declined this parole)—the officers on their parole of honor not to fight against the United States during this war, and the men on their oath to the same effect. You will see by the returns of an election of brigadier-general for the volunteer brigade raised here, that I have been elected to this office, which, so far as depends upon me, 1 have accepted, and the duties of which I am now performing under the authority of the President. This subject is submitted for such action as the Department may determine to be proper.
Since the foregoing was written. I have noticed among the stores taken from Camp Jackson were parts oi muskets, all separate, and apparently without ever having been put together, and were doubtless taken in this condition from the arsenal.
It is proper and gratifying to mention that Captain Callender, in charge of the ordnance, has not, either through punctilious exactions about forms and responsibilities or assumed monopoly of corps above the power of the Government itself, attempted to embarrass me, but, on the contrary, has cordially and most efficiently co-operated to advance the Government interests.
Col. F. A. Dick, of this city, who has to this time served as adjutant-general of the brigade of volunteers, will be the bearer of this, and visits Washington on business connected with the Government interests at this place.	•

Sir : I am constantly in receipt of information that you contemplate an attack upon my camp, whilst I understand that you are impressed with the idea that an attack upon the arsenal and United States troops is intended on the part of the militia of Missouri. I am greatly at a loss to know what could justify you in attacking citizens of the United States who are in the lawful performance of duties devolving upon them under the Constitution in organizing and instructing the militia of the

State in obedience to her laws, and therefore have been disposed to doubt the correctness of the information I have received.
I would be glad to know from you personally whether there is any truth in the statements that are constantly poured into my ears. So far as regards any hostility being intended toward the United States or its property or representatives, by any portion of my command, or, as far as I can learn (and I think I am fully informed), of any other part of the State forces, I can say positively that the idea has never been entertained. On the contrary, prior to your taking command of the arsenal, I proffered to Major Bell, then in command of the very few troops constituting its guard, the services of myself and all my command, and, if necessary, the whole power of the State, to protect the United States in the full possession of all her property. Upon General Harney’s taking command of this department, I made the same proffer of services to him, and authorized his adjutant-general. Captain Williams, to communicate the fact that such had been done to the War Department. I have had no occasion since to change any of the views I entertained at that time, neither of my own volition nor through the orders of my constitutional commander.
I trust that, after this explicit statement, we may be able, by fully understanding each other, to keep far from our borders the misfortunes which so unhappily afflict our common country.
This communication will be handed to you by Colonel Bowen, my chief of staff, who will be able to explain anything not fully set forth in the foregoing.	#

Headquarters United States Troops,
Saint Louis, Mo., May 10,1861.
Sir: Your command is regarded as evidently hostile towards the Government of the United States. It is, for the most part, made up of those secessionists who have openly avowed their hostility to the General Government, and have been plotting at the seizure of its property and the overthrow of its authority.
• You are openly in communication with the so-called Southern Confederacy, which is now at war with the United States $ and you are receiving at your camp, from the said Confederacy, and under its flag, large supplies of the material of war, most of which is known to be the property of the United States.
These extraordinary preparations plainly indicate none other, than the well-known purpose of the governor of this State, under whose orders you are acting, and whose purposes, recently communicated to the legislature, have just been responded to by that body in the most unparalleled legislation, having in direct view hostilities to the General Government and co-operation with its enemies.
In view of these considerations, and of your failure to disperse in obedience to the proclamation of the President, and of the eminent necessities of State policy and welfare, and the obligations imposed upon me by instructions from Washington, it is my duty to demand, and I do hereby demand, of you an immediate surrender of your command, with

no other conditions than that all persons surrendering under this demand shall be humanely and kindly treated. Believing myself prepared to enforce this demand, one-half hour’s time, before doing so, will be allowed for your compliance therewith.

Protest of Brig. Gen. Daniel M. Frost, Missouri State Militia.
Saint Louis Arsenal, Missouri, May 11,1861.
Ser: In accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, which have been existing for some years, and in obedience to the orders of the governor, on Monday last I entered into an encampment with the militia force of Saint Louis County, for the purpose of instructing the same, in accordance with the laws of the United States and of this State.
Every officer and soldier in my command had taken, with uplifted hand, the following oath, to wit:
You, each, and every one of yon, do solemnly swear tli^t you will honestly and faithfully serve the State of Missouri against all her enemies, and that you will do your utmost to sustain the Constitution and laws of the United States and of this State against all violence, of whatsoever kind or description, and you do further swear that you will well and truly execute and obey the legal orders of all officers properly placed over you whilst on duty: so help you God.
Whilst in the peaceable performance of the duties devolved upon me and my command under these laws, my encampment was yesterday surrounded by an overwhelming force of armed men, acting under the command of Capt. N. Lyon, Second Infantry, U. S. Army, and called upon by him through a written command (marked A) accompanying this.*
To which communication I replied in the following terms, to wit:
Camp Jackson, Mo., May 10,1861.
Sir: I never for a moment having conceived the idea that so illegal and unconstitutional a demand as I have just received from you would be made by an officer of the United States Army, I am wholly unprepared to defend my command from this unwarranted attack, and shall therefore be forced to comply with your demand.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
D. M. FROST,
Brig. Gen., Comdg. Camp Jackson, M. V. M.
Capt. N. Lyon, Commanding U. S. Troops.
My command was, in accordance with the above, deprived of their arms, and surrendered into the hands of Captain Lyon. After which, whilst thus disarmed and surrounded, a fire was opened upon a portion of it by his troops, and a number of my men put to death, together with several innocent lookers-on—men, women, and children.
My command was then marched as prisoners of war in triumph to this place. I am now informed, as I was at the time of the surrender, by the captain, that my command may be released upon the officers

and men giving their parole “not to take up arms or to serve in a military capacity against the United States during the present civil war.77
Against the whole proceeding of Captain Lyon, as well as against the terms of release, I most earnestly protest, tor the following reasons:.
That, in addition to the obligation of loyalty which rests upon every citizen, every man of my command now held as a prisoner has voluntarily taken an oath to sustain the Constitution and laws of the United States.
That, when my camp was attacked in this unwarrantable manner, and during the previous days of its existence, the only flags that floated there were those of the United States, with all the stars, and its fellow, bearing alone the coat of arms of the State of Missouri.
That, in addition to all this? on the morning before this attack was made, I addressed to Captain Lyon a communication, informing him of the proffer of services I had previously made of myself and of all my command, and, if necessary, the whole power of the State of Missouri, to protect the United States property, and assuring him that I had in no respect changed those views or opinions, either of my own volition or through any orders emanating from my constitutional commander.*
Under all these circumstances I appeal to you, as the chief representative of the United States in this department, for justice on behalf of those loyal citizens who are now held as prisoners of war, captured under and marching to their place of confinement with the flag of the Union flying over their heads. I ask that you will not put upon the command the additional indignity of requiring us to give our parole, when we have already given our oath in support of the Constitution, but that you will order our restoration to the liberties of which we have been illegally deprived, as well as of the property of the State and individuals, as the larger portion of the equipments have been purchased with the private funds of the individuals of my command, both officers and men.
I trust that such as have been so purchased will at least be restored to the proper owners. .

Report of Capt. Nathaniel Lyon, Second TJ. S. Infantry.
Saint Louis Arsenal, May 12,1861.
Sir : On yesterday I left to Captain Callender and Lieutenant Saxton the duty of receiving and arming about 1,200 men from the northern portion of the city, who on returning to their station were fired upon by a mob, which fire was returned by the troops, from which, all told on both sides, about twelve persons were killed, two of whom, so far as I am informed, were of the United States troops $ further particulars of which may be hereafter transmitted.
General Harney having arrived has assumed command of the department, and has ordered into the city all the troops of the regular service now here (except my own company) and four pieces of artillery.
It is with great delicacy and hesitancy I take the liberty to observe that the energetic and necessary measures of day before yesterday, and reported in my communication of yesterday, require persevering and consistent exertion to effect the object in view of anticipating combinations and measures of hostility against the General Government, and that the authority of General Harney under these circumstances embarrasses, in the most painful manner, the execution of the plans I had contemplated, and upon which the safety and welfare of the Government, as I conceive, so much depend, and which must be decided in a very short period.

Report of Capt Nelson Cole, Fifth Missouri Infantry.
Saint Louis Arsenal, May 16,1861.
Sir: Herewith I respectfully submit the report of an expedition under me in Washington County, Missouri.
Agreeably to instructions, I left this post last night at 10 o’clock with two companies of infantry, consisting of Company A, Fifth Regiment Missouri Volunteers, commanded by Capt. N. Cole, and Company A, Rifle Battalion, First Regiment Missouri Volunteers, Capt. L. E. Koni-uszeski commanding, with staff officers Surg. E. C. Franklin and Asst. Surg. S. H. Melcher, Fifth Regiment Missouri Volunteers, consisting of 176 men, rank and file.
Arrived at Potosi 3 o’clock a. m.; surrounded the town by a line of sentinels; posted sentinels around the houses of all persons opposed to the Government who had been active in driving from the town good and loyal citizens and threatening with death other residents of the place. At a preconcerted signal, the inmates of each house were simultaneously arrested, and confined in the court-house of the town, previously taken possession of by a detachment of my troops. The residences of the respective parties were diligently searched, but no arms of any amount were found. Arrested in all 56 men. Forty-seven took the oath of allegiance to the Government, and 9 were returned to this post as prisoners of war.
I next proceeded to visit two smelting furnaces, the owners of which have been recently engaged in furnishing lead to the enemies of this Government, and captured 100 pigs of lead; also seized 325 pigs of lead at the railroad depot; seized also a quantity of wearing material, partly manufactured into uniforms for disloyal troops. At 12 o’clock proceeded on our return to Saint Louis, stopping at De Soto, about 20 miles distant, where a large secession meeting was being held. Disembarking the troops, I found the meeting dispersed on our approach. Being informed that a body of mounted men, about 50 in number, were still hovering about the outskirts of the town, I dispatched a platoon of 40 men to capture them, if possible. On being commanded to halt they dismounted, fled to the woods, and we succeeded in capturing 15 horses; seized some fire-arms and a secession flag; hoisted the American flag in the town, and left 30 men, under command of First Lieutenant Murphy of Com-

JUNE 17, 1861.—Engagement at Booneville, Mo.
Reports of Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon, U. 8. Army.
Camp Cameron,
Near Booneville, Jfo., June 22, 1861. ^ Dear Sir: I have received the orders from the War Department including this State in the military department under your command. Prior to the receipt of these orders I had, in consequence of the proclamation of Governor Jackson, of this State, which seemed to me tantamount to a declaration, of war, ordered a movement of a portion of the troops under my command to Jefferson City and in the direction of Springfield, Mo., for the purpose of breaking up the hostile organizations which I had reason to believe had been formed in those parts of the State to resist the authority of the Government. On reaching Jefferson City with the force under my immediate command, consisting of the regular troops and the regiment of Colonel Blair, Missouri volunteers, I found that the governor and the State troops had retired to this place, and had collected together three or four thousand men.
As soon therefore as I was joined at Jefferson City by the regiment of Colonel Boemstein, Missouri Volunteers, I left that city under his command with three companies, and proceeded to this place with the balance of the regiment of Colonel Boernstein, the regiment of Colonel Blair, and the regular troops, consisting of Captain Totten’s battery and three companies of infantry, the whole command amounting to about 1,700 men. With this force I landed, on the morning of the 17th June, about 6 miles below Booneville, and about 2 miles below the camp of the enemy, and had proceeded a short distance in the, direction of Booneville when the enemy opened fire upon us. The action, however, lasted a very short time, and the enemy were soon routed, their camp taken, and the city of Booneville .occupied by our troops. I will in a few days prepare and forward to you a more detailed account of the affair.
I have ascertained to-day, from reliable and undoubted information/ that another camp of the State troops which had collected at Lexington, in this State, consisted of many of those who fled from this place and the force that had collected at Blue Mills to oppose the movement of troops from Leavenworth and Kansas City, and variously estimated from 5,000 to 6,000 men, broke up their camp yesterday, and started toward the south with the intention of* uniting with the troops said to be collecting in Arkansas to invade this State. The rumor which has been so long prevalent in regard to the contemplated movement from Arkansas under Ben. McCulloch appears to me to have assumed shape and consistency, and it is no longer to be doubted that such an enter-

prise is on foot. To meet it, I had already, before leaving Saint Louis, dispatched a large force, consisting of the regiments of Colonel Sigel, Colonel Salomon, and Colonel Brown, under the command of Brigadier General Sweeny, commanding the Home Guard in Saint Louis. I cannot speak with precision as to the amount of force under Ben. McCulloch, but I am disposed to think it cannot be less than 5,000 men, and all that I hear makes it much greater.
It is my purpose to order the force under Captain Sturgis and the volunteers with him from Kansas and Iowa to follow the retreating forces of the State from Lexington in the direction of Springfield, and to follow with all the speed I can, and as soon as I can procure transportation, another body of the State troops under General Parsons and Governor Jackson, who are retreating in the same direction through the town of Warsaw. I have hopes that the retreat of the party from Lexington may be cut off by the cavalry unde** Captain Sturgis, and that the party under General Parsons may be intercepted by the command which has already been to Springfield. But if these parties should be able to unite with McCulloch and the troops from Arkansas, it. will swell his numbers to 10,000 or 12,000 men $ and as it will be necessary for me to leave detachments at various points to secure my communications with Saint Louis, it will be necessary to have an additional force to repel the invading force from Arkansas, and I will therefore ask, if you approve the disposition of the troops made and contemplated by me, that you will order three regiments from Illinois to march out by the Southwestern Branch of the Pacific Railroad to Springfield. This route has already been secured and guarded, and the passage of troops can be rapid and safe, and when the force is concentrated at Springfield will, I trust, enable me to repel any force which may be brought from Arkansas.
Allow me to add that I think too much attention cannot be given to the necessity of re-enforcing the troops now in the southwestern part of this State, as I am persuaded that formidable preparations have been made by the enemy in that quarter.
Colonel Blair, who is on his way to Washington to attend the session of Congress, will see you and give you full explanations in regard to affairs here and in Missouri.

Booneville, Mo., June 30,1861.
Sir : I have been too much absorbed in unavoidable business to make a report of the recent operations of the troops under my command. The proclamation of Governor Jackson, of this State, on the 12th instant, calling for 50,000 men to war upon the United States, made it necessary for me to move up the river, in order to anticipate the collection of his forces where it appeared likely such collection would be made. I accordingly proceeded on the 13th instant from Saint Louis with the

light battery, under Captain Totten, Second Artillery 5 Company B, Second Infantry (my company); two companies of recruits for the regular service, under Lieut. W. L. Lothrop, Fourth Artillery; First Begiment Missouri Volunteers, under Col. F. P. Blair, jr.; nine companies Second Begiment Missouri Volunteers, under Col. Henry Boernstein, and advanced by boats to Jefferson City, where I arrived on the 15th about 2 o’clock p. m., and found the governor had fled and taken his forces to Booneville, where, so far as I could then learn, a large force was gathering.
Leaving Colonel Boernstein at Jefferson City, with three companies of his regiment, I proceeded on the following day (16th) towards this place, and reached a distance of about fifteen miles below here that night 5 and starting again early next morning, I came to within about eight miles, and then landed nearly all my forces, leaving one 8-inch howitzer, with an artillery party and Captain Bichardson’s company, First Missouri Volunteers, as guard to the three boats, and this party had instructions to advance within range for the siege howitzer of what was understood to be the position of the rebel camp, and to fire upon it. This was done with good effect. In the morning two companies of the Second Regiment Missouri Volunteers, under Major Osterhaus, Companies A and B, Captains Schadt and Kohr, were thrown forward as skirmishers with excellent effect. Company B, Second Infantry, under Sergt. Wm, Griffin; Captain Totten’s battery, two companies of recruits, regular service, under Lieutenant Lothrop; Colonel Blair’s First Begiment, and four companies of the Second Missouri Volunteers, under Lieutenant-Colonel Schaeffer, formed the order of column in march.
After about two miles’ march we met an advanced party of the rebel forces, which opened fire upon us, but soon fell back. To meet this resistance, the skirmishers already forward were collected to the right of our road. Company B, Second Infantry, was thrown out to the left, and opened fire. Two pieces of Captain Totten’s battery were brought into play, and several shots fired. In advancing from this point, Lieutenant Lothrop, with a company of artillery recruits, Captain Yates’ Company H, Missouri Volunteers, and one additional company from the Third Missouri Volunteers, were thrown forward to the right of the road, and in line with our advance.
After proceeding about one mile, the enemy was discovered in force. Company B, Second Infantry, on the left, was now supported by Company B, First Missouri Volunteers, Captain Maurice. The enemy, having shelter of a house (owned by Wm. M. Adams) and a thicket of wood behind it, held their position for a while, during which time our approach brought us on to high and open ground, and here most of our casualties occurred. Captain Totten’s battery here did effective service, and bur troops on both flanks steadily advanced. Captain Burke’s company, K, First Begiment Missouri Volunteers, now came forward on the left, and engaged the enemy. In falling back the enemy took advantage of sundry points to deliver a fire and continue retreating. This continued till we arrived above their camp, which was situated to our right, near the river, and which about this time was taken possession of by Captain Cole, with his company, E, First Begiment Missouri Volunteers, who had been sent to the right to extend our front.
Companies C, Captain Stone 5 A, Captain Fuchs 5 F, Captain Gratzj G, Captain Cavender, took part in skirmishing and relieving those first engaged. Two pieces of artillery were taken (iron 6-pounders). Considerable camp equipage and about 500 stand of arms of all sorts were taken. About 60 prisoners taken were released upon oath to obey the

laws of the General Government and not oppose it during the present civil troubles.
On approaching this city I was met by a deputation of citizens, asking security from plunder from my troops, to which I gave an affirmative response, on condition of no opposition to my entrance and occupying of it. This was promised, so far as in their power, and on reaching the town I required the mayor and city council to accompany my entrance.. A part of my command was now quartered in the city, and the remainder returned to the boats, now located opposite the fair grounds, at the lower side of the town. This fair ground had been taken by the State for an arsenal, and a considerable number of old rusty arms and cartridges were found.
Our loss consisted of 2 killed, 1 missing, and 9 wounded, two of whom have since died. The loss of the rebel force is not known.
The troops of Governor Jackson dispersed, but for the purpose of assembling at Lexington. This assembly, however, did not continue, and was broken up soon after, many persons, I am informed, returning to their homes, and a considerable portion going south, in expectation of meeting re-enforcements from Arkansas. It is certain that Governor Jackson, with an escort, has gone from here in that direction, and most of his military leaders with him. I had intended pursuit soon after the breaking up of the Lexington camp, but have been unavoidably delayed by the trouble of getting up a train here and by continued and heavy rains. I hope to start soon with about 2,400 troops and some artillery, and proceed to Springfield, and there conform to emergencies as they shall be found to exist. In the mean time I have given orders to have this river occupied, with a view to keep hostile forces from getting it under control.
Surg. F. M. Corayn, First Begiment Missouri Volunteers, and Maj. H. A. Conant acted as staff officers for me during the day with the utmost zeal and intelligence.*

Report of Capt. Thomas W. Sweeny, Second TJ. S. Infantry.
Headquarters Southwest Expedition,
Springfield, Mo., July 12,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to inform you that I left Saint Louis Sunday? June 23, with 300 men, and arrived at Eolla, the terminus of the Southwest Branch of the Pacific Bailroad, the same day, where I established a depot. I proceeded from that point the following day, and arrived at this place Monday, July 1, having established garrisons at various points along the route to keep my communications open.
After taking the necessary steps to make this my center of operations, I issued orders to Colonel Sigel and Colonel Salomon, the headquarters of whose regiments were at Sarcoxie and Neosho, to concentrate their forces and move in the direction of Carthage, where, I was led to believe from information received, Governor Jackson’s and General Rains’forces were encamped. In compliance with my orders, Colonel Sigel advanced with all his force, except one company left at Neosho, to the point designated, and at about 10 o’clock in the morning of the 5th instant engaged the enemy. The enemy, being vastly superior in numbers, completely surrounded our troops and attempted to cut them off. Upon receiving information of these facts, I hastily collected about 400 men, and within three hours after receiving the intelligence was on my way to relieve Colonel Sigel’s command. I fell in with the retreating column at Mount Yernon, Lawrence County, and prepared to give the enemy battle, who I learned from my scouts was advancing in great force. Having remained at Mount Yernon for two days, I took up my line of march for this place, fearing an attack on it from the combined forces of Jackson, Rains, Price, and McCulloch, whose troops I learned were about to form a junction on the Arkansas frontier, towards which the enemy retired from Carthage.
I have an effective force of 2,600 officers and men at this point under my command, and feel confident in my ability to hold until joined by General Lyon, who I learn is within two or three days’ march of me.
I am very deficient in ammunition for the eight field pieces attached to this command ; also for the .69-caliber rifle musket with which the principal part of my command is armed. I have repeatedly presented my wants in these particulars, and pressed them upon the attention of the authorities at the Saint Louis Arsenal without effect.
The inhabitants of this portion of the country are generally loyal, and since my arrival here I have organized several regiments of Home Guards, but they are very deficient in arms and ammunition. Mounted troops are much needed. Colonel Wyman’s regiment Illinois Volunteers is expected to arrive here soon.

Report of Col. Frrnz Sigel, Third Missouri Infantry (Union).
Headquarters Colonel Sigkel’s Command,
Springfield, ilfo., July 11, 1861.
Sir: After having arrived at Sarcoxie, 22 miles from Neosho, at 5 o’clock p. m. on Friday, the 28th of June, I was informed that a force of 700 to 800 men were encamped at Pool’s Prairie, about 6 miles south of Neosho, under the command of General Price. I also received a report that Jackson’s troops, Parsons in command, camped 15 miles north of Lamar, on Thursday, the 27th, and on Friday, the 28th, and that they were there first informed of Government troops being in Spring-field on their march to the West. Bains’ forces were reported having passed Papinsville on Thursday evening, the 27th, and being a day’s march behind Jackson on the 28th. I immediately resolved to march first against the troops at Pool’s Prairie, and then, turning to the north, attack the forces of Jackson and Bains, and to open my communication with General Lyon’s troops, who were said to have had an engagement on the 28th of June at Ball’s Mill, on the banks of the Little Osage Biver, about 15 miles north of Nevada City, and to whom I had sent several scouts, of which only one returned, but without bringing reliable intelligence.
Scarcely had our troops left Sarcoxie on the morning of the 29th, when I received information that the camp at Pool’s Prairie was broken up on the same morning, and that the troops had fled towards Elk Mills, 30 miles southwest of Neosho, in the direction of Camp Walker, near Maysville, which place is not far from the southwest corner of the State of Missouri.
It was now my duty to give all my attention to the northern forces of the enemy. Apprehending that they would try to find their way to Arkansas, I ordered a detachment of two companies and two pieces of artillery, under the command of Captain Cramer, to Cedar Creek and Grand Falls, to occupy the Military and Kansas line road, and to obtain all possible information relative to the northern troops of the enemy. I also ordered the battalion under Colonel Salomon, on his march from Mount Yernon to Sarcoxie, to unite with the troops under my command at Neosho by forced marches. As soon as this battalion had arrived, and our troops were sufficiently prepared, I directed them from Neosho and Grand Falls to Diamond Grove (7 miles south of Carthage), where they arrived at noon and advanced towards the north.
One company of Captain Hackmann I ordered to move from Mount Vernon to Sarcoxie. Captain Conrad, of Company B, Bifle Battalion,
Omitted as unimportant.

Third Regiment, I ordered to stay in Neosho as garrison, and for the protection of the Onion-loving people against bands of secessionists, but to retreat to Sareoxie if he should find it necessary. Company H, Captain Indest, was one of the two companies sent to Grand Falls, from which place this company had not returned when the battle commenced.
On the evening of the 4th of July, after a mafbh of 20 miles, the troops went into camp on the southeast of Carthage, behind the Spring River. It was now as much as certain* that Jackson’s troops, reported 4,000 strong, were about nine miles before us, their scouts swarming over the great plateau to the north of Carthage, and almost within our sight.
The troops under my command on the 5th of July who were engaged in the action of the day were composed as follows: Nine companies of the Third Regiment, with a total effective strength of 550 men; seven companies of the Fifth Regiment, numbering 400 men; two batteries of artillery, four pieces each. With these troops I advanced slowly towards the enemy, our skirmishers driving before them numerous squads of mounted riflemen, who* were observing our march. The baggage train followed our troops at a distance of about three miles.
After crossing Dry Fork Creek, 6 miles beyond Carthage, and advancing 3 miles farther, we found the enemy in line of battle on an elevated ground, gradually rising from the creek, and about one and a half miles distant. Their first line was formed in three regiments, deployed in line, and with proper intervals between them. Two regiments, forming the wings, consisted of cavalry, the center of infantry, cavalry, and two pieces of artillery. The other pieces were posted on the right, and one on the left wing. The whole force within our sight may have numbered 3,500 men, besides a strong reserve in the rear.
As our advance guard was already engaged, I sent two pieces of artillery and two companies of the Third Regiment forward to assist them. One piece of artillery and one company of the Third Regiment of infantry I posted behind the creek, as a guard against movements of the cavalry towards our rear and our baggage. The remainder of our troops I formed in the following order: The second battalion of the Third Regiment, under the command of Major Bischoff, on the left in close column : next to them, four pieces of artillery; in the center, the Filth Regiment, in two separate battalions, under Colonel Salomon and Lieutenant-Colonel Wolff*; on the right, three pieces of artillery, under the command of Captain Essig, and to his right the First Battalion of the Third Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Hassendeubel.
When these dispositions were made, and after we had advanced a few hundred yards, I ordered Major Baekof to commence his fire with all the seven pieces against the enemy’s lines. The fire was answered promptly. I observed now that the two mounted regiments of the rebel army prepared themselves to turn our right and left. They moved by the flank, and, describing a wide circle, left great intervals between them and the center. I immediately directed the whole fire of our artillery against the right of the enemy’s center, so that in a short time the fire of his artillery began to slacken on this point.
I formed now a chain of skirmishers between our pieces, ordered two pieces of Captain Essig’s battery from the right to our left wing, and made known to the commanders and troops that it was my intention to gain the heights by advancing with our left and taking position on the right flank of the enemy’s center. In this critical moment, Captain Wilkins, commander of one of the two batteries, declared that he was 2 R R—VOL in

unable to advance for want of ammunition. NTo time could be lost. One part of the troops on the extreme right and left were already engaged with the mounted troops, and to advance with the rest without the assistance of artillery seemed to me a movement which could easily turn out into a deroute. The moral effect of the enemy’s mounted regiments behind our lines, although the real danger was not great, could not be denied. To lose our whole baggage was another consideration of importance. It was therefore with great mortification that I ordered one part of the troops behind Dry Fork Greek, whilst Lieutenant-Colonel Hassendeubel, with the First Battalion of the Third and a battalion of the Fifth Regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Wolff, followed by four pieces of Captain Wilkins’ battery, repaired to the baggage train to defend it against the projected attack.
The enemy followed slowly toward Dry Fork Creek. Captain Essig’s battery had taken position behind the ford, assisted by one company of the Fifth Regiment (Captain Stephani) on the left, and two companies of the Third Regiment (Captains Dengler and Golmer) on the right, whilst two companies of the Fifth Regiment (Stark and Meissner) remained as a reserve behind both wings. It was at this point that these troops resisted the enemy’s entire force for two hours and inflicted on him the severest losses.
Up to this time the rebellious flag had sunk twice amidst the triumphant shouts of the United States volunteers. Meanwhile the two large bodies of cavaliy had completely surrounded us, and had formed into line against our rear. They were posted behind a small creek, called Buck’s Branch, which we had to pass. To meet them, I left the position on Dry Fork, and ordered two pieces to the right and two pieces to the left of our reserve and baggage, assisted by parts of the Fifth and Third Regiments in column, under Colonel Salomon and Lieutenant-Colonel Wolff, whilst Lieutenant-Colonel Hassendeubel, with his well-known ability, formed three companies of the First Battalion, Third Regiment, in line, and in front of the baggage, against the cavalry. Behind these troops and baggage Lieutenant Schrickel, of the First Battery of Artillery, with two companies, was acting as a rear guard against the main body of the enemy, moving from Dry Fork. After one round of our whole line, the infantry moved in double-quick time towards the enemy, and routed him completely. His flight was accompanied by tremendous hurrahs of our little army.
The troops and baggage train crossed the creek, and retreated unmolested to the heights crowning the north side of Carthage before Spring River. Here they took position again. The enemy advanced slowly with his center, while he pushed forward his cavalry to turn our right and left, and to gain the Springfield road. As I thought it most necessary and important to keep open my communications with Mount Vernon and Springfield, I ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Wolff, with two pieces of artillery (Lieutenant Schaefer, Second Battery), to pass Carthage, and to occupy the eastern heights on the Sarcoxie road. Captain Cramer, with two companies (Indest and Zeis), had to follow him, and to guard the west side of the town against a movement of the enemy to wards this side. Our rear guard took possession of the town to give the remainder of the troops time to rest, as they had, after a march of 22 miles on the 4th and 18 miles on the 5th, been in action the whole day since 9 o’clock in the morning, exposed to an intense heat, and almost without eating or drinking. The enemy, taking advantage of his cavalry, forded Spring River on different points, spread through the woods, and, partly dismounted, harassed our troops from all sides, I therefore ordered the

retreat towards Sarcoxie, under the protection of our artillery and infantry, taking first position on the heights behind Carthage, and then at the entrance of the road of Sarcoxie into the woods 2J miles southeast of Carthage. From this place our troops passed unmolested to Sarcoxie. The losses of all the troops under my command on this day were 13 killed and 31 wounded. Among the latter, Captain Strodtmann, Company E, Third Regiment, and Lieutenant Bischoff, Company B, of the same regiment. The First Battery lost nine horses, the Third Regiment, Major Bischoff, one. One baggage wagon was lost in Carthage for want of horses to move it.
According to reliable information, the enemy’s losses have not been less than 350 to 400. One of their pieces was dismounted and another burst.
It is with the deepest regret that I must report the surprise and capture of Captain Conrad and his company of 94 men at Neosho on the 5th of July. Officers and men were released on oath not to bear arms against the Confederate States during the war.
With the greatest pleasure, and to do justice to the officers and men under my command, I must say that they fought with the greatest skill and bravery. Although more than once menaced in flank and rear by large forces of cavalry, and attacked in front by an overwhelming force, they stood like veterans, and defended one position after the other without one man leaving the ranks.
With the most sincere thanks, I acknowledge the services of the Fifth Regiment under their brave commanders and adjutant; they showed themselves as true friends and comrades of battle. And so did the artillery and their able commander, Major Backof, who, as well as Adjutants Albert and Heinrichs, assisted me during the whole day in performing the duties involved in my command..

Report of Brig. Gen. James S. Rains, Missouri State Guard ( Confederate).*
Hdqrs. Second Division Missouri State Guard,
July 20,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report to you the action of my division in the several engagements of the 5th instant.
About 1 o’clock on the morning of the 5th I received an order from your excellency to take up the line of march at 4 a. m. southward towards Carthage, assigning my command to the right front. My force consisted of the First Brigade, commanded by Colonel Weightman, of the First Cavalry. This brigade was composed of Capt. Hiram Bledsoe’s company of artillery (three pieces—one 12-pounder and two 6-pounders), 40 men, and Captain McKinney’s detachment of infantry, 16 men, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Rosser, of the First Infantry; Colonel Graves’ independent regiment infantry, 271 men; Colonel Hurst’s Third Regiment Infantry, 521 men, and Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane’s battalion of infantry, 350 men, being in ail 1,204 strong.
The cavalry brought on the field consisted of Companies- A and B and part of H of the Third Cavalry, 115 men, commanded by Colonel Peyton, to whom was attached the companies of Captains Stone and Owens. The First Battalion of the Independent Cavalry, 250 men, commanded by Colonel McCown; Lieutenant-Colonel Baughn’s [Yaughn] battalion of the Fourth Cavalry, 200 men, and Capt. Joseph O. Shelby’s company of Rangers, 43 men, making a total of 1,812 men. The remaining portion of my command, being unarmed, was used to present the appearance of a reserve corps and baggage guard. My division took up the line of march as ordered, and most of them without having prepared any breakfast.
About 7 a. m., having marched some 5 miles, our scouts reported the enbmy in force 3 miles in advance. I immediately went forward with some of my staff to reconnoiter their movements and examine the ground. Perceiving that they were descending a slope towards a creek skirted on both sides with timber, I sent orders to Captain Shelby, who was in the advance, to halt and detain the whole command out of view, hoping that the enemy would cross the creek, when I could oblige them to take position in the bottom, while I drew up my force on the height commanding it. My expectations were realized, and after the enemy had crossed the creek -I ordered Captain Shelby forward to check their advance. I then directed Colonel Weightman to deploy the brigade in order of battle on the ridge of prairie overlooking the enemy. This order was executed with celerity and precision, he placing Colonel Graves on the right, the artillery in the center, and Colonel Peyton to take position on the right of the First Brigade, and extend over their line as far as practicable towards the timber, the other division taking position on the left of my command. The ground upon which our army was drawn up was a high ridge of prairie, gently sloping southward, with undulations to a creek about one mile and a quarter distant. In front of our right was a large field of corn extending to the timber on the creek. The enemy, under command of Colonel Sigel, apparently about 2,000 strong, with seven piecevS of artillery, took up their position on the north side of the creek, about

three-quarters of a mile from the timber, and threw a few spherical-case shot at Captain Shelby’s company, which was ordered back to the main line. This movement, conducted in the face of both armies, was executed with a precision worthy of the parade ground.
I then sent this company to the extreme right, to reconnoiter the timber and examine for a crossing. The action commenced by the enemy opening a heavy fire from their battery. This was promptly responded to by the artillery of General Parsons’ command, which had unlimbered on the left of my division. Captain Bledsoe, under the direction of Colonel Weightman, then opened a steady and well-directed fire upon the densest of the enemy’s masses, forcing them to take refuge in the depression of prairie and finally to retire some 200 yards, when Colonel Weightman promptly and gallantly advanced his whole brigade in battle order and reopened his fire from Captain Bledsoe’s guns. By this time I had led the cavalry on the right through the corn field with a view of our flanking the enemy, or, if the ground was suitable, of charging their battery.
The enemy opened with some execution a well-directed fire of grape and spherical-case shot upon our advancing column, which sustained itself with much gallantry, and Colonel Sigel, fearing that his army would be outflanked, and suffering very much from the rapid and well-directed fire from Captain Bledsoe’s battery, retired under cover of his battery across the creek.
Colonel Weightman, in his report, speaks in the highest terms of the coolness and steadiness of the First Brigade throughout this portion of the engagement, and I bear grateful testimony as to the eagerness with which the cavalry desired to charge over the most unfavorable ground. Our loss up to this time was very small.
Colonel Weightman, now joined by Colonel Hurst’s regiment, advanced, and perceiving the enemy posted on a ridge beyond the creek, unlimbered within 400 yards of the enemy’s battery and opened upon them with round shot and canister, while the infantry advanced to engage the enemy at close quarters. This point was severely contested and the loss great.
The officers of Captain Bledsoe’s artillery are reported to have most gallantly served their guns in person, two of them (Lieutenants Wallace and Higgins) after being wounded; the latter falling exhausted under the muzzle of his piece.
Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane, in the most gallant style, pressed forward with his command, and, aided by a portion of General Clark’s division, repulsed the enemy from their position.
Colonel Sigel again commenced a retrograde movement, and retreated across a prairie 5 miles to Spring Fiver, closely followed by the infantry and artillery. The cavalry under my command, joined by a regiment of General Slack’s division, commanded by Colonel Fives, endeavored to outflank them on the right, but the retreat was so rapid as to defeat our object. On nearing Spring Fiver we attempted to intercept the enemy’s crossing, but they again opened a heavy and destructive fire from their artillery, which compelled us to take a crossing higher up, and, pushing forward, endeavored to surround the town.
For the details of the actions of the First Brigade in their several contests for the city I refer you to the able report of Colonel Weight-man.
As I was enabled to reach the rear of Carthage, I dismounted the whole command, who eagerly pressed to the support of their comrades

engaged in town, and just* arrived in time to see the complete rout of the enemy.
Our loss in these engagements amounts to 44 killed and wounded.
Lieutenant-Colonels Ilosser and O’Kane and* Captain Bledsoe are favorably introduced to my notice by Colonel Weightman, and I take great pleasure in seconding his recommendation, and ask leave to add to the list the name of Col. Bichard H. Weightman as deserving a brevet for gallant and meritorious [conduct].
To the officers and men of my command I return my thanks for their gallant bearing and their dauntless zeal for the cause so dear to us all.
The great object of our march is about complete, and, though commenced under difficulties that discourage many, yet, with a column of veteran troops threatening our rear and powerful force of the enemy in front, we can congratulate ourselves on a victory which is but the prestige of our ultimate success.
To Colonels McMertre [McMurtry*?] and Woodard, Assistant Quartermaster Barkery, and others of my staff, I am indebted for their aid in conveying orders, and to my aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel Maclean, for his assistance in the disposition of the forces and arrangement of the line of battle.
The report of Colonel Weightman and other officers, along with the list of killed and wounded, is hereby attached and made a part of this report.*
I am, sir, with much consideration, your obedient servant,

Report of Col. Richard II. Weightman, commanding First Brigade, Second Division, Missouri State Guard.
Hdqrs. First Brigade, Second Division,
July 17,1861.
General : In obedience to your orders I have the honor to report the operations of my First Brigade of your division of the Missouri State Guards in the battles of 5th instant, and will of course strictly confine myself to its operations without mention of the actions of others, unless in cases where such men tion may be necessary to explain the movements, &c., of this brigade. The First Brigade on the day of the battles was 1,204 strong, composed as follows: Lieutenant-Colonel Bosser, First Begiment Infantry, commanding; Capt. Hiram Bledsoe’s company of artillery, three pieces (one 12 and two 6 pounders), 46 men, and Captain McKinney’s detachment of infantry, 16 men, and Colonel Graves’ Second Begiment of Infantry, 271 men; Colonel Hurst’s Third Begiment of Infantry, 521 men; Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane’s battalion of infantry, 350 men.
On the morning of the 5th of July, about 8 o’clock, while the‘Army of Missouri was on the march southward towards Carthage, about 10 miles from that place (your division in advance), I was directed by you to deploy my brigade in order of battle, to meet the enemy, more than

2,000 strong8, with eight pieces of artillery, then advancing to attack us. Accordingly I arranged the brigade in order of battle, Colonel Graves on the right, the artillery in the center, and Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane on the left. At this time Colonel Hurst was 3 miles in the rear with his regiment, which, having marched since 4 o’clock in the morning without breakfast, had, with my authority and of necessity, stopped to prepare a meal. I immediately dispatched a courier to the rear for him, and directed him to come forward at speed and take position on the right of Colonel Graves. You, general, with the remainder and greater portion of your command (composed principally of mounted men), while I was deploying, took position on the extreme right of the Army of Missouri. On the line thus taken by your division the other divisions formed as they successively came on the ground.
The engagement was begun about 8.30 o’clock a. m. by the enemy’s artillery, which opened a heavy fire of round shot, shell, spherical-case shot, and grape. This yas promptly responded to by the artillery of General Parsons’ division, four 6-pounders, which had unlimbered in gallant style immediately on the left of my brigade. Captain Bledsoe then opened upon the enemy a steady and well-directed fire, by my direction, aiming at the densest of the enemy’s masses, ceasing fire whenever the enemy, driven from their ranks, took refuge in depressions on the plains so as to be out of sight, and reopening upon them as they again showed themselves in masses, notwithstanding the fire from the enemy’s artillery was rapid and well directed, and continued for forty minutes. Our loss, owing to the fact that our line presented no depth to them, was small.
At this point Major Murray, of Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane’s battalion, had his horse shot under him by grape shot. The enemy then slowly retired for about 200 yards, halted, and commenced the engagement, when I advanced the whole line of the brigade in battle order, and reopened fire upon him by Captain Bledsoe’s guns, General Parsons’ artillery having by this time retired, as I learn, for want of ammunition. At this time the cavalry of your division, under your immediate command, was closing on the enemy’s left flank, and at the same time a large body of cavalry from some of the other divisions was threatening his right flank, and the enemy, after cannonading us but a few minutes, again retired under cover of the fire of his artillery, passing through the timber which skirted its banks, crossed Bear Creek, one of the tributaries of Spring Biver, about miles in rear of their second position.
Up to this time the engagement.had been in the open prairie, without shelter for the infantry or artillery of my brigade, who, being immediately in front of the enemy and in his line of attack, received the great severity of his fire. I cannot too much commend to your favorable notice the steadiness, worthy of disciplined troops, displayed by infantry and artillery of the brigade. Before the enemy returned the second time, Colonel Hurst, with his regiment, came forward from the rear at double-quick time, and took the position assigned him on the right of Colonel Graves. I again advanced in battle order the whole line of the brigade.
As I neared the timber, proceeding along the road I discovered the enemy through the openings through which the. road passed jrnsted in force on the brow of the hill on the opposite bank of the creek, distant about 400 yards, and only to be seen through the opening. At this exposed point I directed Lieutenant-Colonel Bosser to have the artillery unlimbered and to open fire upon the enemy, and at the same time I directed the infantry on either'wing of the brigade to pass into and

through the timber, and engage the enemy at close quarters. All these orders were promptly obeyed amidst a storm of grape. The artillery steadily unlimbered, and opened a carefully-aimed fire upon the enemy. Lieut. Col. T. H. Rosser in person, with the calmness of a professor of entomology examining a rare addition to his collection, aimed one of the guns, while the enemy’s grape shot tore up the earth and disabled men and horses around him. In the course of the cannonading at this point Capt. Hiram Bledsoe and Lieutenant Wallace, of the artillery, and Capt. F. M. McKinney, of infantry, all of Lieutenant-Colonel Rosser’s command, in person served the guns, in consequence of the number of men disabled, Lieutenant Wallace remaining at his post, though twice wounded in the leg.
At this point the artillery lost in wounded the gallant Lieut. Charles Higgins, seriously but not fatally wounded, who, shot down at the gun he was serving, gained his feet and continued the loading until completed, and fell exhausted under the muzzle of his piece; Lieutenant Wallace very slightly wounded, and 8 privates. Three horses were also wounded, and 4 killed.
Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane, with his battalion, upon the receipt of my order, advanced rapidly through a field, and on the skirt of the timber nearest to us fell in with the enemy, and aided by Captains Gaines’ and Kelly’s companies (General Clark’s division) and Colonel Burbridge’s regiment (General Clark’s division), engaged the enemy, and after a short conflict drove him through the timber across the creek back upon his main body. Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane had his horse shot under him, and suffered a loss of 2 killed and 20 wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel O’Kane makes honorable mention of Captains Hale and Yaughn, who rushed into the conflict, and also of Captains McElrath and Gray, and Lieutenant Taylor, commanding Captain Warren’s company—Captain Warren having been shot through the leg by a grape shot.
Responding with spirit and zeal to my order, Colonels Graves and Hurst threw their regiments into the timber on the right of the artillery, and advancing to the creek found it impassable on the direct line of attack at which they reached it, and, being forced to seek a ford at a point below, passed through the timber on the farther bank of the creek on the enemy’s left flank, but not until he was in the act of retiring. The enemy was a third time forced to retire.
By this time it was 2 o’clock p. m. The entire brigade, with the exception of Colonel Graves’ command, had been marching since 4 o’clock a. m. (Colonel Hurst’s regiment without breakfast), and I was proceeding to encamp the brigade upon the ground recently held by the enemy, the scene of their victory, when, learning that Colonel Rives, of General Slack’s command, with his regiment of cavalry, had engaged the enemy and needed support, I again called upon my wearied brigade to advance, to which they promptly responded $ but the enemy before our arrival had again retreated.
The brigade advancing crossed Spring River, and was passing through the timber on its banks, and was nearing Carthage, when the enemy from a concealed position opened upon us his artillery. I halted the artillery, and ordered the infantry regiments of Colonels Graves and Hurst to leave the road and pass through the timber and flank the enemy on his left. In obedience to the order, Colonels Graves and Hurst, with their regiments, passed through the timber to the right of the road, and arriving in town fell on the rear of the retreating enemy, but being uncertain of his identity, did not at once open fire on him. As soon, however, as it was made certain by a reconnaissance that it

﻿Chap. X.]	ENGAGEMENT NEAR CARTHAGE, MO.	25
was the enemy, and not our comrades in arms, Colonels Graves and Hurst, together with the infantry regiment of Col. John T. Hughes, of General Slack’s division, opened a heavy and well-directed fire upon the enemy’s infantry, throwing it into confusion and forcing it to retreat with great precipitation. The enemy’s artillery again opened their fire, to which our artillery, which I had brought up, responded, aided by two pieces of General Parsons’ artillery, which had by his order reported to me at this point. The enemy retreated on the Sarcoxie road, and was followed for a mile or two by our indefatigable artillery and infantry. Night put a stop to the conflict, and my brigade encamped in and around Carthage.
The battles of this day of victory for Missouri extended over a space of 10 miles, and were continued for twelve hours. They opened the communication between Missouri and her friends, and gave her access to arms and munitions of war.
In view of the magnitude of these results, so important to the cause of liberty, political and private, in Missouri, and also of the steady courage of the raw levies of Missouri in face of a disciplined enemy, the 5th of July last past is a day to be remembered.
General, it may be safely said that this brigade, your whole division, and the whole Army of the Missouri engaged in that day’s battles have done the State some service.
I have no means of computing the loss of the enemy. The loss of this brigade is as follows: Killed, 2; wounded, 38; total casualties, 40.
Col. B. M. Stith, brigade quartermaster; Maj. George W. Morris, of Olay County, aide-de-camp, adjutant of the brigade; Maj. Thomas M. McCrowder and Sergt. Maj. J. Thomas Whitfield, all of my staff, deserve honorable mention for the zeal, discretion, and gallantry with which they conveyed my orders in different parts of the field wherever duty led throughout the day. Capt. Emmett MacDonald, volunteer aide; Maj. Charles C. Martin, and Mr. Joseph Donaldson, in like manner, rendered valuable service. To Capt. Charles S. Eogers, of your staff, I express my obligations for valuable information of the enemy’s movements, derived by him from personal reconnaissance of the enemy upon the field.
Without disparagement to the many officers of this brigade who faithfully and honorably served the State on the 5th instant, I recommend for brevet commissions Lieut. Col. Thomas H. Eosser, Lieut. Col. W. S. O’Kane, and Capt. Hiram Bledsoe.
With highest consideration, I have the honor to be, yours, &c.,

My battalion of cavalry consisted of Company A, commanded by Cap-

tain Crenshaw; Company B, commanded by Captain Johnson; Company C, commanded by Captain King, and Company D, commanded by Captain McCowan. The aggregate number of my command engaged was 250 men. The position assigned my command in the field was the extreme right wing of the army. From that position I was ordered up by Brigadier-General Bains in the direction of the enemy’s battery for the purpose of making a charge. My command advanced up beyond a cabin and near the middle of a grain field, when Brigadier General Rains joined me, and continued at and near the head of my column during the engagement and the entire day. Upon being joined by General Rains, I understood from him we were to charge upon the enemy’s battery on a given signal from the commanding officer of cavalry on the east wing. I neither saw nor heard any signal from the east wing to charge, nor was any order given by Brigadier-General Rains at any time for my battalion.
The movement of cavalry throughout from the west wing was a flank movement, and in passing out of the grain field my command [was] exposed to a heavy fire from the enemy’s battery, wounding Private George W. O’Haver, of Captain Crenshaw’s company (left arm shot off), of which wound he died at the end of two days; his horse was also wounded. And [we] advanced, wounding Private Elijah Wood, of Captain McCowan’s company (left leg shot off, but in a fair way to recover). Six horses killed in Captain McCowan’s company; several slightly wounded.
After passing through the grain field in the midst of the fire we were led into and across a body of timber and halted by General Rains, some time after which we were ordered across the prairie to the timber on Spring River in order to gain a position in rear of the enemy, but arrived too late, the enemy having gained the timber in their retreat before we arrived.
While halted for the purpose of ascertaining the position of the enemy near the timber on Spring River, we received shots from the enemy’s battery, one of which wounded Private John Byler, of Captain McCowan’s company, in the left thigh and leg, and also wounded his horse.
In consequence of failing to gain the rear of the enemy at the timber on the north side of Spring River, we had to pass some distance down Spring River in order to gain a crossing. After crossing to the south side of the river we traveled up the road leading to Carthage until within a mile and a half of Carthage, when we obliqued to the right of the road, marched up to a point of timber opposite to and about 1 mile south of Carthage, when we formed the line, and marched into the town of Carthage soon after the enemy had retreated out of town.
All of our movements during the engagement were according to the orders of Brigadier-General Rains.
I am proud in being able to state that during the whole day [my] command, both officers and privates, demeaned themselves well, and evinced more cool courage than is generally found among raw recruits. Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Col. E. L. Y. Peyton, Third Cavalry, Eiqhth Division Missouri •	State Guard*
Camp Lee,
CowsMn Prairie, Mo., July 19,1861.
General : I have the honor to say that on the morning of July 5, while the army was on the march towards Carthage, I was informed by you that the Federal troops were some miles just ahead of us) then directed to ascertain the number of companies in my regiment properly armed and supplied with ammunition. I did so immediately, and found that only two companies and part of another had the necessary ammunition 5 the remaining six and a half, though the most of them had good arms, were totally without ammunition and could obtain none. I reported this to you, and was then directed, as senior colonel, to take command of the cavalry, composed of my own force, just mentioned, and also the battalions of Colonel McCown and Lieutenant-Colonel Baughn [Vaughan ?], and the companies of Captains Owens and Stone, of Henry County, and march them forward in the direction of the enemy. The force from my own regiment, composed of Company A, commanded by Captain Dook; Company B, commanded by Captain Marchbanks, and part of Company H, commanded by Captain Erwin, as also the battalions of Colonel McCown and Lieutenant-Colonel Baughn [Vaughan?] and the companies of Captains Owens and Stone in a few moments were on the line of march. The balance of my regiment was left under command of Lieutenant-Colonel White. Major Tyler, of the regiment, went with us.
After a march of some 6 miles, and when arriving on the brow of the hill north of Coon Creek, we found the enemy posted about a mile ahead of us on the main road. Here a halt was ordered, and in a very few moments, our artillery coming up, the cavalry, by your directions, were deployed to the right, and moving down a sloping plain for about 400 or 500 yards, were halted to await further orders from yourself, my own regiment at the head of the main body, and the battalion of Colonel McCown filing to the right and taking position some 300 yards in advance of us. While resting here I received an order to send off the companies of my regiment to join that of Captain Shelby, detailed for some special service, and immediately sent Captain Hook and his company. While in this position the batteries of the enemy were on the left, to the southeast and north of the creek, distant about three-quarters of a mile from my regiment, with a large corn field between us, and directly south of us to the timber of the creek it was, I suppose, a little over half a mile, with fencing to pass through. After remaining at the point I have mentioned for some short time you appeared on the field and took command in person of the whole column.
By your order my regiment and those in rear of me turned to the left, and entering the field (the fence being thrown down for that purpose) came up in the rear [of] Colonel McCown?s battalion, who had entered the same before us and from a different point, and then the whole force by your command passed through to the timber of the creek. This was done under a severe and heavy fire from the cannon of the enemy, yourself in the advance. In rushing for nearly a quarter of a mile under the fire of the artillery, my own regiment (consisting then of only 60

men), both officers and privates, bore themselves with calmness and gallantry, and halting at the edge of the timber reformed and passed through in good order to the prairie on the south side of the creek. Every officer and private in the whole column5, as yourself can testify, were ready to obey any call you might give them.
After crossing over on the south side of the timber and gaining the prairie the whole column was halted, and remained there for some time. In a short while Captain Dook, with his company, regained his regiment, and the whole column, moving forward, keeping the course of the enemy, after a march of some 4 miles, was halted, in order that you might cross over and confer with those in command of our army on the left of us, you leaving instructions not to move until you should appear in person or send orders. Before your return to my command the column was marched forward in order to intercept the enemy at or before he should march to Carthage, which movement afterwards met with your approbation.
In a very short while you overtook us at the second creek, and the command was marched rapidly forward between the second creek and Spring River ; the cannon of the Federal forces again opened upon us. After crossing Spring River, when within about a mile and a half of Carthage, the firing of cannon was heard in the direction of the town, and the command was by you then marched as quickly as possible towards that point. When within about a mile of Carthage, by your order we dismounted in the road, and, forming in line, entered the town, but too late to engage in any action.
I have further to report to you that all of the men in my regiment who left in the morning with Lieutenant-Colonel White who could procure arms and ammunition did so, and then acted throughout the day with the forces on the left. Captain Moore, of Company C; Lieutenant-Colonel Graves,----Leaky, and 27 privates; Captain Smith, of Com-
pany E; Lieutenants Ferly, Williams, and Bennett, with his 6 privates; Captain Bryant and Lieutenant Campbell, of Company F, withv4 privates ; Lieutenant Martin, of Company G, with 2 privates; Lieutenant Brookoust, of Company H, with 12 privates, and Lieutenant Williams, of Company A, they being all who could procure arms and ammunition, with Lieutenant-Colonel White, I am informed, did gallant service in different parts of the field.
In the affair at Carthage Captain Moore was injured and Private Lewis Highley severely wounded.
I have great pleasure in stating to you that the officers and privates of my regiment and the officers and privates of the whole brigade while under my immediate command obeyed with promptness any order given by you, and conducted themselves with the courage and steadiness of true soldiers.
1 have further to say that the whole number of men, officers and privates, of my regiment that took part in the affair of the 5th instant was 181.

Report of Lieut. Col. Richard A. Vaughan [Baughan ?], Seventh Cavalry, Eighth Division Missouri State Guard.
Camp Lee, Mo., July 19, 1861.
Sir : Herewith please find report of the battalion under my command in the engagement had with the Federal forces on the prairie near Dry Fork, 12 miles north of Carthage, the county seat of Jasper County, Mo., on the 5th day of this month.
The force under my command that day from my own battalion was 200 men, two-thirds of whom were armed with common rifles and shotguns, viz: Company A, Capt. R. H. Williams, 4 officers and 60 men; Company B, Capt. C. D. Smith, 4 officers and 40 men; Company C, Capt. J. F. Stone, 3 officers and 32 men; Company D, Capt. George W. Hopkins, 4 officers and 30 men, and Company E, Captain J. Crockett, 3 officers and 30 men, making an aggregate of 200 men. Colonel Hyde, of Saint Joseph, Mo., with about 100 men, was ordered to attach his command to my battalion for that day, and the position assigned to me was on the left of Colonel Peyton’s regiment.
When the order was given to charge on the battery of the enemy I moved forward with the whole command, having divided the force under me into two squadrons, giving to Colonel Hyde the command of the first, assisted by Major Bolton, and I commanded the second squadron, assisted by Captain Cunningham, of Colonel Hyde’s battalion. The men marched off in good order, and were anxious to fight. We were prevented from making a direct charge on the battery of the enemy from the fact [that] a strong fence ran parallel with, north, and between my command and the position taken by the enemy. We therefore followed in rear of Colonel Peyton’s regiment through the field, wheat and corn, until some confusion, occasioned by pulling down a strong fence, was discovered at the head of the column, when I obliqued to the right, intending to get a position in rear of the enemy and charge from that point. From the time we passed the brow of the hill in the field we were exposed to a raking fire of canister and round shot until we reached the timber. I am proud to say the men behaved admirably, promptly obeying every order given to them, and were remarkably calm and cool for young soldiers.
Lieutenant Kimble, of Company B, had his leg broken and his horse killed under him by a cannon ball: Lieutenant Badger, of the same company, had his saber and scabbard broken in two by the explosion of a bomb.* Private Hockaby, of the same company, had his horse killed under him. Capt. J. F. Stone, of Company C, had his horse killed under him while at the head of his company. Private Wilson, of the same company, lost his horse at this time.
I was ordered to take my command down the creek and cross over at the first crossing I could find. I did so, and joined the cavalry brigade on the prairie south of the creek. We were not near enough again during the day to give or receive a shot from the enemy.
Yery respectfully,
RICHARD A. VAUGHAN [BAUGHAN »],
Lieutenant- Colonel, Commanding Vernon County Battalion.

Eighth Division Missouri State Guard.

Report of Brig. Gen. John 7>. Clark, commanding Third Division Missouri
State Guard.
Hdqrs. Third Division Missouri State Guard,
19,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit for your consideration the following report of the part taken by the forces under my command in the engagement with the enemy on the 5th instant in Jasper County, in this State.
On the morning of the 5th instant, at about 6 o’clock, the line of march in the direction of Carthage was resumed in the following order: Brigadier-General Bains occupying the extreme right, Brigadier-General Slack on his left, my division on the left of General Slack’s and on the right of Brigadier-General Parsons, who formed the extreme left of the advancing columns. After marching about 5 miles, I received intelligence that the enemy was strongly posted in line of battle 2 miles in my advance and 8 miles from Carthage, on the road we were traveling. I immediately dismounted such of my men as were mounted, and caused all under my command who were supplied with guns to be formed into line of battle, undpr the immediate command of Col. J. Q. Burbridge, Lieut. Col. Edwin Price, and Maj. John B. Clark, jr. The line thus formed contained 365 men, rank and file. With this force I in person advanced, and on nearing the line of battle formed by the command of Colonel Weightman I observed Brigadier-General Parsons advancing with his artillery and infantry, and seeking to take his position in line immediately on the left of Colonel Weightman’s command, such position being the only available point for using successfully his battery against the enemy. Seeing this movement of General Parsons, and concurring with him in the propriety of changing our positions as observed in the line of march, I deployed my forces to the left, thus making my command occupy the extreme left of our line of battle.
It was now 11 o’clock. The enemy being posted something near a thousand yards from our front, with eight pieces of artillery, responded to the lire of General Parsons’ artillery with brisk and continuous fire of shell, grape, and shot, lasting between twenty and thirty minutes, which was spiritedly replied to by the artillery from the batteries of Captain Guibor, of General Parsons’ command, and Colonel Bosser and Captain Bledsoe, of Colonel Weightman’s command, killing and wounding a number of the enemy’s men and horses. At this engagement, and while taking my position with my force in the line of battle, my horse was severely wounded in the neck by a shot from the enemy’s artillery, which circumstance, together with the shower of grape and shell continuously poured upon my forces, caused a momentary confusion in the line, but was soon repaired, and every officer and soldier received the fire with the coolness and composure of veterans. Upon consultation with Colonel Kelly, commanding a regiment of General Parsons’ division immediately on my right, I ordered an advance of my forces in the direction of the enemy. At this moment General Parsons came up from his batteries and gave a similar order, when our commands, together with the battalion of Colonel O’Kane, of Colonel Weight-man’s command, made a rapid movement in the direction of the enemy. After advancing some fifty yards the enemy made a retrograde movement in double-quick time over the eminence on which he had been

posted into a ravine, which effectually concealed him from our view. Supposing his design by such movement was to gain a position on our left and to make an attack on our flank, the several commands changed their direction from the south to the east, each marching in separated columns, Colonel O’Kane forming the extreme right, with Major Dills on his left, Colonel Kelly on my right, and my column forming the extreme left. Continuing in this direction for half a mile, and upon ascending the hill, I discovered the enemy, who seemed to be rapidly forming into line of battle about one mile and a half from his first position, behind a cluster of trees, and upon an eminence on the south side of Bear Creek. Immediately in the front and for some miles above him was a skirt of thick brush timber, through which the creek ran, and upon which his line was being formed. We immediately advanced to the timber on the north side of the creek and took a position near the enemy, when a sharp and incessant fire of small-arms on either side occurred, lasting for about thirty minutes; but by well-directed fire from the battery of Captain Bledsoe, which early in the engagement was run near the enemy, and the fatal aim and steady advance of the infantry, the enemy was driven from his second position and forced to make a rapid retreat, losing one piece of his artillery and suffering a heavy loss of killed and wounded.
In this engagement my command, having engaged the enemy at a distance of from forty to fifty yards, and in attempting to cross the creek to charge the enemy, suffered a loss of 10 men killed and wounded. At this engagement Lieut. Col. Edwin Price had his horse killed under him while gallantly urging and cheering forward the forces.
A detailed report of the surgeon is hereto attached, and made a part of this report.*
When the enemy commenced his second retreat my forces were compelled to make a detour of half a mile up the creek before they could find a crossing, the depth of the stream, together with the abruptness of the banks, being of such a character as not to allow crossing at a shorter distance. When we had effected a crossing we heard the firing of cannon in the direction of Carthage, about 1 mile in our advance, to which point we rapidly hurried. On arriving there we found the enemy still retreating in the direction of Carthage, but occasionally firing his artillery to cover his retreat. At Carthage a sharp conflict occurred, of some fifteen or twenty minutes, between the enemy and portions of the cavalry, infantry, and artillery of the several divisions, when he again retreated, and were pursued for several miles beyond Carthage, and until the darkness of the night caused a cessation of the pursuit.
Thus ended a conflict in which the citizen soldiery of Missouri have given to the world an earnest of their determination to defend their rights and redress their wrongs, and which inspires hope of success in the stormy future upon which we are now entering.
I have no means at hand to give an accurate account of the loss of the enemy. From the number of his dead and wounded scattered upon his line of retreat it cannot be otherwise than great.
In this connection it gives me pleasure to state that my entire command, officers and soldiers, acquitted themselves with honor, and deserve the gratitude of the country ; and I desire in this public manner to bear my testimony to their valor and zeal, and to make my public acknowledgment to my entire staff and to Col. J. Q. Burbridge, Lieut. Col. Edwin Price, and Maj. John B. Clark, jr., of the First Begiment of

Parsons, Colonels Weightman, Kelly, Rosser, and O’Kane, Major Dills, Captains Bledsoe and Guibor, with whom I was thrown during the engagement, and who at the head of their respective forces cordially and efficiently united and acted with me in every movement of the forces under my command. Brigadier-Generals Slack and Rains, with portions of their respective commands, engaged the enemy at points which could not be observed from my position, and I therefore am unable to speak from personal observation of their movements.
I avail myself of this opportunity to tender my thanks to Col. Thomas L. Snead and Col. William M. Cooke, who volunteered to me their services through the several engagements, and gave me most valuable aid, and under circumstances of continued exposure of their lives.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JKO. B. CLARK,

The undersigned, commanding the Fourth Division, begs leave to report that on the 5th of July instant his command consisted of Col. B. A. Rives’ regiment of cavalry, in the aggregate 500 men, and Col. John T. Hughes’ regiment and J. C. Thornton’s battalion of infantry, in the aggregate 700 men. At 11 a. m. of the 5th we met the enemy, 2,300 strong, in the road 8 miles north of Carthage, in Jasper County, where the line of battle was formed. Colonel Hughes’ regiment, with Major Thornton’s battalion, under Hughes’ command, formed the center of the line, the right being formed by the infantry of Colonel Weight-man and Colonel O’Kane, the left with the infantry under General Clark. The enemy’s position being 700 yards in our front, a brisk cannonading was opened from the batteries on both sides, which was kept up for fifty-five minutes. Colonel Rives’ regiment of cavalry was ordered to threaten the right flank and rear of the enemy, which he did with considerable success, diverting their fire from the front.
The enemy retired from their first position with considerable loss,
* Not found.

but took position again about one mile south of the first and in the road, opening a brisk fire from their batteries upon our front ranks at a distance of some three or four hundred yards, which was promptly returned by Colonel Weiglitman’s battery. Colonel Hughes7 command attempted to occupy a woods skirting the enemy, where his small-arms could have been brought to bear upon the enemy, but owing to the deep water in the stream failed in his effort until the enemy had again retired in the direction of Carthage, being closely pursued by Colonel Hughes7 command.
In the town of Carthage the enemy took his next position, taking shelter in and behind houses, walls, and fences. This stand of the enemy was an obstinate one, dealing shot and shell freely from their batteries into our ranks. Colonel Hughes7 command, under his direction, and that of Lieutenant-Colonel Prichard and Major Thornton, was brought in close proximity to the enemy7s lines, when a deadly fire was opened upon them by our infantry. The enemy retired in great haste from his position in town, being hotly pursued by Colonel Hughes7 command, a constant fire being kept up. The enemy again planted his batteries on the heights one mile east of town, and succeeded in a large degree in protecting the hasty retreat of hig shattered and disorganized column. Colonel Hughes7 command was pushed forward under shelter of a skirt of woods, and was again brought in very close proximity in the rear of the enemy7s retreating forces, and again opened a destructive fire upon their lines, the enemy still continuing to retire in rapid haste.
By this time nightfall had set in, and, owing to the exhausted condition of Colonel Hughes7 command, they were called from the field. A portion of Colonel Rives7 cavalry, in command of Captain McNeil, continued in pursuit of the enemy, continuing to annoy their flank and rear until it was entirely dark, and capturing a portion of their baggage, when the chase of the enemy was entirely abandoned. During the whole of the enemy’s retreat his flank was successively annoyed by Colonel Rives7 command.
In these several engagements the losses in my command were as follows: In Colonel Rives7 regiment 2 were killed on the field, 2 mortally wounded, and 1 missing, supposed to be a prisoner $ in Colonel Hughes7* command 2 were mortally wounded, 4 were severely wounded, and 2 slightly wounded.
I have the gratification to report that all the commissioned officers and non-commissioned officers and privates in my command during the several engagements on the 5th displayed all the energy and endurance of veterans, giving abundant evidence that they can be relied on in any emergency.
Colonel Rives7 separate report, herewith submitted, will show more particularly the operations' of his regiment on that occasion. The undersigned, being employed the whole day with Colonel Hughes7 command, reports the conduct of that branch of the army from his own, personal observation. My command captured on that occasion 8 prisoners, and 2 baggage wagons loaded with tents and other quartermaster’s stores. Valuable service was rendered me that day on the field by my entire staff.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Report of Col. B. A. Rives, First Cavalry, Fourth Division Missouri
State Guard.
Camp, Cowskin Prairie, July 24,1861.
Sir: In obedience to your orders I herewith submit a brief report of the participation of the First Regiment Cavalry, Fourth Division Missouri State Guard, in the engagement of the 5th of July.
My regiment was stationed on the extreme left of our line of battle within seven or eight hundred yards of the batteries of the enemy. A brisk cannonade was opened on our lines about 10 o’clock a. m. At the second discharge from the enemy’s guns two horses of my command were killed, and grape shot and shell fell thick in our ranks, the officers and men remaining perfectly cool under the fire. I was ordered by you to flank the enemy’s right and threaten his rear, which order was executed with as little delay as possible, having to tear down a strong plank fence which was directly in our way. In executing this order a masked battery, discharging grape shot and shell, was opened on my regiment, by which I lost *4 brave and gallant men. Capt. John NT. Stone, of Company D, fell bravely leading his command. First Sergt. Joel Stamper and Private James Heron, of Company G, and Private William R. Burton, of Company A, were either killed or mortally wounded in this action.
I crossed Bear Creek, and after the second engagement between our artillery and infantry and that of the enemy I got in front of the enemy, and formed my command on the north side of Buck Branch, in conjunction with Colonel Brown, commanding First Regiment Cavalry, Sixth Division Missouri State Guard, when another short engagement ensued, but Colonel Weightman coming up with his artillery, the enemy again retreated.
I was then ordered to report to and co-operate with Brigadier-General Rains, and endeavor to intercept the retreat of the enemy through Carthage, but in consequence of the difficulty in crossing Spring River, when we arrived there the enemy had passed through the town, being hotly pursued by Colonel Hughes and others. I joined in the pursuit and continued it on foot until dark. Captain McNeil, of Company B, being separated from my command, succeeded in capturing a portion of the transportation and baggage of the enemy.
Too much credit cannot be awarded to the officers and men under my command for the bravery exhibited by them on this their first battlefield, and the fidelity with which they executed my commands.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

ENGAGEMENT NEAR CARTHAGE, MO.
About 6 o’clock in the evening on the 4th of July I received intelligence from my quartermaster, Colonel Monroe, whom I had sent forward with an escort of 95 men to take possession of the mills near Carthage, that the enemy were in strong force in that vicinity, and the colonel demanded of me immediate relief. I ordered my division to halt for refreshment at Camp Slack. By 10 o’clock that night my wagons were reloaded with all the camp equipage, the animals hitched up, and my division under arms, ready for an immediate movement on Carthage, of which I had the honor of informing your excellency at the time. In a very short time thereafter I received an order from you to order my division into quarters and remain in camp during the night. Early on the next morning I received orders from your excellency to march my division in the rear of the army, which position I took immediately, Generals Bains’, Slack’s, and Clark’s divisions marching in my front in the direction of Carthage, which was about 12 miles distant. About 10 o’clock a. m. I received your dispatch, stating that the enemy were form? ing for battle in our front. I put my column in rapid motion, and upon arriving within about a mile and a half of the creek called Bear Creek, I discovered that the advanced divisions of Generals Bains and Slack had formed in line of battle. At this time I did not know the position nor the strength of the enemy, but hurrying up my battery, consisting of four brass sixes, on arrival to the left of Colonel Weightman’s battery I discovered the enemy formed for attack at the distance of 1,000 yards, and in numbers apparently 2,500 or 3,000, formed in the following order: one regiment to the right of the road, one to the left, supporting in the first instance seven pieces of artillery, with their third regiment in reserve 100 yards in the rear.
Advancing my batteries to the front and to the left of Colonel Weight-man’s, forming my infantry, under Colonel Kelly and Major Bills, to the left of my artillery, General Clark’s division coming rapidly into line upon the left of my infantry, my cavalry, under Colonel Brown, Captain Alexander, and Captain Crews, I ordered to take j>osition on the extreme left of General Clark’s.line.
Having made this disposition of my forces, being so cordially and promptly co-operated with by General Clark, I rode up to my battery and ordered Captain Guibor, its commandant, to open fire, which was done instanter. The enemy’s batteries immediately responded, Colonel Weightman’s battery returning the fire as promptly. Without any material change of position, the batteries continued their conflict for about twenty minutes to the great disadvantage of the enemy; but not wishing to have my infantry any longer exposed to the enemy’s batteries, I determined to harass them with the cavalry, so as to draw their fire, at the same time sending a body of mounted riflemen to Bear Creek for the purpose of cutting the enemy’s rear and to get possession of the crossing in that direction. I ordered Colonel Brown’s regiment of cavalry to make a demonstration on the enemy’s right flank, at the same time leaving orders with my adjutant, Colonel Standish, for Colonel Kelly, that so soon as I could make any efficient movement with the cavalry, to advance my whole line.
Colonel Brown advanced with his cavalry upon the enemy’s right flank, which caused him to change the position of his right, as well of infantry as of artillery. Two pieces of artillery were at this time diverted from my infantry, and directed exclusively upon my cavalry. Seeing that there was a prospect of surrounding the enemy, I ordered the whole of my cavalry, Colonel Brown commanding, to Bear Creek, to occupy the timber at the crossing, and, if possible, prevent their

﻿36	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
retreat. The enemy, discovering the object of this movement, commenced a slow and sullen retreat by their right flank, Colonel Kelly, General Clark, and my battery promptly advancing upon them. The cavalry did not succeed in getting the position designated for them, in consequence of which the enemy were successful in recrossing Bear Creek and establishing themselves on a steep eminence on its south bank. Reconnoitering this position, which was about three-quarters of a mile from the first occupied by the enemy, I found the enemy’s batteries stationed so as to completely command the crossing, which was about 30 feet wide, the creek itself being about the same distance in width, thick timber and undergrowth lining the banks of the stream on either side for about 30 yards in width to the right and left of the crossing for several miles above and below. On their right flank on the north side of the creek and to our left of the ford was a large field, its southern boundary being on the timber north of the creek. The enemy’s batteries from the eminence on which they were posted completely commanded the field. Discovering their forces deploying to their right, and taking possession of the timber on their side of the creek, I found it absolutely necessary for the success of the day to make a rapid movement of the infantry through the field above mentioned and get possession of the timber on our side of the stream. This movement was executed with great gallantry by the following commands in the following order: Colonel Kelly’s regiment leading, and to the left of my division; Major Dills’ battalion close upon his right; Colonel O’Kane, of the Warsaw regiment, on the right, and Colonel Clark, with his usual promptness, co-operating upon my extreme left. The enemy used every eftort in their power to prevent the success of this movement. They fired rapid volleys of grape, shell, and round shot upon this command in its advance through the field; yet our troops, without wavering, gallantly succeeded in gaining the south side of it, and, rapidly deploying, threw themselves over the fence and into the timber. In the mean time Colonel Weightman had planted his battery on our side of the creek in the road immediately in front of the enemy’s and opened fire.
The action on the enemy’s right with General Clark’s infantry and mine now became general, the opposing lines having arrived within 30 or 40 yards of each other. Brisk volleys on both sides were kept up for nearly half an hour, and the enemy finally gave way and retreated under cover of their artillery.
Not being advised as to what was going on to the right of the road and to the right of Colonel Weightman’s battery, I then rode up to a high point of ground which commanded a view of the enemy’s position and our own lines to the right. I then discovered that the whole force of the enemy were in full retreat. I then ordered my infantry and artillery forward. Colonel Kelly, Major Dills, and Captain Guibor, of the artillery, although ha ving been engaged in a fatiguing action, promptly advanced. Having obtained position upon the open plain, I discovered that the enemy had obtained a position upon the plain about 2 miles from Spring River, having formed at a house merely as a feint to cover their retreat through the defiles on Spring River in the direction of Carthage. This river is about one and a half miles from Carthage. , I advanced my infantry and two pieces of my artillery for the purpose of again giving them battle, but before my forces came up the enemy had accomplished their object, and again retreated.
When I arrived at Spring River, having ascertained that two pieces of my artillery, under Captain Guibor, had already crossed and were in the front, I delayed a while for my infantry to come up, which they did

## p. 37 (#51) ##############################################

﻿Chap. X.]	ENGAGEMENT NEAR CARTHAGE, MO.	37
as promptly as they could. The river being deep, and the men wearied from their long exertion, I turned my carriage back to ford them over the stream. Immediately thereafter I ordered them to the front at as quick a pace as I thought they were able to march. About this time I heard cannonading in Carthage, about one mile in advance. Hurrying up with my infantry, I arrived in town, and found there a body of cavalry. I ordered them to the front immediately Passing to the east of the town I found my artillery engaged with the enemy at a mile distant, the enemy having occupied the wood at my left, about 400 yards distant. By this time, Colonel Kelly having arrived with my infantry, I ordered him to advance immediately and take possession of the wood to my left. After a few minutes’ sharp firing the enemy was again dislodged and in full retreat across the prairie.
It is due to Major Dills, of the infantry, and to Captain Alexander, of the mounted service, to say that they and their commands acted with great discretion and bravery in driving the enemy from this last position.
At this position it is with regret that I report to your excellency that one of my bravest and best officers fell at the head of his command, viz, Captain McKinzie, of the Clark Township Southern Guards. Your excellency will pardon me for the digression when I state that this valuable officer was my orderly sergeant through Doniphan’s campaign in Mexico, when we were striving to uphold the very flag which now floats at the head of the menials that attempt to oppress us. I deem this testimonial of my regard for him as due on account of our long association together in defense of our country.
Our army at this time (it being sunset) having driven the enemy beyond the mills east of Carthage, which it was my original intention to occupy, and having ordered my commissary, Colonel Boberts, to move forward with a detachment to take possession of a considerable quantity of flour which I had ascertained was in the mill, I then directed my infantry and cavalry and artillery to retire into camp about one-quarter of a mile to the east of Carthage.
While it is due that I should say to your excellency that my artillery and cavalry acted with the greatest bravery and precision; and, without any intention to detract from the merits of any other officer upon the field, it is due that I should call to your excellency’s especial notice the ability and daring of Colonel Kelly, of my regiment of infantry, and all the officers under his command; also Major Dills and the battalion under his command, and also Captain Guibor and Lieutenant Barlow, of the artillery. I might recount several instances of personal valor of the two last-mentioned officers which came under my own observation, but it is sufficient to say that by their prowess the artillery of my division won a position upon the field. I will also state that I was gallantly sustained upon the field by all my staff.
My casualties were as follows: Killed, Captain McKinzie; wounded, Jesse Gilfillan, second lieutenant, Colonel Kelly’s regiment 5 Thomas Doyle, William D. Hicks, and Garret Scott, Capt. Lucius Gaines, of Major Dills’ battalion; B. F. Asbury, of Captain Crews’ company, and B. E. Baber, of Captain Livingston’s company, were slightly wounded. The number of the enemy killed and wounded in the field has, I presume, been already reported to you by the proper authorities.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. M. PABSOKS,
Brigadier-General.

Report of Capt. Joseph Conrad, Third Missouri Infantry (Union).
Springfield, Mo., July 11,1861.
Sir : In accordance with your order, I most respectfully make hereby a statement of facts concerning the surrender of myself and men at Neosho, July 5,186L :
After you had left Neosho, on the 4th day of July, I observed that the city was very unquiet. I took all necessary precautions, by placing extra sentinels and sending out patrols every half hour, day and night. The Fourth passed off quietly.
On the 5th day of July the same precaution was taken. About 11 o’clock I heard the cannonading, whereon I immediately dispatched a patrol of 20 men, under the command of Lieutenant Damde, to inquire, if possible, the cause of it. At 1 o’clock I received orders, signed by Brigade Quartermaster Bichardson, to retreat with my command, if necessary. Lieutenant Damde, with his patrol returned about the same time. They had scarcely returned—in fact, had not been in camp more than ten minutes—before the enemy came pouring in in all directions to the number of about 1,200 to 1,500 men, under the command of Colonel Churchill and Major McIntosh (Arkansas Bangers). Finding it impossible for me to hold my post with success, after due deliberation, after due consultation with my officers and men, I concluded it would be best to make the surrender as it was required—namely, unconditionally.
We were, after the surrender of our arms, placed in the court-house, where we remained until Monday, the 8th.
I must mention here that the officers of the Arkansas Bangers, as well as of the Missouri troops, behaved themselves quietly, accommodatingly, and friendly, both towards myself and men; but their privates, on the contrary, in a most insulting and brutal manner.
On the 8th we were released, we officers having before given our parole of honor not to serve any more against the Confederate States of America during the war, my men having before sworn to the same effect. We left Neosho on the evening of the 8th at 5.30 o’clock, with an escort of about 30 men, under the command of Captain Boone, for our security and protection, the people of Neosho and farmers of that vicinity having threatened to kill us in the streets. Captain Boone escorted us about 4 miles from the camp. After innumerable hardships and dangers, without food and water, our canteens having all been stolen from us by the Southern troops, we at last reached Spring-field, my men all broken down, having traveled the distance of 85 miles in fifty hours, with hardly any food at all.
Having made this statement, I respectfully place the same in your hands to judge my actions.
Yery respectfully, yours,
JOSEPH CONBAD,
Captain of Rifle Company B, Third Regiment Mo. Vols.

General : I have the honor to inform you that in obedience to your orders I started at 11 o’clock a. m. to-day with four companies of Colonel Churchill’s regiment of Arkansas Mounted Eiflemen and Captain Carroll’s company of Arkansas State troops to make an attack upon some Federal troops at Neosho, Mo., in conjunction with Colonel Churchill, commanding six companies of his regiment. We started on different roads which entered the town—one from the west, the other from the south—with an arrangement to make the march of 16 miles in four hours, and upon entering the town to make a simultaneous attack. I found that the distance was not so much as stated. It would therefore be necessary for me to have waited near the town an hour, and fearing that information would be carried into town to the enemy, I determined to attack at once, and made my arrangements accordingly. I dismounted the four companies of Churchill’s regimen t about a quarter of a mile of the town, and marched them by platoon at double-quick within 200 yards of the Court-House, where we found a company 80 strong. I sent Captain Carroll with his company to make a detour and to take them in rear.
After halting my command I sent Dr. Armstrong, volunteer aide-de-camp, to demand a surrender of the forces. I allowed them ten minutes to decide. At the end of the time the captain in command made an unconditional surrender of the company, laying down their arms and side-arms. We took 100 rifles with saber bayonets, a quantity of ammunition, and a train of seven wagons loaded with provisions. Colonel

Churchill came up in good time with his command, and made an im posing sight with his mounted riflemen.
The officers and men did everything in their power to make the movement as prompt as possible, and they marched up to within a short distance of a force whose numbers were unknown with a step as regular and a front as unbroken as a body of veterans.

JULY 9-11, 1861.—Skirmishes near and at Monroe Station, Mo.
Report of Col. Robert F. Smith, Sixteenth Illinois Infantry.
Hdqrs. Sixteenth Regiment Illinois Volunteers,
Monroe Station, Mo., July 14, 1861.
Sir : In accordance with your order, on the 8th of this month I left my headquarters at Palmyra, Mo., with Companies F and H, of the Sixteenth Illinois Regiment, and Companies A, F, H, and K, of Third Iowa Regiment, and Company A, of Hannibal Home Guard, and one 6-pounder, and proceeded to this place. A heavy rain-storm coming on retarded our further progress. Early on the morning of the 9th I started south in search of the rebel force under Harris. At 4 o’clock p. m., when about 12 miles south of Monroe, our advance guard was fired into by the enemy, concealed in a clump of timber and brush, the first volley severely wounding Captain McAllister, of Company G, Sixteenth Illinois Regiment $ also Private Prentiss, of Company A, same regiment, and slightly* wounding a private of the Iowa regiment. I immediately ordered a charge, and drove the enemy from their cover. As they were all mounted, it was impossible to follow them farther with advantage. We found one of their men mortally wounded, and have reason to believe several more shot and carried off by their friends, and captured seven horses, saddled and bridled. We made camp near this place for the night.
On the morning of the 10th, having heard rumors of trouble at Monroe Station, moved my command back. On coming in sight of Monroe, found the station outhouses, seventeen passenger and freight cars, and other railroad property in flames, and found the enemy collected to the number of three or four hundred on our left. On nearing them they began to move off, when I brought forward the field piece and sent a few round shot into their ranks, scattering them in all directions. The only damage done here that I know of was one horse killed.
After coming into Monroe, I took possession of a brick building known as “The Seminary,” and inclosed grounds adjoining, its position answering my purpose for defense, if necessary, and the apartments good quarters for the men, who were without tents. During the day we made several advances on the enemy, without being able to get near enough to do much damage.
On the morning of the 11th the enemy began to collect from all quarters, and by noon we were surrounded by from 1,500 to 2,000 men.

At 1 o’clock p. m. they opened fire on us from one 9 and one 6 pounder, at a distance of about a mile. Their firing was very inaccurate, only three shots out of the first twenty-seven striking the building, and they did very little damage, my men being well coyered by a breastwork they had thrown up. After throwing the first six shots, they moved their cannon some 400 yards nearer and opened fire. I immediately answered with the 6-pounder, dismounting their smaller gun, which made a general scattering, and caused them to carry their 9-pounder to a safer distance. Their firing from this time had little or no effect.
Much credit is due Captain Fritz, of Company F, Sixteenth Begiment, for the able manner he led his men throughout our little expedition. Also to Gunner Fishbourn, who planted his shot among them every time, but who had to deal sparingly, as he was almost out of shot when we were relieved. I was also much pleased with the officers and men generally for their coolness and obedience to orders throughout.
At 4.30 o’clock p. m. of the 11th. a train was seen coming from the east with re-enforcements. It proved to be Major Hays, of my regiment, with Companies D, B, and A, of the Sixteenth Illinois, and one 9-pounder field piece. The enemy now began to move off, and by dark had left the field entirely, since which time they have been skulking about the country in squads, burning wood-piles, small bridges, and culverts, when opportunity offered of doing so without danger.
On the morning of the 12th we were again re-enforced by Colonel Palmer’s Fourteenth Begiment, who returned to Quincy to-day, leaving us in a worse position than ever, with the exception that we have more ammunition.
Colonel Palmer brought two brass field pieces with him, which he has again taken away. Something of the kind would be very acceptable here just now, as there is a slight probability of their being useful.
I have the honor to be-, your obedient servant,

intending to remain until 5 o’clock in the afternoon before resuming the inarcn. While the men were cooking dinner, I was waited upon by a man giving his name as Benjamin F. Hays, and representing himself to be sheriff of Cass County, who stated that he had come to meet the command, for the purpose of ascertaining who they were and what its object was, stating that the citizens of Harrisonville were very much alarmed, and that men were collecting with arms to dispute my march; that if he could get an assurance in writing that no person would be molested he believed he could allay the excitement and prevent trouble. I gave him a note stating “ that I was an officer in the service of the United States, under military orders, on my march to a point south of Harrisonville $ that my route lay through the town; that I had no intention of molesting any one, but that to the extent of my power every citizen, without even inquiry as to his feelings towards the Government, would be protected in person and property^ if he remained peaceably at his home* or business; that none but those in arms against the authority of the Government would be molested, and warning all such to disperse.” He then left my camp, first pledging his honor to return at 5 o’clock p. m. and report to me the result of his mission to the people. He never returned, and I have strong reasons for believing that he used his position as sheriff to gain admittance to my camp for the purpose of ascertaining the strength of the command.
About 2 o’clock p. m. parties of horsemen were discovered on the prairie within 400 yards of my camp, and I sent Adjutant Spiers and 3 mounted men to ascertain their characters. He reported from 350 to 400 men within half a mile, mostly mounted, but one company on foot, and that the officer in command desired an interview. I rode out, and was introduced to “’Colonel Duncan,” of Jackson County, Missouri. After stating to him in substance what was written for the sheriff, and calling his attention to the United States flag, which was in full view, he informed me that “ the people of that part of the country had determined that no United States troops should be stationed among them, and that if I persisted in marching forward I would meet with resistance.” I then rode back to my command, which had meantime been drawn up in line in front of the timber, and within fifteen minutes fire was opened upon us. My position was in the edge of a body of timber, the right of my command resting upon a corn field, in the edge of which were two log houses ; the left upon a ravine, on the opposite side of which, and about 150 yards distant, was a small log cabin* The effort on the part of the attacking force seemed to be to turn our flanks^ and get the cover of the timber in our rear. To prevent this, I stationed a squad of 15 men, under Second Lieutenant O’Neil, of Company B, aided by Private Sharkey, at the cabin on the left, and afterwards occupied the ravine with another squad of 10 men, under Captain Millar.
It was on this flank that most of the fighting was done, the officers and men behaving with great gallantry and steadiness, holding back the whole force of the enemy’s cavalry for three hours, and finally repulsing them from the field. On the right, in the standing corn, and covered by a log house or stable, I placed a squad of 15 men, under Second Lieutenant Kiingler, Company A, to prevent a surprise from the corn field. Learning that a body of foot had passed during the parley in the direction west of the corn field, I detailed 12 men, under First Lieutenant Loos, to the rear of the right, to take possession of the third house and guard the woods in that direction.
A force of some 50 men had succeeded in passing entirely round the corn field, and were approaching our rear through timber and thick un-

derbrusli. They were received by a well-delivered fire from the squad and repulsed, leaving one of their number dead and the captain of the company (Coots) mortally wounded. He died the next day. It was here that we lost one man killed (Private Heil, of Company A). The firing was kept up until near sundown, when the enemy retired.
In summing up the casualties, we found but one man killed. Captain Millar, of Company B, received a slight wound in the head from a buck-shot. I cannot too highly praise the gallantry of the citizen mounted men, who stood the whole time of the action under fire in the most exposed portions of the field, and carrying.orders and making observations and reconnaissances with the greatest alacrity and fearlessness. It is to them that I owe much of the success attending the day.
At sundown I fell back into the field on the right, occupying the dwelling-house of Mr. James Smith, cutting away the corn around the house in order to command the approaches with our rifles. At this time my scouts reported a re-enforcement to the enemy, from our rear, of 100 men. I called a council of officers, and it was thought we could, by felling trees around the house, hold our position until re-enforced. We had, as we supposed, about 1,200 rounds of ammunition besides what was in the cartridge-boxes, but on opening the full box found them to be musket cartridges, each containing a ball and three buckshot. This determined me to attempt reaching the open country before morning, and endeavor to form a junction with Major Dean. I dispatched two messengers, one to ask re-enforcements from Fort Leavenworth and one to Major Dean, who, I had learned, had changed his camp from Austin to West Point, Mo., a day’s march.
In the midst of a heavy rain, at 2 o’clock in the morning, we broke up camp and started west. One of our wagons broke down in the deep mud, and was left, before we reached the road. We had made about a mile, when it became so densely dark that a halt was compelled, and the men stood in the road, under as hard a rain as I ever witnessed, until daylight, when the march was resumed. On reaching a branch of Grand Biver, I found it swollen to a torrent, and in places over its banks. I selected a tree about 100 yards below the ford, at a narrow part of the stream, with high banks, and felled it across for the men to pass over, then swam the horses, and attempted to float our stores and baggage across in the beds of the wagons, which unfortunately sank, thus compelling us to abandon them and two of our wagons. The march was continued all that day, fording streams and marching through overflowed bottom lands, until we reached the State line, some 18 miles southwest of Harrisonviile, at Gamp Prince, where I halted three days awaiting re-enforcements and supplies.
On Monday, July 22, Golonel Weer arrived at camp, and, assuming command, has kept you advised of operations since that date. I cannot close this too lengthy report without alluding once more to the conduct of the men of my command, many of whom lost their shoes and coats. We had no blankets, save private property—in fact, all our clothing was such—the men having only what they enlisted with; without tents, through drenching rains, yet bearing everything with fortitude and cheerfulness, with but few exceptions.

JULY 20-25,1861.—Expedition from Springfield to and Skirmish (July 22)
at Forsyth, Mo.
Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Sweeny, TJ. S. Army.
Headquarters Southwest Expedition,
Springfield, Mo., July 27,1861.
Sir : In compliance with verbal orders received from you, I left this place on the evening of the 20th instant, and proceeded with dispatch to Forsyth, where I arrived at about 6 p. m. of the 22d.
On approaching the town I took every possible precaution to prevent the hostile force assembled there from becoming aware of our presence. The advance guard, which consisted of a company of mounted Kansas Rangers, fell in with a picket guard of the enemy some 3^ miles from town, and succeeded in capturing 2 of them. Upon an examination of the prisoners, they informed me that there were only 150 men stationed at Forsyth; whereupon I ordered Captain Stanley’s cavalry command and the Kansas Rangers to press rapidly forward and surround the town.
After they had passed on, and before the remainder of my force had come up, one of the prisoners remarked, u If that is all you have, you will get badly whipped, for we have a thousand men in Forsyth.” Supposing this statement might be true, although contradictory of his former assertion, I dispatched an order to Captain Stanley to keep the enemy in check if he found the resistance formidable, while I hastened forward with the artillery and infantry to his support. The enemy in the mean time had received information of our approach, and having partially formed in the town, opened a scattering fire on the cavalry, but as it was returned with a well-directed volley from our troops, they fled to the hills and surrounding thickets, keeping up a scattering fire as they retreated. Under cover of the trees and bushes, they collected in considerable numbers upon the hills to the left of the town, from which they were dislodged by a well-directed fire of shell and canister from the artillery. The infantry meanwhile had been deployed as skirmishers through the woods and in the rear of the city, and but a short time elapsed before we were in complete possession of the place.
From the best information I could gather, the loss of the enemy in killed was 8 or 10, and in wounded must have been several times that number. Among the dead was Captain Jackson, who took an active part in the skirmish. Our own loss consisted of 2 men wounded, neither

of them dangerously, and 4 horses killed, including the one shot from under Captain Stanley, First Cavalry. The men belonged to the cavalry. Three prisoners were taken on the day of the action, and 2 on the day following.	*
The entire affair lasted about an hour, and both the officers and men engaged exhibited great coolness and courage. With the town we also captured 7 horses, and a quantity of arms, munitions of war, flour, meal, sugar, sirup, salt, clothing, cloth, boots, shoes, hats, camp furniture, mule and horse shoes, &c., most of which we found in the court-house, which was used as a barracks for their troops. The arms and muni tions of war were distributed among the Home Guards of the county, and the clothing and provisions among our troops, of which they stood in great need.
The country through which we passed is exceedingly hilly and broken, and the latter part of the route almost entirely destitute of provisions for men and forage for horses.
Notwithstanding the adverse weather, which was remarkably stormy for a portion of the time, the march of 45 miles and the capture of the place occupied but little over fifty hours. The last day the troops marched 28 miles, the last four of which were passed over at double-quick time.
I remained in Forsyth till noon of the 23d receiving the captured property, and then took up the line of march for Springfield, which I reached at 2 p. m. of Thursday, the 25th instant.

AUGUST 2, 1861.—Reconnaissance from Ironton to Centreville, Mo.
Report of Col. B. Gratz Brown, Fourth Missouri Infantry (V. 8. R. C.)
Headquarters at Ironton, August 3—11 p. m.
Sir : I have to report a day of very contradictory rumors, but of some decisive information at last. On yesterday, as you have been already advised, I deemed it well to push forward a strong reconnaissance upon Centreville, to ascertain the movements of troops in the valley of the Saint Francis. The detachment, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Mihalotzy, of Hecker’s regiment, 150 strong, pushed forward to within two or three miles of Centreville, where they found the secession troops in force, and soon afterwards found themselves threatened on the flank from Buford by 1,700 men, under McBride. The officer in command at once advised me of the fact, and fell back towards Ironton. I dispatched Colonel Hecker, with 200 men, on the route towards Buford, to threaten McBride’s flank, and to establish communication with Colonel Mihalotzy. My latest advices are that the latter had reached in safety the point where the Buford road leaves the Centreville road, 8 miles from here, and, I presume, by this time has been joined by Colonel Hecker’s detachment. It will be observed, however, that the necessity of this concentration back upon Ironton leaves open the various roads to Potosi, Iron Mountain, and other points on the railroad. I cannot as yet ascertain what force is

supporting this movement from the Current River Valley. If it be of a formidable character, I shall have to rely upon intrenchments at this point. If it be only the movement of McBride’s forces, I shall cut off his communications if he advance^ and fall upon his rear.
It will be necessary that two companies of pioneers, with their equipments, should be sent forward forthwith to this point, if it be designed to put this post in a defensible attitude. So far, I have had nothing, neither tools nor men of experience in engineering, other than Major Trout. If the position is deemed of sufficient importance, it should not only be cared for in such respects, but the necessary artillery, with a sufficient number of artillerists, should be at once sent down. I have scrutinized Colonel Hecker’s regiment, and found seventeen good artillerists, who are now organizing to take charge of the guns at this point. As the company of artillery whose time is out refuse to do any further service other than such as I have compelled them to perform, they should be recalled.
I would also ask for information what I am to do with spies and suspicious characters I find daily haunting this vicinity. Courts-martial will disable my command. I had thought of forming a military commission of three officers to take such cases in hand as a court of inquiry. Where the proof is found on the men they ought to be dealt with promptly.
In addition to the other embarrassments, 1 have to report that there is a portion of my own immediate command whose term of service expires on the 8th instant, and they insist upon being returned to Saint Louis at that time. Such persons are not fit to be relied on as soldiers, and I would submit the propriety of dispensing with the further service of all such. In fact, the three-months’ volunteers have been only a source of demoralization to the Army of the West at the best, and I shall be heartily glad to get rid of them.
There has been for some days past a movement of the families and goods of secessionists from this point, which either betrays fear of our presence or a knowledge of the approach of the enemy. I am inclined to think the latter.
If I shall receive no further advices this evening I shall call in Colonel Hecker’s command in the morning, only leaving strong pickets to note the movements to the west of this position, and sending out scouts to glean all the information possible.
Colonel Bland’s regiment returned barefooted, and with a very insufficient supply of clothing. It should be put in condition for effective service promptly. He complains very bitterly that his requisitions have received no attention.
Yours, respectfully,
B. GRATZ BROWN,
Colonel, Commanding.

jReport of Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon, TJ. S. Army.
Hdqrs. TJ. S. Troops, McCulla’s Farm,
24 miles from Springfield, Fayetteville Road, August 4, 1861.
Sir : On the 1st instant I found the enemy advancing upon Spring-field, and, so far as my information went, it was his intention to center upon it three columns, and this road being the one on which was the largest force and most advanced, I started out to meet it, in hopes to drive it back in time to turn upon other points to the west and northwest, where the other columns are expected. I reached Wilson’s Creek, about 10 miles out, on the first day, and on the second moved about 6 miles, and found an advanced party about 1 mile on from Hayden’s farm. Having little else than meat for my troops, and for nearly three weeks past having less than half rations of everything but beef, which has caused considerable diarrhea, my command of volunteers, badly disciplined and clothed, were unfit to march forward and drive in the enemy’s advance, and proceed to the only camp in advance where water could be obtained, some 4 or 5 miles farther on, and where the rebel forces under Rains were some 3,000 strong, and who must be dislodged before we could camp for the night. I therefore stopped at Hayden’s.
The rebels’ advance perceived my halt, and being mostly mounted, became bold, and threatened me from various points, though in small force—though about 1,000 infantry advanced pretty well forward at one time under an advance of cavalry force. My advance guards of infantry opened fire upon them, and without orders from me, by a spontaneous emotion, the advance guard of my cavalry charged and drove back the rebels, but lost 4 killed and 5 wounded. Cavalry again advanced, but were driven back by my artillery, under Captain Totten.
Yesterday (3d) I advanced to this point, where General Rains, of Jackson’s forces, had his headquarters, and from which he retired without resistance. I cannot say with definiteness how far in advance the main body is, but without supplies, and the danger of being turned by a force to cut off our communication with Springfield, I deem it impracticable to advance; and now, as I determine to fall back upon Spring-field, I perceive evidence of an attempt on the part of the enemy to reach Springfield, by a road to the north of us, in advance of our return. I hope the forces in Springfield will be able to hold out till our return. But, painful as it is to announce, I fear muci} my inability to retain position in Springfield, for the enemy, mostly mounted and very numerous, will cut off our means of obtaining flour, and we shall be forced to retire. I should still hope to retain Springfield and hold out against the enemy in this region but for the expiration of the term of the three-months’ volunteers, of whom Colonel Bates’ First Iowa Regiment claiming discharge on the 14th instant, Colonel Salomon’s Fifth Missouri Regiment at different periods by companies from the 9th to the 18th instant, and a considerable portion of Colonel Sigel’s regiment in a similar manner,

by which my force will be reduced to about 3,500 men, badly clothed and without a prospect of supplies. Prudence seems now to indicate the necessity of withdrawing, if possible, from the country, and falling upon either Saint Louis or Kansas. Saint Louis via Rolla will most likely be selected, with a view to reinforcements and supplies. My forces are now nearly as follows, which I make up from recollection, not having returns for some time past, in consequence of the troops having-been scattered around in the vicinity of Springfield:
First Brigade, Major Sturgis\
Four companies cavalry..................................................   250

I have made every exertion to ascertain the enemy’s forces, and though this is very difficult, I am satisfied it will reach 15,000, and in an attempt to surround and cut me oft* there may be gathered 20,000, most of whom will be ill-conditioned troops, collected from Missouri and Arkansas, with such fire-arms as each man may have, and being mounted, have the means of threatening and annoying my command. In addition to the above will be of the enemy’s forces the organized forces of McCulloch, of Texas, supposed to be 4,000, well-armed, and prepared for effective service.
In fact, I am under the painful necessity of retreating, and can at most only hope to make my retreat good. I am in too great haste to explain at length more fully. I have given timely notice of my danger, and can only in the worst emergencies submit to them.

SKIRMISH AT DUG SPRINGS, MO.

The advance guard was composed of Totten’s battery and my battalion of four companies. About 9 o’clock in the morning a scouting party of the enemy’s cavalry was discovered a hundred yards in advance on the road. Two companies of my battalion were deployed as skirmishers, one on either side of the road, to act as flankers through the bushes. A shell from Totten’s battery dispersed the enemy, and we saw nothing of him for several miles, when some shots were fired at our cavalry flankers two or three hundred yards on the left of the road. Two companies of my battalion were again sent out as flankers, one on each side of the road.
After advancing about a mile and a half, the enemy’s cavalry, in considerable force, was discovered crossing and recrossing the road in front, where it ascended a hill, and was lost from our view in a dense forest. The road passed through a narrow valley, and on the left was a succession of spurs, sparsely covered with scrubby oak, and running perpendicularly to it, up to about a mile from the enemy’s position. Along the ridge of the last spur was Company E, {Second Infantry, deployed as skirmishers, under command of First Sergt. G. H. McLaughlin. On the next spur, in rear of this position, was Lieutenant Lothrop, with his company of general-service recruits, acting as a reserve. On the right of the road the company of Mounted Rifle recruits, under Lance-Sergeant Morine, was deployed to skirmish through a corn field, and Company B, Second Infantry, commanded by First Sergeant Griffin, acting as a reserve. Capt. D. S. Stanley’s troop of cavalry was a short distance in rear, on the right of the road.
General Lyon left me with this force, and drew off the remainder of the command a mile and a half to the rear, in order to encamp near water. I was directed to hold this position unless too hotly pressed by the enemy, when I was to retire, holding him.in check. From our position the valley sloped towards that of the enemy up to the foot of the hill, where it turned off to their right. From behind the hills, on our left, was a deep ravine, running towards the enemy’s position. The bed of a dry stream ran along to the left of the road, and in places was deep, and skirted with tall, thick brush-wood. On the right of the road (the enemy’s left) was a deep ravine, running perpendicularly to the road. In a country of such conformation it was impossible for us to form any estimate of the enemy’s strength. Two small field pieces were in position on the slope of the hill on either side of the road. For several hours they took advantage of their hiding places to annoy us with random shots, none of which took effect.
About 5 o’clock p. m. Sergeant McLaughlin’s line of skirmishers was attacked on the left and front by a large body of cavalry, some 200 or more of whom were on foot and about the same number mounted. At the same time the enemy was seen advancing upon us along the road in column, with two pieces of artillery. Sergeant McLaughlin gallantly repulsed the first attack, but was soon overwhelmed with numbers and obliged to retreat upon the reserve, and all fell back into the road, where I came to their support with the other two companies of my bat-' talion. We then advanced upon the enemy, driving him rapidly back. Captain Stanley, with his troop, took position on a commanding spur on our left and front, to prevent our flank from being turned.
The enemy was now in complete rout, a part of Captain Stanley’s troop having gallantly charged and cut through his line. While we were pursuing the enemy, who had fled, leaving over 200 cavalry horses

tied in the ravine, I received orders from General Lyon to retreat. We could easily have captured all those horses, but I supposed we were being cut off by the enemy’s column, which was concealed from our view. We fell back in good order upon a position chosen by General Lyon, occasionally fronting towards the enemy, but without being molested by him. The enemy expended a large amount of ammunition, but aimed too high to do the infantry much harm. Private John Bus-kirk, of Company E, Second Infantry, received a severe wound in the hand.
The strength of the battalion in this skirmish, excluding the guard in charge of prisoners, was about 200.
The following is Captain Stanley’s report of the number of his troop engaged, killed, wounded, &c.# Conspicuous in the fight, First Sergeant Coates, Sergeant Sullivan.
About 800 of the enemy’s'cavalry, in column, followed us up to within 600 yards of General Lyon’s line of battle, and were soon dispersed by a sharp practice from Totten’s battery.
It is impossible for me to make an accurate report of the enemy’s loss in this affair, but from the best information that I can obtain it is probable that their loss was about 20 killed and 50 wounded, including their loss from the shells thrown by Totten’s battery. Some of the enemy’s wounded men, found in a house near the field, told us it took three six-mule wagons to carry off the dead, and that their loss in killed and wounded was over 70.

Report of Brig. Gen. James 8. Rains, Missouri State Guard (Confederate).
Hdqrs. Second Division Missouri State Guard,
August 3, 1861.
Sir : In consequence of the conflicting rumors which have reached headquarters regarding the action yesterday between the advance guard and the forces of General Lyon, I have the honor to report the following facts in the case:
About 9 a. m. our pickets reported that they had met the advance guard of the enemy, and had fallen back before them after receiving ' two fires from their artillery. I immediately ordered the whole advance guard not on duty (amounting to nearly 400 men) forward, and at a point about 3 miles from our encampment I found the enemy in position. Their forces were covered by the timber and brush, in which they could occasionally be seen deploying. At short intervals they threw out reconnoitering parties, which were checked and driven back by a party of sharpshooters, picked for that purpose. After having thus kept them in check for about five hours Colonel McIntosh arrived on the ground with a force of 150 mounted men, which, by my direction, he kept concealed. In person he reconnoitered the enemy, and reported to us as the result that there were not more than 150 of them on the

ground, which be presumed we were able to keep in check, and therefore withdrew his forces from the field.
In a short time the enemy attempted to outflank us on the right. I sent Colonel Cravens, with 150 men, to check them, and they soon were engaged, driving the enemy back in the utmost confusion. I immediately sent a messenger to report to Colonel McIntosh that we were engaged with a large force. The enemy, re-enforced by the regular XL S. cavalry, renewed the attack on Colonel Cravens’ command, when the conflict became severe and hand to hand. I then took the remaining portion of the guard with the view to cut off the attacking party on the right, when, on reaching them, the enemy opened upon us with two batteries, dispersing the mounted men, a portion of whom became panic-stricken and retired in the utmost confusion. I had been led to expect re-enforcements of infantry and artillery at McCulla’s Spring, and not finding any, fell back, in accordance with instructions, to the main army.*
I found from two of the wounded enemy, one a captain, that we were attacked by the army under General Lyon, over 5,000 strong, with eight pieces of artillery, which we held in check for seven hours.
I have to report a loss of 1 officer (Lieutenant Northcut) and 5 men wounded, while the loss of the enemy, as far as can be ascertained, amounts to 14 killed on the field.
I cannot speak too highly of the gallantry of the officers and men, particularly that portion who acted as infantry; but to notice individual instances of bravery would occupy too much space.

General : I was sent forward yesterday by your order with 150 men to ascertain the position of the enemy, who it was reported were attacking an advance guard of 500 men under General Rains. I marched rapidly 7 miles and met General Rains’ adjutant-general, who told me General Rains was engaging the enemy in front. I screened my men and rode forward with the adjutant-general, and found General Rains with his command. He reported that the enemy were immediately in front. I could see nothing, and told him that I did not believe that they were in force. I then rode forward to reconnoiter the enemy. From a hill I had a good view of the road in advance, and saw either a train or an encampment near it. I reported the fact to the general, and told him repeatedly that he was not sent forward to engage the enemy if in force; that all required of him was to find out their position and strength, and late in the evening to fall back to his position of the night before, take a strong position, and, if attacked, that he would be reenforced. Having obeyed your instructions, I returned. When about

3 miles from your camp, the command of General Rains, as I expected, came down upon us in full flight aud in the greatest confusion. I drew up my men across the road, and rallied the greater portion of them and sent them on in regular order.

AUGUST 7-10, 1861.—Expedition to Price’s Landing, Commerce, Benton, and
Hamburg, Mo.
Report of May. John McDonald, Eighth Missouri Infantry.
Camp Fremont,
Cape GirardeaUj Mo., August 12, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report:
Agreeably to instructions, dated u Headquarters IT. S. Forces, Cape Girardeau, August 7, 1861,” I proceeded in command of two companies (F, Eighth Regiment Missouri Volunteers, and F, Twentieth Illinois), on board steamer Luella, on the night of the 7th instant, for Price’s Landing, on the Mississippi, about 25 miles from here. Landed my command 2 miles on this side of Price’s Landing, and took up a line of march through woods and corn fields to Price’s residence, where I arrived at 2 o’clock a. m. ; surrounded his premises, and at daylight entered his house, expecting to find him there; was however doomed to disappointment, as he had not yet returned from his camp, which is said to be established 14 miles south of his residence, with a force of 1,100 rebels 5 apprehended then as prisoners his son (William Price), who it is said held the rank of captain under his father, and his son-in-law; found in his warehouse a quantity of provisions, marked “ General Price, Charleston, Mo.” Among the lot were twenty barrels, containing in the center firkins of butter, on top of which were potatoes and oats, in order to deceive the public. This, together with other provisions, which were intended for the rebel camp, with the exception of six or seven firkins of butter (which I had the honor to turn over to you), I caused to be burned, having no means of transportation to bring it all with me. I did also take the teams which I found ready to haul these provisions to the rebels, together with one teamster.
I left there about 8 a. m. same day for Commerce; halted on the route about 3 miles above Price’s, where I had been informed I would find one of Price’s leaders, but on my arrival I learned from his family that he was in Price’s camp. I took there several head of stock, which his servants told me were intended for the rebel camp; after which I proceeded on my way to Commerce, and arrived there at 3 p. m. While there I apprehended two rebels, one of them known as the “ Rebel Post Office,” a notorious rascal.
I proceeded from thence to Benton, 8 miles west of Commerce. I was, however, informed on the way that I would find there Jeff. Thompson with 1,100 rebels, but on my arrival found that there had been only two

or three hundred, who on learning of our approach fled to General Pillow’s camp, 48 miles from Benton. Halted at Benton until the following morning, when I found two teams belonging to parties who had been in Jeff. Thompson’s camp for over three months.
I then proceeded to Hamburg, about 5 miles northwest from Benton, where I was told I would find 1,400 rebels, but on my arrival there I found the place deserted of all male inhabitants, who were apprehending an attack from the above rebels. Receiving this information, I concluded to remain there twenty-four hours at the urgent request of the deserted families, and, at the same time expecting their arrival, I did, of course, make the necessary preparations to receive them $ but obtaining no positive information of their whereabouts, I concluded to return to my camp, where I arrived on the 10th instant at 4 o’clock p. m.
In conclusion, I am under the disagreeable necessity of reporting that Capt. T. Q. Hildebrandt, commanding Company F, Twentieth Illinois, did disobey my orders on several occasions by allowing his men to leave the ranks on the line of march, and did on one occasion allow two of his men to go some distance and procure two horses under the pretense of visiting a rebel camp (as they said), which conduct the said captain did not report to me. On my accidentally hearing of this breach of discipline next day, I asked the captain how he came to allow such conduct, when he remarked u that the horses were loaned to his men in order to visit a rebel camp.” On another occasion, while at Benton, I gave positive orders that no man should pass the line of sentinels without my permission, in defiance of which the aforesaid captain did pass a number of his men out without consulting me, and the first intimation I had of it was that I saw two of his men breaking open a house which had been vacated and locked. I reported this to him, and directed him to bring his men back, and to attend more strictly to his company, which he failed to do. All of which I respectfully submit.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Lyon, in three columns, under himself, Sigel, and Sturgis, attacked the enemy at 6.30 o’clock on the morning of the 10th, 9 miles southeast of Springfield. Engagement severe. Our loss about 800. killed and wounded. General Lyon killed in charge at head of his column. Our force 8,000, including 2,000 Home Guards. Muster roll reported taken from the enemy 23,000, including regiments from Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, with Texan Eangers and Cherokee half-breeds. This statement corroborated by prisoners.
Their loss reported heavy, including Generals McCulloch and Price. Their tents and wagons destroyed in the action. Sigel left one gun on the field, and returned to Springfield, whence, at 3 o’clock in the morning of the 11th, continued his retreat upon Eolla, bringing oft* his baggage trains and $250,000 in specie from Springfield Bank. I am doing what is possible to support him, but need aid of some organized force to repel the enemy, reported advancing on other points in considerable strength.

battle of Wilson’s creek, mo.

Saint Louis, August 30, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to transmit herewith the official reports of the several commanders of the United States forces lately engaged under the late Brigadier-General Lyon at Wilson’s Creek, near Spring-field, Mo., August 10, 1861. The duties at my headquarters have been so various and pressing that I have not untii now been able to submit these reports. I have thought proper to make them a substitute for the more formal return of killed, wounded, and missing, as required by regulations; tables or lists of which will be found embraced with the reports.*
The attention of the Department will be attracted to the very commendable gallantry of our troops, contending as they did against fearful odds—that of more than five to one—and I cordially recommend that this appreciation of the services of the officers and soldiers be accompanied with more substantial marks of the favor of the Government.
After completely driving the enemy from his positions with none of his force in sight, the successor of the brave General Lyon, Maj. S. D. Sturgis, U. S. Army, drew off his column, in good order, to a position 2 miles from the battle ground, awaiting the movements of General Sigel’s column.
The further withdrawal of the army from Springfield to Rolla was undoubtedly based upon good reasons, such as will appear evident from Major Sturgis’ report. The exhaustion consequent upon a six hours’ conflict, the great drain upon their supply of ammunition, and the expected re-enforcement of the enemy, all seem to justify the act of the commander in deciding to make no further efforts for maintaining his position in or near Springfield.
The following-named officers, distinguished for highly important services and marked gallantry, are hereby recommended to the special consideration of the Government:
Maj. S. D. Sturgis, First Cavalry, U. S. Army, distinguished for marked intrepidity and gallantry and for highly meritorious services, both before and after the fall of General Lyon.
Maj. J. M. Schofield, first lieutenant First Artillery, major First Missouri Volunteers, and acting adjutant-general to General Lyon, distinguished for cool and conspicuous courage and for his constant effort to inspire confidence among the troops.
Capt. Gordon Granger, Regiment Mounted Rifles, acting assistant adjutant-general to Major Sturgis, distinguished for active and conspicuous gallantry, and for highly valuable services in reconn offering the enemy, assisting in the service of the batteries, and in rallying and inspiring confidence amongst the troops.
. Capt. James Totten, Second Artillery, commanding light battery, distinguished for conspicuously gallant and meritorious conduct and for highly important and valuable services in the command of his battery throughout all the operations of the day. His name deserves to become “a household word.”
Second Lieut. J. V. Du Bois, Regiment Mounted Rifles, U. S. Army, commanding light battery, for gallant and meritorious conduct and for highly important services in the command of his light battery throughout the entire conflict.
Lieutenant Sokalski, attached to Totten’s light battery, distin-

Report of Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon, II. 8. Army, commanding Army of the West, of operations August 5-9.
Springfield, Mo., August 9,1861.
General : I have just received your note of the 6th instant by special messenger.
I retired to this place, as I have before informed you, reaching here on the 5th. The enemy followed to within 10 miles of here. He has taken a strong position, and is recruiting his supplies of horses, mules, and provisions by foraging into the surrounding country, his large force of mounted men enabling him to do this without much annoyance from me. I find my position extremely embarrassing, and am at present unable to determine whether I shall be able to maintain my ground or be forced to retire. I can resist any attack from the front, but if the enemy move to surround me, I must retire. I shall hold my ground as long as possible, though I may, without knowing how far, endanger the safety of my entire force, with its valuable material, being induced by the important considerations involved to take this step. The enemy yesterday made a show of force about five miles distant, and has doubtless a fuil* purpose of making an attack upon me.

Report of Maj. John M. Schofield, First Missouri Infantry, and Acting Adjutant-General Army of the West, of operations August 1-14.
Camp near Rolla, Mo.,
August 20, 1861.
From the time of the arrival of General Lyon’s command at Spring-field till that of the bfittle we were well informed through our scouts and spies of the movements and strength of the enemy. It was General Lyon’s opinion, and doubtless a correct one, that could we have moved forward at once and succeeded in bringing the enemy to an engagement, we would have gained an easy victory; but this movement was impossible. We found our commissary stores, which had been ordered from Saint Louis at the time of our marching from Booneville,

﻿58 operations IN mo., are., rans., and ind. t. [Chap. x.
were still lying at Rolla for transportation. We were consequently thrown upon such resources as the country afforded for subsistence. The heavy rains j>revented the farmers from thrashing their wheat, and our daily expected supplies from Rolla failed to come, so that at no time could our troops have full rations of brearl, and much of the time they had no coffee or sugar. In the event of a forward movement even these limited supplies must have failed. Under these circumstances, the general made frequent and urgent appeals to the Government for aid in troops and provisions. It was well known that the strength of the enemy was rapidly increasing; that he was continually receiving small-arms and artillery from the South, with well-disciplined troops, while our numbers were continually diminishing by the discharge of three-months’ volunteers, and the strength of our troops wasting from privation, and large numbers of them were entirely without shoes.
To all these appeals for aid no favorable response was received. We were not even encouraged to hope for re-enforcements. Amidst these embarrassments General Lyon early and frequently expressed the most gloomy forebodings for the future. He saw clearly the inevitable necessity of either retiring to Rolla, and abandoning to the enemy all the southwest portion of Missouri and Southern Kansas, or of risking the utter destruction of his little army and the loss of all his material of war in a desperate engagement with a vastly superior force of the enemy.
It soon appeared that the enemy’s design was to move upon Spring-field in three different columns, by the routes leading to that place from Cassville, Ilarrisonville, and Greenfield. General Lyon at once determined to await their approach only till they were within about two days’ march of our position, and then to move out and attack the strongest column, and in the event of success to turn upon the others.
In pursuance of this plan, it having been ascertained that the advance guard of the enemy had reached a point on the Cassville road about 18 miles from Springfield, General Lyon marched on the [1st] of August to the crossing of Wilson’s Creek, 10 miles from Springfield, and was there joined by the force under Major Sturgis, then encamped near Little York, about 4 miles west from the crossing ; two detachments, under Colonel Deifczler and Captain Carr, which were absent, obtaining provisions, having been ordered to join the command as soon as possible.
A small advanced picket of the enemy was met at about 9 o’clock the next morning, and fled upon our approach. Toward evening of the same day the enemy’s advanced guard, of considerable strength, was met near Dug Springs, about 23 miles from Springfield, and after a brisk skirmish of several hours with a few companies of infantry, under Capt. Frederick Steele, Second Infantry, and Lieut. W. L. Lothrop, Fourth Artillery, a company of cavalry under Captain Stanley, and, finally, Captain Totten’s battery, together with two pieces of the battery attached to Colonel Sigel’s brigade, was driven in confusion from the field, suffering considerable loss.
The next morning a small force was again discovered at Curran Post Office, 3 miles from Dug Springs, but fled upon the first fire of artillery, our whole column moving forward and occupying their camp, the Second Regiment Kansas Volunteers (Colonel Mitchell) even pushing on by the left flank of our position to McCulla’s, 2 miles beyond, without seeing any sign of the enemy in force. It was too late in the

## p. 59 (#73) ##############################################

﻿Chap. X.]	BATTLE OE WILSON’S CREEK, MO.	59
day to make an attack upon what appeared to be the enemy’s position, and hence our troops bivouacked for the night.
It had now become apparent that the enemy was only seeking to amuse us by demonstrations upon our front and flanks while he could retire to a strong position and be re-enforced by the columns that had been moving towards Springfield by the other routes, and which were making forced marches to join him. The general therefore called a council of the principal officers of his command, and laid before them the question whether we should advance or retreat, explained at some length the possible and probable consequences of either course, and asked the opinion of each officer present. The question was discussed at considerable length and opinions freely given. While all appeared to be willing, and most, if not all, anxious, to risk a pitched battle, if one could be brought on before our supplies were exhausted and our men so far weakened as to leave no chance of success, it was the unanimous opinion of all present that under the existing circumstances there was nothing left us but to retire. The order to retire was therefore given, and on the afternoon of the 6th the main body encamped about Springfield, while about 2,000 regulars and volunteers, under Major Sturgis and Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews, remained 4 miles from the town.
The enemy did not make his appearance during our retreat, but the next day after our arrival at Springfield, his advance guard encamped at Wilson’s Creek. An attack upon this advanced force was planned for the night after its arrival at Wilson’s Creek, and orders were issued for the advance of a portion of the force under Major Sturgis and Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews $ but owing to the lateness of the hour when our spies returned with the necessary information, and other adverse circumstances, the plan was abandoned, and the commands of Major Sturgis and Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews took position in the line of defense about Springfield the next day.
Strong advanced parties of the enemy moved forward during the day, and were engaged by our cavalry scouts. An attack was hourly expected, and our troops were kept upon their arms during the day. Frequent alarms from country people and Home Guards, who came rushing into town and reporting the advance of the enemy, served to worry and fatigue the troops, and deprive them of the rest which was absolutely necessary to fit them for battle after their fatiguing march. At length, about the middle of the day, a report from one of our scouting parties showed the enemy advancing, with a considerable force of infantry and two pieces of artillery, on the Little York road, and a force of regulars and Kansas volunteers, with two pieces of artillery from Colonel Sigel’s brigade, was sent out to meet them. The report proved in the main false, the small force of the enemy fled, and our troops returned without meeting it, having made a rapid march of 9 miles.
General Lyon then determined to make a night march with his entire force down the Cassville road, upon the front of the enemy’s position, and attack him at dawn in the morning. The chief officers of his command were called together to receive instructions relative to the order of march and plan of attack. Many of the officers were so strongly of the opinion that the execution of the plan was impossible, on account of the exhausted condition of a large portion of the troops, that the plan was abandoned, and the evening and next day spent in recruiting the strength of the men, supplying them with shoes, which had recently arrived from Eolla, and in making all possible preparations for battle. Meanwhile our scouts were kept well out towards the enemy’s position,

and Attacked his scouts with vigor whenever opportunity offered. The enemy showed no indication of an intention to advance in force, and hence our troops enjoyed comparative quiet during the day, and at evening were in good condition for battle.
During the forenoon of that day, the 9th of August, General Lyon and Colonel Sigel held a consultation, the result of which was the plan of attack upon the enemy’s position at Wilson’s Creek, which led to the battle of the 10th. I was not present at the conference, having spent the morning in going the rounds of the camp to see if any improvement could be made in our dispositions for defense, thinking all intention of making an attack had been abandoned. Upon my return General Lyon informed me of his determination to make the attack the next morning, and gave me the general features of the plan, but owing to press of business did not go much into detail. Colonel Sigel was to move with his brigade, consisting of the Third and Fifth Regiments of Missouri troops, six pieces of artillery, and two companies of cavalry (regulars), to the left of the main Cassville road, and leading to the right of the enemy’s position, while General Lyon, with the remainder of his force, consisting of the First Missouri, First Iowa, First and Second Kansas, two companies of the Second Missouri, a company of riflemen, eight companies of regular infantry and rifle recruits, ten pieces of artillery, • and two companies of cavalry, amounting to about 4,000 men, besides about 250 mounted Home Guards, was to move down the road towards Little York to a point nearly opposite the enemy’s advanced pickets on Wilson’s Creek, and thence across the prairie, and attack his left flank. Colonel Sigel was to make the attack as soon as he heard that of General Lyon.
The column under General Lyon reached the point where the enemy’s most advanced picket was expected to be found at about 1 o’clock at night. The picket not having been found, the column halted and the men lay on their arms till early dawn, when the match was resumed, Captain Plummer’s battalion of regular infantry in advance, Major Osterhaus’ battalion of Missouri volunteers following, with Captain Totten’s battery. At about 4 o’clock the enemy’s picket was reached, and fled upon our approach. Major Osterhaus’ battalion was then sent on the right as skirmishers, Captain Plummer being on the left, and the First Regiment Missouri Volunteers, under Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews, brought forward to the support of Totten’s battery.
With this disposition the column moved forward about one and a half miles, when at about 5 o’clock a brisk skirmish was opened along our entire front. The enemy was now discovered in considerable force, occupying the crest of a ridge running nearly perpendicularly to our line of march and also to the valley of Wilson’s Creek, and lying between us and his main camp. The First Missouri Volunteers was now sent forward and deployed in line of battle, at once advancing upon the ridge under a brisk fire, and driving the enemy from his position on our right, while the First Kansas came forward and engaged the enemy on our left, causing him to retire. Captain Totten’s battery meanwhile moved forward in the center and reached the crest of the ridge.
The enemy now rallied in large force near the foot of the slope, and under considerable cover opposite our left wing and along the slope in front and on our right towards the crest of the main ridge running parallel to the creek. During this time Captain Plummer, with his four companies of infantry, had moved down a ridge about 500 yards to our left, and separated from us by a deep ravine, and reached its abrupt terminus, where he found his farther progress arrested by a large force

Chap; X.J	BATTLE OF WILSON^ CREEK, MO.
of infantry occupying a corn field in the valley in his front. At this moment an artillery fire was opened from a high point* about 2 miles nearly in our front, from which Colonel Sigel was to have commenced his attack. This fire was answered from the opposite side of the valley, and at a little greater distance from us, the line of fire of the two batteries being nearly perpendicular to our own. After about ten or twelve shots on either side the firing ceased, and we neither heard nor saw anything more of Colonel Sigel’s brigade till about 8.30 o’clock, when a brisk cannonading was heard for a few minutes about a mile to our right of that heard before, and from 2 to 3 miles distant. This was the last during the battle.
Our whole line now advanced with much energy upon the enemy’s position, the firing, which had been spirited for the last half hour, now increasing to a continuous roar. During this time Captain Totten’s battery came into action by section and by piece, as the nature of the ground would permit (it being wooded with much undergrowth), and played upon the enemy’s lines with great effect. After a fierce engagement, lasting perhaps half an hour, and in which our troops retired two or three times in more or less of disorder, but never more than a few yards, again to rally and press forward with increased vigor, the enemy gave way in the utmost confusion, and left us in possession of the position.
Meanwhile Captain Plummer was ordered to move forward on our left, but meeting with overpowering resistance from the large mass of infantry in the corn field in his front and in the woods beyond, was compelled to fall back j but at this moment Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery, which had taken position on our left flank, supported by Major Oster-haus’ battalion, opened upon the enemy in the corn field a fire of shells with such marked effect as to drive him in the utmost disorder from the field.
There was now a momentary cessation of fire along nearly the whole line, except the extreme right, where the First Missouri was still hotly engaged with a superior force of the enemy attempting to turn our right. The general having been informed of this movement sent the Second Kansas Begiment to the support of the First Missouri. It came up in time to prevent the Missourians from being destroyed by the overwhelming force against which they were unflinchingly holding their position.
The battalion of regular infantry, under Captain Steele, which had been detailed to the support of Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery, was during this time brought forward to the support of Captain Totten’s battery. Scarcely had these dispositions been made when the enemy again appeared in very large force along our entire front and moving towards each flank. The engagement at once became general, and almost inconceivably fierce, along the entire line, the enemy appearing in front often in three or four ranks, lying down, kneeling, and standing, the lines often approaching to within 30 or 40 yards, as the enemy would charge upon Captain Totten’s battery and be driven back. Early in this engagement the First Iowa Begiment came into line, and relieved the First Kansas, which had been thrown into some disorder and compelled to retire.
Every available battalion was now brought into action, and the battle raged with unabated fury for more than an hour, the scale seeming all the time nearly equally balanced, our troops sometimes gaining a little ground and again giving way a few yards to rally again.
Early in this engagement, while General Lyon was leading his horse

OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
along the line on the left of Captain Totten’s battery, and endeavoring to rally our troops, which were at this time in considerable disorder, his horse was killea, and he received a wound in the leg and one in the head. He walked slowly a few paces to the re&r and said, u I fear the day is lost.” But upon being encouraged that our troops could again be rallied, that the disorder was only temporary, he passed over to the right of the center, where our line seemed to be giving way, obtained another horse, and, swinging his hat in the air, led forward the troops, who promptly rallied around him. A few moments later he was carried from the field dead. His death was known at the time to but very few, and those few seemed to fight with redoubled valor.
Meanwhile our disordered line on the left was again rallied, and pressed the enemy with great vigor and coolness, particularly the First Iowa Begiment, which fought like veterans. This hot encounter lasted perhaps half an hour after General Lyon’s death, when the enemy fled, and left the field clear as far as we could see, and almost total silence reigned for twenty-five or thirty minutes.
As soon as the enemy began to give way, and it became apparent that the field was at least for the present ours, the principal officers of the command were informed of General Lyon’s death, and Major Sturgis assumed command. He at once called together the chief officers in his vicinity, and consulted with them as to the course that should be pursued. The question was a very perplexing one. Nothing had been heard from Colonel Sigel for a long time. No one could tell where he was or what he was doing. Should we move forward in pursuit of the enemy without knowing whether we should receive any support from Sigel, should we make a detour to the left and attempt to join him, or should we withdraw from the field ?
At this time a considerable force of infantry was seen to move around the right of the position from which Sigel’s cannonading had been seen some time before and advance in column toward the front of our left wing. These troops wore a dress resembling extremely that of Colonel Sigel’s men, and carried the American flag. The opinion was general that this was Sigel’s brigade, and preparations were commenced to move to the left and front and join him. Meanwhile the column in front moved down the hill within easy reach of our artillery, but was permitted to move on unmolested till it had reached the covered position at the foot of the ridge on which we were posted, and from which we had been so fiercely assailed before. But suddenly a battery was planted on the hill in our front, and began to pour upon us shrapnel and canister, species of shot which had not been fired by the enemy before. At this moment the enemy showed his true colors, and at once commenced along our entire line the fiercest and most bloody engagement of the day. Lieutenant Hu Bois’ battery on our left, gallantly supported by Major Osterhaus’ battalion and the rallied fragments of the First Missouri, soon silenced the enemy’s battery on the hill and repulsed the right wing of his infantry. Captain Totten’s battery in the center, supported by the First Iowa and regulars, was the main point of attack. The enemy could frequently be seen within 20 or 30 feet of his guns, and the smoke of the opposing lines was often so confounded as to seem but one.
Now for the first time during the day our entire line maintained its position with perfect firmness. Not the slightest disposition to give way was manifested at any point, till finally the enemy gave way and fled from the field.
A few moments before the close of the engagement the Second Kan-

sas Begiment, which had firmly maintained its position on the extreme right from the time it was first sent there, found its ammunition exhausted, and was ordered to retire, which it did slowly and in good order, bringing off its wounded. This left our right exposed, and the enemy renewed the attack at that point after it had ceased along the line, but was met by Captain Steele’s battalion, which had just driven the enemy from the right of the center, and after a sharp engagement drove him precipitately from the field.
Thus closed, at about 11.30 o’clock, an almost uninterrupted conflict of nearly six hours. The order to retire was given immediately after the enemy gave way from our front and center, and Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery at once took position with its supports on a hill in our rear. Captain Totten’s battery, as soon as his disabled horses could be replaced, retired slowly with the main body of the infantry, while Captain Steele was meeting the demonstration upon our right flank. This having been repulsed, and no enemy being in sight, the whole column moved slowly to the high open prairie about 2 miles from the battle ground. Our ambulances meanwhile passed to and fro, carrying off our wounded, and after making a short halt upon the prairie we continued our march to Springfield.
It should be here remarked that just after the order to retire had been given, and while it was still undecided whether the retreat should be continued or whether we should occupy the more favorable position in our rear and await tidings of Colonel Sigel, one of his men reached us, and reported that his brigade had been totally routed and all his artillery captured, Colonel Sigel himself having been either killed or taken prisoner. Most of our men had fired away all their ammunition and all that could be obtained from the boxes of the killed and wounded. There was then nothing left us but to return to Springfield.
Upon reaching the Little York road we met Lieutenant Farrand with his company of cavalry and a considerable portion of Colonel Sigel’s command, with one piece of artillery. We reached Springfield at 5 o’clock p. in., and had the satisfaction of learning that Colonels Sigel and Salomon had each arrived there some hours before in safety. I at once started for Colonel Sigel’s quarters, and met him riding towards mine. He told me of his disaster, and said we must decide upon our course for the future. A council was called at my quarters, and was attended by nearly all the chief officers who were able.
Major Sturgis explained the circumstances under which he had assumed command upon* the field; stated his convictions of the necessity for our retreating towards Bolla at once and before the enemy could organize for pursuit, and resigned His command to Colonel Sigel.
Yo difference of opinion seemed to exist as to the. propriety and even necessity of the course proposed by Major Sturgis, and the necessary orders were at once issued, 2 o’clock a. m. being the hour designated for the march to commence, in order that the entire column, with its long train (370 wagons), might leave the town and obtain favorable ground lor defense before dawn, when an attack would probably be made if one were contemplated.
Colonel Sigel arranged the order of march, his brigade and the Iowa regiment forming the advance guard, followed by the baggage train, then the main body of the army, and lastly Major Sturgis’ brigade of regulars. I gave the necessary instructions for the movement of the various portions of the train and of the different commands ; made provision for the transportation of such of the wounded as could be carried with us and for the care of such as must be left behind, detailing four

surgeons for this duty; went to the various camps, except Colonel SigePs, and saw that ail possible preparation was made. At 1.30 o’clock I went to Colonel SigePs camp, and found his wagons not loaded, his men apparently making preparations to cook their breakfast, and no preparations to march. I could find no officer to execute my commands nor any one to pay the slightest heed to what I said. I rode at once to Colonel SigePs quarters, arriving there at 2 o’clock, and found him asleep in bed. I aroused him, told him the hour for marching had arrived, and that all were ready except his brigade. I urged upon him the importance of marching at once if at all. He said, u Yes; I will move at once.” I started the train immediately, and sent the Iowa regiment ahead, directing it to halt about a mile from town. In this condition the column was delayed more than two hours for Colonel SigePs brigade, so that the rear guard could not leave town till about 0 o’clock.
During the first three days of our retreat the same order of march was preserved, the same troops doing the fatiguing duties of rear guard, in spite of my remonstrances. Although we made daily marches of only ordinary length, long halts were made in the middle of the day, so that while the advance guard would reach camp at night early enough to obtain and cook provisions, the rear guard would be in the road till long after dark, and in the inextricable confusion resulting from the attempt to encamp a large force with an immense train in an extremely rough and wooded country in a dark night, many would abandon as hopeless the attempt to find their wagons and get them in position, and lie down without food. Many of our men were compelled to go twenty-four hours without a morsel, and some much longer.
On the morning of the third day the whole column was detained three hours for Colonel SigePs brigade to have beef killed and cooked for breakfast, the remainder of the command*having made their breakfast upon such as they had, and, with the exception of the Iowa regiment, marched 6 miles before the killing of beef for Colonel SigePs breakfast commenced.
By this time the clamor for relief became such that almost total anarchy reigned in the command. At length, after numerous entreaties from officers of the command, Major Sturgis resumed command of the army, giving as his reason for so doing, that, although Colonel Sigel had been for a long time acting as an officer of the army, he had no appointment from any competent authority.
Upon this change of command I was relieved from the duties of adjutant-general, and took command of my regiment, then without a field officer, and much in need of my care. My fupctions as acting adjutant-general of this command therefore ceased on the 14th instant.
Respectfully submitted.

miles south of the city, between the United States troops under General Lyon and the rebel forces under McCulloch.
On the 9th instant General Lyon came to the determination of attacking the enemy’s camp, and accordingly dispositions were made on the afternoon of that day for an attack at daylight next morning (10th). The command was to move in two columns, composed as follows:
The first, under General Lyon, consisted of one battalion regular infantry, under Captain Plummer—Companies B, C, and D, First Infantry, Captains Gilbert, Plummer, and Huston—with one company of rifle recruits, under Lieutenant Wood; Major Osterhaus’ battalion, Second Missouri Volunteers, two companies; Captain Totten’s light battery, six pieces, and Captain Wood’s mounted company of the Second Kansas Volunteers, with Lieutenant Canfield’s company, First Cavalry, regulars. This constituted the First Brigade, under Major Sturgis.
The Second Brigade, under Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews, First Missouri Volunteers, was composed of Captain Steele’s battalion of regulars, Companies B and E, Second Infantry; one company of recruits, under Lieutenant Lothrop, Fourth Artillery ; one company of recruits, under Sergeant Morine; Lieutenant Hu Bois’ light battery, consisting of four pieces, one of which was a 12-pounder gun, and the First Missouri Volunteers.
The Third Brigade was made up of the First and Second Kansas Volunteers, under Deitzler, Colonel Mitchell commanding the latter regiment. The First Begiment Iowa Volunteers, with some 200 Home Guards (mounted), completed the column under General Lyon.
The second column, under Colonel Sigel, consisted of the Third and Fifth Regiments Missouri Volunteers; one company of cavalry, under Captain Carr; one company Second Dragoons, under Lieutenant Far-rand (First Infantry), and one light battery of six pieces. This column was to march by road on the left of the main Cassville road, and leading to the supposed right of the enemy’s position.
Here my official information of the movements of Colonel Sigel’s column ceases, as we have not been able to procure any written report of its operations. General Lyon marched from Springfield at 5 o’clock p. m. on the 9th, making a detour to the right, at 1 o’clock in the morning arriving in view of the enemy’s guard fires. Here the column halted and lay on their arms until the dawn of day, when it again moved forward. Captain Gilbert’s company, which had formed the advance during the night, still remained in advance, and the column moved in the same order in which it had halted.
A southeasterly direction was now taken, with a view to strike the extreme northern point of the enemy’s camp. At daylight a line of battle was formed, closely followed by Totten’s battery, supported by a strong reserve. In this order we advanced, with skirmishers in front, until the first outpost of the rebels was encountered and driven in, when the column was halted, and the following dispositions made, viz: Captain Plummer’s battalion, with the Home Guards on his left, were to cross Wilson’s Creek and move towards the front, keeping pace with the advance on the opposite bank, for the purpose of protecting our left flank against any attempt of the enemy to turn it. After crossing a ravine and ascending a high ridge, we came in full view of a considerable force of the enemy’s skirmishers. Major Osterhaus’ battalion was at once deployed to the right, and two companies of the First Mis souri Volunteers, under Captains Yates and Cavender, were deployed to the left, all as skirmishers. The firing now became very severe, and 5 R r—VOL in

it was evident we were approaching the enemy’s stronghold, where they intended giving battle. A few shells from Totten’s battery assisted our skirmishers in clearing the ground in front.
The First Missouri and First Kansas moved at once to the front, supported by Totten’s battery 5 and the First Iowa Regiment, Du Bois’ battery, Steele’s battalion, and the Second Kansas were held in reserve. The Missouri First now took its position in front, upon the crest of a small elevated plateau. The First Kansas was posted on the left of the First Missouri, and separated from it some 60 yards on account of a ravine. The First Iowa took its position on the left of the First Kansas, while Totten’s battery was placed opposite the interval between the First Kansas and the First Missouri. Major Osterhaus’ battalion occupied the extreme right, with his right resting on a ravine which turned abruptly to our right and rear. Du Bois’ battery, supported by Steele’s battalion, was placed some 80 yards to left and rear of Totten’s guns, so as to bear upon a powerful battery of the enemy, posted to our left and front, on the opposite side of Wilson’s Creek, to sweep the entire plateau upon which our troops were formed.
The enemy now rallied in large force near the foot of the slope, and under considerable cover opposite our left wing, and along the slope in front, and on our right towards the crest of the main range running parallel to the creek. During this time Captain Plummer, with his four companies of infantry, had moved down a ridge about 500 yards to our left, and separated from us by a deep ravine, and reached its abrupt terminus, where he found his farther progress arrested by a large force of infantry occupying a corn field in the valley in his front. At this moment an artillery fire was opened from a high point about 2 miles distant, and nearly in our front, from which Colonel Sigel was to have commenced his attack. This fire was answered from the opposite side of the valley, and at a little greater distance from us, the line of fire of the batteries being nearly perpendicular to our own. After about ten or twelve shots on either side the firing ceased, and we neither heard nor saw anything more of Colonel Sigel’s brigade until about 8.30 o’clock, when a brisk cannonading was heard for a few minutes about a mile to the right of that heard before, and from 2 to 3 miles distant.
Our whole line now advanced with much energy upon the enemy’s position. The firing, which had been spirited for the last half hour, was now increasing to a continuous roar. During this time, Captain Totten’s battery came into action by section and by piece, as the nature of the ground would permit (it being wooded, with much undergrowth), and played upon the enemy’s lines with great effect. After a fierce engagement, lasting perhaps half an hour, and in which our troops retired two or three times, in more or less disorder, but never more than a few yards, again to rally and press forward with increased vigor, the enemy gave way in the utmost confusion, and left us in possession of the position. Meanwhile Captain Plummer was ordered to move forward on our left, but meeting with overpowering resistance from the large mass of infantry in the corn field in his front and in the woods beyond, was compelled to fall back ;■ but at this moment Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery, which had taken position on our left flank, supported by Captain Steele’s battalion, opened upon the enemy in the corn field a fire of shells with such marked effect as to drive him in the utmost confusion and with great slaughter from the field.
There was now a momentary cessation of fire along nearly the whole line, except the extreme right, where the First Missouri was still en-

gaged with a superior force of the enemy, attempting to turn our right. The general having been informed of this movement, sent the Second Kansas to the support of the First Missouri. It came up in time to prevent the Missourians from being destroyed by the overwhelming force against which they were unflinchingly holding their position.
The battalion of regular infantry, under Captain Steele, which had been detailed to the support of Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery, was during this time brought forward to the support of Captain Totten’s battery. Scarcely had these dispositions been made, when the enemy again appeared in very large force along our entire front and moving towards each flank. The engagement at once became general, and almost inconceivably fierce, along the entire line ; the enemy appearing in front often in three or four ranks, lying down, kneeling, and standing, the lines often approaching to within 30 or 40 yards of each other, as the enemy would charge upon Captain Totten’s battery and be driven back. Early in the engagement the First Iowa came to the support of the First Kansas and First Missouri, both of which had stood like veteran troops, exposed to a galling fire of the enemy.
Every available battalion was now brought into action, and the battle raged with unabated fury for more than an hour 5 the scales seeming all the time nearly equally balanced, our troops sometimes gaining a little ground, and again giving way a few yards to rally again. Early in this engagement, while General Lyon was leading his horse along the line on the left of Captain Totten’s battery and endeavoring to rally our troops, which were at this time in considerable disorder, his horse was killed, and he received a wound in the leg and one in the head. He walked slowly a few paces to the rear and said, u I fear the day is lost.” I then dismounted one of my orderlies, and tendered the horse to the general, who at first declined, saying it was not necessary. The horse, however, was left with him, and I moved off to rally a portion of the Iowa regiment, which was beginning to break in considerable numbers.
In the mean time the general mounted, and swinging his hat in the air, called to the troops nearest him to follow. The Second Kansas, or at least a portion of it, gallantly rallied around him, headed by the brave Colonel Mitchell. In a few moments the colonel fell, severely wounded; about the same time a fatal ball was lodged in the general’s breast, and he was carried from the field a corpse. Thus gloriously fell as brave a soldier as ever drew a sword, a man whose honesty of purpose was proverbial, a noble patriot, and one who held his life as nothing when his country demanded it of him.
Of this dire calamity I was not informed until perhaps half an hour after its occurrence, in the mean time our disordered line on the left was again rallied and pressed the enemy with great vigor and coolness, particularly the First Iowa Eegiment, which fought like veterans. This hot encounter lasted perhaps half an hour.
Major Schofield now informed me of the death of General Lyon, and reported for orders. The responsibility which rested upon me was duly felt and appreciated. Our brave little army was scattered and broken; over 20,000 men were still in our front, and our men had had no water since 5 o’clock the evening before, and could hope for none short of Springfield, 12 miles distant. If vre should go forward, our own success would prove our certain defeat in the end; if we retreated, disaster stared us in the face. Our ammunition was well-nigh exhausted, and should the enemy make this discovery through a slackening of our fire, total annihilation was all we could expect. The great

﻿68	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Ciiai>. X.
question in my mind was, u Where is Sigel t” If I could still hope for a vigorous attack by him on the enemy’s right flank or rear, then we could go forward with some hope of success. If he had retreated, there was nothing else left for us.
In this perplexing condition of affairs I summoned the principal officers for consultation. The question with most of them was, u Is retreat possible ? ” The consultation was brought to a close by the advance of a heavy column of infantry advancing from the hill where Sigel’s guns had been heard before. Supposing they were Sigel’s men, the line was formed for an advance, with the hope of forming a junction with him. These troops wore a dress much resembling that of SigePs brigade, and carried the American flag. They were therefore permitted to move down the hill within easy range of Du Bois’ battery, until they had reached the covered position at the foot of the ridge on which we were posted, and from which we had been fiercely assailed before, when suddenly a battery was planted on the hill in our front, and began to pour upon us shrapnel and canister—a species of shot not before fired by the enemy.
At this moment the enemy showed his true colors, and at once commenced along our entire lines the fiercest and most bloody engagement of the day. Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery on our left, gallantly supported by Major Qsterhaus’ battalion and the rallied fragments of the Missouri First, soon silenced the enemy’s battery on the hill and repulsed the right wing of the infantry. Captain Totten’s battery in the center, supported by the lowas and regulars, was the main point of attack. The enemy could frequently be seen within 20 feet of Totten’s guns, and the smoke of the opposing lines was often so confounded as to seem but one.
Now for the first time during the day our entire line maintained its position with perfect firmness. Not the slightest disposition to give way was manifested at any point, and while Captain Steele’s battalion, which was some yards in front of the line, together with the troops on the right and left, were in imminent danger of being overwhelmed by superior numbers, the contending lines being almost muzzle to muzzle, Captain Granger rushed to the rear and brought up the supports of Du Bois’ battery, consisting of two or three companies of the First Missouri, three companies of the First Kansas, and two companies of the First Iowa, in quick time, and fell upon the enemy’s right flank, and poured into it a murderous volley, killing or wounding nearly every man within 60 or 70 yards. From this moment a perfect rout took place throughout the rebel front, while ours, on the right flank, continued to pour a galling fire into their disorganized masses. It was then evident that Totten’s battery and Steele’s little battalion were safe. Among the officers conspicuous in leading this assault were Adjutant Hescock, Captains Burke, Miller, Manter, Maurice, and Bichardson, and Lieutenant Howard, all of the First Missouri. There were others of the First Kansas and First Iowa who participated, but whose names I do not remember. The enemy then fled from the field. A few moments before the close of the engagement the Second Kansas, which had firmly maintained its position on the extreme right from the time it was first sent there, found its ammunition exhausted, and I directed it to withdraw slowly and in good order from the field, which it did, bringing off its wounded. This left our right flank exposed, and the enemy renewed the attack at that point, after it had ceased along the whole line; but it was gallantly met by Captain Steele’s battalion of regulars, which had just driven the enemy from the right of the center, and after a sharp engagement drove him precipitately from the field.

﻿Chap. X.]	BATTLE OF WILSON^ CREEK, MO.	69
Thus closed, at about 11.30 o’clock, an almost uninterrupted conflict of six hours. The order to retreat was given soon after the enemy gave way from our front and center, Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery having been previously sent to occupy, with its supports, the hill in our rear. Captain Totten’s battery, as soon as his disabled horses could be replaced, retired slowly with the main body of the infantry, while Captain Steele was meeting the demonstrations upon our right flank. This having been repulsed, and no enemy being in sight, the whole column moved slowly to the high open prairie about 2 miles from the battle ground. Meanwhile our ambulance^ passed to and fro, carrying off our wounded. After making a short halt on the prairie, we continued our march to Springfield.
It should be remembered that just after the order to retire was given, and while it was undecided whether the retreat should be continued, or whether we should occupy the more favorable position in our rear, and await tidings of Colonel Sigel, one of his non-commissioned officers arrived, and reported that the colonel’s brigade had been totally routed and all his artillery captured, Colonel Sigel himself being either killed or made prisoner. Most of our men had fired away all their ammunition and all that could be obtained from the boxes of the killed and wounded. Nothing, therefore, was left to do but to return to Spring-field, where 250 Home Guards, with two pieces of artillery, had been left to take care of the train. On reaching the Little York road we met Lieutenant Farrand, with his company of dragoons and a considerable portion of Colonel Sigel’s command, with one piece of artillery. At 5 o’clock p. m. we reached Springfield.
Thus closed a day long to be remembered in the annals of history; a day which has brought gloom and sorrow to many hearts throughout the land 5 but fathers and mothers, widows and orphans, may receive some consolation from the fact that their relatives and friends presented on that day a wall of adamant to the enemies of their country, and when they fell it was in defense of a great cause, and with their breasts to the enemy. That 3,700 men, after a fatiguing night march, attacked the enemy, numbering 23,000, on their own ground, and after a bloody conflict of six hours withdrew at their leisure to return to their provisions and to water, is the best eulogium I can pass on their conduct that day; and, indeed, it would be impossible to refer to individual acts of courage without doing injustice to many gallant men; yet I am constrained to call the attention of the. general commanding to the particularly important services rendered by several officers which came under my own observation.
Wherever the battle most fiercely raged there was General Lyon to be found, and there, too, was Major Schofield, his principal staff officer. The coolness and equanimity with which he moved from point to point carrying orders was a theme of universal admiration. I cannot speak too highly of the invaluable services of Major Schofield and the confidence his example inspired.
Captain Granger, acting assistant adjutant-general on my staff, rendered such excellent aid in various ways, that a full mention of those services would render this report too voluminous for an official statement. Suffice it to say that he appeared to be almost ubiquitous—now sighting a gun of Du Bois’ battery, and before the smoke had cleared away sighting one of Totten’s; at one moment reconnoitering the enemy, and the next either bringing up re-enforcements or rallying some broken line. To whatever part of the field I might direct my attention, there would I find Captain Granger, hard at work at some important serv-

ice; his energy and industry seemed inexhaustible. To the important services rendered by him I beg to call the attention of the commanding general.
The services of Gaptain Totten are so emphatically interwoven with the various operations of the day as to appear in many, if not all the subreports, and his name deserves to become a “ household word.”
Lieutenant Sokalski also deserves great credit for the energy with which he managed the pieces of his section.
I cannot speak in too high praise of the coolness and accuracy with which Lieutenant Du Bois handled his guns, and of the valuable services he rendered throughout the entire conflict.
The following-named officers came under my personal observation during the day, and deserve especial mention for the zeal and courage they displayed, although it would prolong this report to too great a length if I should particularize in each individual case: Lieutenant Conrad, Second Infantry, A. 0. S. to General Lyon (wounded); Major Wherry, volunteer aide-de-camp to General Lyon; Major Shepard, volunteer aide de camp to General Lyon; Mr. E. Oozzens, volunteer aide-de-camp to myself.
General Sweeny, inspector-general. This gallant officer was especially distinguished by his zeal in rallying broken fragments of various regiments (even after receiving a severe wound in the leg), and leading them into the hottest of the fight.
Assistant Surgeon Sprague, medical department, attended the . wounded with as much self-possession as though no battle was raging around him.
Surgeon Oornyn, First Missouri Volunteers, not only took charge of the wounded as they were brought to him, but found time to use a musket with good effect from time to time against the enemy.
Colonel Deitzler, First Kansas. He led liis regiment into a galling fire as coolly and as handsomely as if on drill. He was wounded twice.
Major Halderman, First Kansas. Early in the action he led four companies of his regiment (which had been held in reserve) gallantly, cheering them on with the cry of “Forward, men, for Kansas and the old flag!”
Colonel Mitchell, of the Second Kansas. He fell severely wounded in the thickest of the fight, and, as he was carried from the field, he met a member of my staff, and called out, “For God’s sake, support my regiment.”
Lieutenant-Colonel Blair, Second Kansas. This excellent soldier took command of the regiment when Colonel Mitchell w7as wounded, and under a most deadly fire from the enemy rode along the front of his line, encouraging his men, to the great admiration of all who saw him.
Major Cloud, Second Kansas; Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews, First Missouri; Lieutenant-Colonel Merritt, First Iowa; Major Porter, First Iowa; Captain Herron, First Iowa.
The gallantry of the following officers was conspicuous from the beginning to the close of the battle :
Captain Plummer, First Infantry; Captain Gilbert, First Infantry; Captain Huston, First Infantry; Lieutenant Wood, First Infantry; Captain Steele, Second Infantry; Lieutenant Lothrop, Fourth Artillery ; Lieutenant Canfield, First Cavalry.
Here would I gladly close and draw the vail of silence, and had a report of the operations of the column under Colonel Sigel been received, I would have permitted it to explain itself without comment. But none

﻿Chap. X.]	BATTLE OF WILSON^ CHEEK, MO.	71
has been received, and justice to the cause of truth compels me to give such account of the operations of that column as I have received from some of the officers and men who formed a part of it.
When Colonel Sigel opened his lire the enemy were completely surprised and fled from their camp, whereupon many of Colonel Sigel’s men and officers, instead of standing to their guns or pursuing the enemy, turned their attention to plunder,' and thus permitted the enemy to return, seize all his guns, drive the entire column from the field in every possible direction, and finally turn our own guns upon the gallant men under Lyon, who were contending against such fearful odds already.
Lieutenant Farrand, First Infantry, temporarily in command of a company of dragoons, happened to encounter one of the guns after they had been deserted, and brought it safely from the field, and on our march back to Springfield we met this gallant young officer coming from the direction of Little York at the head of a large portion of such of the command as had escaped being taken prisoners. However it may be in regard to the loss of these guns, one thing is certain (according to Lieutenant Powell), namely: That the gun brought in by Lieutenant Farrand had been abandoned when there was no enemy in sight.
Accompanying this report you will please find reports of the commanders of brigades, regiments, and battalions$ also, a list of the killed, wounded, and missing. I beg to state that I am under many obligations to Major Schofield, from whose memoranda of the movement of troops, &c., on the field I have drawn largely, and in many cases I have copied them literally.
Our total loss in killed, wounded, and missing amounts to 1,236. That of the enemy will probably reach 3,000.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
S. D. STURGIS,
Major, First Cavalry, Commanding. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters Western Department.
[Indorsement.]
February 18, 1862.
The inclosed report is submitted to the honorable Secretary for his attentive consideration. I am informed that the copy forwarded officially was most garbled, and 1 would call the attention of the Secretary to the part really played by General Sigel in this battle. I recommend that all the regular officers honorably mentioned by General Sturgis be brevetted for their gallantry, and that the gallant general himself be not forgotten.
I also recommend that the Secretary request the governors of the States to which the officers of volunteers here mentioned with praise belong, to give them, at the earliest opportunity, one grade as a reward, and that the General Commanding the Army be authorized to mention all their names in orders.
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General.
I would urge that no promotion be, given General Sigel until this matter is fully examined.

Report of Capt. Joseph B. Plummer, First U. 8, Infantry.
Hdqrs. Battalion First Infantry,
August 16, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of my command on the 10th of this month:
Immediately before setting out, Captain Gilbert’s company (B) was thrown forward to feel for the enemy, whose camp was known to b£ in the valley of Wilson’s Creek. As soon as his position was ascertained, which was shortly after sunrise, the general directed me to follow Captain Gilbert with the balance of the battalion, and, uniting with him, to carry forward the left flank of the attack. I overtook Captain Gilbert with his skirmishers in a deep jungle, where he had been checked by an impassable lagoon. Much time was consumed in effecting the passage of this obstacle. The battalion, however, Anally emerged in good order, and all present, into the corn field to the left of the attack, which by this time was in full progress.
The battalion was pushed forward rapidly, and soon the enemy opened on us from the left, but his fire was light and easily quelled. Our advance was in the direction of the enemy’s battery, on the hill opposite Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery, with the intention of storming it, should the opportunity offer. This was observed by the enemy, and a large force was accumulated in our front and on oui* left flank, and our forward progress was checked. Nevertheless, the men stood steadily and squarely up to their work, until I deemed our position no longer tenable, and I then drew off my command, steadily and without confusion, in the direction of Totten’s battery, the key of our position. In this field I had many men killed and wounded. Lieutenant Wood and myself are among the latter. We were materially aided in extricating ourselves by the timely aid of Du Bois’ battery, which beat back the advance of the enemy with much slaughter. On arriving at the foot of the hill, and in the rear of Totten’s battery, I formed the battalion and relinquished the command to Captain Huston, being no longer able

to keep my saddle. Captain Gilbert, with a part of his company , >vas not present, but I have subsequently learned that he proceeded directly to the battery, and took part in the defense of the position until nearly the close of the action, at which time he was wounded and compelled to leave the field.

Report of Capt. James Totten, Second TJ. S. Artillery.
Springfield, Mo., August 19, 1861.
Sir: In obedience to instructions, I have the honor to make the following report relative to the part taken by my company in the battle on Wilson’s Creek, August 10, 1861:
Light Company F, Second Regiment of Artillery, marched, in company with the other troops composing General Lyon’s command, from Springfield on the evening of Friday, August 9, for the position occupied by the enemy. Early on the following morning (August 10,1861), the camp of the Southern army was discovered about one mile and a half south of the head of General Lyon’s command, and soon after the infantry of our advance was fired uj)on by the pickets of the enemy. From this time our march, as directed by General Lyon in person, lay through a small wheat field, across a hill, and down into a small valley which debouches into that through which Wilson’s Creek runs at the point immediately occupied by the front of the enemy, and just where the main road to Springfield enters the valley. Keeping somewhat to the west, our advance crossed this road along the foot of the hills, and soon afterwards our skirmishers found those of the enemy, and the battle opened. Here the left section of my battery, under Lieutenant Sokalski, was at first brought to bear upon the enemy in the woods in front, and shortly afterwards the other four pieces were thrown forward into battery to the right on higher ground. A few rounds from the artillery assisted the infantry of our advance in driving the enemy back from their first position, and they fell back towards the crests of the hills nearer and immediately over their own camp. I now conducted my battery up the hills to the left and front, and soon found a position, where I brought it into battery directly over the northern position of the enemy’s camp.
The camp of General Rains (as I afterwards learned) lay directly beneath my front and to the left, very close to my position, and a battery of the enemy to my front and right, within easy range of my guns. The camp of General Rains was entirely deserted, and therefore my first efforts were directed against the battery of the enemy to the right and front. The left half battery was then brought into position, but the right half battery, in reality occupying the most favorable ground, was principally directed against the enemy’s battery, although the whole six pieces, as opportunity occurred, played upon the enemy’s guns. As the position of the enemy’s guns was masked, the gunners of my pieces were obliged to give direction to their pieces by the flash and smoke of the opposing artillery.

In the meantime the battle was raging in the thick woods and underbrush to the front and right of the position occupied by my battery, and the First Begiment Missouri Volunteers was being hardly pressed. I now received an order from General Lyon to move a section of my battery forward to the support of the First Missouri, which I did in person, coming into battery just in front of the right company of this regiment. Within 200 yards of the position occupied by this section of my battery a regiment of the enemy were in line, with a secession flag and a Federal flag displayed together. This trick of the enemy caused me tor a moment some uncertainty, fearing that by some accident a portion of our own troops might have got thus far in advance, but their fire soon satisfied me upon this,head. I immediately opened upon them with canister from both pieces, in which service, I am happy to be able to say, I was ably and gallantly assisted by Capt. Gordon Granger, acting adjutant-general, and First Lieutenant D. Murphy, First Missouri Volunteers.
The next step in the progress of the battle was where the enemy tried to force his way up the road passing along by their battery towards Springfield. This was an effort to turn the left of our position on the hill where my battery first came into position, and for a time the enemy seemed determined to execute his object. Four pieces of my battery were still in position there, and Captain Du Bois’ battery of four pieces on the left nearer the road. As the enemy showed himself our infantry and artillery opened upon his ranks and drove him back, and they appeared no more during the day.
About this time, and just after (he enemy had been effectually driven back, as last mentioned, I met General Lyon for the last time. He was wounded, he told me, in the leg, and I observed blood trickling from his head. I offered him some brandy, of which I had a small supply in my canteen, but he declined, and rode slowly to the right and front. Immediately after he passed forward General Lyon sent me an order to support the Kansas regiments on the extreme right, who were then being closely pressed by the enemy. I ordered Lieutenant Sokalski to move forward with his section immediately, which he did, and most gallantly, too, relieving and saving the Kansas regiments from being overthrown and driven back. After this the enemy tried to overwhelm us by an attack of some 800 cavalry, which, unobserved, had formed below the crests of the hills to our right and rear. Fortunately, some of our infantry companies and a few pieces of artillery from my battery were in position to meet this demonstration, and drove off their cavalry with ease. This was the only demonstration made by their cavalry, and it was so effete and ineffectual in its force and character as to deserve only the appellation of child’s play. Their cavalry is utterly worthless on the battle-field.
The next and last point where the artillery of my battery was engaged was on the right of the left wing of the Iowa regiment and somewhat in their front. The battle was then, and had been for some time, very doubtful as to its results. General Lyon was killed, and all our forces had been all day engaged, and several regiments were broken and had retired. The enemy, also sadly dispirited, were merely making a demonstration to cover their retreat from the immediate field of battle. At this time the left wing of the Iowa regiment was brought up to support our brave men still in action, while two pieces of my battery were in advance on their right. The last effort was short and decisive, the enemy leaving the field and retiring down through the valley, covered by thick underbrush, to the right of the center of the field of battle to-

Awards their camp on Wilson’s Creek. After this we Avere left unmolested, and our forces were drawn off the field in good order under Major Sturgis, who had assumed command directly after General Lyon’s death.
It should be borne in mind that in the foregoing report I have only glanced at the main points of the battle where the pieces of my own battery of artillery were engaged. I have not entered into details at all, and could not without entering into a more elaborate history of the affair than appears to be called for on this occasion from me.
I wish simply noAv, in conclusion, to make a few deserving remarks upon the conduct of my officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers during the battle. In reference to Lieutenant Sokalski, it gives me the liveliest satisfaction to bear witness to his coolness and bravery throughout the entire day. No officer ever behaved better under as trying circumstances as he found himself surrounded by at times during the day.
The non-commissioned officers and men to a man behaved admirably, and it is hard to distinguish between them in this particular; but I am constrained to mention Sergeants Kobert Armstrong and Gustavus Deyand, Corporals Albert Watchman and Lorenzo D. Trammel, who were on several occasions during the day greatly exposed and severely tried, and bore themselves with great credit. The other non commissioned officers and men were equally deserving and meritorious according to the time they Averein action, but those mentioned were constantly engaged nearly, and deserve particular notice, because they Avere always equal to the duties imposed upon them.*

Report of Lieut. Gol. George L. Andrews, First Missouri Infantry.
Saint Louis, August 28,1861.
Captain : My absence from the regiment in consequence of wounds and injuries received in the battle at Wilson’s Creek, near Springfield, Mo., on the 10th instant, has necessarily delayed my report of the part enacted on that day by the First .Regiment Missouri Volunteers. I ha\7e now the honor to report that the regiment under my command joined the column under the immediate command of General Lyon at 6.30 o’clock p. m. on the 9th instant, and marched out on the road to Little York about 6 miles, when, taking a road running southeast, we advanced in that direction until the head of the column discovered the camp-fires of the rebels. Here the column halted, and remained until 1.15 o’clock on the morning of the 10th instant, when our advance was continued. Soon after the column was again in motion I received an order to bring the regiment forward, and Avhen it arrived up with the head of the column, upon inquiry, was desired to march parallel with

it, and about 60 yards distant. In a few moments I received orders to deploy one company forward as skirmishers, and this was the last order that reached me during the entire day. Company H, Captain Yates, was at once thrown out as skirmishers, closely followed by the regiment in column of companies, and advancing up the hill, the action was commenced by a shot from my skirmishers at 10 minutes past 5 o’clock. Immediately advancing in person, I was informed by Captain Yates, and in another instant saw for myself, that the enemy were in force immediately in our front, and re-enforcing our line of skirmishers with Captain Maurice’s company (B),.I ordered the regiment forward into line. At this moment a heavy fire was opened upon our then left flank by a force heretofore concealed, the regiment wheeling into line and returning the fire, while the first division, deployed as skirmishers, assembled on the right of the regiment, and prevented our flank being turned. The action now became general, and for a short time the fire was very hot. The enemy giving way, the firing almost ceased for a short time. Again they advanced upon us in front, and the right division having been brought into the line of battle, the regiment continued to advance under a galling fire until the enemy again gave way.
At this moment our advance unmasked one of their batteries, which up to this time had played no part in the action. Before I could complete my arrangements to charge this battery I noticed an apparent attempt on the part of the enemy to turn our right flank, and was forced to abandon the attempt; but, sending word to Captain Totten of its position, I placed the first division of the regiment in its original position at right angles with the line of battle, and opening our fire, we after a time again drove them back. The battery we had unmasked had during this time been playing upon us, and caused no little uneasiness, as the shells which fell in our ranks were pronounced to be those supplied to our column which took the Cassville road. During all this time the firing had been equally heavy upon the left of our line, and finding the right wing apparently able to stand its ground, I went towards the left. As I passed each company I found it well up to its work, both officers and men cool and determined, using their arms with care and precision.
Upon arriving to the left of Du Bois’ battery and approaching Company E, I met Captain Cole, of that company, being taken to the rear in consequence of a wound in the lower jaw, and, although unable to speak, still by every action encouraging his men.
Continuing on, I missed Capt. Cary Gratz, commanding Company E, and soon learned, wffiile advancing at the head of his men, he discovered a body of the enemy approaching, led on by a mounted officer, carrying a Union flag. Captain Gratz, drawing his revolver, fired and knocked him off his horse, but upon reaching the ground he immediately arose and rushed through his lines, at which instant Captain Gratz fired a second shot, pitching him headlong out of sight. The enemy now opened fire, and Captain Gratz fell, pierced by five shots.
1 soon came up with Captain Cavender, who, with his company (G), still maintained an advanced position, and had already by their courage and firmness several times prevented our left flank from being turned. Once more the enemy advanced upon us, and the fire again became very heavy. I now received a shot myself, and returning towards the right of the regiment and meeting Captain Yates, informed him I had been hit, and he must, in case he missed me, assume the command and keep the men together, as by this time the alignment was considerably broken. Feeling faint, I returned again to our left and obtained a

stimulant, and soon after my horse being killed and falling upon me prevented my again being able to reach the right of the regiment.
The enemy now made another rally, and would undoubtedly have forced us back had not the First Iowa Eegiment, led on by General Lyon and Major Schofield, arrived at the critical moment, together with the battalion of the Second Eegiment, led by Major Osterhaus, assisted by Lieut. David Murphy, of our regiment, who came up at the same time, and most gallantly seconded the efforts of our now nearly exhausted men. As the fire again slackened I met General Lyon, and asked him, u Have you seen or heard from our other column ?” To this inquiry he shook his head. I now noticed he appeared to be suffering, and found he had just received a shot in his leg.
The firing had now ceased for so long a time I concluded the engagement over, and going to Du Bois’ battery, was met by our surgeon and by him sent to the rear, but had hardly got out of his hands when the enemy made another and last rally, and for a few moments the fire was terrible, but they were again repulsed. After a time our infantry were seen approaching, and at a few minutes past 11 o’clock a. m., being six hours after I heard the first shot, I saw them in three columns emerge from the timber into the small cleared space between myself and our recent line of battle.
Never have I found it so difficult to do justice to all, and in a position where every man so well performed his part it is almost impossible to single out individuals. That every officer did his duty no better evidence can be adduced than the fact that 13 out of 27 officers who went into the action bore away with them the marks of the enemy’s shot. That the men did their duty I have but to refer you to our mortality report, forwarded some days since.
With every desire to be strictly impartial, I cannot close this report without expressing our obligations to Captain Totten and Lieutenant Du Bois, who by their masterly co-operation so effectually assisted the regiment to maintain its position.
Capt. Madison Miller, commanding Company I, who, by his coolness and deliberate observation, discovered at the critical moment a large body of cavalry preparing to charge us in rear, and who, by his well-directed fire, assisted by a few shells from Captain Totten’s battery, rapidly dispersed them. Capt. John S. Cavender, who, though severely wounded, still refusing to leave his post, mounted his horse, and remained there until exhausted nature could do no more. Lieut. David Murphy, although shot through the leg, I saw advancing at the head of the battalion, brought to our aid, with a spirit and courage that defied his wounds. Surg. F. M. Cornyn, who, while carrying aid and comfort wherever they were required, utterly regardless of personal danger, forgot not, when human aid was of no avail, to seize the musket of the dying man, and with unerring aim avenging his death. Lieut, and Adjt. Henry Hescock, who, from the organization of the regiment, has been of invaluable service in rendering it efficient, and in action was always found where his services were most valuable.
Among the men I must be allowed to call attention to Corporal Kane, of Company K, who, when the color sergeant was killed and nearly all the color guard either killed or wounded, brought the colors safely off the field; also Sergt. Chas. M. Callahan, of same company, who so ably filled the place of his lieutenant, and materially assisted Captain Burke when his only subaltern was disabled; Sergt. Christ. Conrad, of Company G, whose assistance was indispensable to Lieutenant Sheldon

Report of Capt. Frederick Steele, Second U. S. Infantry.
Camp near Eolla, Mo., August 17,1861.
Captain : I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my battalion at the battle near Springfield, Mo., on the 10th instant:
The battalion was composed of Companies B and E, Second Infantry, commanded by First Sergeants Griffin and G. H. McLaughlin; a company of General Service Eecrnits, commanded by First Lieut. W. L. Lothrop, Fourth Artillery, and a company of Mounted Eifles, recruits, commanded by Lance Sergeant Morine. During the early part of the action the battalion was in position to support Du Bois’ battery, but had no opportunity of engaging the enemy, except to assist in dispersing a large body of cavalry that frequently threatened our rear. Soon after the fall of General Lyon, Capt. C. C. Gilbert, First Infantry, joined my battalion with a part of his company, and we made arrangements to repel a threatened assault on the battery in front, which was repelled without our becoming engaged with the enemy. Major Sturgis then ordered me to form line of battle and advance upon the‘enemy’s front, whence the heaviest firing had proceeded during the day. We very soon came within range of the enemy’s rifles, when a fierce contest ensued, the enemy gradually retiring upon his reserve, where he made a stand, from which our small force was unable to drive him.
After a heavy firing on both sides in this position, without any apparent advantage on either side, the contest ceased for a short time, as if by mutual consent.
We were opposed to vastly superior numbers, and many of our men were killed and wounded, so that I did not deem it discreet to charge upon the enemy without support, although Captain Gilbert suggested it.
During this suspension of hostilities, I received orders from Major Sturgis to send a company of skirmishers on the brow of the hill to our left and front. Lieutenant Lothrop went in command of this company, but was met with such a galling fire from the enemy that he was obliged to retire—all of which service he performed with coolness and intrepidity. Lieutenant Lothrop’s retreat was followed up by a vigorous attack from the enemy upon us, as well as upon Totten’s battery on our left and rear. The enemy had a field piece established under the crest of the hill to our left and front, which threw grape with spitefulness, and occasionally a shell, with more moral effect than damage to us. This piece was now re-enforced by one or two pieces of the same character, all of which threw an incessant shower of missiles at us; but my men were ordered to stoop, and very few took effect upon us. It was now evident that the enemy intended to take Totten’s battery, as a

strong column of infantry was advancing upon it. Totten mowed them down with canister in front, and our infantry poured a murderous fire into their flanks, which compelled them to a hasty retreat.
The enemy had failed in all his endeavors to dislodge us from our position, which I conceived to be the strategic point of the battle-field, and was determined to hold it at all hazards.
Another short suspension of hostilities ensued. After a consultation with the officers, Major Sturgis sent me orders to retire. Just at that time Captain Granger came up to me, and we discovered that the enemy were about to renew the attack upon us. Captain Granger rushed to the rear and collected several hundred volunteers of different regiments, while we held the enemy in check, and formed them on our left. We then advanced upon the enemy, and drove them off the field, and never saw one of them afterwards. After collecting our wounded we retired slowly from the field. I commanded the rear guard on the retreat towards Springfield, but saw nothing of the enemy ; it was evident that he had been severely punished.
I wish to call the attention of the major commanding to the gallant conduct of Capt. C. C. Gilbert, First Infantry; of First Lieut. Lothrop, Fourth Artillery, and of George H. McLaughlin, first sergeant, commanding Company E, Second Infantry. Sergeant McLaughlin received the highest commendations of all the officers present. I also mention the first sergeant of Captain Gilbert’s company—Mandazy—who was killed in the last assault of the enemy; also First Sergeant Griffin, commanding Company B, Second Infantry, and Lance Sergeant Morine, commanding the company of Mounted Bifle recruits, each of wThom behaved with distinguished gallantry. Sergeant Morine was mortally wounded, and died on the field. During the critical state of the combat, I conferred with Captain Gilbert, whose intelligence and soldierly qualities are well known, and whoso self-possession during the battle was calculated to inspire the men with confidence. In the latter part of the contest he received a wound in the shoulder, which compelled him to retire from the field. I furnish herewith a list of the killed, wounded, and missing of my command during the day.*

were partially and my horses entirely protected from direct musketry fire.
After assisting Captain Totten to silence the enemy’s batteries, in which we perfectly succeeded, I received orders from General Lyon to move my battery to the right. Captain Granger was to place me in position. While limbering, our left flank, which consisted of three companies of the First Infantry and one of Mounted Rifle recruits, was driven back by an overwhelming force of the enemy (five regiments, I think), who, in the order of an advance, had collected in masses. Captain Granger now countermanded my order to move, and by a change of front to the left I enfiladed their line and drove them back with great slaughter, Captain Granger directing one of my guns. Their broken troops rallied behind a house on the right of their line. I struck this house twice with a 12-pounder shot, when they showed a hospital flag. I ceased firing, and their troops retired.
Large bodies now collected in a ravine in front of our center. By using small charges I succeeded in shelling the thicket, but could not judge of the effect of my fire. It seemed to check the enemy, as he changed his position to one more to my right and beyond my fire. ' A new battery now opened upon us from the crest of the hill opposite, and having a plunging fire, it did great execution, all the shot which passed over me falling among the wounded, who had been carried in rear of my battery in large numbers. We succeeded in partially silencing this fire, and at the same time drove back a large column of cavalry, which had turned our position, and were preparing to charge our men.
During the entire engagement I was so embarrassed by my ignorance of General Sigel’s position, that on several occasions I did not fire upon their troops until they had formed within a few hundred yards of our line, fearing they might be our own men advancing to form a junction with us. During the last effort of the enemy to break through our right wing and capture our batteries, I limbered up two guns to send to Captain Totten’s assistance. Before I could have a road opened through the wounded, I was ordered to fall back to a hill in rear and protect a retreat. I remained until all our troops had passed in good order, and was marching to the rear, when my 12-pounder gun broke down. I asked Major Osterhaus to protect me with his battalion. He remained with me until I repaired damages, and then marched in my rear until I joined the command on the prairie. I now received orders to take command of a rear guard, but as I had already joined Captain Steele’s battalion of regulars, and we had found a rear guard under his command, I reported this fact, and marched to Springfield under Captain Steele. We were not followed by the enemy, who had, I think, been driven from the field before we left it.
Many of the company, myself included, were struck and slightly injured by spent musket and canister shot) but only two were wounded and one missing. My men behaved well, and cannot be convinced that we were not victorious.

Report of Lieut. Got. William H. Merritt, First Iowa Infantry.
Dear Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the Iowa troops in the late hotly-contested battle of Wilson’s Creek.
At 6 o’clock p. in. of the 9th instant the First Begiment of Iowa Volunteers, under command of Lieut. Col. William H. Merritt, Col. J. F. Bates being sick, united with the forces at Springfield under command of General Lyon, and commenced the march to Wilson’s Creek, 12 miles distant. Arriving within 3 miles of the enemy’s camp, and in close proximity of their pickets, the order was given to halt. The troops lay on their arms until 3 o’clock a. m. of the 10th instant, when they advanced on the enemy’s lines. About 5 o’clock a. m. our advanced skirmishers engaged the enemy’s pickets and drove them in. The First Missouri and First Kansas Volunteers, and a battalion of regular infantry, under command of Captain Plummer, with Totten’s battery, very soon engaged a considerable number of the rebel forces.
Du Bois’ battery took position a short distance east of where the enemy were being engaged, and the Iowa troops were drawn tip in line of battle on its left. A brisk fire was commenced and kept up for thirty minutes. The enemy responded promptly with a battery in the ravine, but their shot passed from 10 to 100 feet over our heads. Detailed Company D, First Lieutenant Keller commanding, and Company E, First Lieutenant Abercrombie commanding, to act as skirmishers in advance of my line. Ordered to advance over the hill, engage the enemy, and relieve the First Begiment Kansas Volunteers. In advancing to engage the enemy, met the First Kansas retreating in confusion. They broke through our line on the right, separating Companies A and F from the balance of the command. While in this confused state received a murderous fire from the enemy’s infantry. Gave the command to fall back and reform the line. The din of fire-arms and the loud talking of the retreating troops drowned my voice, so that the command could not be heard on the left. Led the two companies, A and F, over the hill, halted them, and ordered them to about face and fire on a squadron of the enemy’s cavalry advancing to charge on a section of Totten’s battery. The fire was executed with promptness and effect, and after receiving the discharge from the battery the enemy retired in double-quick time, leaving a number of dead and wounded on the field. Ordered Companies A and F to hold their position until further orders, and then returned to Companies I, C, H, K, G, and B, who had been left facing the enemy’s line. Found our troops advancing under a galling fire from the enemy’s infantry. After repulsing the enemy they fell back in good order. Ordered Maj. A. B. Porter to proceed to the rear and take command of the four companies, A, F, D, and E, there stationed. Held our position in front for five hours, alternately advancing and retiring, as the approach and repulse of the enemy made it necessary to do so. In every charge the enemy made we repulsed them, and drove them into the ravine below. About 12 o’clock m. the order was given to retire from the field, which was done in good order. As we retired over the hill we passed a section of Totten’s battery, occupying a commanding point to the right, supported on the right by Companies A, F, D, and E, of the Iowa troops, under command of Major Porter, and on the left by one company of regular infantry, under command of Captain Lothrop. This command

sustained our retreat with great coolness and determination under a most terrific discharge from the enemy’s infantry. After the wounded were gathered up our column formed in order of march, and, the enemy repulsed, the battery and infantry retired in good order.
Thus closed one of the most hotly-contested engagements known to the country, commencing 5.20 o’clock a. m. and concluding 12.20 o’clock p. in., in which the enemy brought to the field 14,000 well-armed and well-disciplined troops and 10,000 irregular troops, and our own force amounted to about 5,000 troops in the early part of the engagement, and considerably less than 4,000 troops for the concluding four hours of it.
It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge valuable aid and assistance from Maj. A. B. Porter, Adjt. George W. Waldron, who was wounded in the leg, and Sergt. Maj. Charles Compton, and to express my unbounded admiration of the heroic conduct displayed by both officers and men. No troops, regular or volunteer, ever sustained their country’s flag with more determined valor and fortitude. They have crowned themselves with imperishable honor, and must occupy a conspicuous l>lace in the history of their country.
A list of the killed, wounded, and missing will be found attached to this report,* together with such notices of individual prowess as were observed on the field.
Before concluding this report I must bear testimony to the gallant and meritorious conduct of Capt. A. L. Mason, of Company C, who fell in a charge at the head of liis company.

Report of Maj, John A, Raider man ^ First Kansas Infantry,
Hdqrs. First Regiment Kansas Volunteers,
Camp Rolla, August 19, 1861.
Sir : The regimental commander has the honor to report, that after a fatiguing night march of 12 miles, the First Kansas came upon the battle-field near Springfield, Mo., on the morning of August 10, in rear of the First Missouri and Iowa Regiments, the former, with a battalion of regular infantry, having been deployed as skirmishers. Very soon the enemy’s outposts were driven in, and Totten’s battery took position and opened fire, while the First Missouri was closed up in line on the right and in front, where they engaged the enemy and maintained position for some moments under a heavy fire.
At this time, under order from General Lyon, the First Kansas moved to the front in double-quick, while the right wing and one company from the left, under command, respectively, of Captains Chenoweth, Walker, Swift, Zesch, McFarland, and Lieutenant McGonigle, all under Colonel Deitzler, advanced to a position beyond that occupied by the First Missouri, and here, forming in the very face of the enemy, engaged a rebel force four times their number, and held their ground steadfastly under an uninterrupted and murderous fire of artillery and infantry.
The four remaining companies of Captains Clayton, Roberts, Stock-

ton, and Lieutenant Agniel, all under command of Major Halderman, having been posted on the right of Totten’s battery as support, where they suffered severely from a constant fire from the enemy’s lines, were here ordered to the front, where they aligned* uppn the remnant of the six right companies, which had thus far borne the brunt of the battle. With but slight and immaterial changes of position the First Kansas occupied this ground for over two hours, repulsing or cutting to pieces one regiment after another as it was brought to the front.
While thus employed, Captain Chenoweth, Captain Clayton, and a portion of Captain McFarland’s company, under Lieutenant Malone, were ordered to charge the enemy with their commands, which order they executed with great promptness, driving the enemy inside their encampment lines at the base of the hill, and returning to the main force, when threatened by a flank movement, at their own imminent peril and with considerable loss of life. While leading this charge Colonel Deitzler had his horse shot under him and was himself severely wounded.
About this time the Second Kansas Kegiment was ordered to the front, but when at a point in rear of that occupied by the First Kansas they were fired upon by the enemy from an ambuscade, by which General Lyon was killed and Colonel Mitchell severely wounded, both of whom were at the head of the column. Here, too, many officers and men of the Second were killed and wounded.
After this the regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Blair, fell back in order to the brow of the hill, where it formed, and at which place the remaining companies of the First Kansas formed upon their left, three companies having been posted on the brow of the hill and on the right of the battery.
After a short cessation of the volley firing it was recommenced by the enemy with great fury, and so continued for at least ten minutes, when our whole line opened upon them a most destructive fire, at which they broke and fled down the hill towards their encampment. At this time, by command of Major Sturgis, who throughout the engagement had acted with the utmost courage and selt-possession, we retired from the field in good order, preceded by the ambulances containing our wounded. With scarcely any material change of position the First Kansas stood under fire; maintained every ground assigned it, without once turning its back upon the foe, for the five long hours during which the battle raged.
With about 800 men we marched upon the field; we left it with but 500.
The regimental commander deems it hardly necessary to say that all the officers and men of this command fought with a courage and heroism rarely, if ever, equaled. The list of killed, wounded, and missing, hereto attached, is the strongest witness for the valor of the living as well as for the memory of the gallant dead.#
I am, sir, very respectfully, yours,

Report of Lieut. Col. Charles W. Blair, Second Kansas Infantry.
Army of the West, Hdqrs. Second Reg’t Kans. Vols.,
August 17, 1861.
Sir : I herewith inclose you a list of the killed and wounded of my regiment,* which came under my command after the fall of Colonel Mitchell, who was dangerously wounded at the first fire we encountered. The regiment had been stationed as a reserve on a hill on the right of and overlooking the corn field in which Captain Plummer’s battalion was deployed. After they had been driven back by overpowering numbers,* and the advance of the enemy against them checked by Lieutenant Du Bois’ battery, which was stationed near us, I rode forward to Captain Totten’s battery, still farther in our front, to see General Lyon and request him to order us forward. Upon a statement of our position, he replied, u Order the Second Kansas to the front!” I informed Colonel Mitchell, and he brought the regiment forward promptly. As we raised the crest of the hill beyond the advanced battery, and were still marching in column by the flank, a masked fire was opened upon us, under which General Lyon was killed (who was at the head of our column) and Colonel Mitchell was severely wounded. Colonel Mitchell sent for me and ordered me to take charge of the battalion, and see that it maintained the reputation of Kansas. He was then re moved to the rear, and Lieutenant Schreyer, of Captain Tholen’s company, assisted by two men, carried back the body of General Lyon.
I threw the battalion into line, and after sharp firing for fifteen or twenty minutes we drove the enemy back down the descending slope which was in our front. During this time the enemy’s artillery was playing upon our position, but his round shot and shell were too high, and only his grape, musketry, and rifle did us great injury.
During the cessation that followed the first firing Captain Clayton’s company of the First Kansas found me, which I formed on the left of my position, and the companies of Captains Roberts, Walker, and Zesch, which I formed on my right. On the right of my position a ravine stretched down to the enemy’s camp, by means of which he made three several attempts to flank us. At different times I had sent men, one or two at a time, from Captain Roberts’ company of the First, and Captain Cracklin’s company of the Second Kansas, but they did not return. At length I rode out myself, and at twenty yards to the right of my i>osition fire was opened upon me by what seemed to be a full company. My horse was killed under me, but I escaped unhurt. My orderly, Alexander H. Lamb, brought me his horse, which I rode during the remainder of the engagement.
At this time Major Sturgis sent me, at the request of Major Cloud, of my regiment, and Captain Chenoweth, of the First Kansas, a section of Captain Totten’s battery, which came just in time to save us. As the guns stopped, Captain Chenoweth rode out to the head of the ravine before mentioned, and perceiving the approach of a large force, he, together with Major Cloud and Lieutenant Sokalski, got the guns in position and opened upon them. As the enemy approached nearer I ordered the men to lie down and load and fire in that position and not to throw away a fire, which order, I think, was obeyed to the letter. The fire upon us was terrific, but not a man under my command broke

ranks or left liis place. They loaded and fired with intense earnestness and energy, and we finally drove the enemy back for the last time and utterly silenced his fire. The artillery then left us and retired to the rear.
Major Sturgis had previously sent me an order to retire as soon as I could do so with safety, and after driving the enemy completely back I took the opportunity to do so. My command came off in good order and slow time, with the men as perfectly dressed as on the drill ground. I crossed the first ravine in my rear and reformed. After waiting there some twenty minutes, I marched out by the flank and rejoined the main command.
It is proper that I should state that early in the action, before our regiment as such was under fire, a large force of cavalry attempted to flank us, and Major Cloud, taking Captain McClure’s company of my regiment and deploying them as skirmishers, succeeded in driving them back after four or five effective and well directed volleys.
Iam under the greatest obligations to Major Cloud and Adjutant Lines and Captain Ayres, of my regiment, and Captain Chenoweth, of the First Kansas, and, indeed, to every officer and man under my command, for their self-possession and courage, and for the admirable manner in which they assisted me in the action, and I would be glad to have them properly represented at headquarters.
My regiment went on the field and came off it unbroken, with its battalion organization as perfect as when it first went under fire.

Reports of Col. Franz Sigel, Third Missouri Infantry, commanding Army
of the West.
Kiangua Crossing, 28 miles east of Springfield,
August 12, 1861.
Sir : I respectfully report to you that after a battle fought 10 miles south of Springfield, on Saturday, the 10th, between our forces and the rebel army, and in which General Lyon was killed, I have taken temporarily the command of the Union troops.
Arrived after the battle at Springfield, on the evening of the 10th, it was found necessary to retreat towards Rolla. We are now; here with 3,000 men of infantry, 300 cavalry, and thirteen pieces of artillery. The Irish Brigade, about 900 strong, will meet us at Lebanon. The Home Guards amount to about 200 infantry and 500 mounted men, who are more or less valuable. The enemy’s forces cannot be less than 20,000 men, of which about one-fourth are infantry, the others cavalry, besides fifteen pieces of artillery.
Once in possession of Springfield, the enemy will be able to raise the southwest of the State against us, add a great number of men to his army, make Springfield a great depot, and continue his operations towards Rolla, and probably also towards the Missouri (Jefferson City). I do not seethe probability of making an effective resistance without

[Chap. X.
rc enforcement of not less than 5,000 men, infantry, one or two regiments of cavalry, and at least two batteries. To meet the momentous danger we want re-enforcements, and to be prepared against the last reverses which may befall us in this State, I would respectfully propose to you to make, in the shortest time possible, the necessary prep-erations for two intrenched camps, one at Saint Louis, the key to the Southwest, and another at Jefferson City, or, perhaps better, between the Osage River and Moreau Creek, on the heights of Taos Post Office. At the same time it would be necessary to be master of the river between Jefferson City and Saint Louis, and to arm the two intrenched positions by heavy ordnance.
The Missouri will now become our natural line of defense, with the Osage River in advance, and the two places, Tuscumbia and Linn Creek, as the most important x>oints where tetes-de-pont could be constructed. I make these remarks because I am aware of our strength and weakness. Our 4,000 men will be crippled by the discharge of the three-months’ men, who cannot be kept longer in our midst because they are anxious to go home, and would be of more damage than use if forced to serve longer.
I therefore respectfully request you to give your kind attention' to our little army, and enable us to take up anew the struggle with our enemy.
With the greatest respect, your obedient servant,
F. SIGEL, Colonel, Commanding.
Major-General Fremont,
Commanding Department of the West
Hdqrs. Second Brigade Missouri Volunteers,
Camp of Good Hope, near Bolla, August 18,1861. General : I respectfully submit to you the report of the battle at Wilson’s Creek, as far as the troops under my command are concerned: On Friday, the 9tli of August, General Lyon informed me that it was his intention to attack the enemy in his camp at Wilson’s Creek on the morning of the 10th; that the attack should be made from two sides, and that I should take the command of the left. The troops assigned to me consisted of the Second Brigade Missouri Volunteers (900 men, infantry, of the Third and Fifth Regiments, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Albert and Colonel Salomon, and six pieces of artillery, under Lieutenants Schaefer and Schuetzenbach), besides two companies of regular cavalry, belonging to the command of Major Sturgis.
I left Camj) Fremont, on the south side of Springfield, at 6.30 o’clock in the evening of the 9th, and arrived at daybreak within a mile of the enemy’s camp. I advanced slowly towards the camp, and after taking forward the two cavalry companies from the right and left, I cut off about forty men of the enemy’s troops, who were coming from the camp in little squads to get water and provisions. This was done in such a manner that no news of our advance could be brought into the camp.
In sight of the enemy’s tents, which spread out in our front and right, I planted four pieces of artillery on a little hill, whilst the infantry advanced towards the point where the Fayetteville road crosses Wilson’s Creek, and the two cavalry companies extended to the right and left, to guard our flanks. It was 5.30 o’clock a. m. when some musket firing was heard from the northwest. I therefore ordered the artillery

## p. 87 (#101) #############################################

﻿f fiAi. XJ	BATTLE OF WILSON^ CREEK, MO.	87
to begin their fire against the camp of the enemy (Missourians), which was of so much effect, that the enemy’s troops were seen leaving their tents and retiring in haste towards the northeast of the valley. Meanwhile the Third and Fifth Regiments had quickly advanced, x>assed the creek, and, traversing the camp, formed almost in the center of it.
As the enemy made his rally in large numbers before us, about 3,000 strong, consisting of infantry and cavalry, I ordered the artillery to be brought forward from the hill, and formed them in battery across the valley, with the Third and Fifth Regiments to the left and the cavalry to the right. After an effective fire of half an hour the enemy retired in some confusion into the woods and up the adjoining hills. The firing towards the northwest was now more distinct, and increased till it was evident that the main corps of General Lyon had engaged the enemy along the whole line. To give the greatest possible assistance to him, I left the position in the camp and advanced towards the northwest, to attack the enemy’s line of battle in the rear.
Marching forward, we struck the Fayetteville road, making our way through a large number of cattle and horses until we arrived at an eminence used as a slaughtering place, and known as Sharp’s farm. On our route we had taken about 100 prisoners, who were scattered over the camp.
At Sharp’s place we met numbers of the enemy’s soldiers, who were evidently retiring in this direction, and, as I suspected that the enemy on his retreat would follow in the same direction, I formed the troops across this road, by planting the artillery on the plateau and the two infantry regiments on the right and left across the road, whilst the cavalry companies extended on our flanks. At this time, and after some skirmishing in front of our line, the firing in the direction of northwest, which was during an hour’s time roaring in succession, had almost ceased entirely. I therefore thought that the attack of General Lyon had been successful, and that his troops were in pursuit of the enemy, who moved in large masses towards the south, along the ridge of a hill, about 700 yards opposite our right.
This was the state of affairs at 8.30 o’clock in the morning, when it was reported to me by Dr. Melchior and some of our skirmishers that Lyon’s men were coming up the road. Lieutenant-Colonel Albert, of the Third, and Colonel Salomon, of the Fifth, notified their regiments not to fire on troops coming in this direction, whilst I cautioned the artillery in the same manner. Our troops in this moment expected with anxiety the approach of our friends, and were waving the flag, raised as a signal to their comrades, when at once two batteries opened their fire against us, one in front, placed on the Fayetteville road, and the other upon the hill on which we had supposed Lyon’s forces were in pursuit of the enemy, whilst a strong column of infantry, supposed to be the Iowa regiment, advanced from the Fayetteville road and at tacked our right.
It is impossible for me to describe the consternation and frightful confusion which was occasioned by this unfortunate event. The cry, “They (Lyon’s troops) are firing against us,” spread like wildfire through our ranks; the artillerymen, ordered to fire and directed by myself, could hardly be brought forward to serve their pieces; the infantry would not level their arms till it was too late. The enemy arrived within ten paces from the mouth of our cannon, killed the horses, turned the flanks of the infantry, and forced them to retire. The troops were throwing themselves into th.6 bushes and by-roads, retreating as well as they could, followed and attacked incessantly by

large bodies of Arkansas and Texas cavalry. In this retreat we lost th e cannon, of which three were spiked, and the color of the Third Regiment, the color-bearer having been wounded and his substitute killed. The total loss of the two regiments; the artillery and the pioneers, in killed, wounded, and missing, amounts to 292 men, as will be seen from the respective lists.
In order to understand clearly our actions and our fate, you will allow me to state the following facts :
1st. According to orders, it was the duty of this brigade to attack the enemy in the rear and to cut off his retreat, which order I tried to execute, whatever the consequences might be.
2d. The time of service of the Fifth Regiment Missouri Volunteers had expired before the battle. I had induced them, company by company, not to leave us in the most critical and dangerous moment, and had engaged them for the time of eight days, this term ending on Friday, the 9th, the day before the battle.
3d. The Third Regiment, of which 400 three-months7 men had been dismissed, was composed for the greatest part of recruits, who had not seen the enemy before and were only insufficiently drilled.
4th. The men serving the pieces and the drivers consisted of infantry taken from the Third Regiment, and were mostly recruits, who had had only a few days7 instruction.
5th. About two-thirds of our officers had left us. Some companies had no officers at all; a great pity, but the consequence of the system of the three-months7 service.
After the arrival of the army at Springfield, the command was intrusted to me by Major Sturgis and the majority of the commanders of regiments. Considering all the circumstances, and in accordance with the commanding officers, I ordered the retreat of the army from Spring-field. The preparations were begun in the night of the 10th, and at daybreak the troops were on their march to the Gasconade. Before crossing this river I received information that the ford could not be passed well, and that a strong force of the enemy was moving from the south (West Plains) towards Waynesville, to cut off our retreat. I also was aware that it would take a considerable time to cross the Robidoux and the Little and Big Piney on the old road.
To avoid all these difficulties, and to give the army an opportunity to rest, I directed the troops from Lebanon to the northern road, passing Right Point and Humboldt, and terminating opposite the mouth of Little Piney, where, in case of the ford not being passable, the train could be sent by Vienna and Lynch to the mouth of the Gasconade, whilst the troops could ford the river at the mouth of Little Piney to re-enforce Rolla. To bring over the artillery, 1 ordered the ferry-boat from Big Piney Crossing to be hauled down on the Gasconade to the mouth of Little Piney, where it arrived immediately after we had passed the ford. Before we had reached the ford Major Sturgis assumed the command of the army. I. therefore respectfully refer to his report in regard to the main body of the troops engaged in the battle.
With the greatest respect, your most obedient servant,
F. SIGEL,
Commanding Second Brigade Missouri Volunteers.

Report of Capt. Eugene A. Carr, First U. 8. Cavalry.
Camp near Rolla, Mo., August 17, 1801.
Sir : Having been requested, through Major Shepard, to write a report of my share in the late battle, I have the honor to state that on the afternoon of the 9th instant I was ordered to report to Colonel Sigel at G o’clock, with my company (I, First Cavalry), which I did. Company C, Second Dragoons, commanded by Lieutenant Farrand, First Infantry, also reported to Colonel Sigel, but was not under iny command, being placed at the opposite extremity of the brigade. Colonel Sigel placed me in advance, with orders to seize persons who might give information to the enemy ; and the command moved about sunset. The night w as very dark, and it was with great difficulty that we avoided losing our wray or getting separated. At about 11 o’clock the command was halted, and rested till 2, when it moved on, approaching the rear of the enemy’s camp. Upon nearing the camp, after daylight, different stragglers were met going from the camp to the surrounding country, and all captured, so that no intimation wTas given to the enemy of our presence till the first gun was fired.
Colonel Sigel directed me to take the right flank, and then proceeded^ into the valley below the camp and opened fire of cannon upon it, I* in the mean time moving to the edge of the bluff and opening fire with my carbines, for the purpose of distracting the attention of the enemy, being at too great a distance to do much execution. A few minutes before Colonel Sigel opened fire I heard the firing at the opposite end of the camp, and sent word to him that General Lyon was engaged. This was a little after 6 a. m. The enemy ran out of their camp, which vTas of cavalry, and contained the headquarters and tents of McCulloch and McIntosh. Colonel Sigel then took position on their camp ground, and I moved up along the bluff.
Up to this time I had observed wagons and horsemen moving off towards the west and going south along the Fayetteville road, the point where we struck the camp being in the valley below that road and probably 2 miles from w here it crosses the creek. At this time I wTas about a mile from the main command, it being on the west side of the valley, while I was on the bluff and higher up, when I observed a large body of cavalry forming and approaching the command. I immediately sent word to Colonel Sigel, and retired myself, as it was getting between me and him. I was obliged to go back to the ford to get across the creek, and in the mean time the cavalry had formed to charge, and had been broken up by Colonel Sigel and put to flight, though their officers raved and stormed and tore their hair in trying to make their men advance.
When I reached Colonel Sigel again he told me he was going to advance, and to take my place on the left flank, which I did, keeping in line with the advance along the road. After advancing a short distance, I think to within about half a mile to the Fayetteville crossing, and over a mile from where we first engaged, the command encountered a concealed battery on or near the Fayetteville road, into which ours had forked. The action here was hot, and there was continual cannonading, with some firing of musketry, for I should think half an hour. I couid see but little, being mostly in the timber to the left with my company, among which bullets, shot, and shell frequently struck, without, how-

ever, killing a man. At that time many were in doubt if it were not our own troops firing upon us.
At about 10 o’clock one of my corporals told me that one of Colonel Sigel’s staff officers had brought an order to retreat, and as all the troops in sight were retreating I did so too, bringing up the rear. After retiring about one and a half miles, during which we were fired on from ' a bushy hill-side by a body of men whom I repulsed, but who caused the loss of one of our remaining guns by killing a wheel-horse, 1 saw Colonel Sigel at the spring where we camped the first night when returning from Dug Springs. It was then decided to move south on the Fayetteville road till we could go out and circle round the enemy towards Springfield. We then had my company, 56 men, about 150 infantry, badly demoralized, one piece, and two caissons.
After retiring about one and a half miles, a large body of cavalry was discovered in front of us, and I was sent to the front, where I observed a column of horse of at least a quarter of a mile in length moving towards the south on our right and filing into the road in front. I watched them for a few moments, when Colonel Sigel sent me word to take the first left-hand road, which luckily happened to be just at that point. While retreating along this road, Colonel Sigel asked me to march slowly, so that the infantry could keep up. I urged upon him that the enemy would try to cut us off in crossing Wilson’s Creek, and that the infantry and artillery should at least march as fast as the ordinary walk of my horses. He assented, and told me to go on, which I did at a walk^ and upon arriving at a creek I was much surprised and pained to find that he was not up. As, however, I observed a great dust coming from the enemy’s camp, which was not far off, I concluded that it was no time for delay, and moved on, after watering my horses, till I arrived at a spot where I thought I could venture to halt and wait for Colonel Sigel, which I did for some time, and then pursued my march to Spring-field. It turned put that the colonel was ambuscaded, as I anticipated,-his whole party broken up, and that he himself narrowly escaped.
It is a subject of regret with me to have left him behind, but I supposed all the time that he was close behind me till I got to the creek, and it would have done no good for my company to have been cut to pieces also. As it was, four of my men were lost who had been placed in rear of his infantry.*

enemy s camp. While on the march Colonel Sigel directed me to act on the right when the enemy should be engaged. Afterwards, however, this order was countermanded, and I was directed to take my position on the left.
Nothing of importance occurred on the march until about 4.30 in the morning, v hen several prisoners were turned over to the guard. One of these stated to me that their army was expecting re-enforcements from Louisiana, and that they had mistaken us for their re-enforcements. We were now very#near the enemy’s camp, and continued to take prisoners in small numbers, most of whom said they were out in search of something to eat. At about 5 o’clock I was ordered with my company to the front. Soon after I reached the head of the column, a small party of men and horses was discovered in a ravine through which we were approaching the enemy’s camp. These I was ordered to take, as they were supposed to be the enemy’s picket. I advanced with a small party upon them. They discovered me at a distance, and mounted their horses. I did not succeed in taking the party prisoners, but cut them oif from their camp, which was now in plain sight. I with my company now took my position on the extreme left, and the command moved steadily forward without having been discovered by the enemy, although very near, and at some points in plain sight of, their camp.
The attack was opened by the infantry on the center and left, and soon responded to by the artillery. It was but a moment before the camp was entirely cleared, and as we passed through it I saw many dead bodies and quantities of arms of all descriptions lying on the ground. Many of the latter I caused my men to destroy. There were in their camp a wagon load of Maynard rifles, one of regular rifled muskets, and several boxes of United States regulation sabers, all new.
There being no enemy in sight, I was ordered to move along the south side of camp. I was in a few minutes after ordered to return and support Colonel Sigel’s battery. When I reached the battery I discovered an immense body of the enemy’s cavalry forming in a field about 700 yards in front of our position. The battery immediately opened upon them with considerable effect, and forced them to retire. A large body of the enemy’s cavalry, who had dismounted and deployed in the brush on the south side of the field, were driven back and obliged to leave their horses. My company was on the field until Colonel Sigel’s forces retired, but as circumstances were such as to render it impossible to use cavalry, we did no particular service.
Upon finding myself with my company alone, I retired in a southerly direction, and accidentally meeting one of the guides who had been employed in taking us to the enemy’s camp, I forcibly detained him until 1 could collect some of the troops, whom I found scattered and apparently lost. I halted my company, and got quite a number together, and directed the guide to proceed to Springfield, via Little York. After x>roeeeding a short distance we came upon one of the pieces which had been taken from Colonel Sigel. Although the tongue of the limber was broken, one horse gone, and one of the remaining three badly wounded, we succeeded in moving it on. Some distance in advance of this we found a caisson, also belonging to Colonel Sigel’s battery. I then had with me Sergeant Bradburn, of Company D, First Cavalry; Corporal Lewis and Private John Smith, of my own company (Company C, Second Dragoons). My company being some distance in advance, I caused the caisson to be opened, and on discovering that it was full of ammunition, I determined to take it on. I and the three

men with me tried to prevail upon some of the Germans to assist us in clearing some of the wounded horses from the harness, but they would not stop. After considerable trouble, my small party succeeded in clearing the wounded horses from the harness, hitching in two more and a pair of small mules I obtained, and moving on, Corporal Lewis and Private John Smith driving, while Sergeant Brad-burn and I led the horses. After reaching the retreating troops again I put two other men on the animals, and joined my company with my three men.
Before reaching Springfield it became necessary to abandon the caisson in order to hitch the animals to the piece. This was done after destroying the ammunition it contained; Lieutenant Morris, adjutant of Colonel SigePs command, assisted me in procuring wagons, which we sent back on the road after the wounded.

I.	The official reports of the commanding officers of the forces engaged in the battle near Springfield, Mo., having been received, the major-general commanding announces to the troops embraced in his command, with pride and the highest commendation, the extraordinary services to their country and flag rendered by the division of the brave and lamented General Lyon.
For thus nobly battling for the honor of their flag he now publicly desires to express to the officers and soldiers his cordial thanks, and commends their conduct as an example to their comrades wherever engaged against the enemies of the Union.
Opposed by overwhelming masses of the enemy in a numerical superiority of upwards of 20,000 against 4,300, or nearly five to one, the successes of our troops were nevertheless sufficiently marked to give to their exploits the moral effect of a victory.
II.	The general commanding laments, in sympathy with the country, the loss of the indomitable General Nathaniel Lyon. His fame cannot be better eulogized than in these words from the official report of his gallant successor, Major Sturgis, U. S. cavalry : “Thus gallantly fell as true a soldier as ever drew a sword ; a man whose honesty of purpose was proverbial; a noble patriot, and one who held his life as nothing where his country demanded it of him.?? Let all emulate his prowess and undying devotion to his duty.
III.	The regiments and corps engaged in this battle will be permitted to have “Springfield” emblazoned on their colors, as a distinguishing memorial of their services to the nation.

be mailed to you to-night in relation to General Sigel, showing him unfit for the rank he now holds.
H. W. HALLECK.
Saint Louis, Mo., February 13, 1862.
Major-General Halleck,
Commanding Department of the Missouri:
General : The question of the merits of Brig. Gen. Franz Sigel, as a commander, having assumed such shape as to deeply involve the interests of the service, I deem it my duty to make a statement of facts which came to my knowledge during the campaign of last summer in the Southwest, ending in the death of General Lyon and the retreat of his army from Springfield.
Soon after the capture of Camp Jackson, in May, General Lyon sent Colonel Sigel, with his two regiments of infantry and two batteries of artillery, to the southwestern part of the State, by way of Boila, to cut off the retreat of Price’s force, which he (Lyon) was about to drive from Boone-ville. Colonel Sigel passed beyond Springfield, reaching a point not far from the Kansas line, and on the main road used by Price’s men in their movement south to join him. Here he left a single company of infantry in a small town, with no apparent object, unless that it might fall into the hands of the enemy, which it did the next day (5th of July). Sigel met Price the next day and fought the celebrated u battle of Carthage.” Sigel had about two regiments of infantry, well armed and equipped, most of the men old German soldiers, and two good batteries of artillery. Price had about twice Sigel’s number of men, but most of them mounted, armed with shot-guns and common rifles, and entirely without organization and discipline, and a few pieces of almost worthless artillery. Sigel retreated all day before this miserable rabble, contenting himself with repelling their irregular attacks, which he did with perfect ease whenever they ventured to make them. , The loss on either side was quite insignificant. Price and McCulloch were thus permitted to join each other absolutely without opposition; Sigel, who* had been sent there to prevent their junction, making a u masterly retreat.”
Several days before the battle of Wilson’s Creek it was ascertained beyond a doubt that the enemy’s strength was about 22,000 men, with at least twenty pieces of artillery, while our force was only about 5,000. About the 7th of August the maiii body of the enemy reached Wilson’s Creek, and General Lyon decided to attack him. The plan of attack was freely discussed between General Lyon, the members of his staff, Colonel Sigel, and several officers of the Regular Army. Colonel Sigel, apparently anxious for a separate command, advocated the plan of a divided attack. All others, I believe, opposed it.
On the 8th of August the plan of a single attack was adopted, to be carried out on the 9th. This had to be postponed on account of the exhaustion of a part of our troops. During the morning of the 9th, Colonel Sigel had a long interview with General Lyon, and jirevailed upon him to adopt his plan, which led to the mixture of glory, disgrace, and disaster of the ever-memorable 10th of August. Sigel, in attempting to perform the part assigned to himself, lost his artillery, lost his infantry, and fled alone, or nearly so, to Springfield, arriving there long before the battle was ended. Yet he had almost nobody killed or wounded. One piece of his artillery and five or six hundred infantry were picked up and brought in by a company of regular cavalry. No effort was

made by Sigel or any of his officers to rally their men and join Lyon’s division, although the battle raged furiously for hours after Sigel’s rout, and most of his men in their retreat passed in rear of Lyon’s line of battle.
On our return to Springfield, at about 5 o’clock p. m., Major Sturgis yielded the command to Colonel Sigel, and the latter, after consultation with many of the officers of the army, decided to retreat toward Eolla; starting at 2 o’clock a. m., in order that the column might be in favorable position for defense before daylight. At the hour appointed for the troops to move I found Colonel Sigel asleep in bed, and his own brigade, which was to be the advance guard, making preparations to cook their breakfast. It was 4 o’clock before I could get them started. Sigel remained in command three days, kept his two regiments in front all the time, made little more than ordinary days’ marches, but yet did not get in camp till 10 and one occasion 12 o’clock at night. On the second day he kept the main column waiting, exposed to the sun on a dry prairie, while his own men killed beef and cooked their breakfast. They finished their breakfast at about noon, and then began their day’s march.
The fatigue and annoyance to the troops soon became so intolerable that discipline was impossible. The officers, therefore, almost unanimously demanded a change. Major Sturgis, in compliance with the demand, assumed the command.
My position as General Lyon’s principal staff officer gave me very favorable opportunities for judging of General Sigel’s merits as an officer, and hence I appreciate his good as well as his bad qualities more accurately than most of those who presume t,o judge him. General Sigel, in point of theoretical education, is far above the average of commanders in this country. He has studied with great care the science of strategy, and seems thoroughly conversant with the campaigns of all the great captains, so far as covers their main strategic features, and also seems familiar with the duties of the staff, but in tactics, great and small logistics, and discipline he is greatly deficient. These defects are so apparent as to make it absolutely impossible for him to gain the confidence of American officers and men, and entirely unfit him for a high command in our Army. While I do not condemn General Sigel in the unmeasured terms so common among many, but on the contrary see in him many fine qualities, I would do less than my duty did I not enter my protest against the appointment to a high command in the Army of a man who, whatever may be his merits, I Tcnow cannot have the confidence of the troops he is to command.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The undersigned officers in the service of the United States, who participated in the battle of Wilson’s Creek (Springfield), believing that the erroneous accounts of the part taken by General Sigel in that engagement, which have been published in the newspapers throughout the United States, have produced wrong impressions upon the minds of the people, and deceived the administration in regard to the merits of the case, respectfully submit the following statement of facts, in a spirit of fairness and justice, pledging themselves to substantiate such items as they are not willing to testify to themselves by what they believe to be reliable evidence.
On the evening of the 8th of August, 1861, General Lyon called a council of war, composed of the principal officers of his command, for the purpose of determining what plan should be adopted to extricate his little army from the dangers which threatened it. General Lyon said in presence of the council:
Gentlemen, there is no prospect of our being re-enforced at this point; our supply of provisions is running short; there is a superior force in front; and it is reported that Hardee is marching with 9,000 men to cut our line of communication. It is evident that we must retreat. The question arises, what is the best method of doing it. Shall we endeavor to retreat without giving the enemy battle beforehand, and run the risk of having to light every inch along our line of retreat, or shall we attack him in his position, and endeavor to hurt him so that he cannot follow us. I am decidedly in f%vor of the latter plan. I propose to march this evening with all our available force, leaving only a small guard to protect the property which will be left behind, and, marching by the Fayetteville road, throw our whole force upon him at once, and endeavor to rout him before he can recover from his surprise.
There were no objections offered to this plan of General Lyon, except that a large part of the command had just returned from a fatiguing scout, and had taken no food since morning; it was therefore decided to defer the execution of this plan until the next night. In the mean time Sigel procured an interview with General Lyon, and persuaded the general to allow him a separate command. Sigel therefore made a detour to the left of the Fayetteville road with his brigade, about 1,300 men, including one battery of six pieces and two troops of regular cavalry, for the purpose of attacking the enemy to their left and rear* He

BATTLE OF WILSON’S CREEK, MO.
succeeded in capturing the pickets of the enemy, taking him by surprise, and for a time sweeping everything before him with his artillery.
After clearing the camp said to have been occupied by McCulloch and McIntosh, his command, supposing, perhaps, that there was nothing* more to be done, went to plundering the camp, or in some way became disorganized. While in this state, some Louisiana troops came down upon them, when they fled, leaving the battery to the enemy without having fired a shot. It appears that Sigel and Colonel Salomon, in their flight, took a different direction from that taken by their troops, and made their way into Springfield with all possible haste, Sigel being attended only by one orderly, a private of cavalry.
As Sigel and Colonel Salomon abandoned their commands and left the rest of our little army to their fate, and arrived at Springfield before the severest part of the battle was over, it seems fair to conclude that they were more solicitous about their own personal safety than that of their companions in arms or the reputation of the flag.
Had Sigel rallied his men, and come to the assistance of General Lyon, in all probability the contest wrould speedily have terminated in our favor ; whereas the mystery which enveloped his operations prevented our pushing the advantages we had gained over the enemy. Sigel, knowing our position, might, by communicating with us, have relieved our perplexity, and left no doubt as to the course for us to pursue.
Charles E. Farrand, then second lieutenant First IJ. S. Infantry, in command of a troop of Second IJ. S. Dragoons, collected together several hundred men of SigeFs command, and seeing that the battery had been abandoned by the enemy, who after having taken it turned their attention to Lyon’s command, thought to carry it off, but found the horses belonging to it either wounded or missing, except those for one piece, where but one was disabled. This horse he replaced by a fresh one, and took off the piece with the caisson and the men whom he had collected. With this party he made his way unmolested by the enemy to the Little York road, which he reached 3 or 4 miles from our right flank.
In the mean time great solicitude was felt by the officers of Lyon’s command in regard to the whereabouts of Sigel. The question was frequently asked, 46 What has become of Sigel?” His men being dressed in the same color as the Arkansas and Louisiana troops, the latter were several times mistaken for 'Sigel’s men, and on two distinct occasions escaped severe punishment at our hands. Du Bois battery was making great havoc among the Louisianians (in the corn field), when Major Sturgis informed Du Bois that he was slaughtering Sigel’s men, and ordered him to cease firing. At another time one of the Louisiana regiments inarched by the flank in front of our line within musket range, and were allowed to pass us unharmed, being mistaken for Sigel’s men. We were also interrupted in our operations by the appearance of SigeFs flag in front of our line with Lyon’s name emblazoned upon it, which flag it appears had been captured by the enemy, and displayed to us out of bravado. It should be mentioned in this connection that about 200 of SigeFs men were taken prisoners by the enemy, and that those whom Lieutenant Farrand picked up, or most of them, had thrown away their arms. Lieutenant Farrand, with his troop of cavalry, one piece of artillery, and the remnant of SigeFs command, joined us on the little York road, about 6 miles from the battle-field. He was obliged to abandon the caisson on account of some of the horses having given out.

In regard to what has been called “SigeFs masterly retreat from Springfield,” it might easily be shown that while Sigel was in command our forces more nearly resembled a crowd of refugees than an army of organized troops. Sigel put his brigade in advance, and the rear was brought up by the regulars. This arrangement was the only evidence of skill manifested by him during his memorable retreat. The column was broken by crowds of refugees, wagons, horses, mules, cows, &c., which were mixed up with the troops in such a manner that it would have been very difficult to have made any disposition for battle.
The command moved before sunrise during the three days that Sigel commanded, and was halted on the second day, and remained exposed to the rays of a burning sun for several hours. The reason given for the halt was that SigePs men were cooking breakfast. During the halt on the third day, the officers, having become disgusted with the manner in which Sigel conducted the retreat, insisted that Major Sturgis should assume command. Sigel yielded, on the ground that he had no commission.

Sir: I have the honor to submit to your excellency the following report of the operations of the army under my command at and immediately preceding the battle of Springfield: *
I began to move my command from its encampment on Cowskin Prairie, in McDonald County, on July 25, towards Cassville, in Barry County, at which place it had been agreed upon between Generals McCulloch, Pearce, and myself that our respective forces, together with those of Brigadier-General McBride, should be concentrated, preparatory to a forward movement.
We reached Cassville on Sunday, July 28, and on the next day effected a junction with the ai mies of Generals McCulloch and Pearce. Tlie^ combined armies were then put under marching orders, and the First’ Division, General McCulloch commanding, left Cassville on August 1 upon the road to this city. The Second Division, under General Pearce, of Arkansas, left on August 1; and the Third Division, Brigadier-Gen-

eral Steele, of this State, commanding, left on August 2. I went forward with the Second Division, which embraced the greater portion of my infantry, and encamped with it some 12 miles northwest of Cassville.
The next morning a messenger from General McCulloch informed me that he had reason to believe that the enemy were in force on the road to Springfield, and that he should remain at his then encampment, on Crane Creek, until the Second and Third Divisions of the army had come up. The Second Division consequently moved forward to Crane Creek, and I ordered the Third Division to a position within 3 miles of the same place. An advance guard of the army, consisting of six companies of mounted Missourians, under command of Brigadier-General Bains, was at this time (Friday, August 2) encamped on the Spring-field road, about 5 miles beyond Crane Creek.
About 9 a. m. of that day General Bains’ pickets reported to him that they had been driven in by the enemy’s advance guard, and that officer immediately led forward his whole force, amounting to nearly 400 men, until he found the enemy in position some 3 miles on the road. He sent back at once to General McCulloch for re-enforcements, and Colonel McIntosh, C. S. Army, was sent forward with 150 men, but a reconnaissance of the ground having satisfied the latter that the enemy did not have more than 150 men on the ground, he withdrew his men and returned to Crane Creek. General Bains soon discovered, however, that he was in presence of the main body of the enemy, numbering, according to his estimate, more than 5,000 men, with eight pieces of artillery, and supported by a considerable body of cavalry. A severe skirmish ensued, which lasted several hours, until the enemy opened their batteries and compelled our troops to retire. In this engagement the greater portion of General Bains’ command, and especially that part which acted as infantry, behaved with great gallantry, as the result demonstrates, for our loss was only 1 killed (Lieutenant Borthcut) and 5 wounded, while 5 of the enemy’s dead were buried on the field, and a large number are known to have been wounded.
Our whole forces were concentrated the next day near Crane Creek, and during the same night the Texas regiment, under Colonel Greer, came up within a few miles of the same place.
Beasons which will be hereafter assigned induced me on Sunday, the 4th instant, to put the Missouri forces under the direction, for the time being, of General McCulloch, who accordingly assumed the command in chief of the combined armies.
A little after midnight we took up the line of march, leaving our baggage trains, and expected to find the enemy near the scene of the late skirmish, but we found as we advanced that they were retreating rapidly towards Springfield. We followed them hastily about 17 miles to a place known as Moody’s Spring, where we were compelled to halt our forces, who were already nearly exhausted by the intense heat of the weather and the dustiness of the roads.
Early the next morning we moved forward to Wilson’s Creek, 10 miles southwest of Springfield, where we encamped. Our forces were here put in readiness to meet the enemy, who were posted at Springfield to the number of about 10,000. It was finally decided to march against them in four separate columns at 9 o’clock that night, so as to surround the city and begin a simultaneous attack at daybreak. The darkness of the night and a threatened storm caused General McCulloch, just as the army was about to march, to countermand this order, and to direct that the troops should hold themselves in readiness to move whenever

ordered. Our men were consequently kept under arms till towards daybreak, expecting momentarily an order to march.
The morning of Saturday, August 10, found them still encamped at Wilson’s Creek, fatigued by a night’s watching and loss of rest.
About 6 o’clock I received a messenger [message] from General Bains that the enemy were advancing in great force from the direction of Springfield, and were already within 200 or 300 yards of the position, where he was encamped with the Second Brigade of his division, consisting of about 1,200 mounted men, under Colonel Cawthorn. A second messenger came immediately afterwards from General Bains to announce that the main body of the enemy was upon him, but that he would endeavor to hold him in check until he could receive re-enforce-ments. General McCulloch was with me when these messengers came, and left at once for his own headquarters to make the necessary disposition of our forces. I rode forward instantly towards General Bains’ position, at the same time ordering Generals Slack, McBride, Clark, and Parsons to move their infantry and artillery rapidly forward. I had ridden but a few hundred yards when I came suddenly upon the main body of the enemy, commanded by General Lyon in person. The infantry and artillery, which I had ordered to follow me, came up immediately, to the number of 2,036 men, and engaged the enemy.
A severe and bloody conflict ensued, my officers and men behaving with the greatest bravery, and with the assistance of a portion of the Confederate forces successfully holding the enemy in check. Meanwhile, and almost simultaneously with the opening of the enemy’s batteries in this quarter, a heavy cannonading was opened upon the rear of our position, where a large body of the enemy, under Colonel Sigel, had taken position in close proximity to Colonel Churchill’s regiment, Colonel Greer’s Texan Bangers, and 679 mounted Missourians, under command of Colonel Brown and Lieutenant-Colonel Major. The action now became general, and was conducted with the greatest gallantry and vigor on both sides for more than five hours, when the enemy retreated in great confusion, leaving their commander-in-chief, General Lyon, dead upon the battle-field, over 500 killed, and a great number wounded.
The forces under my command have possession of three 12-pounder howitzers, two brass 6 pounders, and a great quantity of small-arms and ammunition taken from the enemy; also the standard of Sigel’s regiment, captured by Captain Staples. They have also a large number of prisoners.
The brilliant victory thus achieved upon this hard-fought field was won only by the most determined bravery and distinguished gallantry of the combined armies, which fought nobly side by side in defense of their common rights and liberties with as much courage and constancy as were ever exhibited upon any battle-field.
Where all behaved so well it is invidious to make any distinction, but I cannot refrain from expressing my sense of the splendid services rendered under my own eyes by the Arkansas infantry, under General Pearce; the Louisiana regiment of Colonel Hubert, and Colonel Churchill’s regiment of mounted riflemen. These gallant officers and their brave soldiers won upon that day the lasting gratitude of every true Missourian.
This great victory was dearly bought by the blood of many a skillful officer and brave man.
Others will report the losses sustained by the Confederate forces. I shall willingly confine myself to the losses within my own army.

BATTLE OF WILSON?S CREEK, MO.	101
Among those who fell mortally wounded upon the battle-field none deserve a dearer place in the memory of Missourians than Richard Hanson Weightman, colonel, commanding 'the First Brigade of the Second Division of the army. Taking up arms* at the very beginning of this unhappy contest, he had already done distinguished services at the battle of Rock Creek, of the lamented Holloway [sw], and at*Carthage, where he won unfading laurels by the display of extraordinary coolness, courage, and skill. He fell at the head of his brigade, wounded in three places, and died just as the victorious shout of our army began to rise upon the air. Here, too, died in the discharge of his duty Col. Ben. Brown, of Ray County, president of the senate, a good man and true.
Brigadier-General Slack’s division suffered severely. He himself fell dangerously wounded at the head of his column. Of his regiment of infantry, under Col. John T. Hughes, consisting of about 650 men, 36 were killed, 76 wounded, many of them mortally, and 30 are missing. Among the killed were C. H. Bennett, adjutant of the regiment; Captain Blackburn, and Lieutenant Hughes.
Colonel Rives’ squadron of cavalry, dismounted, some 234 men, lost 4 killed and 8 wounded. Among the former were Lieutenant-Colonel Austin and Captain Engart.
Brigadier-General Clark was also wounded. His infantry, 200 men, lost in killed 17, and wounded 71. Colonel Burbridge was severely wounded; Captains Farris and Halleck and Lieutenant Haskins were killed.
General Clark’s cavalry, together with the Windsor Guards, were under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Major, who did good service. They lost 6 killed and 5 wounded.
Brigadier-General McBride’s division, 605 men, lost 22 killed, 67 severely wounded, and 57 slightly wounded. Colonel Foster and Captains Nichols, Dougherty, Armstrong, and Mings were wounded while gallantly leading their respective commands.
General Parsons’ brigade, 256 infantry and artillery, under command, respectively, of Colonel Kelly and Captain Guibor, and 406 cavalry, under Colonel Brown, lost, the artillery, 3 killed and 7 wounded; the infantry, 9 killed and 38 wounded; and the cavalry, 3 killed and 2 wounded. Colonel Kelly was wounded in the hand. Captain Coleman was mortally wounded, and has since died.
General Rains’ division was composed of two brigades. The first, under Colonel Weightman, embracing infantry and artillery, 1,306 strong, lost not only their commander, but 34 others killed and 111 wounded. The Second Brigade, mounted men, Colonel Cawjbhorn commanding, about 1,200 strong, lost 21 killed and 75 wounded. Colonel Cawthorn was himself wounded, and Maj. Charles Rogers, of Saint Louis, adjutant of the brigade, was mortally wounded, and died the day after the battle. He was a gallant officer, and at all times vigilant and attentive to his duties, and fearless upon the field of battle.
Your excellency will perceive that our State forces consisted of only 5,221 officers and men; that of those no less than 156 died upon the field, while 517 were wounded. These facts attest more powerfully than words can the severity of the conflict and the dauntless courage of our brave soldiers.
It is also my painful duty to announce the death of one of my aides, Lieut. Col. George W. Allen, of Saline County. He was shot down while communicating an order, and we left him buried on the field. I have appointed to the position thus sadly vacated Capt. James T.

Reports of Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch, C. S. Army, with orders and
proclamation.
Headquarters McCulloch’s Brigade, Battle-field of the Oak Rills, near Springfield, August 10, 1801.
Sir : I liave the honor to report that the enemy, 12,000 strong*, attacked us at daylight this morning. Although they were superior in discipline and arms and had gained a strong position, we have repulsed them and gained a decided victory. The enemy fled before us at 1 o’clock, after eight hours’ hard fighting, leaving many dead and wounded and prisoners.
Six pieces of cannon were taken and many small-arms. Among the dead we found General Lyon, and sent his body to his successor this evening. The loss was also severe on our side. Our men were at great disadvantage, on account of the inferior weapons, but they fought generally with great bravery. I will as soon as possible send a more detailed account.
The Missouri and Arkansas State forces were in the battle under my command. Want of arms and discipline made my number comparatively small.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
BEN. McCULLOOH, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.
Headquarters McCulloch’s Brigade,
Camp Weight man, near Springfield, Mo., August 12, 1801.
Sir : I have the honor to make the following official report of the battle of the Oak Hills on the 10th instant:
Having taken position about 10 miles from Springfield, I endeavored to gain the necessary, informat ion of the strength and position of the enemy stationed in and about the town. The information was very conflicting and unsatisfactory. I, however, made up my mind to attack the enemy in their position, and issued orders on the 9th instant to my force to start at 9 o’clock at night to attack at four different points at daylight. A few days before General Price, in command of the Missouri force, turned over his command to me, and I assumed command of the entire force, comprising my own brigade, the brigade of Arkansas State forces under General Pearce, and General Price’s command of Missourians.
My effective force was 5,300 infantry, 15 pieces of artillery, and 0,000 horsemen, armed with flint-lock muskets, rifles, and shot-guns. There were other horsemen wTith the army who were entirely unarmed, and instead of being a help, were continually in the way. When the time arrived for the night march, it commenced to rain slightly, and fearing, from the want of cartridge boxes, that my ammunition would be ruined, I ordered the movement to be stopped, hoping to move the next morning. Many of my men had but twenty rounds of ammunition, and there was no more to be had.
While still hesitating in the morning the enemy were reported advancing, and I made arrangements to meet him. The attack was made

simultaneously at 5.30 a. m. on our right and left flanks, and the enemy had gained the positions they desired. General Lyon attacked us on our left, and General Sigel on our right and rear. From these points batteries opened upon us. My command was soon ready. The Missourians, under Generals Slack, Clark, McBride, Parsons, and Bains, were nearest the position taken by General Lyon with his main force. They were instantly turned to the left, and opened the battle with an incessant fire of small-arms. Woodruff opposed his battery to that of the enemy under Captain Totten, and a constant cannonading was kept up between these batteries during the battle. Hebert’s regiment of Louisiana volunteers and McIntosh’s regiment of Arkansas Mounted Biflemen were ordered to the front, and after passing the battery turned to the left, and soon engaged the enemy with regiments deployed. Colonel McIntosh dismounted his regiment, and the two marched uj) abreast to a fence around a large corn field, when they met the left of the enemy already posted.
A terrible conflict of small-arms took place here. The opposing force was a body of regular Unified States infantry, commanded by Captains Plummer and Gilbert. Notwithstanding the galling fire poured upon these two regiments, they leaped over the fence, and, gallantly led by their colonels, drove the enemy before them back upon the main body. During this time the Missourians, under General Price, were nobly attempting to sustain themselves in the center, and were hotly engaged on the sides of the height upon which the enemy were posted. Far on the right Sigel had opened his battery upon Churchill’s and Greer’s regiments, and had gradually made his way to the Springfield road, upon each side of which the army was encamped, and in a prominent position had established his battery. I at once took two companies of the Louisiana regiment which were nearest me, and marched them rapidly from the front and. right to the rear, with orders to Colonel McIntosh to bring up the rest.
When we arrived near the enemy’s battery we found that Beid’s battery had opened upon it, and it was already in confusion. Advantage was taken of it, and soon the Louisianians were gallantly charging among the guns, and swept the cannoneers away. Five guns were here taken, and Sigel’s command, completely routed, were in rapid retreat with a single gun, followed by some companies of the Texas regiment and a portion of Colonel Major’s Missouri regiment of cavalry. In the pursuit many of the enemy were killed and taken prisoners, and their last gun captured.
Having cleared our right and rear, it was necessary to turn all our attention to the center, under General Lyon, who was pressing upon the Missourians, having driven them back. To this point McIntosh’s regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Embry, and Churchill’s regiment on foot, Gratiot’s regiment, and McBae’s battalion were sent to their aid. A terrible fire of musketry was now kept up along the whole side and top of the hill upon which the enemy were posted. Masses of infantry fell back and again rushed forward. The summit of the hill was covered with the dead and wounded. Both sides were fighting with desperation for the day. Carroll’s and Greer’s regiments, led gallantly by Captain Bradfute, charged the battery (Totten’s), but the whole strength of the enemy were immediately in rear, and a deadly fire was opened upon them.
At this critical moment, when the fortunes of the day seemed to be at the turning point, two regiments of General Pearce’s brigade were ordered to march from their position (as reserves) to support the center.

﻿106	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Ciiai*. X.
Tlie order was obeyed with alacrity, and General Pearce gallantly marched with his brigade to the rescue. Keid’s battery was also ordered to move forward, and the Louisiana regiment was again called into action on the left of it. The battle then became general, and probably no two opposing forces ever fought with greater desperation. Inch by inch the enemy gave way, and were driven from their position. Totten’s battery fell back. Missourians, Arkansans, Louisianians, and Texans pushed forward. The incessant roll of musketry was deafening, and the balls fell thick as hailstones, but still our gallant Southerners pushed onward, and with one wild yell broke upon the enemy, pushing them back and strewing the ground with their dead. Nothing could withstand the impetuosity of our final charge. The enemy fled, and could not again be rallied, and they were seen at 12 in. fast retreating among the hills in the distance. Thus ended the battle. It lasted six hours and a half. The force of the enemy, between nine and ten thousand, was composed of well-disciplined troops, well armed, and a large part of them belonging to the old Army of the United States. With every advantage on their side they have met with a signal repulse. The loss of the enemy is 800 killed, 1,000 wounded, and 300 prisoners. We captured six pieces of artillery, several hundred stand of small arms, and several of their standards.
Major-General Lyon, chief in command, was killed, and many of their officers high in rank wounded.
Our loss was also severe, and we mourn the death of many a gallant officer and soldier. Our killed amounts to 265, 800 wounded, and 30 missing.
Colonel Weightman fell at the head of his brigade of Missourians while gallantly charging upon the enemy. His place will not easily be filled. Generals Slack and Clark, of Missouri, were severely wounded; General Price slightly. Captain Hinson, of the Louisiana regiment; Captain McAlexander, of Churchill’s regiment; Captains Bell and Brown, of Pearce’s brigade; Lieutenants Walton and Weaver, all fell while nobly and gallantly doing their duty. Colonel McIntosh was slightly wounded by a grape shot while charging with the Louisiana regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel Neal, Maj. H. Ward, Captains King, Pearson, Gibbs, Bamsaur, Porter, Lieutenants Dawson, Chambers, Johnson, King, Adams, Hardesty, Mclvor, and Saddler were wounded while at the head of their compauies.
Where all were doing their duty so gallantly, it is almost unfair to discriminate. I must, however, bring to your notice the gallant conduct of the Missouri generals—McBride, Parsons, Clark, and Slack, and their officers. To General Price 1 am under many obligations for assistance on the battle-field. He was at the head of his force, leading them on, and sustaining them by his gallant bearing. General Pearce, with his Arkansas brigade (Gratiot’s, Walker’s, and Dockery’s regiments of infantry), came gallantly to the rescue when sent for, leading his men into the thickest of the fight. He contributed much to the success of the day. The commanders of regiments of my own brigade—Colonels Churchill, Greer, Embry, McIntosh, Hebert, and McBae—led their different regiments into action with the greatest coolness and bravery, always in front of their men, cheering them on. Woodruff, Bledsoe, and Reid managed their batteries with great ability, and did much execution. For those other officers and men who were particularly conspicuous I will refer the Department to the reports of the different commanders. To my personal staff I am much indebted for the coolness and rapidity with which they carried orders about the field, and

would call your attention to my volunteer aides, Captain Bradfute, Messrs. Armstrong, Ben. Johnson (who had his horse killed under him), Hamilton, Pike, and Major King. To Major Montgomery, quartermaster, I am also indebted for much service. He cheerfully volunteered his services as an aide during the battle, and was of much use to me. To Colonel McIntosh, at one time at the head of his regiment and at other times in his capacity of adjutant-general, I cannot bestow too much praise. Wherever the balls flew thickest he was gallantly leading different regiments into action, and his presence gave confidence everywhere.

General Price will order the officer in command of his cavalry, as soon as he learns that the enemy is in force, to make a flank movement to our left, and the general will, as soon as the line of battle is formed, take command of the left in person. The four other regiments of cavalry above enumerated will at the same time make a flank movement to our right, and endeavor to take the enemy in flank.
All general officers will lead their respective commands wherever the larger portion of them are. The regiments and batteries of these respective commands which are detached will be led by the immediate commanders. This movement will take place in quietness. Neither shouting nor beating of drums will be allowed, and, especially on the march, strictest silence must be observed.
The canteens will all be filled before starting, and one day’s rations (cooked) will be carried by each soldier. Each commander of regiment and company will see that a sufficient amount of ammunition is carried by. each man.
No unarmed man will be permitted to march with or follow the army. No wagons will move with the command. Each regimental commander will leave a detachment of men to guard their respective wagon trains. The ambulances will move in rear of the army. The general and his aides will be distinguished by a white badge on each arm.
The general takes this occasion to say to his soldiers to look steadily to the front. Remember that the eyes of our gallant brothers in arms, who have so nobly acquitted themselves in the East, are upon you. They are looking for a second victory here. Let us move forward, then, with a common resolve, to a glorious victory.

Soldiers of Louisiana, of Arkansas, of Missouri, and of Texas, nobly have you sustained yourselves! Shoulder to shoulder you have met the enemy and driven him before you. Your first battle has been glorious, and your general is proud of you. The opposing force, composed mostly of the old Regular Army of the North, have thrown themselves upon you, confident of victory, but by great gallantry and determined courage you have entirely routed it with great slaughter. Several pieces of artillery and many prisoners are now in your hands. The commander-in-chief of the enemy is slain and many of the general officers wounded.

Springfield, Mo., August 15 [1861].
To the People of Missouri :
Having been called by the governor of your State to assist in driving the Federal forces out of the State and in restoring the people to their just rights, I have come among you simply with the view of making war upon our Northern foes, to drive them back, and give the oppressed of your State an opportunity of again standing up as freemen and uttering their true sentiments. You have been overrun and trampled upon by the mercenary hordes of the North. Your beautiful State has been nearly subjugated, but those true sons of Missouri who have continued in arms, together with my force, came back upon the enemy, and we have gained over them a great and signal victory. Their general-in-chief is slain and many of their other general officers wounded,* their army is in full flight, and now, if the true men of Missouri will rise up and rally around their standard, the State will be redeemed.
I do not come among you to make war upon any of your people, whether Union or otherwise. The Union people will be protected in their rights and property. It is earnestly recommended to them to return to their homes. Prisoners of the Union party who have been arrested by the army will be released and allowed to return to their friends, Missouri must be allowed to choose her own destiny ; no oaths binding your consciences will be administered. I have driven the enemy from among you. The time has now arrived for the people of the State to act; you cannot longer procrastinate. Missouri must now* take her position, be it North or South.

any of our own batteries, I fell back to the woods, and there formed ray regiment. I then moved down the road in the direction of Springfield. Having reached the hollow, I was met by an aide of General Price, asking for a re-enforcement to come to the support of General Slack. I instantly moved up my regiment to his aid amid a shower of grape and musketry, and took my position on his left, and ordered my men to commence firing. We disputed the ground there with the enemy inch by inch, for about three or four hours, amidst a most terrific fire from their battery, posted on the hill, supposed to be'Totten’s, and continued volleys of musketry. I there encountered the forces commanded by General Lyon in person, mostly all regulars, with a regiment of Iowa troops. The battle raged fiercely, and the firing scarcely ceased for a moment. The contest seemed doubtful. At times we would drive them up the hill, and in turn they would rally and cause us to fall back. At length we shouted and made a gallant charge and’drove them over the hill.
At this moment the Louisiana regiment, with Colonel Dockery, flanked them upon my left, made a charge, and drove them completely from the field. This was the last position they abandoned, and the last stand they made. In the engagement I had two horses shot under me. The adjutant, James Harper, was shot down, mortally wounded, at his post, with his sword in hand, leading and cheering on the men. The sergeant-major, N. T. Roberts, was wounded in the shoulder while leading on the left. My volunteer aide, A. II. Sevier, was wounded in the breast while encouraging our men to stand by their colors, and had to be taken from the field. The lieutenant-colonel and major evinced great bravery and gallantry in leading their different wings to the charge; and I must say that no men displayed greater coolness than they did upon the field. Captain McAlexander was killed advancing on the enemy at the head of his company. At the same time fell Lieutenants Dawson, Chambers, and Johnson; Captains Ramsaur and Porter, and Lieutenants Thomas King, Adams, Hardesty, and Mclvor severely wounded. Captains Pearson and Gibbs and Lieutenants Saddler, Wair, and Head slightly wounded. Major Harper at one time was taken prisoner by the enemy, but made his escape. Captain Reynolds was thrown from his horse early in the action, and was cut off from his company.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon the officers of my command, for they were ever seen in the thickest of the fight, cheering on their men, who always gallantly responded to the call.
♦ I lost iii the engagement 42 killed and 155 wounded.

into action. I moved forward with it to the front, going through a terrible fire of grape shot and shells, until I reached the Louisiana regiment. I immediately dismounted my men, and ordered them to face to the left and attack the right of the enemy. I led them through a dense thicket to a fence surrounding a corn field, where we became closely engaged with the enemy. My men and those of the Louisiana regiment were suffering from a deadly fire. I rode forward to the latter regiment, and told it, \yith my regiment, to charge the enemy. I was followed by a greater portion of both regiments, and we drove the enemy before us and swept them from the com field and back to their rear.
A portion of the Louisiana regiment was then called for by General McCulloch, and he requested me to assist him in moving other regiments into action. The command of the regiment then devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Embry, who gallantly led it through the fight to victory. My officers behaved in this first fight with great bravery and cool ness. Captains Gipson, King, Brown, Arrington, Witherspoon, Parker. Garnbel, and Flanagin all deserve great credit for the manner in which they led their companies.

Oak Hills, Greene County, Mo., August 11,1861.
Sir : I hereby submit the following report of the operations of the Second Kegiment of Arkansas Mounted Biflemen, under your command, at the battle of Oak Hills:
While at breakfast on the morning of the 10th instant, the regiment was surprised by the opening of the enemy’s batteries on the western heights of Oak Hills, but at the call of the bugle the regiment rallied immediately, mounted, and formed in line of battle in good order, you at the time being at General McCulloch’s headquarters. I marched the regiment to the timber north of Captain Woodruff’s battery, to shield them from the fire of the enemy’s batteries on the west, and dismounted them, at which time you made your appearance and took charge of the regiment, and in person led them in a charge upon a division of the regular Federal troops stationed upon our north. In the charge many of the enemy were slain and the rest repulsed. From some misunderstanding in regard to orders, only about half the regiment participated in the action at this point.
About this time, your services being needed or required upon other portions of the field, General McCulloch ordered me to move the regiment to the hills to the west, where a close and bloody contest was going on. I did so immediately, and in a short time after reaching the

scene of action the regiment became engaged with the enemy. We remained here for an hour and a half, at different times skirmishing with the enemy. The enemy then made a desperate charge, in which they were repulsed. At this point we had several killed and wounded. I then caused the regiment to fall back to the creek, as we were informed the enemy’s cavalry were preparing to make a charge; I wishing to place the regiment in a position to receive them. After remaining there and resting we ascended the hill again, but did not become engaged. About that time the enemy ceased firing and retreated.

Report of Lieut, Col, B. McRae, commanding Arkansas Battalion,
Camp near Wilson’s Creek,
Creene County, Mo., August 11, 1861. General: I have the honor to make the following report of the action of the battalion of Arkansas volunteers commanded by me in the action on yesterday, the 10th ultimo:
About 6 o’clock a. m. I was ordered to form in the rear of Colonel Hubert’s regiment of Louisiana volunteers. 1 then moved up to the Springfield road, and formed to the left of the Louisiana regiment, in front of Captain Woodruff’s artillery. After remaining there a short time, according to your orders I countermarched battalion and moved off across the valley to take and hold possession of an eminence towards the southwest of our first position. Unfortunately, a little before my command reached the long hill a column of mounted men broke through my column, cutting off from me all of my command but one company and a few files of the second company.
With this force I proceeded to the summit of the hill and formed my men, deployed as skirmishers, near a road leading in a northerly direction. When I first arrived upon thejiill it was thronged with scattered fragments of mounted men. A short time after forming upon the hill a battery about 100 yards south of me opened a heavy fire. I at once sent some of the mounted men to find out whether they were our friends or not. They reported them as friends. I sent them out some several times, and they invariably reported the battery as being Weightman’s. Thick brush intervening, I was unable to distinguish for myself. However, suspecting from the direction of their shot that they were enemies, I sent two of my men to reconnoiter, who reported them as enemies. I at once charged at trail arms. Upon getting withing twenty paces of the road I saw a heavy body of men moving off rapidly. I at once opened fire, and they fled. I at once halted, and formed my men so as to sweep the road. Another column then came up, and upon my ordering them to halt and demanding who they were,

in answer hurrahed for the South. They being clothed like our own men, and claiming to belong to the South, deceived me until the greater part of their column had passed. We then opened fire on their rear. I then wheeled to the left and met the Louisiana regiment at the enemy’s battery. There learning that the enemy were forming again upon the road north of me, I at once proceeded in that direction with the whole of my battalion (the other three companies having joined me at the point where said battery had been placed). Finding that the enemy had not rallied in reach, I returned to camp.
I will state that owing to the irregular movements of horsemen, I was deprived of almost two-thirds of my force until the action was over. I would further state that during the action it was impossible at any considerable distance to distinguish our friends from the enemy. Several persons were taken by my command who have been turned over. In my command I had 2 men killed, 1 mortally wounded, 1 severely wounded, and 5 slightly wounded.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Headquarters Third Begtment La. Yols.,
Camp at Wilson’s Springs, Ulo., August 12, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report the part that my regiment took in the battle of the Oak Hills, on Saturday, the 10th instant. Aroused by yourself early in the morning, I formed my regiment, and following the direction of Oapt. James McIntosh, brigade adjutant-general, followed the Springfield road for a short distance to a narrow by-road flanked on both sides by the thickest kind of underbrush and on one side by a rail fence. This road led to a com field. At the moment of deploying in line of battle, and when only two companies had reached their position, the enemy opened their fire on our front, within fifteen paces at the most. Deploying the other companies, an advance was ordered, led gallantly and bravely by Captain McIntosh, to whom I owe all thanks for assistance. The enemy was posted behind a fence and in the corn field. The companies moved up bravely, broke the enemy, pursued them into the corn field, and routed them completely.
On emerging from the corn field the regiment found themselves in a naked oat field, where a battery on the left opened upon us a severe fire. The order was given to fall back to a wooded ground higher up to the right. This order was obeyed, but by some misunderstanding the right of the regiment and some of the left were separated from the left, and found themselves under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Ilyams, who there received your orders to march to the attack on Sigel’s battery and command on the left #f the field of battle. His report is herewith transmitted, giving an account of the operations of his battalion up to the time of my joining him. I remained myself near the above-named corn field, rallying and reforming the left wing. Succeeding in forming two companies into a detachment of some 100 men, 8 R R—VOL in

I advanced towards Totten’s (enemy’s) battery. I advanced to a position some 500 yards from the battery, where I remained before the line of the enemy some twenty-five or thirty minutes, when, falling back, I again rallied some other stray portions of the regiment, and marched by orders to join the right wing on the left of the field. This I did, and having reformed the regiment, I received orders to move so as to place myself in the rear of the enemy’s battery (Totten’s), then closely engaged in its front.
Although moving as expeditiously as possible, I did not reach the proper position until Totten’s battery had been drawn back in retreat. Some of the enemy still remained on the hill and in a ravine. I, however, hesitated to attack, having discovered a force immediately in my rear, whom I did not ascertain to be friends for some twenty minutes. I then ordered the advance, attacked the enemy, and put them to flight. In this the regiment was very gallantly assisted by a detachment of Missourians and others, whom I then supposed to be under the imme-ate command of Captain Johnson, and who placed themselves under my command. This fight ended the engagements of my regiment for the day. The regiment was formed upon the hill previously occupied by the enemy, and by orders was marched back to their camp. The first engagement of the regiment commenced at 6.30 a. m., and the last ended at about 1.30 p. m. When the enemy made their final retreat my men were too exhausted to make a successful pursuit.
I transmit herewith a list of the killed, wounded, and missing,* recapitulating as follows: Killed, 1 commissioned officer, 1 non-commissioned officer, and 7 privates; total, 9. Wounded, 3 commissioned officers, 6 non commissioned officers, and 39 privates ; total, 48. Missing, 3 privates.
I also transmit a report of Maj. W. F. Tunnard. [No. 28.J
Proud of the manner in which my regiment behaved in their first fight against the enemy of our Confederate States (a fight in which officers and men displayed endurance, bravery, and determination), it is difficult for me to particularize the services of officers or men. I will, however, bring to the notice of the commanding general some cases. The whole of my staff* acted with great coolness and bravery, the lieutenant-colonel leading a battalion in my absence against Sigel’s battery, and the major assisting constantly in the rear wing. Capt. Theodore Johnson, quartermaster, was of invaluable service in transmitting orders, rallying the men, and encouraging them to stand by their colors, often exposing himself to the fire of the enemy. Adjt. S. M. Hyams, jr., left his horse and fought bravely on foot. Capt. Thomas L. Maxwell, commissary, followed the regiment in battle, and assisted much in rallying the men. The lamented Capt. B. M. Hinson fell when gallantly leading his company in the charge against Sigel’s battery; a nobler gentleman and a braver soldier is not to be found. Sergt. Maj. J. P. Eenwick was shot down in my sight in the first fight, while bravely fronting and fighting the enemy. He was the first killed of the regiment. Dr. George W. Kendall, a volunteer surgeon, on the field was active and untiring in his exertions to relieve the wounded. In the reports of company commanders many acts of bravery and gallantry by non-commissioned officers and privates are mentioned. With the consent of the general commanding I shall seek hereafter occasions to show that their conduct has been noted.
I cannot conclude without saying that the conduct of Capt. James

McIntosh, in throwing himself with my regiment in our first fight and in the attack on Si gel’s battery, greatly contributed to the success of our arms, and deserves unlimited praise. I must not forget also to return to the commanding general himself the thanks of the regiment and my own for his presence at the head of the right wing at the charge upon Sigel’s battery.

Report of Liettt. Col. S. ill. Ilgams, Third Louisiana Infantry.
Sir : On the morning of the 10th of August, 1861, after forming with the regiment and marching to the thicket and corn field, under your command, on the order of the charge in the thicket, I dismounted and went on foot with the command in the charge. The men behaved well, and received the fire of the enemy’s skirmishers, returned it, and rushed on. At the first fire of the regiment the sergeant-major, Renwick, of the regiment, was killed, as was Private Placide Bossier, of Pelican Rangers No. 1, Natchitoches.
After crossing the fencing and running the enemy through the corn field, where the enemy’s artillery were showering grape and shell, with heavy fire of minie muskets, I was met by General McCulloch, who ordered the regiment to face to tie right and march by flank movement toward the ford of the creek, and sent an aide to communicate the order to you farther on right of the regiment. In this first encounter in the bushes and corn field, where all behaved well, it was impossible to designate any particular individual of the command. Here I first noticed the fearlessness and undaunted bravery and activity of the quartermaster, Capt. Theodore Johnson, in communicating orders from headquarters. Learning from him that you were separated from the command, he attached himself to that portion of the regiment under me, composed of the Pelican Rifles, Captain Yigilini; Iberville Grays, Lieutenant Verbois; Morehouse Guards, Captain Hinson; Pelican Rangers No. 2, Captain Blair; Winn Rifles, Captain Pierson; Morehouse Fenci-bles, Captain Harris; Shreveport Rangers, Captain Gilmore; Pelican Rangers No. 1, Captain Breazeale. A few of the Monticello Rifles, under Sergeant Wolcott, and some seventy of the Missouri Infantry, under Captain Johnson, of Missouri troops, attached themselves to my command. We were conducted by the gallant Colonel McIntosh across the ford to the valley in front of Sigel’s battery, when, having deployed in line, the charge was ordered on my giving the order, and arriving on the brow of the hill, Lieutenant Lacey, of the Shreveport Rangers, sprang on a log, waved his sword, and called, “Come on, Caddo!” The whole command rushed forward, carried the guns, rushed to the feiice, and drove the enemy off. Here the gallant Captain Hinson, in cheering his men, was killed by a shot from our own battery taking us in flank. Private Whetstone, of the Morehouse Guards, brother-in-law to Captain Hinson, was killed at his side by the same shot. I cannot, sir, speak in too high commendation of the coolness and courage of both officers and men. They had charged and taken five guns out of six of the battery,

and passed beyond them without knowing we had them, except those companies immediately in front of the guns. The standard-bearer, Felix Chaler, of Pelican Eangers Ko. 1, of the regiment, behaved with great coolness and courage, advancing our banner to the front in every charge. Corporal Hicock, of Shreveport Eangers; Private I. P. Hyams, of Pelican Eangers No. 1, and Corporal Gentles, of Pelican Eifles, rushed in forward and captured one cannon that was in the rear of the first guns captured, about 100 yards, where they killed the only man that remained with his gun, the rest of the cannoneers having abandoned the gun at their approach. Orderly Sergeant Alphonse Prudhomme is reported to have cheered and acted with coolness. The color company stuck to the colors, as did the Shreveport Eangers, and all rallied to the flag.
I cannot speak too highly of the courage and bravery of all our gallant officers and men in this charge. It is impossible to say what company was in advance where all obeyed orders and* went so gallantly into action. But for the unfortunate casualty created by our own battery firing into our flank and raking us, killing several and wounding many, we would have had but few regrets. Poor Hicock, of the Shreveport Eangers, after his gallant conduct, was shot through the breast, ten steps in advance of the regiment, in driving the enemy from the corn field round the large white house/
Here I beg to call attention to the gallantry and bravery of Colonel McIntosh, who conducted us to the point of attack. Quartermaster T. Johnson, of our regiment, was of great assistance, and behaved with distinguished bravery. We rolled their captured guns down the hill, and one cannon was conducted with its horses to our artillery. We were then marched back to the valley below the hill, and were in line when you joined us with the rest of the regiment. You, having resumed command, are familiar with the rest.
I am, respectfullv, your obedient servant,

After the retreat of the enemy under the charge I found the regiment divided and scattered. I then rallied as many as possible of the left (the right having been led off by the lieutenant-colonel), and on forming in an open field we received the fire of the enemy’s battery, in which we lost two killed and several wounded. We then formed under cover of a hill in a field, where we were taken command of by yourself in person. In marching to join the right wing,

Headquarters Pelican Eifles,
Gamp Jackson, Ark., September 7, 1861.
Dear Sir : To you, as former captain of the brave company I now have the honor to command, I deem it my duty to acquaint you of the part taken by the Pelican Eifles in the capture of Sigel’s battery at the battle of Oak Hills :
General McCulloch, finding that Colonel Sigel had placed his batteries in a position where they were doing terrible execution in the ranks of the Arkansas and Missouri troops, who were attacking Lyon’s forces and Totten’s battery, determined that it must be taken. Accordingly he ordered the Louisiana regiment to do so, he leading us in person. We started with about 300 men, the regiment having been much scattered in the first fight in the woods and two companies being with you, fighting the cavalry under Major Sturgis, on the left of Totten. The Pelican Eifles and Iberville Greys, under my command, were on the right, and thus marched until we were within thirty or forty yards of the battery, which was on a steep hill. When within the above-named distance a man appeared on the edge of the hill. The general then ordered us to halt, and asked the man whose forces those were. He replied, u Sigel’s regiment,” at the same time raising his rifle to shoot, but ere he had time to execute his design the sharp crack of a Mississippi rifle carried a messenger of death to him, and thus to Corporal Henry Gentles, of my company, belongs the honor of having saved the general’s life. The general then turned to me and said, u Captain, take your company up and give them h—1.” I then ordered my company forward, and was followed by the remainder of the regiment.
When near the top of the hill I ordered a* halt, and went up to see the position of the enemy, and was followed by your son, Serg. William H. Tunnard. I was much surprised to find myself in front of and about fifteen feet of the battery. I asked them who they were, when your son answered and said, u Look at their Dutch faces.” We immediately fell back, and they fired two guns over us ; the shot from one, as 1 afterwards learned, struck your horse as you were leading the left to our support. I then ordered, u Fire,” when all fired and charged the battery, the enemy falling back and retreating into a corn field, where they were followed by our men and shot down as they attempted to escape. We then returned to the battery we had taken and found the guns all in good order. A fire from Eeid’s battery (which was ours)

made us give way once, and Rilled Captain Hinson and his brofcher-in-law, Private Whetstone, of the Morehouse Guards.
Each and every member behaved with great coolness and bravery, and when the word was given to forward, they responded with a determination that would do credit to old soldiers.
On the morning after the battle General McCulloch and Adjutant-General McIntosh congratulated me for the manner in which my company led the charge and for the coolness and bravery which they exhibited upon that occasion. In communicating this to you, I do so that you may know that the Pelican Bides are worthy of all honors bestowed upon them, and that Baton Bouge may well be proud of those who represent her in the great struggle in the southwest of Missouri.

Report of Col. P. Greer, South Kansas-Texas Regiment.
Hdqrs. South Kansas-Texas Begiment, C. S. Army,
August 12, 1861.
I beg leave to submit to you the following report of my command during the battle of the 10th instant :
About sunrise I received orders to report my regiment at the ford of the creek on the public road to Springfield. The officer of your staff who delivered the order stated that the enemy had fired upon some of our soldiers. Our horses at the time were saddled and our guns and ammunition ready to be used. Almost simultaneously it was evident that the enemy in strong force had brought on a general engagement. The different companies of the regiment formed as rapidly as possible. I immediately determined to cross the ford opposite General Pearce’s command and charge the battery of the enemy on the hill. About half of the companies had marched out of the field in which we bad been encamped, when I found that the. other companies did not move out. I sent the adjutant back to where they were, with orders to have them join the other portion of the command.
By this time the enemy had appeared in the field, had planted several pieces of artillery, and had opened fire on my remaining companies. They were formed under command of Major Chilton. It was evidently the intention of the enemy to cut off this battalion from the first, which had passed out. When reaching the ford the road was blocked up with wagons. While trying to clear the road and pass around the wagons as well as I could, Captain Bradfute, one of the general’s aides, rode up, and stated that the main body of the enemy was up the creek on the west side of the stream on a large hill. I at once moved five companies of my regiment round to the left, the remaining companies having become separated from them. It was evident that the hottest of the fight was raging in that direction.
I about this time received orders from General McCulloch to flank the enemy on their right. I ordered Colonel Carroll and his regiment to move up and take their position in line on a hill, and that I would

## p. 119 (#133) ############################################

﻿Chap. X.l	BATTLE OF WILSONS CREEK, MO.	119
move my regiment sufficiently far and beyond bis to flank the enemy. The fight along our right as we moved up was very fierce and hotly contested. When I thought the five companies I had with me of my command had moved sufficiently far, I ordered a charge upon the enemy. This was done, with a shout for Texas. The enemy was thrown into considerable confusion. Some of them left without firing their guns, others stood still until we had nearly rode upon them, then fired and fled; others concealed themselves in the bushes and shot at us as we passed. Several of my men were killed and wounded in this charge. I would have attempted to charge the main body of the enemy’s forces still farther to our right, but for the fact that we would have been exposed to the fire not only of the enemy, but of our own guns. It was very evident that they were embarrassed by the cavalry force, which still flanked them, and were at a loss what to do. This gave our army encouragement and enabled them to strengthen their position. The enemy moved several wagons and a portion of their force back. Soon they showed themselves beyond us in considerable numbers, supported by what I took to be three pieces of artillery. They were intimidated, and were never brought into the action.
At this time the firing seemed considerably to abate on both sides. Here I remained for some time watching the movements of the enemy. Being entirely separated from the rest of our army, I then moved my companies back, so as to support our infantry on their left, at which point I sent to General McCulloch, and received orders from him to take position on a hill north of and near the main road. Here I was joined by the balance of my command.
I was informed that Colonel Sigel, with about 200 men, with two pieces of artillery, had left the field with the intention of burning or destroying our train, which .was just coming up from Fort Smith. I immediately forwarded Captains Mabry’s and Bussell’s companies, also a company from Lieutenant-Colonel Major’s command, to follow after and capture said Sigel and command, which they did.
Bor a more specific account of what they did you are referred to the report made to me by Captain Mabry, marked Exhibit A,# and hereunto attached.
Soon after this I was ordered to report at headquarters. I was sent with my regiment, accompanied by Colonel Carroll and his regiment, out to follow after and capture a body of the enemy, who it was said had left in an easterly direction with some artillery. After we had gone about 2 miles it was evident, from the dead and wounded along the road, that some one in advance of us had followed up the enemy. I afterwards ascertained that it was when the companies sent by me had passed them. When we had reached the place where the enemy’s cannon had been captured, and most of those who had been with it either captured or killed, we took a road leading to Springfield. This road we followed for several miles. Finding none of our enemies who had been in the engagement, we returned to the battle-field about sundown. Colonel Carroll’s regiment co-operated with me in most of the movements of the day.
Captain Dalrymple’s company, from Arkansas, which had previously been attached to my command, it is due to say, conducted itself very gallantly.

In conclusion, it is due that I should mention the gallant bearing of Lieut. Ool. W. P. Lane in the battle. He had his horse shot under him in the charge, and fought on foot until he mounted another horse (whose rider had been killed), and continued the fight.
Adjutant M. D. Ector and the balance of my staff, together with Captains Winston, Cumby, Taylor, Short, Hale, and others, acted with great gallantry during the whole battle.

Headquarters Reid’s Light Battery,
In Camp, August 11, 1861.
Sir : At the commencement of the battle on yesterday morning we were ordered by Captain McIntosh to take a position on the hill southeast of the camping grounds, supported by General Pearce’s Fourth and Fifth Regiments of Infantry. We immediately got into position, and remained so for one hour, at the end of which time our first fire opened on the enemy’s battery on the hill to our left. We disabled the enemy’s battery after a fire of about three minutes. The Louisiana regiment then carried it.
We were then ordered by Captain McIntosh to bring our battery into position directly west of the camping ground, distance about one-half mile, where we again opened fire upon the enemy for about five minutes, when we received orders from Captain McIntosh to cease firing, the enemy being entirely repulsed. We were then ordered back to our camping grounds.
I have the honor, sir, to state that only one man received a slight wound during our entire engagement—-Private Ben. Huff. One horse lost in second engagement.
Among the men who were attached to the battery it is impossible to say that any failed to fill the most sanguine expectations as to their courage; but among them I desire to mention Lieutenant Wilcox and Sergeant Loudermilk as displaying great coolness and bravery during the engagement.

Hdqrs. First Division, Army of Arkansas,
Camp near Springfield, Jfo., August 11, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the engagement of yesterday:
At about 5 o’clock a. m. one of my escort came hastily into camp and informed me that the enemy were in force a short distance to the east of camp. About the same time Captain Carroll informed me that General McCulloch had received information of their approach on the west. I immediately formed the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Infantry, Arkansas Volunteers, and posted them as follows: The Fourth and Fifth on the heights to the east to support Eeid’s battery, which had been ordered posted there. Woodruff’s battery was ordered to take position on the eminence north of camp, and the Third Infantry ordered to support it. I took position with the Fourth and Fifth Infantry and Reid’s battery, holding Captain Carroll’s company of cavalry in reserve in the ravine. Soon the enemy (General Sigel’s brigade) appeared in our rear in the field formerly occupied by General Churchill’s cavalry. They had infantry, cavalry, and artillery, but being some distance off, I was unable to determine the character of this force, as they displayed no flag until they marched across the field and had fired several rounds with their artillery. With a glass I discovered the Stars and Stripes unfurled, and at once ordered Captain Reid to open on them, which he did with terrific effect. I am informed the enemy lost several killed and wounded, and several artillery horses killed by this fire enabled the infantry of Colonel Hebert’s regiment to charge and take the battery. The movement of the enemy appearing to be directed to our left, I ordered Col. F. A. Rector to take command of the Fourth and three companies of the Fifth and support the battery, and hold his position at all hazards. Colonel McIntosh informed me that the enemy was pressing our right on the west. I sent two pieces of artillery from Reid’s battery and seven companies of the Fifth to their assistance, and went myself and took the Third, Colonel Gratiot commanding, and led it into action. Here was the fiercest and most terrific part of the battle. Here our volunteers met and repulsed the regular troops of the Federal Army. Colonel McIntosh arrived with the artillery and seven companies of the Fifth, and entered into the fight with all the vigor and determination of veterans. I deem it lost time for me to attempt to sound the praises of the brave and chivalrous McIntosh. Always in the midst of the fight cheering and leading his men forward to victory, his name and conduct were a host in our behalf.
In this part of the engagement many of the gallant Third fell. We mourn the loss of the gallant Captain Bell, the chivalrous and gentlemanly Captain Brown, the noble and brave Lieutenant Walton. Among our wounded are Lieutenant-Colonel Neal, of the Fifth Infantry, and Major Ward, of the Third. A full report of casualties is hereto appended. Captain Woodruff’s battery was engaged early in the action against Totten’s (Federal) battery, and drove it back, and afterwards, when the enemy were retreating, did efficient service by playing on them in their retreat. We are pained here to have to record the death of Lieutenant Weaver, of this battery, who acted gallantly, and received the death-wound* by a cannon ball while sighting his gun.

Colonel Carroll’s cavalry was engaged in a part of the field away from my view, and I herewith submit his report in full. I am informed that the officers and men of his regiment did efficient service in charging the battery of the enemy. The Fourth Infantry, Colonel Walker, was placed in a trying position, especially for new troops, grape shot, shell, and minie balls flying around them and no chance of returning tlie fire. Much praise is due Colonel Bector for the coolness displayed in remaining in position, as well as to the officers of the regiment for their efforts to the same effect, for at this part of the field was supposed would be the main fight, and on my return to this part of the field, finding the artillery withdrawn from the height, I ordered General Parsons’battery to take position formerly occupied by Captain Reid’s battery, and an advance movement to the east of half a mile by the fourth and third companies of the Fifth, supported by Captain Carroll’s company of cavalry, to give the enemy battle, should he desire it; but the Louisianians, under Colonel Hebert, had fully satisfied Colonel Sigel, and he retreated without giving us another chance at him. Colonel Carroll’s regiment, though badly fatigued, was ordered to proceed on the Spring-field road in pursuit of the enemy, which duty he performed with his usual promptness and ability.
My thanks are especially due to the officers of the several regiments for the promptness and ability with which they obeyed, an d to the men for the determined manner in which they executed, all my orders. To particularize I would have to send in a full roster. I am particularly indebted to Colonel Rector for the ability displayed during the engagement 5 to Commissary-General Grace, who was with me when I led the Third into action and remained in the thickest of the fight, aiding and urging the men on to victory; also to my aide, Major Cline, who was by my side in the thickest of the tight; also to Mr. Samuel Mitchell, Messrs. Brown, Taylor, and Dawson, for conveying orders during the engagement as volunteer aides) also to Surgeon-General Smith, and to the surgeons of the regiments for their kind attention to the wounded.
Our loss has been heavy, but a great victory is ours. Peace to the ashes of the dead and immortality to the names of the defenders of the lovely South. Early in the action Captain Jefferson was sent to recon-noiter the enemy and was taken prisoner, and is still in their hands.
I respectfully call the attention of the general to the praiseworthy conduct of Colonels Gratiot, Carroll, and Dockery ; also to Lieutenant-Colonels Neal and Provence, the former of whom was badly wounded and the latter was continually in the midst of the battle) also to Majors Ward and Featherston.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Report of Col. John R. Gratiot, Third Arkansas Infantry.
Battle-Ground upon Wilson’s Creek, Mo.,
August 11,1801.
Sir: Early upon the morning of the lOtli of August my regiment was summoned by the report that the enemy had taken us by surprise and were upon us. As soon as the regiment was formed it was ordered to an adjacent hill, occupied by Captain Woodruff’s battery, to support it, where it remained some hours under a fire of shot and shell. At about 11.30 o’clock a. m. yourself in person gave orders for my regiment to move on to the scene of action and attack a battery and a large force then forming on the north side of Wilson’s Creek, on the ridge, and in the woods. I proceeded to execute the order under a heavy fire of shot and shell from the enemy’s batteries, crossed the creek, and marched up the ridge by a flank movement and in column of fours. I advanced until we came near the enemy. We then faced toward them, and marched in line of battle about fifty paces, when we were attacked by a large force of the enemy in front and on the left flank. *
At this moment a battery commenced playing upon our left‘flank, enfilading the entire regiment with grape, canister, and shell. So terrific was the fire, that my regiment was obliged to lie down, and then commenced firing in that jiosition. We remained in this attitude for about thirty minutes, firing with deadly effect, silencing the fire of the artillery and infantry upon our left and driving the enemy in front. We remained upon the ground long after the enemy had fled and all firing ceased.
During the action, I am sorry to say, we were very much annoyed, and some of the casualties hereafter mentioned are to be attributed to the fire of our own friends, who formed behind us and lower down upon the hill, and fired through my ranks after the fire had ceased from the enemy. Attached herewith find a report of casualties, which will show the heavy fire under which we were placed.*
Of my regiment I must speak in the highest terms for their coolness, prompt obedience, and daring courage, and although but few of them

had ever been upon a battle-field, they maintained their position for thirty minutes under one of the most galling fires ever delivered upon a regiment by 1,500 or 2,000 Federal troops, besides being enfiladed by a heavy battery. They stood their ground, delivering their fire with deadly effect and extreme rapidity.
I must here mention in terms of high approbation the conduct of my lieutenant-colonel, David Provence, for his coolness, skill, and gallant bearing during the whole action, his example having a powerful influence in keeping the men steady and cool. Major Ward behaved with great gallantry; also Captain Sparks and bis company; Captain Hart and company; Captain Brown, up to the time of his death, and Lieutenant King, afterward in command of the company; Captain Bell, up to the time of his death. These companies bore the heat of the action, and distinguished themselves by their gallant conduct, and the conduct of the officers and men throughout was so universally gallant and courageous, that it is hard to make personal distinctions.
After my regiment had silenced all firing upon the north side of Wilson’s Creek, fears were entertained that the enemy were collecting in force with a view of attacking Woodruff’s battery, which yet remained upon the ground that it had occupied during the day. My regiment was again ordered to the support of this battery, where we remained until ordered into camp by General McCulloch. As Captain t Woodruff’s battery was attached to my regiment, I feel it my duty to say something in reference to the services of Captain Woodruff and his battery. The execution which this battery did in the enemy’s ranks was prodigious, and its influence was sensibly felt in achieving the fortunes of the day, men and officers behaving with great coolness and courage.

The Fourth Eegiment, on the morning of the 10th, was placed under the command of Adjutant General Eector, who remained in command during the day. This regiment was not brought into immediate action, being stationed upon the hill for the protection of Eeid’s battery, and although exposed to danger from the fire of the enemy, all the officers and men of the regiment behaved with the greatest promptness and coolness in all their movements during the day.

No. 35.
Report of Col. Tom. P. Dockery, Fifth Arkansas Infantry.
Hdqrs. Fifth Eegiment Arkansas Volunteers,
Camp Wilson’s Creek, ilio.,	11, 1861.
Sir : In conformity with military usage, I respectfully submit the following as a chronicle of the memorable occurrences of yesterday:
About sunrise an attack was commenced on Churchills regiment, which was posted below my command and on the opposite side of the creek, about 1 mile distant. Simultaneously an attack was made on the opposite side of the encampment of the main army. Instantly on the alarm being given my regiment was ordered into line, which order was promptly obeyed. Eeid’s battery of artillery had been posted on the height southeast of our encampment, and the Fifth Eegiment of Arkansas Yolunteers was ordered to occupy the height as a guard for the battery. We remained in that position about two hours, and there being no indications of an attack from the direction of the position in which Churchill’s regiment had been posted, Captains Titsworth’s, Dis-rnukes’, Neal’s, Dowd’s, Whaling’s, and Lawrence’s companies, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Neal, were ordered to support the Third Eegiment of Louisiana Yolunteers and the Third Eegiment of Arkansas Yolunteers, which had been exposed to a wasting fire from the main body of the enemy (who were posted on an eminence on the west of our encampment) from the commencement of the attack. Lieutenant-Colonel Neal moved promptly forward, and while gallantly leading the charge he fell severely wounded. I immediately took command of the battalion and led them on to the attack.
I must, in justice to my own feelings, say that Captains Titsworth, Dismukes, Neal, Dowd, Whaling, and Lawrence, and the commissioned officers and privates under their command, demeaned themselves with such gallantry, and made such splendid exhibitions of courage, that while their conduct excited my admiration, I cannot repress an expression of my commendation of their coolness and firmness. Each man did his whole duty, and although fully exposed for fifteen or twenty minutes to a most deadly fire from the enemy, no man, so far as my observation went, wavered, blanched, or quailed, but poured volley after volley into the ranks of the enemy, which soon fell back and commenced a retreat from the field, leaving it covered with their dead and wounded. Captains Hartzig’s, Arnold’s, McKean’s, and Hutchinson’s companies were detailed, after Eeid’s battery had been moved to a different position, to act as skirmishers, and continued in that service until the engagement was over. It would be iujustice not to make some mention of the highly creditable manner in which these gentlemen deported themselves. Each one obeyed with alacrity and promptness the orders he received, and the men in their respective commands are entitled to all praise for their bravery and coolness in the face of danger.
From the reports submitted by the different captains in my command I find our loss to be 3 killed and 11 wounded.
Congratulating you on the result of yesterday’s battle, I am, yours, very respectfully,

Dear Sir: In obedience to your order of this morning, I have the honor to submit to you the following report, to wit:
The number of killed, wounded, and missing from my regiment on yesterday is as follows:
Captain Lewis’ company: 2 killed, 5 wounded. (Two of Captain Lewis’ company wounded thought to be mortally so.)
Captain Park’s company: 1 killed, 3 wounded, 1 missing.
Captain Walker’s company: 4 wounded, 3 missing. (Captain Walker wounded, but will recover.)
Captain Withers’ company: 2 killed.
Captain Perkins’ company: 4 wounded, 4 missing.
Captain McKissick’s company: 4 wounded, 2 missing.
Captain Kelly’s company: 1 missing.
Captain Armstrong’s company : 1 wounded, 8 missing.
Recapitulation: 5 killed, 22 wounded, 19 missing.
Prisoners: 4 privates and 1 officer brought in and turned over to headquarters.
In closing this report, the most pleasing part of it now remains to be given you: that the officers and men acted well their part in the hard battle of yesterday, for a while supporting the Missouri Infantry amid a shower of balls from the enemy’s infantry, mixed with grape from their batteries, hurled thickly around us$ then in the charge by flank on the Totten battery ; and the execution done in the charge shows how. cool and bravely all behaved; and where all did so well, there can be no discrimination. They drove the enemy in retreat from the battery, and it became easy for the infantry to march on it (Colonel McRae’s infantry). The Texas regiment flanked to the left on the charge. I had been ordered to flank with it, which we did in short range for our arms, which were discharged into the enemy. I am sure that our conduct will meet the approval of our country.*

Report of Brig. Gen. James 8. Rains) commanding Second Division Missouri State Guard.
Headquarters Second Division Mo. S. G.,
Camp at Springfield, August 12, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on the evening of the 9th instant I received a general order detailing the order of march and mode of attack on Springfield, and in accordance with verbal instructions drew in my pickets, with a view to take up the line of march that evening by 9 p. m. In consequence of the rain I was notified not to strike tents until further ordered.
By sunrise on the 10th the pickets which I had sent out at daybreak reported the enemy advancing in force on the west side of Wilson’s Greek and within 3 miles of camp. Prom time to time, as the foraging parties returned, I reported their advance to Major-General Price and General McCulloch. As they approached the position occupied by my second brigade they extended their lines, placing their artillery in battery, and opening a heavy fire on my encampment.
For an hour this brigade resisted the fire of the enemy’s artillery and infantry before being sustained, and under their gallant leader, Colonel Cawthorn, they maintained their position throughout the day.
A portion of the First Brigade (Colonel Graves’ regiment) was detached to sustain Captain Woodruff’s battery,*while the remainder, under the brave and accomx>lished Colonel Weightman, was engaged in the thickest of the fight on the hill, protecting the west side of our encampment. Here, while examining the position of the enemy, he fell mortally wounded, pierced by four balls. Here also, nearly at the same time, fell the leader of the Republican invaders, Major-General Lyon, under a fire from the Fifth Infantry.
About 11 a. m. Captain Bledsoe’s artillery, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Rosser, was ordered across the creek, when Lieutenant-Colonel Maclean, my aide-de-camp, having in person examined the position of Colonel Sigel’s battery, reported the same to Lieutenant-Colonel Rosser, who so promptly and efficiently replied to it as to silence it effectually, when it was gallantly charged and captured by the Louisiana regiment and other infantry, among whom was Major Murray’s battalion, of the First Brigade.

Valuable as this victory has been to the State of Missouri, yet it has been dearly bought by the loss in my division of 56 killed, 186 wounded, and 60 missing.
It is impossible to particularize individuals where every inch of the ground fought over bears testimony of the most desperate daring and unflinching courage. My thanks are due to the officers and men of my command for their dauntless bravery, their prompt obedience, and the noble gallantry with which they sustained the cause of their country.

Report of Col. John R. Graves, commanding First Brigade, Second Division,
Missouri State Guard.
Hdqrs. First Brigade, Second Division, Mo. S. G.,
August —, 1861.
General : In obedience to your orders I have the honor to report the operations of the First Brigade, Second Division, Missouri State Guard, which fell under my command after the death of our noble, brave, and gallant Colonel Weightman, who fell at the head of his brigade while leading the column directly in the face of the enemy:
At an early hour in the morning, while our brigade was preparing breakfast, the enemy’s guns were heard distinctly in the direction of Springfield and also to the south of our encampment. Our lamented Colonel Weightman [ordered us] into line of battle, which order was promptly executed. After our brigade had been marched some distance Irom our encampment to the west, Colonel Hurst, of the Third Regiment, and Colonel Clarkson, of the Fifth Regiment, were led directly across Wilson’s Creek, towards the main body of the enemy, by Colonel Weightman in person, where they were exposed to a galling fire for more than an hour, and during which fire Colonel Weightman fell mortally wounded at the head of«his column. Colonel Rosser, commanding the First Regiment and Fourth Battalion, with Captain Bledsoe’s artillery, being stationed on the extreme left, was attacked by Colonel Sigel’s battery, and his men exposed to a deadly fire for thirty minutes, when Captain Bledsoe, with a well-directed fire, succeeded in disabling a portion of the enemy’s guns, and almost at the same instant a portion of the infantry, commanded by Colonel Rosser, together with the Louisiana regiment, led by General McCulloch in person, drove the enemy from their guns, capturing five pieces of artillery, three of which have been attached to Captain Bledsoe’s battery.
About the same time that Colonels Hurst’s and Clarkson’s commands were ordered across the creek, Colonel Graves’ regiment, under Major Brashear, was ordered to support Captain Woodruff’s battery, which was posted on a hill north of our encampment, which order was promptly executed, and the regiment held that position until Captain Woodruff’s battery aided in driving the enemy from his position, not-

withstanding they were exposed to a shower of grape and ball from the enemy for some half an hour.
All the officers and men under my command fought like veteran soldiers.
I must notice especially the cool deliberation and courageous deportment of Colonels Hurst and Clarkson ; also Lieutenant-Colonels Eosser, Crawford, and Tracy 5 also the great courage of Adjutant Gordon, of this brigade, who was severely wounded in discharging his duties. Major Martin also rendered great service in delivering orders wherever duty called him; also Major Morris, who gave valuable information of the position of the enemy, though quite sick at the time 5 also Adjutant Trigman and volunteer aides Donaldson and Whitfield, who did great service in delivering orders 5 also F. L. Graves, who rendered valuable service.
I mention with satisfaction the discretion and soldierly bearing of Captains McKenny and Muse, of the First Eegiment of Infantry} Captains Hall, Yaughan, [and] McElrath, of the Fourth Battalion, and Captains Cockrell, Mings, Cunningham, King, Galliher, and Newton, of the Third Eegiment of Infantry; also the discretion and bravery at the most trying time of the conflict of Lieutenants Foster, Fewell, Gibbs, Wynn, McClean, Barr, McMahan, Harper, and Martin, of the Fourth Battalion ,* also the promptness of Adjutant Horn wood and Sergeant-Major Murray, in delivering orders, of the‘First Eegiment of Infantry, and Adjutant Beltzhoover, of the Fourth Battalion. And I must mention the daring bravery of Sergeant-Major Murray. He was taken prisoner by Sigel while executing an order, and as soon as the enemy commenced retreating before the galling fire of the Bledsoe Artillery he mounted one of their cannon and cheered the Louisiana regiment, exclaiming that the enemy was in full retreat.
I must also mention the gallantry of Lieutenant Waddell, Sergeants Anderson and Bunker, and three privates of the Third Eegiment of Infantry, who were taken prisoners the morning before the fight, and were exposed to a strong fire in front on the enemy’s ranks. When the enemy commenced retreating, the prisoners mounted one of Sigel’s guns and dragged it into our lines.
In conclusion, I will say that all officers and men in the brigade behaved with great courage and gallantry.
General, I will have a more extended report of Colonel Clarkson’s regiment of this brigade as soon as possible, as the colonel has not yet, up to this time, handed his detailed report in.

An attack was made on the Home Guards at Potosi last night, resulting in the wounding of five of them and the shooting and taking of six of the other party, shooting three of their horses, and getting a number of pistols, shot-guns, rifles, &c.
Quite a number of marauders are reported in the Belleville Valley, northwest of Ironton, taking all the horses they can find. The party now moving towards Caledonia may meet them.

I arrived here about 8 o’clock this morning, but did not find any more rebels here. There were two companies of Colonel Hecker’s regiment stationed here, under command of Colonel Kallmann, IJ. S. R.

The information received from Captain French, of the Home Guards of this place, about the fight which took place here last Saturday [10th], is as follows: On Saturday evening, about 6 o’clock, the Home Guards were attacked by about 150 mounted rebels. At the time of the attack there were only about 20 Home Guards on duty; the rest were out protecting the bridges on the road. That brave little band of Home Guards drove those 150 mounted rebels' from the town, taking several of their horses and wounding five'rebels. The Home Guard had five of their men also wounded, but not seriously. When I arrived in this town, the two companies of Hecker’s regiment, IJ. S.

Agreeably to instructions, dated Headquarters U. S.

I immediately ordered my command to surround the city, and remained in silence until daylight, when I made inquiry relative to the whereabouts of the rebel camp, and was informed that none were nearer than the regular encampment near Pilot Knob. I then made due inquiry as to the inhabitants, their sentiments, &o., and found that very few Union men were among them, and these few were so timid as to fail to express their sentiments, that I thought it necessary to issue a proclamation, of which I have the honor herewith to inclose a copy. I then caused the branch of the Merchants7 Bank of Saint Louis to be opened, and I took from it a box said to contain $28,633.30 in coin and $29,680 in currency, total $58,313.30, and brought the same on board the steamer, which I have the honor to turn over to you in person.

To the Citizens of the City of Saint Genevieve :
On my arrival at this place I found such a disposition on the part of parties whq sympathize with the rebel forces as to seriously alarm the Union men for the safety of their lives and property. I deem it mv duty to warn all persons who may in any way be connected with such forces that they will be held individually responsible, both in their persons and property, for any outrage which may be committed on Union men here. When reliably informed of such, I will not hesitate to return at once to this city and retaliate in the most summary manner. It will be no excuse that they did not assist the rebels. They must prevent any outrages on Union men or take the consequences.

AUGUST 16-21, 1861.—Operations around Kirksville, Mo.
Report of Brig. Gen. S. A. Rurlbut, U. S. Army.
Kirksville, August 21,1861.
General : Having sent forward 500 men of Third Iowa Regiment to this point, I was deprived for several days of any direct communication from them. It at length became certain that a body of rebels, not less than 2,000, were assembled at a point on Bee Branch, near Jackson’s farm, some 8 miles northeast of this place, and were seriously threatening attack on detachment at Kirksville. Having waited a long time for reliable intelligence from John D. Foster as to his arms, I considered it my imperative duty to move from Macon City on Kirksville with seven companies of the Sixteenth.	m
I sent forward hospital stores and sick to Brookfield. I left Macon City on Tuesday night with wagons for transportation, and marched the command to Atlanta before morning, arriving there at 2 a. m. The latter part of the march was in a heavy rain-storm, which continued until 10 a. m. The march was then continued through to La Plata, at which place we arrived by 5 p. m., having passed through two heavy rain-storms. Left La Plata at 8 a. m., the weather fine, and reached Kirksville at 3 p. m., where the force is now encamped. Health of the command remarkably good. The position is a fine one. Water abundant and of excellent quality, and within easy reach of the disaffected regions.

day we arrived in Kirksville, and took up position at Felb’s Bridge, in tlie southwest corner of Knox County, on Salt Biver. Their numbers are daily decreasing, but the desperate men among them are moving in a body south, towards Monroe and Balls Counties, and will probably cross the railroad near Clarence.
I have sent out daily strong parties of observation, who generally succeed in meeting small bodies going to or returning from camp. In these rencounters some casualties have occurred. Before my arrival Corporal Dix, of Company C, Third Iowa, with a few Home Guards, was surrounded by a large body of rebels, and after a most desperate resistance, in which five of the enemy were killed, the corporal was killed and his detachment dispersed. The enemy laid out his body decently, and sent notice to this cami>. The body was recovered, and buried with military honors. Having learned on my arrival that his weapons were in the same neighborhood, and probably in custody of a man named Jackson, on whose ground the rebel camp on Bee Branch was situated, and well known to have furnished large supplies to them, I sent a strong body into that neighborhood, who recovered the weapons, and found at Jackson’s house some fourteen rebels, guards on one of their officers, severely wounded in the skirmish with Corporal Dix. The rebels fled, and were fired upon. One, a man named Brown, from Schuyler County, was killed■; Jackson wounded in the knee, and brought in, with three others, prisoners. The others escaped. The officer was too severely wounded to be moved, and was left on parole.
Communication with Macon City had been cut off by a band under Captain Gross, from the neighborhood of La Plata, who will be dispersed to day. The mail-carrier is a secessionist, and avails himself of the disturbances to refuse to perform his duty.
I am waiting anxiously for two things—to establish communications with Moore a^d his command and to hear from Foster. The wealthy citizens of this county are very sick of guerrilla warfare. I have spread your proclamation as fully as possible, and informed this neighborhood that this force must be maintained by them, which is done with proper discrimination. I found about 500 Home Guards here, whom I have dismissed, except about 100 active mounted men, whom I retained for outside pickets.
A great difficulty besets us here in obtaining timely information. Union men are slow to come in and inform us, and we rarely know the movements of the enemy until too late.
The Third Iowa are entitled to great credit for their efficiency in this detached service and the steadiness with which they have held their post.
As soon as junction can be effected with Moore, I shall follow these marauders. I would not hesitate to attack, disperse, or destroy them, with three discreet companies of cavalry, though they are 1,200 strong. Without cavalry it will be difficult, but will be done.
My line of progress from this place will be down the divide of Salt Biver to the railroad; thence to Marion County. I have received no communication from any source since I came here. I send this by messenger, who visits Saint Louis to see Mr. William P. Linder, cashier of the Branch Bank of this city, who has foolishly fled.
As soon as communications are re-established I will report again.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

One man of the Sixteenth Illinois Volunteers was killed and another wounded. The train was halted, and the rebels dispersed, with loss of 5 of their number killed. This county of Marion has been the principal seat of the^ disturbances in North Missouri, and it is my purpose immediately to inflict such punishment as will be remembered.

Report of Col. Michael K. Lawler, Eighteenth Illinois Infantry.
Headquarters, Camp Lyon, Mo., August 20,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on yesterday evening I sent six companies of the Twenty-second Illinois Volunteers, under command of Col. Henry Dougherty, and a detachment of 50 cavalry of Captain Nole-man’s company, to act in concert with Colonel Dougherty, and directed them to move upon Charleston, 13 miles distant. Colonel Dougherty’s command embarked on the cars at this point on the evening of the 19th, at dusk, and went by rail to within two and a half miles from Charleston, to a point where the trestles have been partially destroyed, and marched from thence to Charleston, and invested the town. The rebels, 500 strong, had notice of their approach, their pickets firing on our men. The rebels formed in the streets to receive us, and after a sharp contest of ten minutes fled, leaving in our hands 15 prisoners, their horses and equipments. Number of rebels killed, 13 ; number wounded, not known. Our loss, 1 killed, 7 wounded.
Colonel Dougherty, Lieutenant-Colonel Hart, of the Twenty second, and Lieutenant-Colonel Bansom, of the Eleventh, and the officers engaged deserve praise for the manner they performed their duties. Colonel Dougherty and Lieutenant-Colonel Bansom were wounded in a hand-to-hand contest with the rebels. Colonel Dougherty speaks in terms of praise of Lieutenant-Colonel Hart, Lieutenant-Colonel Bansom, Captains Johnson and McAdams, and all under his command.
Colonel Dougherty returned with his command, to this camp this morning at 1 o’clock, bringing his prisoners, horses, and equipments. Captain Noleman arrived at Charleston two hours after the conflict occurred, and finding it partially deserted, posted his men in position to capture any scouts that nright be about the town. After waiting two and a half hours, he caught two armed troopers, and forced them to show the way to their camp, where, at 4.30 o’clock, he completely surprised, and took 33 prisoners and 38 horses, with their equipments, and brought them to this camp.
Captain Noleman speaks in praise of the conduct of his men, and makes, particular mention of Sergeant Casey, who was next to him in command. The manner in which Captain Noleman performed his part in the expedition deserves the highest commendation.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. K. LAWLEB, Colonel, Commanding.

Rejmrt of Col. II Dougherty, Twenty-second Illinois Infantry, of skirmish
at Charleston.
Bird’s Point, Mo., August 20,1861.
In obedience to your order to me last evening I detailed from my command 250 men and embarked on the Cairo and Fulton Railroad, and proceeded towards Charleston in search of the enemy. On arriving at the bridge I took a forced march in that direction. On arriving at the road leading to the city I took Companies A and E, Captains Johnson and McAdams, and Colonel Hart, with the balance of the command, proceeded up the railroad track on my right. Colonel Hart had with him Company B, Lieutenant Clift commanding; Company C, Captain Stier-
lin ; Company D,------Hubbard, and Company G, Captain Jackson.
When within a short distance from the city we were fired upon by the enemy’s pickets, when we set off on a run up the road leading to the city. When within about 100 yards of the public square a cavalry company of about 200 were drawn up in front of us. We halted and save them a fire, when they retreated to a corn field on my right, near Lieutenant-Colonel Hart and his command. We then proceeded at double-quick time to the public square, where we received the full force of the enemy, and here the principal part of the engagement took place; from the corners of the streets and houses the enemy pouring a shower of balls; the city illuminated by the blaze of fire-arms.
At this time the cavalry on my right attacked Colonel Hart, as did the infantry on my right. Lieutenant-Colonel Hart fired right and left, dispersing both cavalry and infantry.
Our killed and wounded is very small, as follows: Killed, William P. Sharp, Company A. Wounded, Col. Henry Dougherty, Lieutenant-Colonel Ransom, of the Eleventh Regiment, acting as my aide; Captain Johnson, Company A; Capt. JohnC. Parke; Privates George T. Perry, Lewis Sharp, and Lewis Shoemaker.
Too much praise cannot be bestowed upon Lieutenant-Colonels Hart and Ransom, Captains Jackson and McAdams, and all under my command, for the able and efficient manner in which they discharged each and every duty assigned to them.

to march upon Charleston with 50 men, in conjunction with six companies of infantry from the Twenty-second Regiment, under command of Colonel Dougherty, I have to submit the following :
I left Camp Lyon at 6.30 p. m. in command of 50 mounted men; proceeded to Charleston by direct route; arrived at a point miles north of Charleston at 10.30 o’clock; called a halt, expecting to be joined by a detachment of infantry; remained here until 2 this a. m., but not being joined by Colonel Dougherty’s command, nor receiving the promised signals from him which were to guide my operations, I, with the command, advanced upon Charleston at 2 o’clock; passed through the principal streets without any resistance from armed forces; captured two rebels, who informed me that the infantry forces under Colonel Dougherty had preceded us there and had engaged the enemy, the result of which engagement is known to you. They also informed me that there wasr an encampment of mounted rebels at a point near or upon what is called Fish Lake, 5 miles east of Charleston, and about 2 J miles north of the Cairo and Fulton Railroad.
Your orders having been as nearly as possible.complied with, I deemed it expedient to make such examination and research as I could in regard to the reported encampment on the way of my return to Camp Lyon. Taking one of the captured men above referred to for a guide, I took up the line of march in the direction indicated. I came upon the enemy’s camp at 4.30 o’clock, which was situated in a dense wood which surrounded an open space of some eight acres.
Day was just, breaking and the surprise was complete, insomuch that, after firing some forty shots from our pieces, and receiving a few from their, own, they laid down their arms and surrendered. Yo lives were lost on either side so far as we could ascertain. According to the best information we could gain, the enemy’s forces numbered between fortyr and fifty.
We took 33 men prisoners, among them First Lieutenant Woodward; captured 38 horses, and took possession of about the same number of rifles and shot-guns, together with accouterments and ammunition.
During the engagement the men under my command displayed great coolness and bravery, and the manner in which my commands were executed and obeyed would have reflected great credit upon older and more tried veterans.
To Sergeant Casey, who was second in command of my forces at tbe time, I am under especial obligations. ‘The coolness and courage exhibited by him, the readiness with which he gave and executed my commands, and the tact displayed in his movements, justly entitled him to the consideration and credit of all parties.

Reports of Brig. Gen. M. Jeff. Thompson, Missouri State Guard (Confederate), of skirmish at Charleston, with order arresting Confederate commander.
Hdqs. First Military District, Mo. S. G.,
Camp Benton, Mo., August 21, 1861—-9 a. m.
Dear General : Yours of yesterday is at hand, and I will try to keep my men in hand as much as possible. If you will allow me to suggest, I would that it would be very impolitic to send any of the wagons back from the troops here. We are within 8 miles of where the enemy can land 10,000 troops at any moment, and, with cavalry, attack us on thirty minutes7 warning. I am disposed, by vigilance and impudence, to keep the enemy from knowing our weakness, but I am always prepared to retreat if he should discover his strength and march on me.
That unfortunate affair at Charleston shows the danger of giving them time to count our numbers. If Colonel Hunter had advanced only far enough to march back to his camp after driving in their pickets, the object and order would have been accomplished; but he reached Charleston at 10 a. m., remained there all day and night, within a few hours7 march of an overwhelming force. I have placed him under arrest, and will see that my brave boys shall have more sensible and brave leaders.
Yours, respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, C. S. A.,
Comdg. Army of Liberation, New Madrid, Mo.
Camp Benton, Mo., August 21, 1861—2 p. m.
Dear General : I send you another letter from General Pillow? which he directed me to read. If the general delays his movements much longer the enemy will find our real strength and position, and can, by the number of steamboats at his command, drop on us any night with an overwhelming force at some point in our rear. Each available point on the river should be taken as we advance and navigation cut off, and Cape Girardeau should be taken by a coup de main. I stopped the navigation of the Mississippi for ten days, by going to Commerce and firing four shots across into Illinois; and if I were only allowed to make my appearance at different and unexpected places, I could effectually stop all steamboats except the gunboats.
My officer acted miserably at Charleston yesterday. The enemy attacked them suddenly. My men fell in like veterans, and drove them away, when the colonel took them out of the field and retreated with them, when nearly every man thought he was charging the enemy. The other officers have made formal complaints against him, and the men refused to serve under him longer. I have ordered him under arrest. Colonel McCown, with two regiments of infantry, a battery of artillery, and four companies of cavalry, are within four miles of me; but still I am in great danger, unless allowed to keep hitting at the enemy.
Yours, respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Sir: You will report yourself immediately at these headquarters under arrest. It is with the greatest mortification and grief that I contemplate your abominable management of an expedition which was distinctly ordered to be a simple demonstration to draw the attention of the enemy. I did not send you to occupy Charleston, or I would have said so. You should have known the censure that was given a former expedition for remaining a few hours in the same place, and how near they came to being stampeded by a small picket. You will be charged with incompetency to command, for making the disposition you did of your forces; you will be charged with ignorance from the manner you conducted the fight, and with cowardice for bringing my brave soldiers away from their dead and wounded companions after the enemy had retired.

merce, opposite Big Island, a combined attack by the troops at Ironton and Cape Girardeau has been determined upon to destroy them. Brigadier-General Prentiss has therefore been directed to move with all his disposable force to Dallas. From that place, he will proceed towards Cape Girardeau, first attacking and destroying the rebels at Jackson, should he ascertain that any are stationed at that place. Colonel Smith, now in command at Cape Girardeau, has been instructed to put himself in communication with General Prentiss at Dallas, and unite the forces at or near Jackson. Upon this junction being effected, General Prentiss has been ordered to send information to that effect to Colonel Wallace, commanding at Bird’s Point, who will thereupon move with two regiments to Charleston, and after occupying that place make reconnaissance along the railroad, and advance as far as possible.
Colonel Waagner, chief of artillery at Cairo, left Saint Louis last night, with the regiment of Colonel Pugh, by steamboat, for Bird’s Point, to exchange that regiment there with Colonel McArthur’s, and to undertake an expedition with two gunboats, under Commander Bodgers, to Belmont, to destroy the fortifications erecting by the rebels, keep possession of that place, and move thence, in concert with the two regiments just mentioned, towards Charleston, with the view of cooperating with the forces from Ironton and Cape Girardeau towards Benton.
Brigadier-General McClernand, of Illinois, is moving towards Cairo with 2,000 infantry, which he has been instructed to distribute at Centralia and Carbondale, on the Illinois Central Bailroad, and at a point opposite Commerce.
It is intended, in connection with all these movements, to occupy Columbus, Ky., as soon as possible. You will therefore, upon assuming the command at Cape Girardeau, act in accordance with all the foregoing dispositions, and when the junction with the forces of General Prentiss is effected, you will take command of the combined forward movement.
Finally, I recommend you to do everything to promote the work of fortifications commenced at Cairo, Bird’s Point, Cape Girardeau, and Ironton.

By the official list published it appears, however, that he is your senior in rank. He will, therefore, upon effecting a conjunction with your troops, take command of the whole expedition.

I arrived here at 4.30 o’clock this evening and assumed command of the post. Found that Colonel Marsh, with thirteen companies of infantry, two pieces of artillery, and about 50 cavalry, armed with rifles taken from the Ninth Missouri Volunteers, left here at 10 o’clock p. m. yesterday. A report is just in from him, stating that he was in Jackson. No enemy was found. This command took with it but two days’ rations, but I have ordered to leave by daylight to-morrow morning three days’ more rations, excepting meat. This I have instructed must be supplied by the country, giving special instructions, however, that it must be done in a legal way. Owing to the limited amount of transportation, it is impossible to forward much of a supply at one time. Thirteen teams are reported to me as being the extent of transportation at present available. Additional wagons, however, were received a few days ago, and as soon as harness is supplied eight more can be started from captured mules now in our possession.
The fortifications here are in a considerable state of forwardness, and I would judge, from visiting them this afternoon, are being pushed forward with vigor. I notice that a number of contrabands, in the shape

Should anything come to my knowledge of the enemy’s movement likely to affect your movement, I will communicate with you as early as practicable, either by way of this place or by some point on the river below.

General Prentiss having placed himself under arrest by his own order, the command of the column at Jackson necessarily devolves upon the senior colonel with it. The general commanding having no official notice of the relative rank of officers, will assume that they are arranged according to the numerical order of the regiments which they command, colonels from different States taking rank according to date of commission, when they have been issued. When they have not, according to the date of being sworn into the United States service. It is assumed, therefore, that Colonel Cook, Seventh Regiment Illinois Volunteers, is the senior, and the command will devolve upon you. You will at once assume command. Hold the troops at Jackson for further orders, and make requisitions for one more day’s rations from this place and get them out to camp.
The regiment under Col. C. C. Marsh, Twentieth Illinois Volunteers, is to accompany the expedition when it moves. He will therefore be directed to send back all his surplus baggage to this place for shipment by river. Transportation being so limited, nothing will be taken not strictly required.

According to intelligence received by me the enemy has left Benton, but, if your own means of information are not more reliable than mine, you will still direct the forces at Jackson to move with all precaution, sending scouts along the road as they advance. Should Benton be still occupied by the enemy, they are to make an attack, annihilate him, and take possession of the place. With the same precautions you will proceed from Bird’s Point and cause Colonel Waagner to advance with his force from Belmont towards Charleston and occupy that place. From Charleston, you are immediately to open a direct communication with Benton, and from the information you gain at those places you will determine whether a united attack would prove advantageous to our forces. Should you regard an attack advisable, you will leave an adequate reserve on both lines.
The united force of the enemy at Sikeston is estimated at 16,000,

strongly supported by artillery as well as cavalry, the latter being thoroughly experienced in scouting, and having full control over the swampy country around Sikeston.
Before leaving Bird’s Point you will see that all the important points on the Illinois Central Bailroad are guarded by small squads and that the gunboats watch all the crossings on the river between Commerce and Hickman. Should you, instead of moving forward, make a stand at Benton as well as at Charleston, you will throw up, without delay, earthworks to strengthen your position, and report immediately the disposition of our own forces; and also, as far as possible, from your reconnaissances and the intelligence brought by your scouts, the numbers and position of the enemy.

Having sent charges to headquarters Department of the West against you, as in duty bound, I send you a copy of them. In justice to myself I must say that in this matter I have no personal feeling, but have acted strictly from a sense of duty, and, should it be General Fremont’s wish, am perfectly willing to see the charges quashed and the whole matter buried in oblivion. A sacrifice of my own feelings is no sacrifice when the good of the country calls for it.
Some of the dispatches sent here for telegraphing by one of the newspaper correspondents accompanying you were of such a character, and so detrimental to the good of the service, that I felt it my duty to suppress them.

Sir : The prompt execution of your plan by the troops under my command having been defeated by General Prentiss’ withdrawal from the command at Jackson and delaying the movement of that column, and the representation of Commander Rodgers as to the efficiency or the rebel inland navy, coupled with the impossibility of making a retreat from Belmont, except by falling back into the country as far as Charleston, and the weakness of the force at Belmont, makes me deem it advisable to withdraw the troops from that point until the command assumes shape for concert of action. Orders have been given accordingly. From information gathered from the rebel district I inclose you reports of Colonel McArthur* and Colonel Waagner,t reserving copies.

General : Information is just in from Sikeston, which I am disposed to credit, although the authority is a negro man. He tells a very straight story. Says that the rebels left Sikeston last Monday; had there four regiments of Tennessee and Mississippi troops, ten or twelve pieces of artillery drawn by horses, one large piece drawn by five yoke of oxen, and one mortar dr^wn by three yoke. In addition to this Jeff. Thompson had 1,500 men. They said they were going to New Madrid and then to Memphis.
On the strength of reconnaissances made by Colonel Waagner I telegraphed this evening that troops—artillery, cavalry, and infantry— can be spared from here by sending those from Jackson promptly to take possession of Columbus Heights, and New Madrid will fall within five days after. This should be done to-morrow night. Inclosed I send you the report of Commander Eodgers [No. 5], retaining copy.

You will commence and prosecute with the utmost speed all the preparation of the place selected for the fort and intrenched camp on the Kentucky shore, forming a triangle with Cairo and Bird’s Point, which fortification we will call Fort Holt. The point, if not determined now, should be defined by Colonels Waagner and Webster, and Lieutenant Freeman, who was especially intrusted with the selection of the spot. To protect the place and the work to be done there you will order a sufficient force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, selecting the troops, according to your own judgment, from Cape Girardeau, Cairo, and Bird’s Point, and replacing them from our forces concentrated at Jackson. The force employed on the Kentucky shore should number at least six regiments of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry, and a battery of artillery, and only after the force is there and the place secured against attack will you plant the four heavy guns to be brought by Captain Schwartz. Besides one of the two artillery companies organized by Colonel Waagner, you will detach all the artillerists of Colonel Smith’s regiment of Zouaves to Fort Holt; and, using the sand-bags at Cairo and the gabions going with the guns, and employing day and night the largest force of workmen obtainable, you will put the place in a state of defense in the shortest possible time.
The ammunition called for by requisition of Captain Brinck, acting ordnance officer at Cairo, will be sent to-morrow. If you feel strong enough, you will take possession of Paducah; but if not, then opposite that place, on the Illinois side of the river, which you will do without delay, with the view of planting a battery which shall command the Ohio and the mouth of the Tennessee Eiver. In a few days I will send an adequate force with sufficient artillery to hold that position. If in your power, it would be well to make preparation for building a bridge to connect the Illinois shore with Paducah.

While conducting these operations on the Kentucky and Illinois shores, you will not abandon your operations in Missouri, and taking Charleston and Sikeston, as well as holding Belmont, you will follow the retreating rebels to New Madrid. This, however, must depend upon your disposable force and the truth of the report that the enemy’s troops from Greenville have retreated to Arkansas.

Inclosed I send you plans and estimates of the work proposed opposite this place and at Bird’s Point.* A party has been on the Kentucky shore most of the day making the preliminary arrangements for prosecuting the work with larger details hereafter. The labor of clearing will have to be done by the troops exclusively, and probably a great portion of the digging. All information to-day has been telegraphed fully. I am now nearly ready for Paducah, should not telegram arrive preventing the movement on the strength of the information telegraphed.
On the subject of fortifications I scarcely feel myself sufficiently conversant; to make recommendations, but it appears to me that the fortifications there need much more labor expended in that way, and heavier armament, before labor is expended on the opposite shore. The works ordered by you will be prosecuted, however, with all the force available for that service.

The people of Southwest Kentucky having permitted large bodies of armed men in rebellion to the Government to assemble upon her soil, to erect batteries, and fire upon the Federal flag, are guilty of an offense which must be resisted and punished. All commanders, therefore, on the Kentucky borders, within this military district, are directed to embarrass their communications with rebels in every way possible. To this end all ferries, yawls, flats, and other boats within the reach of these troops will be seized and taken in charge.

I have but a moment, as the steamer is on the move.
Last night I sent steamer to communicate with Colonel Waagner. Left here at 10 o’clock.

Headquarters Expedition to Belmont,
Belmont, Mo., September 2,1861—6 p. m.
Sir : I have the honor respectfully to report that in accordance with your order I started this morning from Cairo, at 5 o’clock, on the steamer Graham, with the Twelfth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, Colonel McArthur, 600 strong, for the purpose of destroying the reported fortifications at this place.
One gunboat, under the command of Commander Rodgers, and myself left Cairo at 5 o’clock this morning, and proceeded up the Mississippi River about 20 miles, for the purpose of reconnoitering our weak points, returning to Bird’s Point at 8 o’clock. The second gunboat, under com mand of Captain Stembel, I ordered to Norfolk, to await the arrival of the convoy.
In the mean time the steamer Graham was ordered to take on board the necessary troops at Bird’s Point, this disposition of the gunboats being made to mask our movements. At 10 o’clock I left Bird’s Point with my command on the steamer Graham, and on arriving at Norfolk at 10.30 I found both the gunboats awaiting our arrival, as previously arranged. I made a reconnaissance of Norfolk, but finding nothing of importance, I re-embarked for this place, being well protected by the gunboats which protected the landing of our troops in the best military manner. The people residing on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers have a very great respect for the gunboats. I arrived at Belmont at 1.30 p. m. I have not as yet been able to discover any building in the town.
Our first reconnoiter of three companies Twelfth Regiment was successful in capturing a small ferry-boat and a boat fitted up with a good set of tools for repairing muskets, pistols, &c.
We found one man on the last-mentioned boat, who will be sent to Cairo. The ferry-boat, I think, can be made useful as a messenger to

A Dr. Travers, a resident here for ten years, coming down to see us, I concluded to detain him a few days.
1 have received reliable information this evening that Island No. 10 is fortified with 10 heavy guns. At Union City they have 44 heavy guns.

What with New Madrid t In a few days I shall be able to give you correct information in regard to this latter post.
There are no rebel troops between this place and Charleston, except a few of the enemy’s mounted pickets.

Report of Commander John Rodgers, U. S. Navy, of engagements at Hickman and Columbus, Ky.
U. S. Gunboat Taylor,
Near Cairo, September 4, 1861.
General: It was agreed upon this morning, upon parting with Colonel Waagner at Belmont, that the gunboats Tyler and Lexington should make a reconnaissance down the liver as far as Hickman. When we arrived in sight of Hickman we discovered a rebel gunboat, with the Confederate flag flying, off that town.
The boat fired a shot at us, to which we replied ; a number of tents extending for half a mile were upon the shore fronting the river. When three or four shots had been exchanged a battery on shore fired several guns, then another battery opened upon us.
The Lexington and this vessel fired some twenty shots, when, finding the current fast setting us down upon their batteries, with which we were in no condition to cope, having very little powder on board and only half enough gun tackles for working the battery, we returned. I think both officers and crew were remarkably cool under the fire 5 it was not, indeed, so close as to be very dangerous.
I intended to wait for this gunboat when away from her batteries, but she ran alongside the river bank and made fast. Upon passing Columbus and the chalk-banks we were fired upon by rebels with muskets. This was. returned with muskets principally, but also by two great guns.
The army at Hickman is considerable.

Dear General : My picket at Benton just sends me word that 4,000 troops landed at Commerce to-day, and that a man from the Cape states that a large force will leave there to-night. I see from the Saint Louis papers that General Prentiss left Ironton with a large force, to hunt Hardee. So it seems we have attracted their attention at last, and they are after us. What is now to be done f Send Pillow word, or go on with the programme ? They cannot more than drive me back, at the worst. I will send up immediately to find out the truth about Commerce, and will carefully watch the Cape. Some gentlemen in from Bollinger say there are 1,000 Federals at Dallas and 1,200 of my men at Lakeville. If I should be compelled to go across to Bloomfield, your movement will be covered by a general retreat, and be probably more effectually done than if I were to stay fighting in squads.

My men from Hardee are at Lakeville, and have scarcely any powder, but an abundance of lead, and we are rather scarce ourselves. I would be pleased, therefore, to have about 20 kegs rifle powder; 10,000 musket caps; 20,000 shot-gun caps, and 10,000 musket cartridges. With these I think I can hold the country against any force which may be sent against me. Various rumors of the movements of the' enemy reached me last night, which puts me on the qui vive, but I have not had any of them confirmed by the pickets this morning, although I ordered all the pickets to advance at daybreak until they felt the enemy, never mind how strong.

ever there is no prospect of whipping in a fight. If your movements can be kept secret, you succeed ; but I think this is almost impossible in an army of gentlemen. It may be necessary for me to fall back on Bloomfield if attacked too strongly; but if they come after me, you will succeed in your enterprise; and if they suspect you,-they cannot spare men to hunt me in these swamps, for they know that I will kill all that come. If you could noisily charter all the small steamboats for a trip up White River, it might make the people believe you were going to Hardee.

If the post at Sikeston was maintained, I am in the best point in the country; but, when the enemy find that it is abandoned (if they can spare forces from Bird’s Point), I will be in danger of being cut off. Four thousand men have just reached Cape Girardeau from Ironton, having marched across, with 150 wagons. I am having them carefully watched, and will be prepared to retreat to Bloomfield at a moment’s warning. Forces from all directions are pouring into Cairo.

I have directed them, on the approach of the enemy in force, to send their baggage to Bloomfield, and to skirmish or to fight them until I reached them, either in person or by orders. I am afraid your plans have been frustrated, and hope you will now suddenly and unexpectedly change them, and strike a severe blow somewhere.

Report of Brig. Gen. 8. A. Hurlbut, TJ. 8. Army.
General: I inclose herewith the report of Col. N. G. Williams, Third Iowa, in relation to the affair at Shelbina. Certain other facts relative to my movements are necessary for the full understanding of the matter.
I left Kirksville, in Adair County, on August 30, with detachment of 500 men, Third Iowa, in command of Lieutenant-Colonel Scott; seven companies Sixteenth Illinois, Colonel Smith; Mattison’s artillery, two pieces, and one other piece attached to the Sixteenth. There were also about 150 Home Guards, nearly all mounted, temporarily led by Lieutenant Call, of Third Iowa. We marched that day to Wilson’s, 16 miles. On the 31st of August we moved from Wilson to Lakeland, 15 miles. On the 1st of September from Lakeland to Bethel, 15 miles.
At Bethel I was joined by Colonel Moore’s command, 850 men, with one piece of artillery. I then ordered Colonel Smith and Colonel Moore, with their commands, to proceed by Philadelphia to Palmyra; Colonel Smith to hold Palmyra, and Colonel Moore to follow Green’s force wherever he might be advised it was, giving them all the artillery and cavalry. My information there was that Green was at Philadelphia.
With the sick men of the command, numbering over 120, and the Third Iowa, I moved from Bethel, through Shelbyville, to Shelbina. I reached Shelbina in a terrific rain and wind storm on the 2d September about 7 p. m. It was impossible to telegraph for railroad transportation on account of the storm, and the men went into quarters for the night. Transportation was ordered in the morning of the 3d; arrived about noon, and the command was transported to Brookfield. At Shelbina I first learned that Colonel Williams had gone to Paris, but I was also informed that he had not less than 1,200 men with him, including his own force and the Second Kansas Begiment. There were no supplies of any kind at Shelbina, and I saw no reason to suppose that there was any cause for holding my immediate command there.

## p. 157 (#171) ############################################

﻿Chap. X.] OPERATIONS IN NORTHEASTERN MO., ETC.	157.
On the 4th I sent trains down from Brookfield to bring up Colonel Williams’ force. About 11 a. m. I received a dispatch from Colonel Williams asking re-enforcements; that he was surrounded by some 3,000 men. I answered by telegraph that I would come down with 350 men, to assist him and to hold the place. Shortly after I received another dispatch that the enemy had opened fire with two pieces of artillery. I ordered that the troops charge at once and take the battery.
These dispatches were received at Shelbina. I hurried forward the embarkation of the men at Brookfield, and started as rapidly as possible. On arriving at Macon City, I learned by telegraph that Colonel Williams’ force had abandoned Shelbina, and were then near Clarence, 12 miles east of Macon. As it was now near night, I concluded to wait for their arrival. They came up about 8 p. m. I sent for Colonel Williams and the officers of the Second Kansas Begiment, and demanded the reasons for withdrawal. Colonel Blair and Major Cloud stated that they had insisted on the abandonment of the place against Colonel Williams’ consent; that they considered the order to charge the battery impracticable. They further informed me that their time of service was out; that by orders from General Fremont they were on their way home to reorganize the regiment; showed me Major-General Fremont’s orders for their transportation west, and demanded transportation accordingly. I requested them as a matter of justice to Colonel Williams to put their statement into writing, which was done, and a copy of which is hereto attached.
In the morning of the 6th I ordered down the balance of my force from Brookfield, and sent the Second Kansas west. Great delay occurred in obtaining the necessary timber and material for the repair of the road, which we had ascertained to be very much torn up in the neighborhood of Shelbina, especially as the engineers refused to run after dark.
On the morning of the 7th of September, having collected the necessary material, and taking under my command the Third Iowa and two hundred men of the Illinois Sixteenth, I started east on the road and worked through without opposition, but with considerable delay, to Shelbina, where I had the honor of opening communications with you. I was in hopes that the Second Kansas would have remained with the command, but did not consider that I had any authority to order them to do so. As Brookfield was, in my judgment, much exposed to attack, and had a large amount of Government property, I requested them to remain and guard that point. This they also declined, but afterwards, on arriving at the post, concluded to do so.
It appears from Colonel Williams’statement that he had only 280 of his own men; that he was willing to hold Shelbina, and wholly refused to abandon it, but was compelled to do so by the action of the Second Kansas.
The only casualty that occurred at Shelbina was that Captain McClure, of the Second Kansas, lost his foot by a cannon ball. I learned from good sources at that point that at least seven of the enemy were killed. The force was commanded by Martin E. Green, the same that was at Philadelphia, and fell away from that point before the advance of Moore and Smith, re-enforced largely by sudden levies from Monroe, Marion, and Balls Counties. Their numbers I only gather from the reports made to me. I do not think that Green had of his own command more than 1,200.
It is my opinion that Shelbina could have been held, but the fault of

surrendering that position does not rest, in my judgment, on any of the officers or men of my command.

Report of Col.. Nelson G. Williams, Third Iowa Infantry.
Macon, September 5,1861.
Sir : In obedience to your order, I respectfully submit the following statement of facts connected with the Paris expedition and the reasons why I retired from Shelbina :
Late Friday evening (August 30) I received a telegraphic dispatch, from General Pope to take my effective command, together with Loring’s cavalry, proceed to Palmyra, open the road, and then go to Paris and take the specie and funds in the bank, and send it to Saint Louis. Early Saturday morning I started from Brookfield to execute the order. I arrived at Palmyra about noon, was there informed by the railroad employes that we would have to go to Hannibal in order to turn the engine west, they telling me it would be impossible to back the train. As a further reason for going to Hannibal, there was $150,000 in specie on board, and from instructions I received it would be in some danger of being seized by the rebels. I arrived at Hannibal, and while feeding my men the Second Kansas Regiment arrived per boat, en route for Kansas, to recruit. I immediately invited them to join me in the Paris expedition, as I had learned on my down trip that it would be unsafe with my force (320 men) to go into Monroe County. They consented, and we started Sunday morning. Arrived at Shelbina about noon. I pressed into service some wagons to carry provisions and sick men, and started for Paris about 8 o’clock in the evening. My entire force consisted of about 620 men, viz, 520 infantry and 100 cavalry. I arrived in Paris at daylight Monday morning, September 2. I immediately proceeded to the bank, in company with M. Cassel, esq. (agent to receive money). We called the directors together. They informed us that the cashier had taken the money to a safe place, and that they did not know where he or the money was. We waited during the day, thinking that they would get the money. In the afternoon I learned that the whole country was rising in arms against us. About 5 o’clock I gave the order to prepare for our return march, but a tremendous storm coming up I countermanded the order, and resolved to stay in Paris overnight. I quartered my men in the court-house and vacant buildings. About midnight we received an alarm and turned out under arms, and remained so during the night. Started on our return at daybreak. In the mean time I had learned that Green and his forces had got past General Hurlbut, and that he had prepared an ambush for me on the straight road to Shelbina. I determined to take the road to Clinton, making a detour of 10 miles. Every step of the way I found evidence that the whole people were in arms. I arrived, however, in Shelbina at night, having escaped the ambush, but had one man wounded (supposed mortally) by the enemy’s pickets. When I arrived in Shelbina I found

do communication east or west; also learned that General Hurlbut had left that day for Brookfield. During the night had two alarms. In the morning, and after the enemy had shown himself in force, a train arrived from the west, and brought word that another train was coming to take my command away. In the mean time the enemy was gathering in still greater force, so that I could make out about 3,000. About noon I received a note from the rebel commander, giving me thirty minutes to move the women and children and to surrender. I ordered the women to leave, but made no reply to Green. I barricaded the streets and prepared to resist the enemy. After a short time the enemy opened on us with two pieces of artillery, one 9 and one 6 pounder (reported to me to be brass by an escaped prisoner). Their battery was planted a full mile off. I am satisfied that at this time the enemy numbered full 4,000. With my glass I could discover a strong force under cover of timber to support their artillery. I offered to lead the men out on the plain and offer the enemy battle. Major Cloud, of the Second Kansas, objected. I did not insist, as I thought the opposing force too great. During the firing I discovered the enemy some 2 miles in the west tearing up the track. I immediately ordered one company on the train to run up to them, which was done, and the enemy driven from that point. I observed also a force in the east tearing up track, and started a train that way, but the train came back, as the enemy opened upon it with their artillery. The officer in command reported to me that he supposed the engine and train of more value than a little piece of track. I told him he did right.
The enemy fired well. Almost every shot was well pointed, either striking the building or falling in the square. Captain McClure, of the Second Kansas, had his foot shot off. After receiving some thirty shots, the officers of the Second Kansas held a meeting, and sent Major Cloud to me, demanding that I should withdraw the men, saying they had been in one Springfield fight and did not wish to be in another (meaning fighting against such odds), and also that if I would withdraw and get artillery they would come back with me. He further stated that his men were discontented*, and supposed they were going home, and did not like being brought on the expedition; that he, to encourage them, had held out the inducement to them that the money in the bank was to pay them off with; that they only considered themselves in the light of volunteers, &c. I still resisted, and declared I would not mention the subject of retreating to my men, as I had been to them and told them we could hold the place; but finally they insisted so strongly, and fearing there might be a stampede, I consented to call the officers together. When they met, I said to them I had nothing further to say. After they had decided it to be expedient to retire, I told them to wait orders. I delayed giving orders any further than to tell them to go to their companies and prepare to move. After a few minutes I saw the Kansas men starting for the cars. They filled the first train and started. I jumped on the engine, and ordered the engineer to move slow, so that the cavalry could keep up with him on the right flank (the enemy was on the south). I then jumped off, and started back for my own men (280), but they, seeing the Kansas men off, had got on the second train and started before I got back. In the confusion the Iowa men left some of their coats and knapsacks* in quarters. They did not know at the time we were retiring from the enemy. There were also one transportation wagon and four mules left, all of which might have been brought off had they waited for orders.

Report of Lieut. Col. Charles W. Blair and Maj. .William F. Cloud, Second Kansas Infantry.
Hudson, Mo., September 5,1861.
Sir : It is perhaps proper for me to state formally to you a fact or two relative to the evacuation of Shelbina on yesterday.
The enemy numbered, as nearly as we could ascertain, about 3,000, and we had about 600 effective men. We drove them several times, and held our position until the enemy brought to bear upon us two pieces of artillery, one 6 and one 9 pounder. We having no artillery, and not being able to reach them otherwise, but being compelled to sit still behind barricades and receive discharges of artillery which would inevitably have destroyed the command, I, after consultation with Major Cloud and the officers of the Second Kansas, insisted upon the men being withdrawn until we could be re-enforced by artillery, which we understood was at Brookfield. Colonel Williams was averse to the withdrawal, but we insisted that it should be done, and he finally yielded a reluctant and unwilling assent, and as we had volunteered to serve in the Paris expedition, he was in courtesy compelled to pay some attention to our wishes in the matter, and consequently he at last yielded.

SEPTEMBER 1-3,1861.—Expeditions through Jefferson County, Mo.
Report of Col. Chester Harding) Tenth Missouri Infantry.

Sir : Major Holmes, with a detachment of 320 men, returned from Jefferson County on the 1st instant. He did not succeed in finding the enemy in force, but found a camp which had recently been deserted, and saw squads of mounted men at a distance too great for pursuit by infantry. Several flying rebels were fired upon, and some of the men say two were killed, but Major Holmes thinks this to be a mistake.
I desired very much to arrest two of the more notorious leaders of the rebels, one Hildebrand and a Dr, Smith; both fled. The expedi-

tion captured four horses, abandoned by their owners, who had fled to the brush, which were turned over to the quartermaster, and six prisoners, who are named as follows: Charles Williams (half-breed), John Feehan, Peter Hogg, Michael Bannon, John Byan, and Augustus Hymers, all of whom will be sent to Saint Louis to-night. Williams was caught with a huge knife in his hands, apparently creeping upon one of our sentries. I shall deliver him to Colonel Burbank, to be kept for such action as may be deemed requisite. I suggest that he, at least, be sent to Cairo. The four next named are Irishmen, from Saint Louis, who say they visited the region in which they were found to seek employment. They were doubtless sent there to find employment as recruits for the Southern Army, but as there is no positive evidence against them, I shall release them on their arrival in Saint Louis, having first administered the oath to them. The last one, Hymers, is a Jew, 45 Spruce street, between Third tod Fourth, Saint Louis. He gives a most confused account of himself $ but although it is most probable that he has been used as recruiting agent and spy, no positive evidence can be brought against him. He will also be released at Saint Louis.
Having heard that the secessionists had assembled again after Major Holmes left, I sent another party to attempt to surprise them last night. As they probably supposed our men to be wearied out, and as the night was dark and stormy, the attempt may be successful. I shall not hear from them before the evening train leaves.
Yesterday morning I went to Washington, and there directed Colonel Kallmann to leave guards at the Saint John Bceuf Creek, Big and Little Berger Bridges, and take the remainder of his force from Miller’s Landing south to Georgetown, near the Bourbeuse Biver, on the line between Franklin and Gasconade Counties, to chastise some rebels who had gathered in that vicinity and were committing depredations on the Union men. He was to relieve the Home Guard then guarding those bridges, who were to come to this place. I also directed Colonel Owens, of the Home Guard, to ascertain if he could induce 200 of them to volunteer for a four days’ expedition into Crawford County, leaving the Southwest Branch Bailroad at Stanton, proceeding up the Bourbeuse to a point opposite Cuba, and within a few miles of the point to which Kallmann was going, via Cuba to the Meramec, thence down the Mera-inee to a point opposite Stanton, and thence return for muster. That region is full of the most pestiferous.traitors. This morning, however, Owens telegraphed me that Colonel Kallmann did not relieve his men, who would have readily volunteered, but proceeded with his whole command from Miller’s Landing. The superintendent of the Pacific Bailroad also informed me that I could not have a special train, as Colonel Wyman, at Bolla, had an engine and train which was likely to be on the road at any moment excepting when it would come in conflict with the regular trains.
I was the more disappointed to learn this fact, as Colonel Wyman had sent a messenger to me last night, urging me to send a force to Cuba (25 miles distant from Bolla), for its protection, and to disperse a large body of rebels said to be in camp near there. ^This expedition must be deferred, therefore. Colonel Wyman may have concluded to use the means at his command to effect the same purpose.
A regiment is started to-day by the enrollment of one company. Several others are ready to join it as soon as they can be relieved. The bridges from Cheltenham to Meramec Station (outside of my district) are guarded by Home Guards which belong here, and are anxious 11 R R—VOL III

If Colonel Peabody is able to co-operate with General Lane, it will afford him some assistance. You will perceive that this is the only aid which I could extend. The general commanding must be aware that the communication via the Hannibal and Saint Joe Road is seriously interrupted, and must remain so for some time; therefore, if it wilLnot be considered presumptuous in me, I would suggest, as the best means of augmenting the forces under General Lane, a column of at least 3,000 troops be detached at once from Jefferson City, with orders to unite with Lane on the Osage; the only way, in my judgment, which will afford Lane the necessary and timely succor.
Our mail and telegraph connections with the east are and have been entirely cut off for the past five days, and I have availed myself of the movements of a private individual in the hope this may reach you. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Fort Lincoln, September 3,1861.
I informed you that we drove back the advanced guard of the enemy and of the loss of Weer’s mules. My cavalry engaged the whole force of the enemy yesterday for two hours 12 miles east of Fort Scott. It turns out to be the column of Price and Eains, numbering from 6,000 to 10,000, with seven pieces of artillery, some 12-pounders. I last night fell back upon this point, leaving there at midnight. I left my cavalry to amuse the enemy until we could establish ourselves here and remove our good stores from Fort Scott. I have ordered Major Dean to join me by forced marches. I am compelled to make a stand here, or give up Kansas to disgrace and destruction.
If you do not hear from me again, you can understand I am surrounded by a superior force. When thus situated, I trust the Government will see the necessity for re enforcing me. My loss so far is about 5 killed and 6 wounded. The enemy has suffered considerably.
The fight yesterday was a gallant one on our part. Colonel Montgomery and Colonel Weer behaved admirably. In fact, all the troops engaged behaved steadily. Lieutenant Hollister is here, and is making himself useful. I can only try again. Send me re-enforcements.

I am holding Barnesville, 12 miles northeast of Fort Scott, within 1J miles of the border, with an irregular force of about 250 men, stationed in log buildings, and am now strengthening their position with earth intrenchments.
I have here a regular force of about 1,200 men, and an irregular force I am now organizing, amounting in all to about 400 or 600 men, and am strengthening the position to stay. I have before given you all the information as to the strength of the enemy. All sources of information concur that their force is in the neighborhood of 6,000; that they have fortified themselves on the Dry Wood, 10 miles northeast of Fort Scott, and are rapidly re-enforcing; that they have seven pieces of artillery, either one or two 12-pounder howitzers, and the balance 6-pound-

ers; that they have already 1,000 mounted men, that are increasing much more rapidly than their infantry. The cavalry that we engaged are armed with minie rifles, and from the prisoners we have taken we learn the entire force is armed with the same. In their artillery are some of the guns taken from our army at the battle near Springfield. To retake those guns it seems to me would benefit the cause of the country as much as any other event that could transpire. Cannot this Government supply me without delay with sufficient artillery and men to destroy that army and capture those guns 1 It is within 15 miles of me, with a smooth prairie between us. In twelve hours after being reenforced I can be upon them, give peace to Kansas, confuse the enemy, and advance the cause of the Union. I have detailed Lieutenant Hollister to the command, in the absence of Colonel Johnson, of the two companies of Iowa troops, and should like to retain him here in that command and as mustering officer. He has proved himself a gallant officer.

I have just received information from the advance at Fort Scott that the enemy has broken up camp and is moving to the rear, and from a deserter that their destination is Lexington. It may be true that they are moving upon Lexington, but I am acting upon the opinion that they are moving to the rear for the purpose of crossing over to the north side of the Osage, expecting to attack Barnesville, this post, and Fort Scott, in detail. Should my opinion be correct, this movement places us in rather an awkward situation, but I hope to extricate myself and defeat them. If the move is upon Lexington, I will annoy them as far as my forces and the protection of Kansas will admit of. I cannot believe, however, that that army has retreated satisfied with the stealing of 60 mules and with a loss of from 150 to 200 men in killed and wounded. I will therefore move over to meet them on the north side of the Osage, first at Barnesville, and the final stand at this place.

Jefferson City, Mo., September 3,1861.
General : Last night I started an expedition, consisting of the Fifth Iowa Regiment, under command of Colonel Worthington, with some cavalry, across the river in the direction of Columbia, Boone County, with orders to capture or disperse all armed parties he could find, and also to take into possession all property belonging to such parties. This expedition was sent under my immediate supervision, during the terrible rain, which continued most of the night, and is by this (11 o’clock) time on its march from the river to Columbia. I hope to surprise some of the rebel camps. Colonel Worthington’s command will return on Saturday. I have taken steps to secure the money in the banks at Kansas City, Independence, and Lexington, and will immediately take steps to secure that at the other points mentioned, if possible.
An expedition which I sent out a few days ago in the direction of Iberia returned yesterday with some four or five prisoners, two of whom were captured with United States muskets in their possession. I have them confined. Colonel McClelland, who commanded this expedition, reports troops collecting there for the Confederate Army.
Reports vary much in estimating the number of troops collecting in the vicinity of Warsaw, but all agree that this part of the country is very active in furnishing recruits and supplies.
It is now time for the mail to leave.

I marched on Green at dark Sunday. Beached his camp at daylight in morning. As usual, he had received notice of our approach, but, in consequence of night marches, few hours before I reached there. His force, about 3,000, scattered in every direction, leaving much bag-gage, provisions, and forage, as also the public property captured at Shelbina. The infantry of my command was, of course, unable to pursue after a forced night march of 23 miles. The few horsemen followed the train for 10 or 15 miles until it scattered in various directions. The bulk of his force has crossed the Horth Missouri road at Benick, and are making for woods of Chariton. I go west with Sixteenth Illinois and Third Iowa immediately in pursuit.
Moore’s force proceeded by land to Canton, and will there organize. Four hundred of Bussey’s cavalry are in Hortheast Missouri, but I think not doing much. As soon as I can run down Green’s force I will go to Keokuk. Please send Colonel Tindall back to Brookfield immediately ) he went down for his arms to Saint Louis, and can now be of much service.
Glover and Moore will organize their regiments I hope in a few days. Green’s force is mounted, and infantry cannot do much in overtaking them.
The railroad east of Brookfield is open, and I think no more secession camps will be made within 20 miles.

Stembel, for a reconnaissance to Columbus. About 7 o’clock a. ra. we passed Islands Nos. 3 and 4, where we discovered the camp tires a few miles above Columbus, on the Kentucky shore, exactly in the center of the two natural platform bluffs commanding the river and Belmont. In attempting to pass the foot of Lucas Bend, near Columbus, two batteries opened fire on us, one consisting of three the other of four guns, but, notwithstanding the high elevation given to their pieces, their shot all fell short. We did not answer, as they were out of range and we could not do them any damage, the caliber of the guns being two 24-pounder howitzers and 24 and 32 pounders on barbette carriages. The direction of their guns was good, the powder weak, and the fuses entirely too long. I was quite well satisfied with the reconnaissance, but, having some suspicion of gunboats lying in Lucas Bend, I requested Captain Stembel to throw some shell in the bend. This was done, and caused the appearance of two gunboats. One of them followed us. As it was not our intention to enter into an engagement we retreated, and arrived at Cairo this day at 10 o’clock a. m. It is beyond doubt that on the bluffs at Columbus there is a camp of at least 2,000 men, with two batteries of heavy guns, about six pieces in all, and opposite between Belmont and Lucas Bend there are about 1,000 men and some field pieces.
It affords me pleasure to report the cool, calculating, and energetic behavior of Captain Stembel, his officers and men.

Gunboats returned. Engaged batteries at Lucas Bend all day. Found 16 guns on Missouri shore. Rebel batteries all silenced. One man wounded on Conestoga. The gunboat Yankee was disabled, and would have been taken but for land batteries near Columbus. The rebels must have suffered severely. Discovered large bodies of cavalry on Missouri side. Saw no troops on Kentucky side.

This morning Colonel Waagner started from Norfolk, with all the force that could be spared from that point, to reconnoiter towards Belmont, supported by the gunboats Conestoga and Lexington. They went as far as Beckwith’s farm, about 5 miles below Norfolk. Found no regular force, but had 1 man wounded and lost 1 horse by shots from the pickets of the rebels. The gunboats, however, penetrated

farther, and found large numbers of cavalry on the Missouri shore, and as near as they could ascertain 15 pieces of artillery on wheels and 1 large piece in position. Some of the pieces were ascertained to be 24 jiounder rifled guns.
The gunboat Yankee could not be induced to come far from a battery on the Kentucky shore. Captain Stembel, however, succeeded in bursting a shell in her wheel-house, disabling her so much that she retired, working but one engine.
The batteries on shore were silenced, and the officers commanding gunboats think with considerable loss to the enemy. On two occasions they saw shell explode in the midst of the batteries, after which they could see by the aid of their glasses men being carried to the rear. One man was wounded dangerously by a musket-ball fired from the shore. Further than this no damage was sustained by either of the boats. The machinery of the Lexington is out of order, and I have permitted her to go to Mound City for repairs.
All the forces show great alacrity in preparing for any movement that looks as if it was to meet an enemy, and if discipline and drill were equal to their zeal, I should feel great confidence even against large odds.
The enemy were seen to cross and recross the river, with what design I am at a loss to tell. My impression is that they want time to prepare for defense of their present position or for an advance on one of our positions, likely Paducah. If it were discretionary with me, with a little addition to my present force I would take Columbus. Your order will, however, be executed.

Received dispatch last night from Lexington by the hands of Lieutenant Pease, dated 9th. Colonel Mulligan had arrived all safe, and Colonel Marshall was scouring the country. Dispatches from Warrensburg leave no doubt but that Price is there in strong force, and is moving on towards Lexington. Some of his cavalry took possession of Georgetown Tuesday, causing great consternation among the people. Booneville is menaced by a small force, but if the troops I sent yesterday do their duty, they have landed there by this time.

Warrensburg with considerable force, and moving in the direction of Lexington, is now beyond doubt. Many persons are coming in hourly from that vicinity, confirming the fact.
His force is variously estimated at from 5,000 to 15;000. His cavalry took possession of Georgetown on Tuesday. The commander at Boone-ville sent me two dispatches last night, asking for re-enforcements, as that place was also threatened by 600 men. I had, however, anticipated this, and sent a detachment up the river yesterday, sufficient to drive them off, if they do their duty.
Lieutenant Pease, a very intelligent officer, arrived last night with dispatches from Colonel Mulligan, at Lexington, and reports all quiet there. They had not heard of Price’s advance, but the colonel informed me that he had secured the money in the bank at that place, and was taking steps to secure that of other banks, in obedience to my orders. I also ordered him, immediately after his arrival, to commence fortifying Lexington, which he informs me he is doing. STo troops from Kansas, except about 300, had arrived. Nothing was known there of General Pope’s movements. Affairs south of this, and in Calloway County, are being vigorously straightened out by some detachments I sent out some days ago.

The general commanding desires to say that two Indiana regiments leave for Jefferson City to-night or to-morrow early; a third regiment leaves to-morrow, and probably two batteries of artillery.

Major General Fremont :
Sir : The advance guard of General Price’s force was at Warrensburg on Tuesday night en route for Lexington. His force 11,000. Unless re-enforcements can reach that post, it will most probably fall. It would be a great disaster, giving control to the enemy of the upper country.
If by telegraph a train of cars could leave Saint Charles immediately (empty), for the purpose of taking up the troops under General Sturgis, and another train could leave Hannibal empty so as to take the troops of General Sturgis and General Pope along the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Bailroad to Hamilton, a point about 40 miles from Lexington, the place might be relieved by a forced march from Hamilton. I make the suggestion because of the great importance to the country of maintaining the position. It may be too late now, but it is worth the effort.

It is confidently expected that, even should you fail to defeat the enemy, you will be at least strong enough to break through his lines and effect a junction with our forces at Lexington, which, by your aid and that of other re-enforcements ordered to that point, will then be strong enough not only to defend that place successfully, but to assume the offensive.
It is expected that General Lane, who will be kept fully informed of these movements, will be able to act with you from Kansas City; but should the rebels change their plan of operations and attack that place, you will unite with him and General Sturgis in its defense.

I have and am sending forward troops, but I cannot take permanent possession with any considerable force until I get means either by rail or wagons to get forward supplies.

If the rebels have been defeated at Lexington, they will in my opinion retire to the Osage, in order to be supported by McCulloch. That would be difficult if Warsaw were occupied, and I cannot get there without transportation. I am exerting every effort to get teams organized to make a move in that direction. If I were now at Georgetown I could cut off his retreat. The bridge across the La Mine is now the great obstacle to progress in that direction to Sedalia. I shall overcome that as soon as possible.

Sir : It is reported that Lexington is surrounded by an overwhelming rebel force of 16,000, and that our re-enforcements from Utica and Liberty, uuder command of Brigadier-General Sturgis, are opposite to Lexington, and prevented from crossing the river by two rebel batteries. To assist Colonel Mulligan and his brave little band of 2,000, General Lane will harass the enemy by sudden attacks upon exposed posts upon his flank and rear, and you will act according to the order of the 18tli, and endeavor to break through the enemy’s lines. Should you not succeed in effecting a junction with Colonel Mulligan at Lexington, you are to retreat, and take such a position as your own strength and the movements and force of the rebels may render advisable.
Should the whole force of the enemy be concentrated around Lexington, it may be sufficient to retreat to Davis’ Creek, or at farthest to Dunksburg$ in either of which cases a junction with the forces of General Lane, consisting of 2,200 volunteers, with a large Home Guard force, may be effected.
Should the rebels hold Warrensburg with a larger force than yours, or if reliable information should reach you that McCulloch is also operating towards Lexington, you will take position at Georgetown or Sedalia.
Should McCulloch operate towards Jefferson City, but not be able to reach that place before 1 can re-enforce it (and 1 shall start Monday), it should not detain your forward movements from Georgetown to Lexington.

You will keep me constantly informed of your own movements and those of the enemy.

General James H. Lane,
Commanding Kansas Brigade, West Point, Mo.:
General : The last reliable information reports Price at Lexington with his whole force, 15,000 to 20,000. He demanded a surrender of the force under Colonel Mulligan, which, as I suppose, is composed of the Irish Brigade and Peabody’s command. This demand was not complied with. A fight ensued without the results desired by the enemy. Be-enforcements are expected at Lexington from the north side of the river. The column under Colonel Smith drove the secessionists to the river opposite the Blue Mills Landing, when a fight ensued. Federal loss reported by telegraph as 50 killed, 25 wounded $ the toss of the enemy 150 to 200.
I have this moment received a telegraphic dispatch from General Fremont, dated to-day. He wanted to know your position. I replied, “Last heard from (the 17th) at West Point, marching on Harrisonville.” You will readily see the importance of concentrating your force to

By some misunderstanding the ammunition which was turned over to the Quartermaster’s Department for transportation was not sent to you. Lieutenant Weed will leave as soon as the ambulances you desire can be put in readiness, and will take with him the ammunition, as also the men now here belonging to your brigade.

General : By a telegram of to-day, sent to Capt. W. E. Prince, of Fort Leavenworth, the officer in command of the Second Kansas Regiment has been directed to take the steamer West Wind, or any other steamer, and proceed at once carefully down the river to join you. You will therefore* send a messenger up the river to communicate to the commander of the Second Kansas Regiment such orders as you may deem proper to secure a safe landing of the boat, and then make every effort to cross the river and effect a junction with Colonel Mulligan. Acting Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, of Jefferson City, will also endeavor with his force to join Colonel Mulligan from Georgetown by land and from Glasgow by steamer. Every effort, therefore, should be made to retain the post at Lexington.

A junction of your force must be formed at once with Sturgis at Kansas City. It is to be regretted that this was not perfected as originally suggested.

Report of Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, commanding Missouri State Guard (Confederate), of operations, September 10-20.
Headquarters Missouri State Guard,
Camp Wallace, Lexington, Mo., September 21, 1861.
I have the honor to submit to your excellency the following report of the action which terminated on the 20th instant with the surrender of the United States forces and property at this place to the army under my command:
After chastising the marauding armies of Lane and Montgomery and driving them out of the State, and after compelling them to abandon Fort Scott, as detailed in my last report, I continued my march towards this point with an army increasing hourly in numbers and enthusiasm.
On the 10th instant, just as we were about to encamp for the day a mile or two west of Bose Hill, I learned that a detachment of Federal troops and Home Guards were marching from Lexington to Warrens-burg, to rob the bank in that place and plunder and arrest the citizens of Johnson County, in accordance with General Fremont’s proclamation and instructions. Although my men were greatly fatigued by several days’ continuous and rapid marching, I determined to press forward so as to surprise the enemy, if possible, at Warrensburg. Therefore, after resting a few hours, we resumed the march at sunset, and marched without intermission until 2 o’clock in the morning, when it became evident that the infantry, very few of whom had eaten a mouthful in twenty-two hours, could march no farther. T then halted them, and went forward with the largest part of my mounted men until we came, about daybreak, within view of Warrensburg, where I ascertained that the enemy had hastily fled about midnight, burning the bridges behind them.
The rain began to fall about the same time. This circumstance,

﻿186	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., RANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
coupled with the fact that my men had been fasting for more than twenty-four hours, constrained me to abandon the idea of pursuing the enemy that day. My infantry and artillery having come up, we encamped at Warrensburg, whose citizens vied with each other in feeding my almost famished soldiers.
An unusually violent storm delayed our march the next morning [September 12] until about 10 o’clock. We then pushed forward rapidly, still hoping to overtake the enemy. Finding it impossible to do this with my infantry, I again ordered a detachment to move forward, and placing myself at their head, continued the pursuit to within two and a half miles of Lexington, when, having learned that the enemy were already within town, and it being late and my men fatigued by ar forced march and utterly without provisions, I halted for the night.
About daybreak the next morning [September 13] a sharp skirmish took place between our pickets and the enemy’s outposts. This threatened to become general. Being unwilling, however, to risk a doubtful engagement, when a short delay would make success certain, I fell back 2 or 3 miles and awaited the arrival of my infantry and artillery. These having come up, we advanced upon the town, driving the enemy’s pickets until we came within a short distance of the city itself. Here the enemy attempted to make a stand, but they were speedily driven from every position and forced to take shelter within their intreneh-ments. We then took position within easy range of the college, which building they had strongly fortified, and opened upon them a brisk fire from Bledsoe’s battery, which, in the absence of Captain Bledsoe, who had been wounded at Big Dry Wood, was gallantly commanded by Capt. Emmett MacDonald, and by Parsons’ battery, under the skillful command of Captain Guibor.
Finding, after sunset, that our ammunition, the most of which had been left behind on the march from Springfield, was nearly exhausted, and that my men, thousands of wThom had not eaten a particle in thirty-six hours, required rest and food, I withdrew to the fair ground and encamped there. My ammunition wagons having been at last brought up, and large re-enforcements having been received, I again moved into town on Wednesday, the 18th instant, and began the final attack on the enemy’s works.
Brigadier-General Rains’ division occupied a strong position on the east and northeast of the fortifications, from which an effective cannonading was kept up on the enemy by Bledsoe’s battery, under command, except on the last day, of Capt. Emmett MacDonald, and another battery, commanded by Capt. Churchill Clark, of Saint Louis. Both these gentlemen, and the men and officers under their command, are deservedly commended in accompanying report of Brigadier-General Rains. General Parsons took a position southwest of the works, whence his battery, under command of Captain Guibor, poured a steady fire into the enemy. Skirmishers and sharpshooters were also sent forward from both of these divisions to harass and fatigue the enemy, and to cut them off from the water on the north, east, and south of the college, and did inestimable service in the accomplishment of these purposes.
Col. Congreve Jackson’s division and a part of General Steele’s were posted near Generals Rains’ and Parsons’ as a reserve, but no occasion occurred to call them into action. They were, however, at all times vigilant and ready to rush upon the enemy.
Shortly after entering the city on the 18th Colonel Rives, who commanded the Fourth Division in the absence of General Slack, led his

regiment and Colonel Hughes’ along the river bank to a point immediately beneath and west of the fortifications, General McBride’s command and a portion of Colonel [General] Harris’ having been ordered to re-enforce him. Colonel Rives, in order to cut., off the enemy’s means of escape, proceeded down the bank of the river to capture a steamboat which was lying just under their guns. Just at this moment a heavy fire was opened upon him from Colonel Anderson’s large dwelling-house on the summit of the bluffs, which the enemy were occupying as a hospital, and upon which a white flag was flying. Sever, l companies of General Harris’ command and the'gallant soldiers of the Fourth Division, who have won upon so many battle-fields the proud distinction of always being among the bravest of the brave, immediately rushed upon and took the place. The important position thus secured was within 125 yards of the enemy’s intrenchments. A company from Colonel Hughes’ regiment then took possession of the boats, one of which was richly freighted with valuable stores.
General McBride’s and General Harris’ divisions meanwhile gallantly stormed and occupied the bluffs immediately north of Anderson’s house. The possession of these heights enabled our men to harass the enemy so greatly that, resolving to regain them, they made upon the house a successful assault, and one which would have been honorable to them had it not been accompanied by an act of savage barbarity—the coldblooded and cowardly murder of three defenseless men, who had laid down their arms and surrendered themselves as prisoners.
The position thus retaken by the enemy was soon regained by the brave men who had been driven from it, and was thenceforward held by them to the very end of the contest. The heights to the left of Anderson’s house, which had been taken, as before stated, by Generals McBride and Harris, and by part of Steele’s command, under Colonel Boyd and Major Winston, were rudely fortified by our soldiers, who threw up breastworks as well as they could with their slender means.
. On the morning of the 20th instant I caused a number of hemp bales to be transported to the river heights, where movable breastworks were speedily constructed out of them by Generals Harris and McBride, Colonel Rives and Major Winston, and their respective commands. Captain Kelly’s battery (attached to General Steele’s division) was ordered at the same time to the position occupied by General Harris’ force, and quickly opened a very effective fire, under the direction of its gallant captain, upon the enemy. These demonstrations, and particularly the continued advance of the hempen breastworks, which were as efficient as the cotton bales at Kew Orleans, quickly attracted the attention and excited the alarm of the enemy, who made many daring attempts to drive us back. They were, however, repulsed in every instance by the unflinching courage and fixed determination of our men.
In these desperate encounters the veterans of McBride’s and Slack’s divisions fully sustained their proud reputation, while Colonel Martin Green and his command, and Colonel Boyd and Major Winston and their commands, proved themselves worthy to fight by the side of the men who had by their courage and valor won imperishable honor in the bloody battle of Springfield.
After 2 o’clock in the afternoon of the 20th, and after fifty-two hours of continuous firing, a white flag was displayed by the enemy on that part of the works nearest to Colonel Green’s position, and shortly afterwards another was displayed opposite to Colonel Rives’. I immediately ordered a cessation of all firing on our part, and sent forward one of my staff officers to ascertain the object of the flag and to open nego-

tiations with the enemy if such should be their desire. It was finally, after some delay, agreed by Colonel Marshall and the officers associated with him for that purpose by Colonel Mulligan that the United States forces should lay down their arms and surrender themselves as prisoners of war to this army. These terms having been made known, were ratified by me and immediately carried into effect.
Our entire loss in this series of engagements amounts to 25 killed and 72 wounded. The enemy’s loss was much greater.
The visible fruits of this almost bloodless victory are very great— about 3,500 prisoners, among whom are Colonels Mulligan, Marshall, Peabody, White, and Grover, Major Yan Horn, and 118 other commissioned officers, 5 pieces of artillery and 2 mortars, over 3,000 stands of infantry arms, a large number of sabers, about 750 horses, many sets of cavalry equipments, wagons, teams, and ammunition, more than $100,000 worth of commissary stores, and a large amount of other property. In addition to all this, I obtained the restoration of the great seal of the State and the public records, which had been stolen from their proper custodian, and about $900,000 in money, of which the bank at this place had been robbed, and which I have caused to be returned to it.
This victory has demonstrated the fitness of our citizen soldiers for the tedious operations of a siege as well as for a dashing charge. They lay for fifty-two hours in the open air without tents or covering, regardless of the sun and rain and in the very presence of a watchful and desperate foe, manfully repelling every assault and patiently awaiting any orders to storm the fortifications. No general ever commanded a braver or a better army. It is composed of the best blood and the bravest men of Missouri.
Where nearly every one, officers and men, behaved so well, as is known to your excellency, who was present with the army during the whole period embraced in this report, it is impossible to make special mention of individuals without seemingly making invidious distinctions.; but I may be permitted to express my personal obligations to my volunteer aides, as well as my staff, for their efficient services and prompt attention to all my orders.
I have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, your excellency’s obedient servant,

After traveling a circuitous route to avoid the observation of the enemy, I took i>osition near the residence of Mr. Tutt, and opened with four guns upon them. These

guns were ably served under the command of Captains Emmett MacDonald and Churchill Clark, whose gallantry and efficiency were justly spoken of by all. Here I offered a gold medal to any artillerist who would strike down the large flag on the southeast corner of the battlements. It was quickly won by Capt. Churchill Clark, though closely contended for.
About 11 a. m. I closed.in and around the college, placing a large force in an entirely protected position about 350 yards north and about 500 yards east. I remained there throwing out sharpshooters and skirmishers to annoy and fatigue the enemy, while at the same time the approaches to the water were completely guarded. But one sally was made by the enemy on the evening of the 18th, which was quickly repulsed.
All the men under my command acted with a patience, courage, and endurance worthy only of the cause engaged in, and for more than fifty hours they lay there panting like the hounds in summer when they scent the stately deer, eager not for revenge, but to teach again the minions of the tyrant that Missouri shall be free.
The loss in this almost bloodless victory amounts in the Second Division to 2 killed and 20 wounded. Among the latter is Captain Vaughan, of the Fourth Infantry.

Report of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Harris, Missouri State Guard.
Hdqes. in the Field Second Division Mo. S. G.,
Hear Lexington, September 23,1861.
Sib : In compliance with instructions, I beg leave to submit the following report of the part taken by the forces under my command in the capture of the Federal forces occupying the city of Lexington on the 18th, 19th, and 20th instants:
Leaving 200 hundred men to act as camp guard, at 9 o’clock a. m. of the 18th instant my command, in pursuance to your order, took up the line of march for Lexington. The whole command, acting as infantry, moved by flank, the battery of artillery bringing up the rear. I had proceeded about one mile en route when my advance touched upon the rear of General Parsons’ division, and I soon after received your order to take the road to the left and support the movements of that division. An order to bring my artillery to the advance caused delay of some fifteen or twenty minutes, as the infantry had to give way for its passage along the road. My command arrived at precisely 10 o’clock a. m., and I ordered Captain Kneisley, who was in command of the battery, to take position at an elevated point of intersection of two streets, and to open his fire and imitate the movements of the battery of General Parsons’ division, which was already in action. I detached^Captain Davis’ company, armed with minie rifles, to act as an intermediate covering party for the battery, whilst my whole command, protected by the houses, was held in readiness to support the battery if required. Captain

﻿190	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chvp. X.
Kneisley served his battery very satisfactorily, only suspending his fire from the exhaustion of his men, induced by the excessive heat and from want of sufficient ammunition. The effect of the fire upon the enemy was very evident and destructive. At* one or two positions occupied by my command the enemy annoyed us slightly with both round shot and grape, but a slight change in position sufficed to afford adequate protection against his missiles.
At 11.15 o’clock I received the order from yourself in person to move my command along the bank of the river to the support of General McBride’s command and General Slack’s division, under command of Colonel Bives. At the same time you gave me instructions to capture the brick house outside of the enemy’s line of defense, known as the Anderson house or hospital, provided that if upon my arrival there I was of opinion I could carry it without too severe a loss. My battery of artillery you suggested to remain in its then effective position, saying that you would look to its security.
Immediately upon the receipt of the foregoing instruction I moved my command along to the line of the river, causing the different battalions to debouch to the right and ascend the elevations which protected our movement from the fire of the enemy. I directed the men to crawl to the crests of the hills and annoy the enemy as he should expose himself above his breastworks. Lieutenant-Colonel Brace’s battalion I held to occupy the main road for several hours as a reserve. The active skirmishing of my men from the crests of the hills visibly had an annoying effect upon the enemy, and he responded throughout the day and night with great spirit and indust^.
Upon my reaching the point known as the hospital I dismounted and ascended the hill on foot. Upon my arrival I found Colonel Bives’ command, supported by a portion of Lieutenant-Colonel Hull’s and Major Milton’s (Callaway’s) command of my division. From a personal inspection of the position occupied by the hospital I became satisfied that it was invaluable to me as a point of annoyance and mask for my approach to the enemy. I at the same time received your communication as to the result of your reconnaissance through your glass. I therefore immediately ordered an assault upon the position, in which I was promptly and.gallantly seconded by Colonel Bives and his command, together with Colonel Hull and Major Milton and their commands of my own division. The hospital was promptly carried and occupied by our troops, but during the evening the enemy retook it, and were again driven out by our men with some loss.
Leaving a sufficient force at the hospital to hold it, I descended the hill and moved along the left wing of my command, which, under Colonel Green, had united with General McBride’s command, and had gallantly driven the enemy back from an advanced position, and was occupying an advantageous point in common with General McBride’s command in a trench taken from the enemy near a mine which had [been] sprung. Upon reconnoitering the position of the enemy I directed Colonel Green to deploy his line to the left, which he promptly did, and directed that his riflemen should continue to skirmish with the enemy, whilst his shot-gun men, being out of range, should protect themselves beneath the crest of the hill, and be in readiness if an assault from the enemy’s lines should be attempted. I then directed Lieutenant-Colonels Brace and Hull to mcjve with their commands to the support of Green’s position, and to extend the flank to the left on Colonel Green’s front extended.
This was the position of my command on the night of the 18th in-

stant, the men maintaining a brisk skirmishing with decided effect upon the enemy. Climbing the rugged and precipitous heights during the excessive heat of the day caused the men to suffer greatly for water, but nothing appeared to daunt their resolution* endurance, and valor. They had neither blankets nor food, but they remained steadfastly at their posts during the entire night. In repelling these assaults I had the pleasure to recognize the gallant co-operation of General McBride and his command and the timely assistance of the batteries of Generals Rains and Parsons.
At 7.30 o’clock on the evening of the 18th instant, when a sally was anticipated from the enemy through the hospital position, designed to make a diversion favorable to the landing of anticipated Federal re-enforcements and to burn steamers captured by us during the day, you were kind enough to afford me the valuable re-enforcements from General Steen’s division, commanded by Majors Thornton and Winston, and the battery of Captain Kelly. The infantry I posted to strengthen the hospital position, and the artillery was so disposed as to command the wharf and the river. Col. Congreve Jackson politely loaned me the use of a battalion commanded by Colonel Bevier, which I posted to cover the artillery. During the night I visited frequently the various positions of my command, and found both men and officers fully resolved and capable of maintaining themselves until morning.
On the 19th instant I moved Colonel MacDonald’s command to the extreme left, thus perfecting my connection with General Rains’ right flank. I directed a desultory fire to be kept up during the day by my sharpshooters along my entire front, and directed the line of some rude field fortifications. The commands of Colonel Green and Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Brace, poorly provided with intrenching implements, perfected their defense with astonishing perseverance. None contributed more to the zealous and efficient prosecution of the work than Lieutenant-Colonel Porter, of Colonel Green’s regiment, who, although severely wounded in the head by a ball, continued to afford the most untiring example to the men by his zeal and self-sacrificing services. Where timber could be had as a shelter these field works could be constructed only at the expense of great physical exertion; but where the enemy had removed the means necessary for construction, to extend the lines of defense involved great hazard of life. By a reconnaissance of the hospital position I became satisfied that the construction of flank defenses would afford greatly increased facilities for the annoyance of. the enemy, while it would materially lessen the exposure of our men; but such had been the great exhaustion of our men, that I feared their power of endurance would be overtasked should I impose this new task upon them. Captain Robinson, commanding the Callaway infantry, however, offered to attempt the task. I then directed Capt. George A. Turner, of my staff, to request of ^ou one hundred and thirty-two bales of hemp, which you promptly accorded. Captain Turner was intrusted with the general superintendence of transporting it to the points designated. To the extraordinary zeal, activity, and persevering industry of Captain Turner I feel under the greatest obligations. His services were invaluable to me during the entire engagement. I directed the bales to be wet in the river to protect them against the casualties of fire of our troops and of the enemy, but it was soon found that the wetting so materially increased the weight as to prevent our men in their exhausted condition from rolling them to the crest of the hill. I then adopted the idea of wetting the hemp after it had been transported to its position. In the arduous and extremely trvjng duty of transporting the hemp I

• cannot neglect to recognize the active and cordial co-operation of the commands of Colonels Eives and Hughes, Majors Winston and Thornton, Captains Mitchell, Grooms, and Spratt, and Adjutant Flowerree, of General Steen’s division, Major Peacher, of General Clark’s division, and Major Welton, and the officers and men of General McBride’s division.
At 5 o’clock p. m. on the 19th instant a truce was granted by you to the enemy to enable them to remove their sick and wounded from the hospital which had been captured by us the day previous. This afforded me the opportunity to make final and complete arrangements for defense of the hospital position during the day, notwithstanding the active skirmishing along the entire line. Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Brace had been enabled materially to improve and extend their defenses, composed of earthwork and timber. During the day and entire night of the 19th I was almost continually in the saddle, visiting the various positions, and giving detailed instructions to all grades. The extreme exhaustion and fatigues which I suffered taught me to appreciate fully the heroic patriotism and endurance of those brave men who had been exposed with me for forty-eight hours continuously, without comparatively either food, water, or blankets, and encountering the severest physical trials.
At 8 o’clock a. m. on the 20th instant I ordered up additional hemp to extend the defenses at the position occupied by Colonel Green and Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Brace. The activity and zeal of these commands in putting the bales in position reflect the greatest honor upon them. I directed them to be used as portable breastworks, to be pushed forward towards the enemy’s lines in parallel approaches. The disclosure of the hemp defenses or approaches, as they might be called, elicited the obstinate resentment of the enemy, who was profuse in the bestowal of round and grape shot, and was not at all economical of his minie balls; but our men, gallantly led by their officers, continued to approach the enemy, pouring in upon him a most destructive fire until about 2 o’clock p. m., when he surrendered.
The loss sustained by my division in the entire engagement was: Killed, 11; severely wounded, 18; slightly wounded, 26; making a total of casualties* 55.# I regret to state that among the killed were Lieutenant John W. Mason, of Saint Charles County, an officer of Lieutenant-Colonel Hull’s battalion, and Sergt. Maj. W. A. Chappell, of Colonel Mac-JD on aid’s regiment, both of which officers fell while gallantly leading and encouraging their men. Among so many officers and men who are entitled to honorable mention for gallant and distinguished services to make mention of a few appears like discrimination, yet I cannot refrain from mentioning the names of Colonel Green and Lieutenant-Colonel Brace and Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Porter. Both of the latter-named gentlemen were wounded severely in the head by shot from the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel Grimshaw severely sprained his ankle while gallantly rallying his men. Major Milton, of the Callaway Rangers, aided gallantly in the recapture of the hospital. Captain Robinson, of the Callaway infantry, deserves honorable mention for his zeal and cool, deliberate courage. Colonel MacDonald faithfully and in a soldierly manner gallantly repelled several severe assaults from the enemy. Colonel Franklin, of Schuyler County, Captain McCulloch, Captain Davis, Captain Richardson (severely wounded), Captain Grant, and Adjt. William F. Davis, all of Colonel Green’s regiment, are entitled to honorable

mention for their gallantry, zeal, and great endurance. Captain Kneis-ley, who commanded my artillery, won my approbation by his energy, coolness, and courage. The men all behaved admirably. To the officers of my staff I feel under especial obligations for their zeal, intelligence, and courage in carrying my plans and instructions into execution. Lieutenant-Colonels Vowles and Pittman, my aides-de-camp 5 Capts. George A. Turner and C. M. Randolph, my additional aides-de-camp; and Provost Marshal Pindall, who was knocked down by a ball during the heat of the action, were all alike inexhaustible in their energy, courage, and perseverance, while the excellent condition of my wounded fully commends the skill, attention, and industry of Surgeon Bailey and his corps of assistants to my most favorable consideration.

jReport of Lieut. Col. John Scott, Third Iowa Infantry.
Hdqrs. Third Regiment Iowa Volunteers,
Liberty, September 18, 1861.
Sir : In relation to an affair of yesterday which occurred near Blue Mills Landing, about 5 miles from this place, I have the honor to report :
Agreeably to your orders I left Cameron at 3 p. m. of the 15th inst., and through a heavy rain and bad roads made but 7 miles during that afternoon. By a very active march on the 16th I reached Centre-ville, 10 miles north of Liberty, by sunset, where the firing of cannon was distinctly heard in the direction of Platte City, which was surmised to be from Colonel Smith’s Sixteenth Illinois command. Had sent a messenger to Colonel Smith from Haines vdlle, and sent another from Centreville, apprising him of my movements, but got no response. On the 17th, at 2 a. m., started from Centreville for Liberty, and at daylight the advanced guards fell in with the enemy’s pickets, which they drove in and closely followed. At 7 a. m. my command arrived at Liberty, and bivouacked on the hill north of and overlooking the town. I dispatched several scouts to examine the position of the enemy, but could gain no definite information. They had passed through Liberty during the afternoon of the 16th to the number of about 4,000, and taken the road to Blue Mills Landing, and were reported as having four 13 r r—yol hi

pieces of artillery. At 11 o’clock a. m. heard firing in the direction of the landing, which was reported as a conflict between the rebels and forces disputing their passage over the river. At 12 m. moved the command, consisting of 500 of the Third Iowa, a squad of German artillerists, and about 70 Home Guards, in the direction of Blue Mills Landing. On the route learned that a body of our scouts had fallen in with the enemy’s pickets, and lost 4 killed and 1 wounded. Before starting dispatched courier to Colonel Smith to hasten his command. About 2 miles from Liberty the advance guard drove in the enemy’s pickets. Skirmishers closely examined the dense growth through which our route lay, and at 3 p. m. discovered the enemy in force, concealed on both sides of the road, and occupying the dry bed of a slough, his left resting on the river and the right extending beyond our observation. He opened a heavy fire, which drove back our skirmishers, and made simultaneous attacks upon our front and right. These were well sustained, and he retired with loss to his position. In the attack on our front the artillery suffered so severely that the only piece, a brass 6-pounder, was left without sufficient force to man it, and I was only able to have it discharged twice during the action. Some of the gunners abandoned the piece, carrying off the matches and primer, and could not be rallied.
The enemy kept up a heavy fire from his position. Our artillery useless, and many of the officers and men already disabled, it was deemed advisable to fall back, which was done slowly, returning the enemy’s fire, and completely checking pursuit. The 6-pounder was brought off by hand, through the gallantry of Captain Trumbull, Lieutenants Crosley and Knight, and various officers and men of the Third Iowa, after it had been entirely abandoned by the artillerists. The ammunition wagon, becoming fastened between a tree and log at the road-side in such a manner that it could not be released without serious loss, was abandoned.
The engagement lasted one hour, and was sustained by my command with an intrepidity that merits my warmest approbation.
I have to regret the loss of a number of brave officers and men, who fell gallantly fighting at their posts. I refer to the inclosed list of killed and wounded as a part of this report.* The heaviest fire was sustained by Company I, Third Iowa Volunteers, which lost 4 killed and 20 wounded, being ohe-fourth of our total loss.
Major Stone, Captains Warren, Willett, and O’Neill were severely wounded, and also Lieutenants Hobbs, Anderson, Tullis, and Knight. The latter refused to retire from the field after being three times wounded, and remained with his men till the close cf the engagement.
Among the great number who deserve my thanks for their gallantry, I might mention Sergt. James F. Lakin, of Company F, Third Iowa, who bore the colors, and carried them into the thickest of the fight with all the coolness of a veteran.
The loss of the enemy cannot be certainly ascertained, but from accounts deemed reliable is not less than 160, many of whom were killed. His total force was about 4,400.
Your most obedient servant,
JOHN SCOTT,
Lieutenant-Colonel Third Iowa Volunteers.

Lexington, Mo., September 21,1861.
Sir : In pursuance of your orders I left this place on the evening of the 15th instant, and proceeded forthwith to Liberty, Clay County, Missouri, where I met the State Guard, on the march from the northwest— five regiments of infantry, under the command of Colonel Saunders, and one regiment of cavalry, under the command of Colonel Wilfiey, from the fifth district) five regiments of infantry, under command of Col. Jeff. Patton, and one battalion of cavalry, under Colonel Childs, from the fourth district. I delivered your orders to the above commands to hasten to this point (Lexington) with as much dispatch as possible. They marched forthwith, and arrived at the Missouri Eiver about 4 o’clock in the evening, when Colonel Boyd’s artillery and battalion and baggage were crossed over to the south side, where the colonel took his position, Captain Kelly planting his artillery so as to completely command the river. The crossing continued all night without interruption, every officer and man using his best exertions. We received news during the night that the enemy would be in the town of Liberty, about 6 miles distant from Blue Mills Ferry, at an early hour the ensuing morning. We were crossing in three small flats, and much time was necessary to move the large train, of some hundred wagons. Colonel Childs, with his command, had taken post for the night about 2 miles from Liberty, on the road to the ferry. Here he engaged the enemy’s advance or pickets in the morning, killing 4 and wounding 1, with no loss on our side. The enemy fled, and we heard no more of them till 3 or 4 o’clock, when their approach was announced, in targe force, supposed to be about 900 men, with one piece of artillery (a 6-pounder). The men of our command immediately formed, Col. Jeff. Patton leading the advance, to meet the enemy. After proceeding about 3 miles from the river they met the advance guard of the enemy, and the fight commenced. But the Federal troops almost immediately fled, our men pursuing rapidly, shooting them down, until they annihilated the rear of their army, taking one caisson, killing about 60, and wounding, it is said, about 70. The Federal troops attempted two or three times to make a stand, but ran after delivering one fire. Our men followed them like hounds on a wolf chase, strewing the road with the dead and wounded, until they were compelled to give over the chase from exhaustion, the evening being very warm. Colonel Saunders, Colonel Patton, Colonel Childs, Colonel Cundiff, Colonel Wilfiey, Major Gause, Adjutant Shackleford, and all the other officers and men, as far as I know or could learn, behaved gallantly.!

Capt. W. E. Prince,
First Infantry, Commanding Fort Leavenworth:
Sir : The expedition sent out yesterday afternoon, consisting of the cavalry, two mountain howitzers, and two companies of infantry of Fifth Regiment, in all about 600 men, against an encampment of the enemy at Morristown, in Gass County, 5 miles from the border, has this moment returned. They succeeded in routing the enemy, killing 7, capturing their entire camp equipage, tents, wagons, &c., some 100 horses and horse equipments. Our loss is 2 killed, 6 wounded—mere flesh wounds, with the exception of two. One of the killed, however, is Col. H. P. Johnson, who was connected with Colonel Montgomery in the command of the expedition. His loss is deemed by every member of the command as of great importance to the service $ as a dashing cavalry officer he had no superior. He was killed, while leading his command, by the enemy in ambush. Details will be given you in my next. I hope you will communicate his death tenderly to his wife, and say to her that his body will be forwarded to Leavenworth to-morrow morning as soon as the coffin is prepared.*

Sir: For the information of the general commanding the Western Department I have to report that reconnaissances which I have directed for the last two days show the enemy to have abandoned their position near Hunter’s farm. They are now confined in their encampments at Columbus and Belmont. A party of cavalry sent out by my order this morning succeeded in surprising a detachment of about 40 of Jeff. Thompson’s command to-day. I inclose herewith Colonel Oglesby’s report of the result [No. 2].
I have to report the loss of two good soldiers by the culpable conduct of Lieut. J. W. Campion, Twentieth Illinois Volunteers, on yesterday. Colonel Marsh’s report oi the circumstances is inclosed herewith.*
There are two companies of the Seventh Iowa Regiment stationed at Potosi, Mo., which I would respectfully request to be relieved and sent here to join their regiment.
Yesterday a party of cavalry from Columbus came up to the neighborhood of Elliott’s Mills and arrested a farmer there for the crime of loyalty to his country. To-day I directed in retaliation the arrest of two noted secessionists, who were informed that they would be released on the safe return of the Union man sent to Columbus. The party making the arrest went into Blandville and brought from there also a Mr. Blake, who is charged with recruiting a company for the Southern Army. He will be sent to Saint Louis for trial.

You will learn from the prisoners that the position of the enemy is unchanged at Belmont. Jeff. Thompson still has only 2,500, 800 cavalry included. I will give no detailed statement, as you will learn all from the prisoners. We are not threatened by them, but the steamer Jeff. Davis is still below us, waiting to be taken.

Report of Col. R. J. Oglesby) Eighth Illinois Infemtry.
Headquarters, Norfolk, Mo., September 28, 1861.
General : Yesterday I sent down 200 infantry to Colonel Dougherty’s regiment (Captain Challenor), to sustain the cavalry if repulsed. At the Beckwith farm, 5 miles below here, Captain Challenor (Twenty-second Illinois Infantry) met the enemy, stationed to surprise our cavalry by drawing it into an ambuscade. Upon the first fire from Captain Me Adam’s company [Twenty-second Illinois] the whole force fled in confusion. The enemy were about 400, besides a small body of cavalry. They have never been so near us before. It means nothing more than an effort to catch our cavalry companies scouting the country about Hunter’s farm. We were not troubled by the Jeff. Davis last night, although she was in 2 miles of us a part of the time.

Regiment. The force left here at 3.30 o’clock this morning5 arrived at Charleston at 8 o’clock. Colonel Tuttle reports that no enemy has been near Charleston in force. He immediately sent out detachments in every direction to reconnoiter. Learning that about 500 of the enemy’s cavalry would be at Charleston at noon to-day or during the day, he sent forward on the Belmont road a company of-cavalry 5 miles to report their approach. The enemy did not reveal itself. At 5 o’clock p. m. the forces were put in motion, and have returned to this camp to-night. From all the information learned through Colonel Tuttle I am satisfied the enemy have not been at Charleston, and will not move by there. Belmont has been evacuated. My impression is they have fallen back on New Madrid.

Cairo, October 7,1861.
Sir: Information which I am disposed to look upon as reliable has reached me to-day that the Confederates have been re-enforced at Columbus to about 45,000. In addition to this they have a large force collected at Union City, and are being re-enforced every day. They talk boldly of making an attack upon Paducah by the 15th of this month. My own impression, however, is that they are fortifying strongly and preparing to resist a formidable attack, and have but little idea of risking anything upon a forward movement. Jeff. Thompson and Lowe are no doubt occupying positions at Sikeston and Benton. If the cavalry here were fully armed and equipped, they could be easily driven out. There is no use going after them with any other arm. I had a reconnaissance made to-day to within a few miles of Columbus. I inclose herewith Captain Walke’s report of it. I also have at Charleston a force of some 1,200, all armedl No news of an enemy passing there or having passed.

General: Agreeably to your orders of this morning, I proceeded down the river with the U. S. gunboat Tyler and the Lexington, under Commander Stembel, for the purpose of reconnoitering the position of the enemy as far as practicable. When approaching the head of Iron Bluffs we saw the rebel steamer Jeff. Davis, but could not get near enough to be of effective service. Proceeding on till we came in sight of their batteries, about 2 miles above Columbus, we opened on them, and succeeded in drawing the fire of five of their batteries, some of which proved to be mounted with rifled cannon. Four of their shots passed over us, one of them coming within fifty feet of the bow. Not feeling ourselves strong enough to contend with their rifled cannon, we rounded to, and returned to Cairo. When near the foot of Lucas Bend the Lexington and ourselves fired several shell into Camp Belmont, from which they fired several rounds from their batteries; and on our return, just above Norfolk, we brought away two flat-boats, which we deliver subject to your order.

Report of Brig. Gen. Monroe M. Parsons, commanding Sixth Division Missouri State Guard (Confederate).
Headquarters, Camp on Cedar Creek,
October 14,1861.
General : General Harris’ division and my own camped on Smith’s farm, 5 miles from Clintonville, about 12 o’clock on Saturday last. About 3 o’clock in the evening of that day the pickets of General Harris were fired upon by a few jayhawkers in ambush, who killed 1 man and wounded 3 others. The cavalry was immediately sent out in force, and scoured the country for miles around, bringing in 5 prisoners, but we have no positive evidence that they were of the party that fired upon our troops.
On yesterday, about sunset, I received intelligence that another party of jayhawkers, about 20 in number, fired upon 7 of our party, who were over on the Pomme de Terre, about 20 miles distant, foraging for wheat. Two of our men were wounded. The forces that I had at Bitchie’s Mill, about 20 in number, immediately started in pursuit. I also dispatched from this camp 50 men, under Captain McCarey, with instructions to proceed immediately to the mill and occupy it in the absence of the other troops, or, if necessary, move on to their relief. Sufficient time has not yet elapsed for any further report from them.

My commissary is procuring his flour at Bitchie’s Mill, 9 miles distant, and General Harris is obtaining his at Caplinger’s, 5 miles distant, and they are getting on admirably in the preparation of flour. The steam-mill on the Osage, that was occupied by General Harris, had got out of repair, and he was compelled to abandon it without getting from it the quantity of flour that he had expected. I am informed that Caplinger’s Mill will turn him out a fair supply to-day.
We have here an abundance of forage in the vicinity of our camp, and the men and animals are rapidly recruiting. This being the last day allowed us to remain in this camp, I shall to-morrow morning resume the line of march. You will please indicate its direction. I have reliable information from the other side of the Osage, through Major Woods, of Versailles, who arrived in camp last night, that there are no Federals at Warsaw. About 20 are at Cole Camp \ none at War-rensburg or any other point on this side of the Pacific Bailroad line. They appear to be establishing themselves along the railroad line and on the Missouri Biver. Their whole force estimated at about 16,000. Major Woods left Versailles on Wednesday last. From the fact that the enemy are scouring the country in which they are located for transportation, I am satisfied that an overland expedition is intended.

Captain: 1 have to report that on yesterday evening the conductor of the down train reported to me that Potosi was threatened by a rebel force 400 strong. Believing the report reliable, I immediately started three companies of the Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, under Maj. D. H. Gilmer, by railroad, and four companies of the First Indiana Cavalry, under Col. Conrad Baker. To-day at 10 o’clock I received reliable information that Jeff. Thompson, with a force of near 3,000, was 25 miles southeast of Crossville. Thinking the move at Potosi a feint to draw off my main force, I sent expresses to recall Colonel Baker and Major Gilmer, as I have not sufficient force to guard all the approaches to this place. At 4 o’clock to-day I received a note from Major Gilmer, informing me that the rebels had captured Captain Elliott and his guard at Big River Bridge, 6 miles above Mineral Point, and that he would go on to the bridge and wait for re enforcements. Being still assured that the enemy design weakening this point to attack it, I reiterated my order to Colonel Baker and Major Gilmer to return, though I deeply regret the necessity of abandoning the guards at the bridge. Three regiments should be sent immediately, also one light battery and 1,000 musket cartridges.

In the absence of General Fr&nont, I have the honor to report that a force from Pilot Knob, under Colonel Carlin, acting in conjunction with a force from Cape Girardeau, under Col. J. B. Plummer, attacked the enemy yesterday at Fredericktown, about 25 miles from Pilot Knob, completely routing them, killing Lowe, their commander, and capturing four pieces of heavy artillery. The loss of the enemy heavy; ours small. Major Gavitt and Captain Highman, First Indiana Cavalry, were killed in charge on the rebel battery.

Colonel: A dispatch, just received from department headquarters, informs me that Jeff. Thompson, with between two and three thousand men, is at Farmington, Mo., and directs that I send such force as can be spared from Cape Girardeau to cut off his retreat.
I send you, in addition to the force now under your command, one regiment of infantry, one squadron of cavalry, and one section of artillery. With this force and the able-bodied men of two other regiments it will give you a force sufficient to meet Thompson, and leave sufficient force at the Cape.
The expedition should be moved with all dispatch, taking as many days’ rations as you can find transportation for. Should it become necessary, you are authorized to press into the service of the United States such private teams as the good of the service may require.

Colonel : Colonel Buford has just returned from his expedition up the river, and reports that you had been informed that General Hardee was at Greenville, with a force of 5,000 men. Hardee has not been in Greenville for three or four weeks. He has been in Columbus, Ky., until quite lately, and is now with Buckner, General Sherman informs me, threatening Louisville.
I am satffied that you can have no force to contend against but Thompson’s and Lowe’s. I feel but little confidence in your even seeing them, but information just received from Saint Louis reports Thompson as fortifying Fredericktown. You will, therefore, march upon that place, unless you should receive such information on your march as to indicate a different locality for the ubiquitous individual.
It is desirable to drive out all armed bodies now threatening the Iron Mountain Railroad, and destroy them if possible.
Having all confidence in your skill and discretion, I do not want to

Reports of Lieut. E. M. Joel, Twenty-ninth Missouri Infantry, of skirmishes at Fredericktown.
Pilot Knob, October 17,1861.
Prom a conversation I have just had with Major Gavitt, of the Pirst Indiana Cavalry, and who was in command in the engagement this morning, I learn that he made the attack with his cavalry at 4 this morning, and discovering the strength and position of the enemy, fell back until he came on Colonel Alexander, with 600 of the Twenty-first Infantry and one piece of artillery, the enemy following and fighting all the way. He got his gun in position and infantry in ambush. He made part of his command retreat, and the enemy followed into the ambush laid for them. They suffered severely, and fell back with heavy loss. If you will attack them in the rear, and with our force in front, they will be completely at our mercy.

The artillery has not arrived yet. I have had all the carpenters I could find working all night making frames for cars, so that we could bring horses, as we had no stock cars. I expect they will be here about 9 this p. m.
We have learned from prisoners which were taken last evening by some of our troops, who passed themselves for rebels, that it was the intention of the enemy to make an attack this or to morrow morning at four different points. The prisoners also said that they were raising all the men between Pilot Knob and Irondale, and are to make the attack from the north. We have four of them in irons, and one of them is represented as being a captain in the rebel army. Another furnished a guide to our officers to go and burn the bridge. Colonel Carlin had intended to march all the force he could spare against the enemy this morning, but in consequence of the information received he has retained them. Let us have our artillery, and there is no fear but we can hold this place against all the force the enemy has within 30 miles of this point.
We have received information since yesterday that the enemy has been re enforced, and has at Fredericktown about 7,000, and at Centre-

Reports of Gol. J. B. Plummer, Eleventh Missouri Infantry, commanding, of operations October 18-24, with complimentary letter and order from General Grrnt.
Headquarters, Camp Fremont,
Gape Girardeau, Mo., October 26, 1861.
General: Pursuant to your orders of the 16th, I left this post on the 18th instant, with about 1,500 men, and marched upon Fredericktown, via Jackson and Dallas, where I arrived at 12 o’clock on Monday, the 21st instant, finding there Colonel Carlin, with about 3,000 men, who had arrived at 9 o’clock that morning. He gave me a portion of his command, which I united with my own, and immediately started in pursuit of Thompson, who was reported to have evacuated the town the day before and retreated toward Greenville. I found him, however, occupying a position about 1 mile out of town on the Greenville road, which he had held since about 9 o’clock a. m., and immediately attacked him. The battle lasted about two and a half hours, and resulted in the total defeat of Thompson and route of all his forces, consisting of about 3,500 men. Their loss was severe; ours very light. Among their killed was Lowe.
On the following day I pursued Thompson 22 miles towards Greenville, for the purpose of capturing his train; but finding further pursuit useless, and believing Pilot Knob secure, and the object of the expedition accomplished, I returned to this post, where I arrived last evening, having been absent seven and a half days, I brought with me 42 prisoners and one iron 12-pounder field piece, a number of small-arms and horses, taken upon the field. I will forward a detailed report of the battle as soon as reports from colonels of regiments and commanding officers of corps are received.

Twentieth Regiments of Illinois Volunteers, commanded by Colonels Ross and Marsh; the Eleventh Missouri, under the immediate command of Lieutenant-Colonel Panabaker; Lieutenant White’s section of Taylor’s battery, and Captains Stewart and Langen’s companies of cavalry, under the command of the former, with rations for twelve days.
Learning that Thompson and his forces were at Fredericktown instead of Farmington, I took the road from Jackson to Dallas, for the purpose of cutting off their retreat south should they attempt it. From my camp at Dallas on Saturday night I dispatched a messenger, with a communication for the commanding officer at Pilot Knob, requesting his co-operation, which unfortunately fell into the hands of the enemy, and gave them information of my intention to attack them on Monday morning. On my arrival at Fredericktown, at 12 o’clock on Monday, the 21st, I found the town had been occupied since 8 o’clock that morning by Colonel Carlin, with about 3,000 men, from Pilot Knob. The town people stated that Thompson had evacuated the town the evening before, and was en route for Greenville.
Being determined to pursue the enemy, Colonel Carlin consented to re-enforce me with the Twenty-first and Thirty-third Regiments of Illinois Volunteers, commanded by Colonels Alexander and Hovey; six companies of the First Indiana Cavalry, commanded by Colonel Baker, and one section of Major Schofield’s battery, under Lieutenant Hescock. The column thus re enforced was put in motion about 1 o’clock p. m., and had not proceeded over half a mile on the Greenville road, when the enemy was discovered in front of us by Captain Stewart, whose vigilance and untiring energy during the whole march was conspicuous.
Colonel Ross, whose regiment was the leading one of the column, immediately deployed it to the left into a lane, and threw forward two companies as skirmishers to feel the enemy, whose exact position and strength it was difficult to determine. As soon as I arrived at the front I directed Colonel Ross to move forward his regiment into the corn field in support of his skirmishers, and ordered up Lieutenant White’s section of Taylor’s battery, which immediately opened fire, and by its effectiveness soon caused the enemy to respond. Their artillery consisted of four pieces, masked upon the slope of a hill about six hundred yards distant. The principal body of their infantry, under Colonel Lowe, was posted in the corn field to the left of the road. With them the Seventeenth Illinois was soon engaged. The other regiments of the column were deployed to the right and left of the road as they came up. I then ordered forward the Thirty-eighth Illinois from the town, which promptly came upon the field under one of its field officers, leaving there the Eighth Wisconsin, under Colonel Murphy, and one section of Major Schofield’s battery in reserve—a post of honor, though one disagreeable to them, as all were eager to participate in the engagement.
As soon as it was practicable, Major Schofield, of the First Missouri Volunteer Light Artillery, brought upon the field two sections of his battery, under Captain Manter and Lieutenant Hescock, which were placed in position and did efficient service. At my request he then aided me in bringing the regiments on the right of the road into line of battle, and during the remainder of the day he rendered valuable service in directing their movements. In the mean time the enemy were falling back before the steady advance and deadly fire of the Seventeenth and Twentieth Illinois and a portion of the Eleventh Missouri. Their retreat soon became a rout, and they fled in every direction, pursued by our troops.
It was at this time that the enemy’s infantry on our right, where

Thompson commanded in person, being also in retreat, I ordered the Indiana cavalry to charge and pursue them. Thompson, however, had rallied a portion of his troops about half a mile in the rear of his first position, and brought one gun into battery into the road, supported by infantry on either side. The cavalry charged and took the gun, and were exposed at the same time to a deadly fire from the enemy’s infantry, but as the column I had ordered forward to their support did not reach the point in time, the enemy were enabled to carry the piece from the field. It was there that fell two of Indiana’s noblest and bravest sons, Major Gavitt and Captain Highman.
The rout now became general, and the enemy were pursued by our troops for several miles, until the approach of night induced me to recall them to town. Captain Stewart, however, with his squadron of cavalry, followed them until late in the night, and brought in several prisoners.
One field piece was taken by the Seventeenth Illinois, under Colonel Ross, whose gallantry during the action, as well as his promptness at its commencement, are indicative of the true soldier.
•I would remark that Colonel Carlin, though exhausted by a long night’s march, and claiming to rank me, came upon the field during the engagement and reported to me in person for orders, remarking that as I had commenced the battle he would not interfere, and he obeyed my instructions during the remainder of the day.
It is with pleasure that I bear testimony to the good conduct of all the troops under my command and to the promptness with which every order was obeyed. Capt. George P. Edgar, who was my assistant adjutant-general, deserves special notice for the valuable service he rendered throughout the day, as also Captain Taggart, commissary of subsistence, Lieut. L. B. Mitchell, of Campbell’s battery of light artillery, and Lieutenant Henry, of the Eleventh Missouri Volunteers, who acted as my aides.
On the following morning, with the greater portion of the forces, I pursued the enemy for 10 miles on the Greenville road, and sent forward a reconnoitering party of cavalry 12 miles beyond. Finding further pursuit would be useless, and having but four days’ rations for my command, I returned to Fredericktown the next day, and on the morning of the 24th instant commenced my march for this place, where I arrived the following evening.
There were taken upon the field 80 prisoners, of whom 38 were wounded, and left at Fredericktown. Our loss consisted of 6 killed and 60 wounded. The enemy’s force was about 4,000 men, though some of their wounded stated it was 6,000. Their loss was very great. One hundred and fifty-eight of their dead were buried by our troops before my departure from Fredericktown, and many other bodies had been found.
I herewith append the reports of Colonels Ross, Marsh, Hovey, Baker, Lieutenant-Colonel Panabaker, Major Schofield, Captain Stewart, and Lieutenant White, to which I would respectfully refer you for the operations of their respective commands.
Before closing this report I feel it but proper to revert to some events which followed the victory, for the purpose of correcting many misrepresentations in regard to them. I learned from Drs. Gaulding and Lamden, who came into Fredericktown after the battle, with a flag of truce, for the purpose of obtaining the body of Colonel Lowe and burying their dead, that Thompson left the town with his forces the evening previous, and marched about 10 miles towards Greenville, where he left

his train. He then proceeded by another road to the point where he expected to find me encamped, intending to attack me at daylight in the morning, but, finding I had taken a different route, he returned without passing through the town, and assumed the position he occupied at 9 o’clock a. m.
The soldiers, after their return to town, believing the citizens, who nearly all sympathized with the enemy, had co-operated with them in their endeavor to lead us into an ambuscade, became exasperated, and some few acts of violence ensued. Six or seven buildings were burned. I exerted myself, with many of the officers, to put a stop to the incen- ‘ diarism, and finally succeeded. I will not attempt to justify such acts of violence; but if anything could palliate them, it would be the deserted homes and desolate fields of our Union friends which I witnessed upon the march.

Colonel : Your report of the expedition under your command is received. I congratulate you and the officers and soldiers of the expedition upon the result.
But little doubt can be entertained of the success of our arms when not opposed by very superior numbers, and in the action of Frederick-town they have given proof of courage and determination which shows that they would undergo any fatigue or hardship to meet our rebellious brethren, even at great odds. Our loss, small as it is, is to be regretted; but the friends and relatives of those who fell can congratulate themselves, in the midst of their affliction, that they fell in maintaining the cause of constitutional freedom and the integrity of a ilag erected in the first instance at a sacrifice of many of the noblest lives that ever graced a nation.
In conclusion, say to your troops that they have done nobly. It goes to prove that much more may be expected of them when the country and our great cause calls upon them.

Report of Col. L. F. Ross, Seventeenth Illinois Infantry, of engagement at Frederiektown, with complimentary letter from General Grant.
Hdqrs. Seventeenth Begiment Illinois Yols., qjj&amn Fremont, Cape Girardeau, iho., October 28, 1861.
Sir : In obedience to your orders I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations and movements of the Seventeenth Beg-iment Illinois Volunteers during the engagement with the enemy near Frederiektown, Mo., on the 21st instant:
At 1 o’clock p. m. on that day, agreeably to your order, I moved forward from Frederiektown on the road to Greenville with the troops under your command from Cape Girardeau, the Seventeenth Begiment Illinois Volunteers in advance, preceded by two companies of cavalry as an advance guard. On advancing about 1 mile in that direction, Captain Stewart of the cavalry, who was leading the advance guard, halted his command, and informed me that- the enemy was in sight in front, and that he suspected an ambuscade. On advancing to the front, and observing the enemy at three different points, I considered it prudent to prepare for action, and immediately dispatched a messenger to advise you of the appearance of the enemy; filed my regiment into a lane to the left under cover; deployed my two right companies, A and F, as skirmishers, and directed them to advance; ordered my left company (B) forward, to form on the left of A and F, and to advance also as skirmishers.
At this period you appeared on the field, and I informed you of the steps I had taken in the matter, of which you approved. While my skirmishers were advancing under Major Smith, I returned to the main road, to attend to placing the artillery in proper position. Met Lieutenant White advancing with a section of Taylor’s battery; ordered one piece stationed in the road and to open fire with grape shot on what I supposed to be a masked battery directly in our front, and commanding the entire road to the village, but the gunner being of opinion that grape shot would not be effective at that distance, by my direction he loaded with round shot and opened fire. After firing two rounds the enemy responded, the ball passing considerably above us.
Having satisfied myself of the existence of a battery, I returned to' my regiment to form for action. Before we were fairly formed the skirmishers sent forward had met those of the enemy, received their fire, and were returning it promptly with warmth and zeal. I moved rapidly forward to their support. The two right companies of skirmish-

ers, A and F, having met a superior force, were checked in their advance, closed intervals, and formed on the right of the regiment in line of battle. A brisk fire was now opened by my entire command on the forces of Colonel Lowe, who occupied a position directly in front and under cover of a rail fence. The firing was continued with activity on both sides for thirty-five to forty minutes. My left company of skirmishers continued to advance until they turned the right flank of the enemy, commanded by Colonel Lowe.
At this time I received an order for a force to support a battery in my rear. As Company A had suffered more severely than any other from the first fire of the enemy, I ordered it back for that purpose. The enemy now began to retire from their cover, when our fire on them proved most destructive. Leaving Companies D and I as a reserve, I advanced on a double-quick with Companies C, E, F, H, and K, and ^ took position behind the fence which at first covered the enemy. Company K was now ordered forward to the support of Company B on the extreme left. The advance of my skirmishers was rapid, completely turning the right of the enemy’s infantry, driving them from and capturing one of their pieces of artillery.
The flight and jmrsuit now became general and the victory complete. Colonel Lowe, the celebrated leader of the rebel forces, was killed while bravely fighting at the head of his regiment. He fell directly in front of our center, with his pistol firmly clenched in his hand and ready to fire. Seventeen prisoners, including two captains, with a large quantity of arms, were captured.
My force in the engagement was composed of all the able-bodied men of my regiment except Company G, which was, by your order, left at Cape Girardeau, to assist in guarding the place. I had in the engagement, officers, 18 5 non-commissioned officers, 72 5 privates, 336. Aggre-. gate, 426.
While we rejoice over the decisive victory gained over the enemy, I have to mourn the loss of 1 man killed and 27 wounded. I cannot speak too highly in praise of the conduct of both officers and men under my command. All, without exception, so far as I observed, performed their duty promptly and faithfully. The company commanders speak also in high terms of the coolness and courage exhibited by the men during the engagement. Major Smith and Lieutenant Kimball, acting adjutant, were always at their posts, and aided me materially during the contest in moving the troops, conveying orders, and executing commands. l>r. Kellogg, the surgeon of the regiment, was promptly on the field, engaged in the discharge of his duty. By his efficiency and skill he has established for himself the reputation of a first-class sfirgeon.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your* obedient servant,
LEOKABD F. BOSS,
Colonel Seventeenth Regiment Illinois Volunteers.
P. S.—In regard to the destruction of property by the troops at Fred-ericktown the night after the battle, it affords me pleasure to state that no member of my command participated in it.
Bespectfully submitted.

Report of Col C. C. Marsh, Tioentieth Illinois Infantry, of engagement at Fredericktown, ivith complimentary letter from General Grant.
Hdqrs. Twentieth Reo’t Illinois Vols.,
Camp Girardeau, Mo., October 26, 1861.
Sir : In accordance with your request, I have the honor to submit my official report of the action of the 21st instant. On Monday, the 21st instant, the regiment marched 12 miles from camp to Fredericktown, where a halt was ordered. After resting about an hour and a half 1 was ordered with the rest of the brigade to march toward Greenville, and took my place in line in rear.of the Seventeenth Illinois, being third in position, Captain Stewart’s squadron of cavalry leading the march. The march had continued scarcely a mile when the column was halted, and information passed along the line that the enemy were in position directly in front. A moment afterwards Colonel Plummer, #m-manding the brigade, came up, ordered forward Taylor’s section of artillery, and ordered me to take position on the extreme right. While moving to my place the battle was commenced by our battery, which opened on the enemy, and was immediately replied to.
I had but just formed in line of battle when I was ordered to move to the left and support the Seventeenth Illinois and Eleventh Missouri, who were already engaged with the enemy, concealed in a corn field on the left. Assuming tKe position ordered, I ordered the third division of my regiment to act as a reserve, and deploying the remainder as skirmishers, advanced and engaged the enemy. Shortly after I came into action the infantry of Colonel Lowe commenced retreating from the com field and the shelter of the fences, which had concealed them. They thus exposed themselves to a raking fire from my left wing, which was poured in with terrible effect. At this point I sent 4 prisoners and 6 of the enemy’s wounded to the rear. While in line of battle and in deploying as skirmishers we were exposed to the enemy’s batteries, which kept up a constant discharge of grape and round shot, which flew thickly around, but, owing to the poor manner in which they handled their guns, we fortunately escaped uninjured. Two grape shot passed through the colors, as did several rifle balls. Shortly after the retreat of Colonel Lowe the firing ceased from the enemy’s batteries.

and I pushed on as rapidly as possible in pursuit of the forces opposed, who appeared to be retreating en masse, Lieutenant-Colonel Erwin, with the right wing, being on the right side of the Greenville road, and Major Goodwin, with the left wing, on the left side of the same road. My colors were in the center of the road. While moving forward in this manner many of the enemy were killed or wounded as they retreated. Shortly alter passing the place where the enemy’s batteries had been, Colonel Baker, wTith the Indiana cavalry, passed me in pursuit of the retreating forces. I immediately pushed forward to support him. The cavalry had passed me but a few moments when I heard a discharge of artillery and a volley of musketry in front, and almost immediately after Colonel Baker, with a portion of his cavalry, returned, requesting me to hurry forward, and stating that the enemy had planted their batteries in front of him, and that their infantry were behind fences in such a position that he could not charge on them. I at once moved on at a double-quick, passing Colonel Baker’s cavalry, who were drawn up on each side of the road.
At this time Lieutenant-Colonel Erwin discovered from the right a battery a short distance in advance, with the Union flag flying. As he had been concealed from the road for some distance by the timber through which he passed, he supposed them to be some of our own forces who had passed while he was out of sight, and, fearful of injuring friends, withheld his fire. WThile still approaching them they limbered up and moved off at a run. At this point several of the retreating forces were killed and wounded. About this time Colonel Carlin, of the Thirty-eighth Illinois, at the head of not more than two companies, came up the road. I pushed on ahead of him, pursuing the enemy. When about miles from our starting point my left wing emerged .from the timber into an open field. At this instant I discovered, a short distance ahead, a number of cavalry, whom I supposed from their dress to be Union troops. I rode up to a house a short distance in front, and inquiring of a woman who was there, was informed they were Union men. I immediately ordered my left wing, who were firing into them, to cease firing, fearful that they would kill our own forces. On riding up to the spot we ascertained from a wounded man that they were the rear guard of the enemy, and that Jeff. Thompson in person was with them. Pursuing them at a double-quick, I succeeded in getting within long range of them at a turn of the road, and fired, killing one. At this time I was about 3^ miles from our original position, and received an order to halt and return to Eredericktown, which I did. During the engagement and pursuit my command behaved with coolness, and my orders were obeyed with a* readiness truly commendable, taking into consideration the fact that it was the first time they were ever under fire.
When all do well the mention of individual names is unnecessary. My field and staff were in their proper positions, and afforded me efficient aid in the discharge of my duties. Rev. Charles Button, chaplain of my regiment, was on the field, and was untiring in his efforts to aid the wounded and dying.
I am happy to report only 3 wounded and none killed, which, considering the long time we were under fire, is truly remarkable.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel : I am instructed by General Grant, commanding, to extend to you and your command a cordial welcome* on your return from the field of battle and of victory. The reports that have reached him from Fredericktown have filled him with the highest admiration of the valor and patriotism displayed by you and your command in that engagement. Amid the gloom that filled the country on the announcement of the reverses of our arms a.t Leesburg, Fredericktown arose and threw athwart the clouds its bow of promise. It was your privilege to be among the foremost of that gallant band who raised our drooping banner and emblazoned it with victory. The importance of that success cannot be measured by any ordinary standard. It gave new life to tens of thousands of our discouraged soldiers. It crushed out the rebellion in Southeast Missouri; it sustained the prestige of victory to our flag, and not the least of your generals congratulations is that you have brought back your entire command.

Report of Lieut. Col. W. E. Pandbaker, Eleventh Missouri Infantry, of engagement at Fredericktown.
Hdqrs. Eleventh Missouri Volunteers;
Camp Girardeau, Mo., October 26,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on taking up our line of march for Fredericktown, on the morning of the 21st of October instant, five companies of my command, consisting of Company A, Lieutenant O’Donnell; Company C, Captain Warner; Company D, Captain Hen-dee ; Company F, Captain Singleton, and Company K, Captain Stewart, marched immediately in the rear of the Seventeenth Illinois and in front of the baggage train; and four companies, consisting of Company B, Captain Weber; Company G, Lieutenant Carter; Company H, Captain Dollahan, and Company I, Acting Lieutenant Hummel, were detached as a guard to the train. About 10 o’clock a. in. I was ordered to detach a company as a guard to the center of the train, and Company D, Captain Hendee, was detached for that purpose. My command was marching in this order when the enemy was discovered. In obedience to orders I immediately formed the four companies that were in advance of the train in line of battle on the right of the Seventeenth Illinois and to the left of the battery commanded by Lieutenant White, and advanced on line with the Seventeenth until the enemy were driven from their position and completely routed, when I received an order to support Lieutenant White’s battery on my right, which I did, and advanced with it to the extreme front and remained with it until the end of the engagement. The four companies guarding the train, under command of Captain Weber, were ordered forward, and joined by Captain Hendee, to support the battery during our advance on the left, and after the retreat of the enemy on our left Captain Weber was ordered and took position in line on the right of the Thirty-third Illinois, and

advanced under fire of the enemy’s guns until the left wing of the enemy’s line was driven from the field and the rout of the enemy was complete. The four companies in my immediate command occupied a position directly in front of the rebel leader Lowe’s command and of the enemy’s heaviest artillery, and, although exposed to the hottest fire of the enemy, the officers and men fought like veterans, displaying a coolness and bravery worthy of the cause for which they were fighting.
The number of my command, rank and file, was 460, of which only 1 man was killed and 3 wounded.
Respectfully submitted.

Report of Capt. W. Stewart, Illinois Cavalry, of engagement at Freder-
icktown.
Fredericktown, Mo., October 22, 1861.
Dear Sir : In compliance with your order of this date, I have the honor to report as follows:
My command consists of my first company of cavalry and Captain Langen’s company, called the u Benton Cavalry.” My company consists of 2 commissioned officers and 40 privates; Captain Langen’s consists of 2 commissioned officers and 45 privates. Aggregate, 89. By your order 1 took the advance at 10 o’clock a. m. on the Greenville road. At a half mile distance I discovered men on the hill in advance of us, and suspected from appearances that a masked cannon was placed to command our approach. Thereupon ordered the cavalry to flank the right behind the crest of the hill, and proceeded myself with Sergeant Good-sell to reconnoiter and ascertain the position of the enemy’s guns, and upon a near approach ascertained that Colonel Lowe, of the enemy, had posted his regiment in and near a corn field on our left, also a body of cavalry on their (the enemy’s) left, which was duly reported to you. Thereon you ordered my command a half mile to our right, to prevent the enemy from flanking us. This position'we held until we were ordered to pursue the retreating enemy, which was executed at a rapid rate, 12 miles, until dark, without coming in sight of the enemy, except three prisoners whom we took. We found dead bodies, arms, saddles, and clothing on the road as far as we pursued them, the enemy apparently being in confusion. A cannon shot was fired through our ranks, but no one was killed. Captain Langen lost one man by an accidental shot.
All of which is most respectfully submitted.

Reports of Col. William P. Ourlin, Thirty-eighth Illinois Infantry.
Fredericktown, Mo., October 21,1861.
I have the honor to report that the force under my command, in conjunction with Colonel Plummer’s command, gained a brilliant victory over the rebel force at this place to-day. The battle raged three hours. The Twenty-first Illinois Volunteers, the Thirty-third [Illinois] Volunteers, the Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, and Major Schofield’s artillery and First Indiana Cavalry displayed great valor, and their respective commanders, Colonel Alexander, Colonel Hovey, Major Gilmer, and Major Schofield, and Colonel Baker deserve great credit for their coolness and zeal in urging on their men. During the engagement not a single retreat occurred among our troops. They constantly moved onward, driving the enemy before them for 4 miles. A charge of the First Indiana Cavalry on a battery was led by Col. Conrad Baker and was a very brilliant affair, but disastrous, as they were fired upon by a very large force in ambush, resulting in the death of Major Gavitt and Captain Highman and 5 men. This battery was driven back and the infantry support routed by the three companies of the Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, under my immediate command. The enemy suffered severely in the affair. As the battle was brought on by Colonel Plummer, and had progressed for some time before I was informed of it (being sick in bed), I deemed it but just to conform to his plan and co-operate with him, w hich I did to the best of my ability. For the plan of the battle and disposition of the forces you are referred to his report.* The conduct of all the troops was admirable, but I wish to refer especially to Acting Adjt. Gen. A. L. Bailhache, my aides, Lieutenants Hoelcke and Willett, engineers, and Lieut. J. Forth, First Indiana Cavalry, all of whom were indefatigable in their efforts to bring up the troops and carry my orders. Major Schofield and his artillery acted with the same gallantry that distinguished them at Springfield.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,.

Fredericktown, Mo., October 22, 1861.
Captain: I beg leave to submit the following remarks supplementary to my report upon the engagement yesterday:
The embarrassing relations existing between Colonel Plummer and myself respecting the command induced me to confine my report to the operations of my own troops from Pilot Knob, leaving Colonel Plummer to do justice to his troops. Being senior by commission to Colonel Plummer, I claimed the command, but Colonel Ross, Seventeenth Illinois Volunteers, senior to both, had decided to claim command if Colonel Plummer had been superseded by me. To avoid the vast injury to our cause resulting from such a dispute, it was arranged between Colonel Plummer and myself that one of us should hold this place, with a force sufficient to protect the wounded and to keep communication with Pilot Knob, as well as a support for the main force if it had to fall back. In deference to the greater experience of Colonel Plummer I chose to remain here, and detached from my command the Twenty-first and Thirty-third Illinois Volunteers, five companies First Indiana Cavalry, and Schofield’s artillery, to accompany him injmrsuit of the rebels. My own regiment, three companies of cavalry, and two 24-pounder howitzers constitute the force at this place.
In a note to you on the 21st I informed you that the enemy had left for Greenville, but a few hours afterwards the cannonading on the Greenville road notified me that they had moved to a new position, where they were met by Colonel Plummer’s advance guard, which had just taken up its march in pursuit of the enemy. The battle was entirely unexpected by Colonel Plummer as well as myself.
Verv respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. P. CARLIN,
Colonel Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers.
Capt. C. McKeever,

Captain : I have the honor to report my return to this place with the last of my force from Fredericktown, ^excepting Captain Hawkins’ cavalry company, which I left there to procure transportation for a few sick men and to bring them in. In my last report I informed you that I had detached the Twenty-first and Thirty-third Illinois Volunteers, the First Indiana Cavalry, and Schofield’s artillery, to accompany Colonel Plummer in pursuit of Thompson. After one day’s march the colonel decided to discontinue the pursuit, and returned on the 23d to Fredericktown. On the 24th I sent the same force above mentioned into this place, remaining at Fredericktown with my regiment, two companies of cavalry, and two 24-pounder howitzers, all of which I brought in to-day with the exception mentioned.
The prisoners not wounded were delivered to Colonel Plummer, who took them to Cape Girardeau to work on the fortifications. The wnunded prisoners I left at Fredericktown in the hands of competent physicians, and well provided for generally. They are under oath to deliver themselves to me on recovery. There are 34 sick and wounded prisoners, and near 40 with Colonel Plummer. During the 22d, 23d, and 24th we were burying the dead and bringing in the wounded of the enemy. The longer we remained the nearer we could approach to accurate estimate

of their loss, and I find that it was much greater than we at first supposed. It may be safely stated at 300. Many are believed still to be in the woods.
In this connection I deem it proper to report that I ordered the destruction of two lead furnaces near Fredericktofan, which had been supplying the rebels with lead, and which, from all I could learn, had long since refused to ship it to the Mississippi.
I have no reliable information of Thompson’s whereabouts since his arrival at Greenville. His forces were thoroughly demoralized, but he will probably be able to collect the majority of them. Two regiments of Arkansas cavalry had joined him, one of which was actually within 12 miles of this place on the day of battle. The prisoners informed me that it was his intention to attack this place, and I have no doubt that the attack would have taken place ere this if we had not marched on him first.
The defeat of the rebels has had a marked effect on the resident population, making Union men, by profession at least, of all of them.

W. P. CARLIN,

Captain C. McKeever,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.
Headquarters,
Pilot Knob, Mo., December 15, 1861. Sir : I feel compelled to make the following statement supplementary to my report in regard to the battle of Fredericktown, Mo., October 21, 1861, to correct certain inaccuracies contained in the reports of Col. J. B. Plummer and officers of his command :
On the 20th of October, having ascertained the precise location of Thompson’s camps and guns, I marched for Fredericktown with the Eighth Wisconsin Volunteers, the Twenty-first Illinois, parts of the Thirty-third and Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, 350 of the First Indiana Cavalry, Captain Hawkins’ company of Missouri Cavalry, Captain Manter’s battery of Missouri Light Artillery, and two 24-pounder howitzers, under Lieut. C. W. Purcell. Total, 3,000 men. It was my intention to surprise and attack the enemy at daylight. His camp ex: tended from the bridge over St. Francis River, on the'Pilot Knob road, for three fourths of a mile to the center of the town, where his guns were all posted on the four main streets leading from the court-house-north, south, east, and west. At a ford a quarter of a mile below the bridge I would have crossed half my force to proceed near the town tc

## p. 219 (#233) ############################################

﻿C?AP. X.]	IRONTON AND FREDERICKTOWN, MO.	219
cut off retreat southward and to attack the camps on the south side, while I, with the other half, would have crossed the bridge, attacked the enemy on the flank, and marched up the road to the town. When it is remembered that Colonel Plummer, with 1,500 men, arrived at Fred-ericktown between 9 and 10 o’clock of the 20thfrom the southeast, and that a retreat northward was impossible, it is evident that Thompson’s whole army would have been captured if my plan had not been thwarted. Marching all night, excepting such halts as were necessary to prevent a too early arrival at Fredericktown, I arrived at the usual picket stations of the enemy, but found them deserted. I proceeded on cautiously to the bridge, but- still saw no enemy. 1 entered the town, and to my great surprise and annoyance I found that at 2 o’clock on the 20th the enemy had marched farther south on the Greenville road. This sudden move, which seemed to make my expedition fruitless, was caused by the unfortunate circumstance reported by Colonel Plummer, viz, he had sent a dispatch for me directly through the enemy’s camp, which gave them information of our movement, and of course deranged all my plans. Having arranged for a surprise, I took only two days’ rations in haversacks and five ambulance wagons, and was not prepared for pursuit, having my provision train laden, but ordered not to start till further orders.
The above statement explains why Thompson’s army was not captured. Colonel Plummer having provisions in abundance, I gave him a portion of my command to take in pursuit, intending to wait for my supply train before starting myself. About three-fourths of a mile south of the town, as stated by Colonel Plummer, his advance guard discovered the enemy, and he brought on the action, and I sent orders to all the troops by his staff officers, both my command and his, but he sent no message to me, though he knew I was his senior as a volunteer colonel, even if his rank had any effect, having been appointed by General Fremont.
Hearing the cannonading, I immediately gave orders to all the troops in town to march to the battle-field, except the Eighth Wisconsin and two 24-x30under howitzers, which were to remain to hold the town and as a reserve, and then proceeded as rapidly as possible to the point where the battle was progressing. Finding that Colonel Plummer had sent orders to all the troops, that he seemed determined not to respect my rights but to hold command, and caring more for success to our cause than for the honors of command, I withdrew to my own regiment, having first placed that on the left to guard against a flank movement of the enemy. After the enemy had given way on the left I marched with my regiment on his trail till I reached the main road, which I crossed into the field on the right, when we found the enemy had made a stand with his artillery, supported by infantry. He soon fled on south, followed by my regiment as well as nearly all our forces, who had then crowded into the road. It was here, about 3 miles from the town, where our pursuit ceased, and where Col. C. C. Marsh, of the Twentieth Illinois, very irrelevantly and untruly says, u Colonel Carlin, Thirty-eighth Illinois Volunteers, came up with not more than two companies of his regiment.” Hot only my regiment, but the Thirty-third Illinois and First Indiana Cavalry, were as tnear me as the crowded state of the road would permit. On my return from the pursuit I met Colonel Plummer and staff going south. Considering the great forbearance I had shown towards him, I was prepared to receive a positive order from him, which, however, he did give, to wit: to go with my regiment to the right on an old road for a mile or more, to see if the

enemy had left that locality. Taking the order as a suggestion I acted on it, though I suspected at the time the coloneFs object was more to see if I would submit to his* command than for purposes of utility. But I was determined not to have a public quarrel before our troops. This is the only foundation in truth for Colonel Plummer’s statement that I obeyed his orders that day.
After the fight was over I informed Colonel Plummer that there must be no further misunderstanding about our rank. He then candidly admitted that I ranked him, but that it was arranged between Colonel Boss, Seventeenth Illinois Volunteers, and himself, that if I assumed command over him (Plummer), Boss would take command over me— Boss’ commission as colonel being older than mine. By the unceasing importunities ofCapt. George P. Edgar, acting assistant adjutant-general to Colonel Plummer, some of the colonels under my command were induced to report to him the operations of their Regiments, and he even had the effrontery to demand a report from me. The reports of these colonels were all reluctantly given, and some of them not till I had consented to its being done.
Having never been on the battle-field before that day, I was strongly disposed to favor all Colonel Plummer’s pretensions, as he was an older soldier than myself, and had fought with credit on former occasions. But as he has not manifested that sense of justice and delicacy towards me and my command that was demanded by truth, I have felt compelled to make this report, which I desire to be filed in the War Department with Colonel Plummer’s.
On the 22d, being exhausted and sick, I again gave Colonel Plummer a large portion of my command, with which to pursue the defeated army of Thompson, expecting that he would go at least as far as Greenville, 40 miles, where the scattered bands of Thompson’s army would concentrate. I had arranged with Colonel Plummer to supply him from Pilot Knob with all the necessary provisions. He returned to Frederiektown on the 23d, having gone 10 miles in pursuit of Thompson. He wished to turn over his surplus supplies to me, but not needing them, I declined to receive them. If the pursuit had continued to Greenville, half or more of Thompson’s command would have been cut off, as they were scattered in every direction, and five days elapsed before they had all joined at Greenville. This report is intended to show, first, why I did not, and why Colonel Plummer did, write an official report as commander of all the United States troops at Freder-icktown; second, why Thompson’s whole army was not captured by my force, aided perhaps by Colonel Plummer; and, third, why our victory was so barren of results; and, fourth, to correct several misstatements, injurious to myself, contained in the official reports of Colonel Plummer, Col. C. C. Marsh, and some anonymous publications by officers of Colonel Plummer’s command, and apparently sanctioned by him.

Report of Col. C. F. Roney, Thirty-third Illinois Infantry, of engagement
at Frederichtown.
The entire regiment, consisting of eight companies present when the action began, participated. They were first stationed as a reserve in the grove to the right (westward) of the conflict, and after 10 minutes the regiment was ordered to flank the enemy’s left. Moved henceforth on the double-quick. Coming near the troops actually engaged, the regiment was separated into its wings by order of Colonel Hovey. The second, under Major Eoe, following the first, under the colonel, at a distance of 100 yards en echelon, passed rapidly up to the enemy’s left by front and occasional flank movements until Company A was near enough to engage the enemy. The company was then detached as skirmishers, by order of Colonel Carlin, of the Illinois Thirty-eighth. Came within range, but Colonel Carlin, mistaking. the enemy for Federal troops, restrained the fire. Company C was also detached for the same purpose, but the rapid retreat of the enemy prevented their getting within reach of our muskets. The whole regiment had arrived in good order near the point when the pursuit ended, when the rout was perfect as to end all prospects. Aggregate number of men engaged, 507missing, none.

Report of Col. Conrad Balter, First Indiana Cavalry, of engagement at
Frederielctown.
Fredericktown, October 22, 1861.
Dear Sir: In the action of yesterday my regiment, consisting of parts of eight companies, was stationed behind the hill, to the right of our artillery, until the order to charge was given. Your order was that four companies of my command should pursue and charge the enemy, then supposed to be in full retreat. Major Gavitt requested me to allow him to execute the order, to which I assented, and told him to select the four companies himself wherewith to execute it. He selected the companies of Captain Tlighman, Captain Walker, Captain Pace (commanded by Lieutenant Mellon), and Captain Browe, and formed them in the order here stated, the company of Captain Highman being in advance. After the four companies had moved forward, with Major Gavitt at their head, I determined to accompany them myself, and reached the head of the column just as the charge was about to be made. The enemy were in ambush in the woods on the left-hand side of the road down which the column was moving, and also behind a fence at the turn of the road, and nearly in front of the head of the column, and opened a cross-fire upon the companies in advance. This fire checked to some extent the companies of Captain Highman and Captain Walker, and I immediately went back to bring up a portion of the infantry belonging to Colonel Plummer’s command, and at the same time Major Wood and Captain Walker reformed the column, witlf Captain Walker’s company in front,

﻿222	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X
and continued the charge in the most gallant style until they passed the gun which the enemy had planted in the road near the foot of the hill. The cross-fire to which these four companies were subjected resulted in the death of Major Gavitt and Captain Highman and 2 privates, one belonging to Captain Walker’s and the other to Captain Highman’s company, and in wounding 28 others.
After I had brought forward the infantry before alluded to, my command moved forward in pursuit of the enemy without overtaking him,
• until the order was received requiring them to return. The officers and men of my command received the fire of the enemy with a degree of coolness and courage that won the admiration of all who witnessed it, and their conduct on the field proved their ability and willingness to render good service to the cause in which we are engaged. The death of Major Gavitt and Captain Highman cannot be too deeply regretted, but it is consoling to know that they fell in the front of the battle, gallantly defending the flag of their country. The four companies engaged in the charge consisted of not more than 168 non-commissioned officers and privates, and the whole of my command present on the field did not exceed 360.

Report o f Mai. J. M. Schofield, First Missouri Light Artillery, of engage-merit at Fredericktown.
Saint Louis, Mo., October 26, 1861.
Sir: 1 have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the force under my command during the engagement between the United States troops under command of Colonel Plummer and the rebel forces commanded by Thompson and Lowe near Fredericktown, Mo., on the 21st instant:
Our artillery force consisted of four 6-pounder guns, under Captain Manter, of the First Missouri Regiment, two 6-pounder guns under Lieutenant White, of the Chicago Artillery, and two 24-pounder howitzers in charge of Lieutenant Purcell, of the Missouri Volunteers. The latter were left in position with a regiment of infantry to defend the town.
Lieutenant White’s section and a section of Captain Manter’s battery, under Lieutenant Hescock, assisted by Lieutenant Mitchell, being in advance, were brought into battery as soon as the enemy was discovered, and opened the engagement. They were immediately responded to by the enemy’s artillery, which, however, was so poorly served as to do but very trifling damage.
The other section of Captain Manter’s battery, under his immediate charge, assisted by Lieutenant Schofield, being in the town when the engagement commenced, was quickly brought forward aod established upon the right.
The fire of our artillery was very spirited and effective; so much so, that by the time the main column of infantry had been brought forward and deployed it was evident that the way was fully prepared for a gen-

## p. 223 (#237) ############################################

﻿Jhap. X.J	IRONTON AND FREDERICKTOWN, MO.	223
eral attack. This was immediately made, and the enemy’s position carried almost without resistance. With this the fire of the artillery ceased, and it was not found necessary to use it again during the day.
The officers and men of Captain Manter’s battery deserve great credit for the energy and efficiency displayed in organizing a battery from entirely new materials, making the difficult march from Saint Louis to Fredericktown, and fighting a successful battle, all in the space of four days.
Lieutenant White, of the Chicago Artillery, deserves special mention for his efficient service.
Sergeant Donaldson, of the First Missouri Artillery, who acted as my aide during the day, behaved with gallantry and rendered me much assistance.
I have the satisfaction of reporting no loss in killed or wounded in my command.
Soon after the engagement commenced the colonel commanding informed me of his determination to form line of battle in the fields on the right and left of the road and charge upon the enemy’s position, and requested me to assist him by conducting the operations of the right wing. For this purpose he placed at my disposal six companies of his own regiment (the remaining four being left as support to the artillery) and Colonel Hovey’s Thirty-third Illinois, while a squadron of cavalry was properly disposed to protect our right flank. The enemy being destitute of canister and not formidable in bayonets, the battalions were deployed, and, preceded by a line of skirmishers, moved forward in perfect order, and drove the affrighted enemy from his position without even firing a shot.
The enemy made two attempts to rally in favorable positions, and . exchanged a few shots with our skirmishers, but upon the approach of our line broke and fled. He made a stand with his artillery about 1,000 yards in rear of his first position, and gave us a few solid shot without damage, retreating before it was possible for us to reach him.
The retreat now became a perfect rout. 1 sent a small battalion to occupy a strong position upon our right flank, and the remainder of the infantry pressed forward in pursuit of the flying enemy, and continued the pursuit till recalled by order of the colonel commanding.
I cannot speak in too high terms of the efficiency of the troops whose movements I had the honor to direct.

I sent a portion of the Second Begiment Hragoons around to make the attack upon a stone redoubt which the enemy had built on the north side of the bridge, and a portion of the Third Begiment advanced upon the railroad from

the south. Just after daybreak the Second charged upon the redoubt and carried it by storm. The Third dashed gallantly over the bridge, and in 10 minutes after the first gun was fired the enemy surrendered at discretion. I lost 2 men killed and several wounded. We killed a number of the enemy and took 45 prisoners, captured 06 muskets, and a quantity of overcoats, &c.
I had the property carried over the bridge, and then completely burned it down. It was a large three-span bridge, and cannot be rebuilt in months. The property was taken to the Blackwell Station, and while distributing it among the men, and in the midst of the confusion, we were attacked by a company of the enemy, and then occurred one of those bushwhacking fights which proved the mettle of my men. Scarcely any of the officers were about, and but few of the men, and I ordered them to “go in on their own hook,” and each man dashed at them. In 10 minutes we had them in full flight. In this last affair we had 4 men killed and several more wounded, but we killed another lot of the enemy and took 10 prisoners. Not having any means to transport or secure the prisoners, I swore them to refrain from fighting the Missourians or our allies until regularly exchanged. We got all the officers.
This last fight having deranged my plans for intercepting a train of cars and using the engine as a catapult on Ironton, and as the enemy were fleeing both north and south, I have brought my men back into the hills to rest their horses, and strike another blow in a different direction to-morrow. I have them terribly frightened, and if your forces were in striking distance, we could take Ironton in an hour. If my plans do not miscarry, I will take it with my own forces this week. The Mississippians with me acted splendidly, and my Indians with great propriety.

Frederichtown, Mo., October 18, 1861—4 a. m. Dear Sir : I reached this place yesterday at 10 a. m., with my horsemen, just in time to find about 1,200 of the enemy marching upon my infantry. My men were prepared to fight, and each party was deployed in less than 1,000 yards of each other, with a little river between. My 15 R R—VOL III

horsemen came with me at full gallop, yelling like Indians. My infantry received us with three cheers, and, as we thundered over the bridge with 500 horses, it had the effect of a Chinese fight, and the enemy retired at a double-quick. My horses were entirely too much worn-out to take advantage of their retreat, but we nevertheless followed them for several miles. Just before my arrival one of my infantry pickets of 30 men laid in ambush until the enemy approached so close that in a single volley, in which but 27 guns were fired, we killed 5, severely wounded 8, and slightly wounded many more, and then fell back, without losing a man. Our surgeons, Poplin and Gaulding, went over, tendered their services, and were kindly received by the commander.
1 will remain here until the enemy discovers my weakness. I have been sadly disappointed in recruiting my army, as there are no arms in the country, and the people will not go without they know when and where they are to receive them. I found, however, that the hearts of the people were all right, and, from New Madrid to Big Biver Bridge, we have been welcomed in the most flattering and encouraging manner.
Had I with me a few Confederate regiments I could take Ironton by Sunday, and capture 12,000,000 rations and an immense quantity of forage, which is being collected for winter quarters. My rapid and unexpected movements have fully convinced them that my force is very large, and I have also exercised my talents upon them with fictitious orders and reports, but I do not feel safe enough to undertake to ship the lead from the mines near here. The reports that come in to-day will influence the citizens, as well as myself, and I may have a week to spare here, in which case I will have a quantity of lead moved south of here, and then I can move it away at my leisure.
If you can spare me one of your brigades I cau fall back to the swamps, and, by immediately advancing again with its support-', we can take Ironton without any question. My men are perfectly familiar with all the roads through the country, and if my horses are recruited I can easily finish the railroad.
Preparations are being made to winter 10,000 men at Ironton, 10,000 at Springfield, with a large force at Saint Louis. If this is broken up, Southern Missouri will be comparatively free.

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Sir : I am still here, but will probably start away to-day. We have intercepted a courier from Colonel Plummer, TJ. S. Army, to the commanding officer at Ironton, saying that he is marching with considerable force to intercept my retreat (I understand 3,000 men). They were to have encamped at Dallas last night, and say they will encamp within 10 miles of us to-night. I have sent out vigilant pickets to scour the country, and, if the report be true, I will shape my course accordingly. You will please make some inquiries into the matter, and, if they follow me into Wayne County, you will please send out a few regiments into Stoddard County, ready to relieve us or strike at Cape Girardeau. Fremont is too far from railroad and rivers to return to the support, and a little energy will now secure the Mississippi above Cairo, which is as important as Paducah. I have 16,000 pounds of lead secured. I

have recruited some few hundred, but not as many as 1 expected, although I hear of many more coming. I will not wait longer for them. Yours, most respectfully,

Camp at Carter’s, Mo., October £2,1861—8.30 a. m.
Dear Sir : Having learned on Sunday that the enemy was advancing from the east and west on my position at Fredericktown for the purpose of cutting oif my retreat, I fell back southward 12 miles, and leaving my train in a condition to move, I marched back at 1 a. m. Monday, for the purpose of occupying the town with my troops alone, and fighting either party that made its appearance first. The enemy had heard of my marching the evening before, and, by a forced march, occupied the town before I reached it. I could not possibly learn their number, and wasted the whole morning in endeavoring to find out their number and position by spies, but could not succeed. At 12 o’clock I placed my men in position, and then drove in their pickets. They came, and in more than double qur numbers, and deployed immediately in our front, and opened with their rifled cannon. We returned their fire with one 12-pounder and on e of our sixes. This we kept up for thirty minutes, when their line, having advanced within musket range of Lowe’s regiment (which I had placed in ambush, a considerable distance from our main line), a galling fire was opened upon it, which was only returned when Lowe’s men could get dead aim. The object for which Lowe was placed having been accomplished, he should have fallen back $ but, with unparalleled courage, he remained until he was shot through the head and immediately killed, when his men fell , back behind my main line. About this time their rifled cannon had found the range of my guns and the main line, and their percussion shells were bursting in quick succession among us. One of them knocked off the two drivers of the limber of the 12-pounder, and the horses ran entirely away, leaving the gun without ammunition or power of motion. It being a double-trailed gun, and all the others being stock-trailed, it was impossible to remove it, and therefore I left it on the field.
Too much praise cannot be awarded to Lieut. Sam. Harris, who served this gun, with but one assistant (the other having gone in pursuit of the limber) until the ammunition in the trail-chest was exhausted. About this time one of the shells, just passing the top of the hill, behind which the Second Eegiment was lying down, struck Captain Flourney in the left breast, and, exploding, instantly killed him and Captain Neveille, who was leaning on his shoulder. Captain Flourney was transferred to my command from the Bluff City Grays, of Memphis, and was a gallant young gentleman. Captain Neveille was from Stoddard County, Missouri.
Finding now that the enemy were being re-enforced with a regiment of cavalry from Iron Mountain, I ordered a retreat by the right wing, placing each battalion in ambush, to check a pursuit by their cavalry. I had scarcely placed Brown’s battalion when a charge was made by their cavalry past the fence behind which they lay. When at twenty yards a fire was poured into them, which emptied nearly every saddle. A running fight was continued for nearly 6 miles, my men keeping perfect

order, except my dragoons, who were completely stampeded several times. . I continued my retreat to this place, which is 26 miles from Fredericktown. I will leave here at 12 o’clock to go to Greenville, and then shape my course by the circumstances which arise.
Major Shall has been hovering on the south' side of Ironton, with 250 dragoons and 100 Missourians, to assist me, but to-day I have received a dispatch from him that his duty impels him to return to Pitman’s Ferry, to prepare to defend that post, which will be 50 miles in my rear, if I can maintain myself at Greenville. I hope you will send a few regiments over into Stoddard County, to encourage the people, as they may be discouraged by my defeat. I will give you a detailed report of the whole expedition as soon as I reach a permanent camp.*

Sir: I have just been informed that the enemy in strength, say 5,000 men, are in 20 miles of me, with the intention of following me to Pitman’s Ferry. I will start immediately, and go to Bloomfield, as 1 mentioned in my letter of yesterday, and if the forces I have asked are sent me, I think I can prevent their return to Ironton.
Activity will now accomplish much, and I hope to have your assistance. I will send you information constantly, and if the enemy return, you shall know it. They will try, I expect, to take Bloomfield, and I wish your troops there to disappoint them.

Sir: I reached here an hour ago, having left my command at Saint Francisville. From what I can hear to-day the enemy have not followed up their intentions of pursuing us, and have returned to the line from Cape Girardeau to Ironton. I have a splendid position for defense or unexpected sortie, and by Monday I hope to begin another march after them if my horses are enough rested. My deserters have mostly come in, and I have more men, and in better spirits, now than ever beforef although I did not get as many as I expected in the upper counties, on account of the scarcity of guns. The troops stationed at Pitman’s Ferry have not acted with the gallantry they should have. My adjutant will make a detailed statement as soon as possible. Let me know by courier if any re-enforcements have been sent me, so that I may make my arrangements accordingly.

Col. D. F. Shall, C. S. A.,
Commanding Arkansas Volunteers, Bailees, Mo.:
Dear Colonel: Unfortunately I was not credibly informed of your position until a few hours ago. I am sorry that more men are not up with you, so that the men will not have to be held still so long. You had better assume some defensible position, and only make such demonstration as will amuse and attract the attention of the enemy and prevent his learning of the marches of the infantry and artillery until we are prepared to strike. Communicate with General McBride on the west, and when we all get at equal distances from Ironton, we will march simultaneously. Our support is near at hand, and. I hope we will be ready to strike by to-morrow night or Monday. The report that Price has whipped Fremont is currently believed, but needs confirmation. If it is a fact, Southern Missouri is free. Nothing prevented me from whipping the 1,200 troops sent out here on Thursday but the fatigue of my horses, which had just returned from a 200-mile trip. And, although the men were very anxious, and the infantry were quite fretted at my making them stand still, yet I* felt compelled to do so, as the other troops on the west and south were not in position. I am here with my whole force, except those left at Bloomfield and New Madrid, to garrison those posts, and I am having lead hauled away. We must keep in constant communication and act as circumstances may dictate. The enemy are reported to have about 15,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. We must whip all that come 10 miles out, but it will not do.to approach nearer until the definite time.

I am anxious that they shall still follow me, as every man brought into this part of the State is that much nearer the Confederate Army, and away from the pursuit of General Price. You will please move your men out to meet us, and picket all the roads well to-night, as my men will then sleep some, knowing that you are on the watch, and to-morrow we will be fresh and ready for duty.

There are none of the enemy south of the line from Ironton to Cape Girardeau that we can hear of, but I will go up and hunt them to-morrow.

back from an overwhelming force, that was afraid to follow us). They attempted to advance, but we ambushed them at every thicket and corn field, and have killed three of their men to every man I lost. I have all the roads for 10 miles north of here thoroughly picketed, and if a few hundred of your dragoons were thrown forward, you would be better posted. My men are in fine spirits. Except the loss of Colonel Lowe and of my 12-pounder, I have been a gainer in everything by the fight.

Report of J. R. Purvis, Assistant Adjutant-General (Confederate), of operations October 12-28.
Hdqrs. First Military District, Mo. S. GL,
Camp Allen, lio., October 28, 1861.
Sir : I am instructed by the general commanding this brigade to forward you a detailed account of our movements subsequent to the 12th instant, when we broke camp at Spring Hill, Stoddard County:
On the above date, about 10 a. m., the general, accompanied by 500 mounted riflemen, started in a direct course towards the Iron Mountain Eailroad, designing to strike it about 40 miles south of Saint Louis, at Big Biver Bridge. In the absence of the general, Colonel Aden Lowe, of the Third Regiment Infantry, commanded the remaining forces, which consisted mostly of infantry. He was ordered to make his line of march on a direct route from Spring Hill to Fredericktown, moving only short distances each day, so as to keep the men in good condition, either for a fight or a hasty move, and to halt at that place and await ^further orders ; when he arrived there to use every exertion to collect all the lead possible, and make preparations for its instant shipment. I might state here that we procured 18,000 pounds, and have it safe 10 miles south of New Madrid. In the mean while the general, with the cavalry, pushed ahead at a rapid rate, arriving at the bridge about daylight on the 15th, succeeding in surprising, and, after a short struggle, capturing 58 of the enemy, belonging to the so-called Normal Regiment of Illinois, including 1 captain (Elliott) and 3 lieutenants, who had scarce time enough to run into a low stone fort, which they had established, when our men, at a full run, broke in upon them, with the before-detailed results. We here had 2 killed and 2 wounded, and the enemy lost 4 dead and 7 wounded. The bridge was at once fired, and was soon a complete wreck. Our men at once went to work collecting all the stores of the enemy, preparing them for transportation.
About this time a new foe appeared on the field. Some 80 men from one of the posts above, having heard the firing, came in double haste to the succor of their comrades, and caught our forces in a somewhat scattered condition. For a time the battle was evenly waged, but our men soon collected together and pushed home on them, when they fled in confusion. We here had 3 killed and 6 wounded, and killed 6 of the enemy and wounded quite a number.
We captured, among other things, 50 muskets, 15 overcoats, and a number of blankets. The prisoners were all liberated on taking the

oath not to serve during the war, unless exchanged. The captured guns belonged to the Fremont purchase of Belgian guns, and are much prized by the men, who used them in the battle of the 21st. During the march of the infantry towards Fredericktown, our scouts brought in 2 Federal soldiers, which they had captured some 5 miles beyond that place, and reported a large party out trying to intercept them. We reached the town on the 17th, and quietly went into camp, to await the return of the general.
Early on the morning of the 18th the camp was startled by a quick succession of musket-shots beyond the Saint Francis Bridge, which crosses a river of the same name, a quarter of a mile beyond the town. We soon discovered that it proceeded from our pickets, who had been driven in by a very large force of cavalry. The enemy sustained a severe loss, as the picket, which was under command of Captain Holmes, consisting of 30 men, gave them a volley at the short distance of 60 yards.
The captain of our little band, as they came out at a dashing gallop, walked deliberately into the middle of the road, and, taking careful aim at a leading officer, shot him through the body. They lost 3 killed and some 15 wounded, while the picket got safely to camp.
The enemy maneuvered about all the morning, seeking to find out our numbers, but refraining from attacking us. As the general had been advised that the enemy was at hand, and as he was expected to arrive at any moment, the .colonel commanding did not deem it advisable to assume the offensive, but to await his coming. About 1 o’clock the general rode into camp. At the sight of him, the whole brigade, though ordered not to cheer, broke out in one long-continued shout, which, astonishing to say, so appalled the enemy, that they at once commenced a hasty retreat, and, from all reports we can gather from those residing on the road, they used the greatest diligence in moving their wagons, and seemed to be in considerable confusion. We made hot pursuit, but failed to come up with them, and, after following them several miles, the whole command again returned to camp.
The balance of the day and all the following we were left in quiet; but on the morning of the 20th our pickets arrested a man, whom they ^ discovered, just as the day was breaking, endeavoring to avoid them. When he found he would be caught, he threw away a package, which, on inspection, was found to be a communication from Colonel Plummer, of Cape Girardeau, to the commandant at Ironton, stating that he was approaching our camp with 3,000 men, and asked co-operation. Being thus warned in time, we made all the necessary arrangements to receive the enemy. The safety of the baggage first engaged the general’s attention, for, having once secured that, he could fight or not, at his pleasure. It was soon on its way to Greenville, in Wayne County, the whole brigade accompanying it, but was halted 10 miles south of the town, and here preparations were made to return with all our fighting force to give battle to the enemy, be their numbers what they might. After a rest of a few hours we started, at 4 o’clock in the morning of the 21st, with but 1,200 men, all told, with the expectation of giving fight to three times our numbers, but which we found, shortly before the battle opened, to have been increased to 7,000, and which were further reenforced during the battle to 10,000.
We arrived at about 11 a. m. within half a mile of the town, and were immediately placed in position. Lowe’s Third Regiment, with Jennings’ and Rapley’s battalions, were posted on the right of the Greenville road, some 300 yards in advance of the Second and Fourth Regiments, which were in position on the left of the same. One 12-pounder, commanded

by Lieutenant Harris, was placed on a prolongation of the line of the regiments on the left, on the right of the road, 300 yards in the rear of Lowe’s position. The three 0-pounders were placed on or closely adjacent to the road. After driving in their pickets with some skirmishers detached for that purpose, at about 2 o’clock they advanced in force, and showed on the brow of the hill, which hid the town from our view. Soon their cannon were placed in position, and sent shot and shell in large quantities among us. Our 12 and little 6s replied merrily, and at once quite a stampede took place among their cavalry, which had showed incautiously in masses over the hill-top. Our 12-pounder, by its well-directed discharges of grape, prevented their cavalry from charging down the road through our center, which they evidently intended to do, as they several times formed in heavy masses on the road. During the while their infantry advanced down the hill, through the corn field immediately in front of Lowe’s command, which layT concealed behind the fence that inclosed it. The advance guard of the enemy, consisting of one company, halted within 60 yards of the fence, when, after particularly cautioning his men to shoot low and take deliberate aim, the word fire was given by the colonel, when at least 70 of the enemy bit the dust. But a moment elapsed before three full regiments were advanced within shooting distance of our little band of heroes (only about 300 men in all), and kept up an incessant volley of musketry three-quarters of an hour upon them, our menno t yielding one inch; the enemy several times giving ground for an instant, but at once returning to their work. They twice gave back. On the authority of Colonel Waugh, the enemy were twice driven back; first one regiment came down the field and sent an advance of one company ahead, which was nearly annihilated; the balance of the regiment advanced, but gave back in confusion, and fled to the farther side of the field. Soon two regiments were seen.marching down the field, but soon met the same fate as the first, and only when three regimental flags were seen in the field could they hold their place against our little regiment of 300 fighting men. At first they overshot us (caused as much by the nature of the ground as by defective aim), the enemy being on the descending side of the hill and our men at the foot of the same; besides, Lowe’s entire command were either on their knees or lying down," frequently loading while stretched out on their backs, but only because so ordered to do. Our men assert that the enemy frequently discharged their pieces at a ready, but fired three times to our once. They soon took better aim, and their fire became more destructive; but as the breeze wafted the smoke away at once, and our men continued to take deliberate aim, which their officers kept continually reminding them of, we killed ten to one. About this time the chivalric Lowe was shot through the head and fell quietly to the ground without giving a sign. Though many of the men by this time were out of ammunition, they showed no signs of giving ground, and only when Lieutenant-Colonel Hedgpeth gave the order to fall back under cover of the woods (some 300 yards in the rear, where the 12-pounder was in position) did they move from where they were placed. The principal loss was sustained while crossing the open space—in all, 16 killed. These men, with but few exceptions, rallied immediately in the rear of our lines, and in a short time afterwards were again fully under command. In the mean time shot, shell, and bullets were rained upon the 12-pounder so fast, that the limber was broken and the horses so repeatedly wounded that they could not be held to their places, but ran away with both it and the caisson. Besides, every one about the gun was wounded but Lieutenant Harris

and his sergeant. The latter, a moment afterwards, was killed while mounting his horse. Harris, all alone, fired his gun twice, showering grape among the close ranks of the eUemy while advancing upon him. At last his ammunition gave out, and as he stood all alone, resting against a tree, he received orders that if he could not bring off his gun, to leave it. At this moment Brown’s battalion, which had been placed in the rear of the artillery, came at a run to cover the retreat of Lowe’s command. They attempted to take it off* by hand, and actually dragged it up the hill a considerable distance, but were forced to leave it to the tender mercies of the enemy, as they were ordered to take ground to the rear and place themselves in ambush, wMle Farmer’s Second and Waugh’s Fourth were ordered to cover the retreat, which was at this time commenced in good order. Their cavalry only once attempted to charge (while our sixes were in full retreat), but paid so severely for their temerity, that they were not heard from again, for Brown’s battalion, with one volley, mowed them down as with a scythe; and here fell their major (Gavitt), 1 captain, 4 lieutenants, and about 30 rank and file. A private in Brown’s battalion (Prophet by name) leaped the fence into the road and captured the major’s sword, but only after he had thrown a number of dead men off his body, the bullets raining around him all the while. The enemy at this time had outflanked us on the left, our cavalry having retired too soon. But, as they did not apx>ear in great numbers, and our men kept such excellent order and looked so formidable, though they opened upon us, their fire was desultory and quite ineffective. Our men, moving quietly but quickly, not returning the fire of the enemy, were soon out of danger. The enemy is said to have followed us about 10 miles, to where our trains had been left, but which, when we commenced retreating, had been ordered to move on, and were far on the way to Greenville when our little band of heroes passed through in excellent order, and quite satisfied with themselves and the day’s proceedings.
Drs. Gaulding and Lamden, who had been left with our killed and wounded, are just in, and report that the enemy acknowledge to having 8,000 infantry and 2 regiments of cavalry—all infantry commands being more than full. They also had 9 guns, and the whole force under the command of Colonel Boss. Major Schofield had the guns under his immediate care.
We lost 3 men (dead), which were brought to camp. The balance— 17 killed, 27 wounded, and 15 unhurt—all fell into the enemy’s hands. The enemy acknowledge 400 killed and wounded, and were greatly exasperated at the day’s results. They believe we had 4,000 men, no doubt judging by the disposition of our forces, which embraced as large an area as a force of that number would occupy.
Our doctors were very roughly handled by the enemy, losing all their money and both their horses. Hr. Gaulding at one time was arrested as a spy, and remained in confinement several hours. This was, however, after Colonel Boss had left and Colonel Carlin was in command. Eight houses were sacked and burned, with all their contents.
Without further occurrences worth relating, we arrived at this camp on the 27th, and shall remain here a few days to recruit.

Report of Maj. D. F. Shall, (7. S. Army, of co-operation with Thompson's
forces, October 19-23.
Headquarters Camp Hardee,
Pitman's Ferry, October 23, 1861.
General : On the evening of the 18th instant received a dispatch from General M. Jeff. Thompson, inviting us to participate in the taking ot Ironton, stating that he would burn Big River Bridge, and soon afterwards be ready to attack the Knob. We responded. On the morning of the 19th started with 230 mounted men of the First Regiment (including 40 men of Casey’s company) for Bailey’s, the place indicated by the general; here expected to find troops to act with, or a messenger from him, but neither were there. On the morning of the 20th camped within 8 miles of Ironton, sending forward scouts to within 4 miles of that place; here remained, expecting to hear from General Thompson; did not do so. At 11 o’clock that night started back (just as we started received a vague dispatch); reached the Stoney battery; camped for the night; next day, 21st, camped 6 miles south of Patterson, on the road to Doniphan, and to-day reachfed] this i>ost about 4 o’clock p. m. While near Ironton learned from a reliable gentleman living within 4 miles of that place that it had been re-enforced with artillery, cavalry, and infantry, and that the force then there was at least 7,000 strong. This is reliable.
Soon after arriving in camp here, about five hours ago, a Missourian came in from Greenville, with news to the effect that Thompson had been defeated a mile south of Frederiektown by a force from Cape Girardeau and Saint Genevieve, and that with the remnant of his command was retreating towards this place. Thompson’s force, from what I learned before the fight from a man of his at Bailey’s, was 700 mounted men and 1,000 infantry. This defeat exposes the post here and at Pocahontas to imminent danger, and to be prepared to face it I am making every exertion my poor abilities are capable of. I have made a call upon the people of the State generally, the governor, and some individuals of prominence. Hope to be able to hold our position at Pocahontas, to which point will fall back immediately. Captain Bridewell having taken all the teams and himself off in violation of orders, leaves me crippled in the way of transportation. Can you not and will you not help us %
In haste, your obedient servant,

Before leaving Pit man’s Ferry, I gave orders to have all the stores of every description removed to Pocahontas, which is in steamboat communication, usually about twice a week, with Jacksonport and Memphis. It is 110 miles from Trenton to Pocahontas. I feel no apprehension that the force I left there will be attacked, or, if attacked, that it will not be able to make a successful resistance. This force consisted of 7 companies cavalry of Borland’s regiment and 4 companies infantry of Me-

I also authorized a battalion of infantry, under Desha [ f] (5 companies), to be mustered into service, which I presume has been done, as Colonel D. informed me they were ready. It is proper to add that I ordered the company under Captain Roberts to join me here, but it has not done so, nor do I know that it has left Pocahontas. I would recommend that all the ammunition, except a limited supply for the troops immediately on duty there, should be shipped from Pocahontas to Memphis. Respectfully,

Dear General: Tours, dated at 7 p. m. of the 16th instant, is at hand. In reply, I am happy to say to you that we are all here, safe and sound. We arrived here about 1p.m. yesterday. I sent out scouts towards fronton, and they captured two carbineers. Shortly after the arrival here of our advance guard a party of thirty-five cavalry made their appearance at the Little Saint Francis Bridge, upon the Ironton road, but ran away without harm. They have been seen near here twice since. All is still so far ; did not appear to know who we are, or anything of our coming, until to-day. We hope to see you soon.

Report of Col. John B. Wyman, Thirteenth Illinois Infantry.
Headquarters Camp McClurg,
Linn Creek, Mon October 15, 1861.
General : I have the honor to report to you that immediately upon the departure of my messenger to you yesterday morning 1 put my command on the march at 7 o’clock in the following order: Major Bowen, commanding battalion attached to the Thirteenth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, in advance, with his own transportation, then the Thirteenth Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Gorgas commanding, immediately followed by its own transportation and that of the commissary department, the rear being brought up by Maj. C. Wright, commanding Fremont Battalion. After seeing the entire column in motion, X started for the head of it, and had proceeded about 6 miles to the point where the road turns off from the route to Lebanon for this point, and had reached the right of the Thirteenth Regiment, when I was informed that Major Bowen had discovered a party of rebels—70 in number— and had gone in pursuit of them towards Lebanon, feeling confident of his ability to cope with them successfully. I turned the column towards this point, and had proceeded about 2 miles when a rapid volley of musketry fell upon my ear. I immediately, turning towards the left of my command, ordered the train corraled at once, and at the same time met a courier from Major Bowen, informing me that u he had engaged the enemy, and that they were from 800 to 1,000 strong,* that he had been obliged to fall back,” and asked for re-enforcements. This same message had also been sent to Major Wright, who, with his usual promptness, took two of his companies, himself taking the advance. At the same moment I sent an order to Lieutenant-Colonel Gorgas to send to the support of the cavalry the five left companies of the Thirteenth Regiment, reserving the other five- companies, under Major Partridge, as a reserve and guard for the train. The order was promptly delivered to Colonel Gorgas, and as promptly executed. The line of march was at once taken up, headed by Lieutenant-Colonel Gorgas himself; then Company K, Captain Blanchard; Company I, Capt. Samuel Wadsworth; Company H, Captain Gardner; Company G, Captain Cole, and Company F, Captain Dutton, all at double-quick; and to show you the

rapidity of their movements, I beg to assure you that they made a march of nearly 5 miles in forty-five minutes. After issuing this order I immediately started for the scene of action.
In the mean time Major Wright had formed a junction with Major Bowen, and had made their arrangements for another attack, for particulars of which I beg to refer to their respective reports. Approving of them, I relieved Major Wright of the center command, and ordered him to join the line of flankers thrown out by him, and myself made a forward movement from the center—with one company of cavalry, supported by the five companies of infantry—of about 1 £ miles. The enemy by this time becoming satisfied they could not cope with us (or for some other reason known only to themselves), commenced a rapid retreat, so fast, indeed, that it was impossible even for the Thirteenth to keep up with them. I therefore ordered a halt of the infantry, and ordered the cavalry forward, with orders to drive them as far as possible, and reach camp (at the point 2 miles on the Linn Creek road) at or before sunset. They did so, and drove them nearly 12 miles toward Lebanon.
For the list of killed, wounded, and prisoners I beg to refer you to the reports of the different officers in command. I also take occasion to say that proper and respectable arrangements were made for the burial of their (the enemy’s) dead, which they had left upon the field to be devoured by swine, beasts of prey, or the vulture.
I reached camp on the return with the infantry at 4 p. m., and the entire command were all, with one exception, safety in at 6 p. m. Total enemy killed, 39$ wounded, 29$ prisoners, 51$ horses captured, 18$ guns captured or destroyed, 93; with only a loss on our side of 1 man killed and 2 horses wounded. Among the prisoners are 1 colonel (Summers), 1 lieutenant (Laughlin), 6 non-commissioned officers, and 43 privates.
Trusting that this little diversion from my line of march to join you as ordered will meet your approbation, I have the honor to subscribe myself,

General: At 7 o’clock a. m. my command struck tents at Camp Conant, on Tavern Creek, and formed into column in rear of train. I immediately passed along the line, and requested the officers to keep the men well closed up and allow none to leave their places, but keep everything ready for service at a moment’s notice. The reports from my scouts during the night induced me to believe the enemy might attack us during the day. I also went forward and suggested to the quartermaster of the Thirteenth Regiment that the train be well closed and kept so, after which nothing of importance occurred until I arrived

at Justice Bemington’s, where I learned that Second Lieut. Henry Laughlin, of rebel Johnson’s command, had come home, and lived about 1 mile north of said Bemington’s, and had a lot of McClurg’s goods in the house. I at once detached Captain Crockett, with his company, to take the lieutenant and search the place. He had not been gone five minutes before I saw a courier coming from the front. I at once called Captain Crockett back. The courier arrived with a message from Major Bowen, stating that he had been attacked and needed assistance. I at once ordered Captains Montgomery and Switz-ler forward at full speed to the relief of Major Bowen ; ordered the train corraled, and Captain Crockett, with his company, to guard it until relieved by infantry, and then dispatched a courier to your honor for a guard for the train and support for cavalry, after which I went forward to the scene of action. I found Major Bowen some 2 miles forward and half mile south of Mr. Lewis’, on the Lebanon road. I immediately had a conference with Major Bowen, and we mutually agreed as to the disposition of our forces and plan of attack. The rebels at that time occupied a high ridge immediately in our front, and half mile south of us. The presumption was that we could not expect relief from the infantry in time to secure the rebels, and an immediate attack was resolved upon. The disposition was as follows: Captain Montgomery’s company was already on the right, and I ordered Captain Switzler to join him, flank the enemy, and engage him at any hazard. Major Bowen, with two companies of his command, went to the left. I took charge of one company of Major Bowen’s (at his request) and took position in the center, or as you found us on your arrival. I observed at that time that the enemy was moving to the right. I ordered Captain Crockett forward to support them, knowing they outnumbered us greatly. I then went to the right myself, found that Captains Switzler and Montgomery had formed a junction and succeeded in flanking the enemy, and held him at bay. The enemy, commanded by Captains Sorrel, Wright, Thurman, Bell, Fair, and Hawthorne, drew up in line of battle, and gave evident signs of making a bitter stand. My two companies immediately got into line, and were ordered to receive their fire, return it steadily, and then charge with sabers, and never allow them to reload their pieces, all of which order was carried out to .the very letter, with a coolness and determination that evinced true bravery in both officers and men, and struck terror along the whole rebel lines. He could not stand such a charge, so prompt, so uniform, so determined, and the result was a general rout, and in a short time a running fight for 1J miles, with the following result (as near as we could ascertain without occupying too much time to hunt through the bushes): Bebels killed, 27 5 mortally wounded, 4; severely, 5; slightly, 3; prisoners, 36; horses, 2; guns, 81—most were old shotguns and rifles, and were doubled around black-jacks on the field. Officers and men all agree that many more were killed and wounded, but we did not hunt them up. Our loss was 1 killed and 2 horses slightly wounded. I cannot call your especial attention to any one or number of officers or men in those two brave companies; they are, each one of them, as true as steel, and in this charge, with six to one against them, they exhibited a coolness and bravery that those of more experience might proudly imitate. Yet I feel that I would do my own feelings injustice not to speak of the tenacity with which Captain Switzler adhered to the order of charge, and the promptness and energy of Captain Montgomery in carrying it out. I cannot omit naming Lieutenants Montgomery, Paynter, and Stockstill; not a nerve quivered in those brave

men; nothing left undone that coolness and energy could do in carrying out orders, encouraging the men, and dealing death to the rebels. One incident I must be permitted to mention. Lieutenant Montgomery, after exhausting his revolver, and doubling up his saber in a hand-to-hand fight so that it was useless, not satisfied with the half-dozen he had disposed of, charged on yet another, and with one blow of his fist made him bite the dust. Such fighting is worthy of imitation.

General : I respectfully submit the following report of the engagement that took place yesterday, the 13th:
My battalion was ordered to advance at 7 o’clock a. m., and after advancing some 3 miles our skirmishers rallied and reported a large body of the enemy in our front. I immediately ordered Company B to the right of the main road, Company C to the left, and Company A to advance. After advancing about a mile 40 of the enemy were discovered in full retreat. We followed them 3 miles, when they rallied and formed a line of battle. After receiving their fire we charged on them; thereupon they retreated in great confusion. After pursuing them half a mile we discovered they numbered 600 strong, and were endeavoring to surround the party under my command, which numbered 40 men. I immediately ordered my men to fall back. I was shortly re-enforced by Companies B and C. The enemy, having confidence in their superior numbers, endeavored to surround my command by advancing first on the left. I immediately changed my position to the left and opened

fire on the enemy. After firing two volleys they retreated and took a position on a hill, which, being covered with trees, concealed the movements of the enemy. At this time Major Wright made his appearance on the field, and with his command filed to the right of the hill, on which the enemy were in position. 1 with my command advanced on the front and left, when we discovered a small body of the enemy in retreat. Company A, being in advance, fired upon them, and they broke into confusion, and the whole force retreated towards Lebanon, and we pursued them some 8 or 10 miles. The loss of the enemy was 12 killed, 17 wounded, and 8 prisoners. Among them^was William W. Summers, called colonel.

How well he executed my orders I leave you to judge by inclosing a copy of his own graphic account of the affair. In closing this report I beg to say that I am much embarrassed with the prisoners I have now in keeping (88), all or nearly all of whom are guilty of high treason, and unless I soon receive orders from you I shall send them to Rolla with sufficient escort, with orders to Colonel Dodge to put them at work upon the fortifications there or send them to Saint Louis.

Report of May. Clark Wright, Fremont Battalion (Missouri) Cavalry.
Headquarters Fremont Battalion,
Camp MeClurg, October 15,1861.
General : At 7 o’clock of the morning of the 14th my command left Camp Gorgas in advance of the column in the following order: A detachment of 30 men, well mounted, from Company A, 500 yards on the extreme right; 5 mounted sentinels at the respective distances of 100 yards each, reaching back to the head of the column; 20 scouts each on the right and left flanks, to march in line with head of column, with instructions to allow no one to pass forward or ahead of the column. Thus we moved forward, feeling our way, without any incident worthy of note until 11.30 o’clock a. m. On our arrival at Alexander Berry’s, 5 miles southeast of this place, I there learned that there was no doubt but Linn Creek was occupied with rebel forces, and rumor said 200, who had arrived the day before. I at once resolved to strike them with all the available force I had, leaving out the skirmishers and sufficient force to cover the front of the Thirteenth Illinois Regiment, out then in my immediate rear. I immediately sent forward two scouts in citizens’ dress to go into the town, take observation, and report to me 1 mile out before I arrived. Then called out Company D (Captain Crockett), myself taking the right, and ordered a descent upon the town in double-quick. Arriving at the point to meet the scouts, I called a halt. Their not returning led me to suppose they were detained. I soon learned, however, from a lady just from town, that there was a company of secesh rebels, commanded by the notorious Bill Roberts, then in town; also, that the notorious sheriff (Mr. Cummings) was at home. I at once made the preliminaries, and ordered a double-quick march, with instructions to arrest the whole camp and all the men in town. We arrived at 1 o’clock, and at once surrounded the whole thing, and demanded an unconditional surrender. The notorious captain and a few of his followers, as well as his wife, broke from some of the buildings, fired on my troops, and attempted to escape. I promptly ordered them fired on, which was promptly executed. Some fifty random shots were fired, but owing to the fences, buildings, and other means of cover none were killed, and but one slightly wounded on the rebel side. None killed or wounded of my troops. The scene was a wild one. The activity of the cavalry in guarding the avenues of the place, arresting the citizens, and the rebels running to and fro; the screams of secesh wives, daughters, and children; the firing from both sides echoing back from the bluffs on either side, made the whole thing look somewhat frantic. However, at the end of thirty minutes we had the town restored to its usual quiet, and the secesh under guard. Every member of Company D behaved well* Captain Crockett and Lieutenant Kirby executed every order with promptness and bravery. The men, without exception, acquitted themselves to my entire satisfaction.
The result of our descent was as follows: Prisoners, 37; horses, 5 mules, 2; guns, 26; holster-pistols, 2; 1 keg powder; J bushel of bullets, as well as the peaceable possession of the town.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Report of Lieut. S. P. Tufts, First Illinois Cavalry.
Camp Lyon, Bird’s Point, Mo., October 15,1861.
Sir : Pursuant to orders, I proceeded, with 26 men of my company (Captain Coleman’s Centralia Cavalry), on a scout out upon the Rushes Ridge road, taking a direction towards the Beckwith farm. When about 9 miles out, and about 2 o’clock p. m., met a body of armed mounted rebels, about 100 strong, supposed to be Mississippi or Tennessee Mounted Rides, armed with breech-loading rifles and revolvers. My advance guard, after giving the usual signal (the enemy continuing to advance), discharged fheir carbines and fell back upon the column. We were moving down the road through a clearing, the enemy being in the timber. I immediately ordered the advance, and advanced into the open timber, taking a position within 180 yards of where the enemy were forming, and engaged the enemy, who were partly concealed by dense underbrush and heavy timber. The enemy poured a rapid fire upon our ranks, and made every exertion to outflank us. We maintained our position until we were nearly surrounded and our ammunition almost* exhausted. We then retired, the enemy following close upon our rear, and engaged my rear guard for about 1J miles, when the enemy retreated. We brought our wounded men and horses off of the field, with the exception of Corporal H. H. Fletcher, his horse, equipments, and arms. Corporal Fletcher was shot in the temple, some distance in advance of our line, and supposed to be instantly killed. He was afterwards discovered still living by Dr. Baker, residing in the vicinity, and by him removed to liis residence. Private Louis Krenyhoff received a flesh wound in the arm, the ball passing across the chest and lodging inside the shirt. Several others received slight scratches from shattered balls. The horses of Privates J. Copeland, S. T. Maxy, W. Hutter, and E. T. Amadan were mortally wounded and left on the road. Seven other horses were wounded more or less seriously. The enemy on their retreat stripped Corporal Fletcher of his arms and spurs. Two others lost their carbines. The loss of the enemy, as near as could be ascertained, was from 6 to 10 men either killed or seriously wounded, including the officer in command. Of their horses one was left dead upon the field and others taken off evidently wounded. My men deserve great praise for the coolness, bravery, and implicit obedience to my commands exhibited throughout the engagement, several of whom stood firmly, receiving the tire of the enemy, with but one shot held in reserve, and awaiting my orders. They retired in as good order as circumstances would permit, the rear guard contesting their ground nobly.

farm, while your wagons were being loaded with hay at that place, I proceeded, by permission of Lieutenant-Colonel Grayson, who was in command of the expedition, on a scout towards Norfolk, for the purpose of learning whether the enemy had again occupied that place. I had with me Lieutenant Lobdell, of my company, and 34 men. I went up the river within 3 miles of Norfolk without seeing any recent signs of the enemy’s presence. I then took a road leading from the river to Rushes Ridge, and thence to Bird’s Point. About one-half mile from the river I discovered abundant signs that the enemy’s cavalry were in the habit of frequenting the road to that point. After proceeding about 1 mile farther my advance guard discovered them approaching, when they fired and fell back on the company, which I had formed in single rank to receive the enemy, who came forward at a full run, evidently expecting a general stampede on our part. Upon seeing my line they halted under cover of the woods and at the distance of 150 to 200 yards from me, when I ordered a fire, which they immediately returned. The firing was very spirited on both sides for about ten minutes. I fired an average of about ten rounds to the man with the Maynard rifles, and they fired about an equal number. None of our men were killed and only 1 wounded—Henry H. Smith, who had his right arm broken after having fired several shots. I had one horse killed on the ground, two others mortally wounded, and several slightly wounded. The enemy numbered, I think, not less than 50; and from the coolness which they displayed, their arms, and uniform, I think must have been United States dragoons. They left one man—a noncommissioned officer—on the ground, shot through the head, whose arms I brought off with me. They were plainly seen during the fight to send off several who were badly wounded, and, as I learned from a citizen who lived on the road near the scene of action, many were bleeding profusely as they passed him, some being supported on their horses. They also took from him his horse, to replace one which had been killed. I did not pursue them, fearing, with my small force, to be drawn into an ambuscade.
The non-commissioned officers and soldiers of my company displayed the greatest bravery, many of them being without cover during the fight, some dismounting in the thickest of it in order to fire with better aim.
When all behaved so well it would be invidious to mention any by name; but I would mention particularly Lieutenant Lobdell, who was continually exposed, and displayed great coolness, having his horse wounded. Mr. Watson, of the Watson Battery, who accompanied me, and Dr. Ross, of Bolivar County, Mississippi, who has been attached to my company since its formation, doing duty always as a soldier, without pay, and at his own expense, both behaved with the greatest bravery, firing shot for shot with the enemy.
I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Report of Maj. Clark Wright, Fremont Battalion of Missouri Cavalry.
Headquarters Camp McOlukg [Mo.],
October 17, 1861.
General: At 4.30 o’clock p. m. one of my men came into camp and reported one corn team and two of my men captured by secesh, himself escaping to bring in the news only by his superior strength. I immediately ordered Lieutenant Kirby, with 15 men, to follow the rebels, and engage them at all hazards, and if possible retake our men. I also detailed Captain Crockett with 15 others to flank them on the right, and if possible cut off their retreat, and engage them until I could come up with the reserve. I asked Major Bowen for one company to form a reserve, which request the major granted, and responded so promptly at the head of the reserve, I hastly set out for the field. On my arrival there I found that Lieutenant Kirby had overtaken and engaged 45 rebels, dispersing them in all directions, releasing our team and men who were prisoners, and driving the enemy 5 miles from the point of attack, killing 5 rebels (found), wounded 1 severely (captain), and many others escaped, bleeding; capturing 1 horse, 2 saddles, and 10 guns. Our loss none [killed] ; wounded, 1 slightly.
The whole party under Lieutenant Kirby acted promptly and bravely. As evidence of their promptness, only seven minutes elapsed from the receipt of the news by the courier until the lieutenant with 15 men and orders were filing around the point of bluff to charge the enemy. I desire to call your especial attention to Lieutenant Kirby, who at all times is prompt, energetic, and brave, and ever at his post. I append a list of killed, so far as they are known to me:
John W. Candy, from Buffalo, Dallas County, belongs to Jones’ command; First Lieut. Fountain Maysfield, Dallas County; Carmelite Preacher Murline, Dallas County; 3 others unknown. Severely wounded, George Miller, Dallas County, school commissioner.

We left Jefferson City on the 5th instant, and after a severe march reached Georgetown, our men in good condition, on the afternoon of the 8th. Our horses be-

ingall unshod^ and consequently unfit for travel, we procured a few shoes and a quantity of old iron, called for blacksmiths from our ranks, took possession of two unoccupied blacksmiths’ shops, and in five days shod our horses and mules, 232 in number.
Our scanty supply of ammunition having been destroyed by the rain, and having two small bullet-molds in our possession, we procured lead and powder, and turning a carpenter’s shop into a manufactory, made 3,000 cartridges for our revolving rifles.
On the loth instant Colonel Hovey, commanding at Georgetown, received a dispatch from Lexington, stating that a valuable baggage train had left the vicinity of Lexington destined for Price’s rebel army; also a private dispatch from Colonel White, stating that if he and his fellow-prisoners were not relieved within twenty-four hours they would be assassinated by the rebel marauders infesting Lexington. As Colonel Hovey’s command was under marching orders, and therefore could not go to their relief, my command volunteered for the service, and Colonel Eads, of Georgetown, tendered me 70 men from his regiment. Accompanied by Colonel Eads, I started at 9 p. m. on the 15th instant, my whole force being 220 strong. By a severe forced march of nearly 60 miles we reached Lexington early the following morning, drove in the rebel pickets without loss, and took possession of the town. We made from 60 to 70 prisoners, 60 stand of arms, 25 horses, 2 steam ferry-boats, a quantity of flour and provisions, a large rebel flag, and other articles of less value. The rebels fled in every direction.
The steamer Sioux City arrived at Lexington the following morning, and was seized by us. Our first care was to rescue our fellow-soldiers captured at Lexington by Price, viz, Colonel White, Colonel Grover, and some 12 or 15 others. We placed them on board the Sioux City with a guard, and dispatched them to Saint Louis. After administering the oath of allegiance to our prisoners we released them. As the rebels were recovering from their alarm, and beginning to surround us in force, we evacuated Lexington, after holding it thirty-six hours. As soon as the rebels were satisfied of our departure they attacked our deserted camp with great energy.
We then proceeded to Warrensburg, making a few captures on our route. The evening of our arrival at Warrensburg we easily repulsed a slight attack, and by threatening to burn the town if again attacked, remained two days unmolested. We next proceeded to Warsaw, and are now on our route to Stockton.
Among the interesting articles taken at Lexington were Price’s ambulance, Colonel Mulligan’s saddle, and the flag I have the pleasure of sending you.
I have no casualties to report, and my men are all in good health, anxious for further service. I cannot commend in too high terms the faithfulness and courage of the officers and men detailed on this service from Colonel Ellis’ First Missouri Cavalry, and the Irish Dragoons, commanded by Captain Naught on.

Thompson went north to join his force with Lowe’s, and attack Ironton. At Columbus a new casemate battery has been erected, a new 84-pounder rifled gun brought to the upper end of the city, and a chain brought up to throw across the river to obstruct navigation. In view of these facts I ordered a reconnaissance with gun-boat to-day. Inclosed I send you report of the commander [No. 2],
Whilst at New Madrid the same agent learned from General Watkins and others that the steamers Arago and Lake City are regularly in the employ of the South. Passengers, packages, and everything wanted South are sent aboard by Saint Louis agents, received without the authority of the provost-marshal or collector, shipped to Price’s Landing, and there meet agents to conduct them to their destination. I would recom mend that all boats other than those owned or chartered by Government be prohibited from navigating below Saint Louis. Let those be authorized to carry all legal freights, mails, passengers, &e., and Government receive the benefit.
In my report of last evening I expressed the desire to be allowed to visit Saint Louis and Springfield on business connected with this command. I now withdraw the request.

The enemy had been effectually cleared out of the town, in numbers from 1,500 to 2,000, by the cavalry force under Major Zagonyi, sent out two days since. Major Zagonyi’s report of his affair in detail has not yet been presented, with his statement of killed and wounded. It will be forwarded as soon as received. From all accounts the enemy have pushed on to join General Price’s forces, understood to be at Neosho, some 75 or 80 miles to the southwest. General McCulloch, it is reported, is at Camp Walker, in the northwest corner of Arkansas. I shall proceed to clear the State entirely of the enemy, and my further operations will then be determined by the movements and condition of the enemy.

tion of Lebanon. The commanding general, regarding this as an example of valor too brilliant to be passed over cursorily, directs that you transmit a copy of the order herewith to the War Department, with letter of transmittal.
In addition to Zagonyi’s ISO of the Guard, Major White had joined him with about 180 mounted men, and orders had been sent to Colonel Wyman to detach Major Wright’s battalion of rangers from Avis Plains, to co-operate with him. Other dispositions of Wright’s men, and the celerity with which Zagonyi moved, prevented immediate junction with him. Sigel’s division and force at headquarters move in now to occupy Springfield.

By order of the general commanding, the following dispatches from the brave Major Zagonyi are published, that all may know how much of success to the cause of the country may be accomplished by discipline and good conduct, viz:
Eight Miles from Springfield,
October 25, 1861—11.30 a. m.
General : The information on which I can rely is that Wednesday evening 1,500 men came into Springfield, and that at present there are not less than 1,800 or 1,900 men. I march forward, and will try what I can do. At the same time I would be thankful if some re-enforcement could come after me. Should I he successful, I need them for guard; should I be defeated, to have some troops to fall back with my worn-out command. I will report shortly again.
With high respect,

Major, Commanding Body-Guard.
Major-General Fremont, Commanding.
Five Miles of Bolivar,
October 26, 1^61—1 a. m.
General: I report respectfully that yesterday afternoon at 4 o’clock I met in Springfield about 2,000 or 2,200 of the rebels in their camp, formed in line of battle. They gave me a very warm reception— warmer than I expected. But your Guard, with one feeling, made a charge, and in less than 3 minutes the 2,000 or 2,200 men were perfectly routed by 150 men of the Body-Guard. We cleared out the city perfectly of every rebel, and raised the Union flag on the court-house. It getting too dark, I concluded to leave the city, not being able to keep it with 150 men. Major White’s men did not participate in the charge.
Allow me, general, to make you acquainted with the behavior of the soldiers and officers. I have seen charges, but such brilliant unanimity and bravery I have never seen and did not expect it. Their war cry, ‘ ‘ Fremont and the Union,” broke forth as thunder. Our loss comparatively small. I expected to remain on the field with them all. I will write about particulars.

ACTION AT SPRINGFIELD, MO.
No. 2.
Report of Maj. Charles Zagonyi, Fremont1 s Body-Guard.*
Springfield, October 28, 1861.
Sir: According to the order of Major-General Fremont, I left the camp south of Pomme de Terre River on Thursday, the 24th instant, at 8.30 p. in., and proceeded towards Springfield. About 8 miles from that place I captured five men belonging to picket guard and foraging parties. A sixth escaped and gave the alarm to the rebels. I reached Springfield, a distance of 51 miles, at 3 p. m. on the 25th. Knowing that the enemy was apprised of our coming, I made a detour of 5 miles, to attack from another side; but instead of finding the enemy in their old camp, I came suddenly upon them, drawn up in line of battle, as I emerged from a wood near the Mount Yernon road. The place was too confined for me to form my men. I had to pass 250 yards down a lane and take down a rail fence at the end of it, form in their camp, and make the first charge. My men belonging to the Body-Guard amounted to 150, and were exposed from the moment we entered the lane to a murderous cross-fire. Our first charge was completely successful. Half of my command charged upon the infantry and the remainder upon the cavalry, breaking their line at every point. The infantry retired into a thick wood, where it was impossible to follow them. The cavalry fled in all directions through the town. I rallied, and charged through the streets in all directions about twenty times, clearing the town and neighborhood, returning at last to the court-house, where I raised the flag of one of my companies, liberated the prisoners, and united my men, which now amounted to 70, the rest being scattered or lost. As it was nearly dark I retired, in order not to run the risk of sacrificing the remainder of my men, who were exhausted with the labors of the march and the battle. Twenty men, with a corporal, who were without horses, took possession of the town, collected the wounded and placed them in the hospital, picked up the dead, ordered out the Home Guard, and preserved order throughout the next day.
On the 27th, at 5 o’clock a. mr, I arrived again in the city, and from the statements of citizens, scouts, and prisoners (the latter being Union soldiers placed in front of the enemy’s ranks to be shot at), I ascertained that the rebel strength, as arrayed to receive our first charge, was 2,100 men. They had concentrated all the forces in the city to receive us. From the beginning to the end the Body-Guard behaved with the most unparalleled bravery and coolness. I have seen battles and cavalry charges before, but I never imagined that a body of men could endure and accomplish so much in the face of such a fearful disadvantage. At the cry of “Fremont and the Union,” which was raised at every charge, they dashed forward repeatedly in perfect order and with resistless energy. Many of my officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates had three or even four horses killed under them, capturing new ones from the enemy. I cannot mention any names without doing great injustice to my command. Many performed acts of heroism. Not one but did his whole duty.
Our loss is as follows:
Killed—Corporals, 6; privates, 9. Wounded—Officers, 4; non-commissioned officers, 1) privates, 16. Missing—Sergeant, 1; Corporal 1, privates, 8. Total loss, 52.

The loss of the enemy in killed alone, from the statement of citizens, scouts, and prisoners, was at least 106. How many wounded have since died I have no means of knowing, as they removed them in the night with wagons. Twenty-three of their dead were buried by the Body-Guard. We took 27 prisoners, $4,040 in gold, and about 60 stand of arms. Inclosed I send you a detailed account of our loss, with names.*
Major White’s command left me at the beginning of the action and before my first charge, and I saw no more of them until the next day at 10 o’clock. Captain Naughton and Lieutenant Conolly, who followed part way down the lane, were both wounded, the latter mortally, whereupon their company turned and followed the other two in spite of the efforts of the sergeant. Major White himself was made a prisoner before the battle, and placed with others in the enemy’s front rank, but escaped uninjured.
In conclusion, I beg to urge the necessity of new clothing, arms, and horses for my command. Forty-five horses are killed or unfitted for use. Uniforms, haversacks, and extra clothes carried in the haversacks are so riddled with bullets as to be useless. Bevolvers are also seriously damaged by the enemy’s bullets.

Commanding Body-Guard.

Report of Capt. P. Naughton, commanding V Irish Dragoons.”
Saint Louis, Mo., December 18,1861.
General: In accordance with the privilege granted me of making a personal report to your headquarters of the part taken by my company in the charge at Springfield on the 25th of October last, I respectfully represent that—
1st. Gross injustice has been done my company in the report of Major Zagonyi.
2d. That this injustice, after several solicitations on my part, and a forbearance extending even several weeks, has not been atoned for in any even the slightest manner.
The proof of my first accusation against Major Zagonyi consists in this: That, from a personal knowledge, he was aware of a portion of my command being connected with his own in the charge on and pursuit of the enemy’s cavalry; that from information drawn from his officers he was cognizant of the participation of the rest of my company, assisted by some dismounted Body-Guards, in three successive assaults on the enemy’s camp, and that having confessed this much in the presence of different officers of his command, he deliberately withheld all credit therefor, and even perverted a temporary and purely accidental connection with Major White’s command, so that the public might conclude my company—as stated, whether truly or not, of Major White’s— was not in the fight.
The proof of my second accusation against Major Zagonyi consists in this: That with the knowledge of the untruth implied in his report, and well knowing by letter and otherwise from me how grievously we felt

ACTION AT SPRINGFIELD, MO.
the impropriety of any stigma being attached to us on account of others’ default, he nevertheless studiously avoided, except by word of mouth, any retraction or any written evidence of his inconsiderate and evidently egotistical announcement of the affair at Springfield.
I leave it to your judgment, general, whether or not, under these circumstances, I should forbear to characterize his conduct as it appears to deserve. So far from Major Zagonyi’s command being the only one engaged at Springfield, it was proved in the court of inquiry (called for, but of which the full report* never saw the light) that the dragoons were the second in the order of time into the field, and were the last to leave it. It was also proved to that court’s satisfaction that the major gave no orders, either to his men or Major White’s command, and consequently that the conduct of the dragoons in engaging the infantry of the enemy almost single handed, after his cavalry had been detached and was in the road to Springfield, was purely a voluntary, and, therefore, whether wise or not, no cowardly choice of alternatives.
It was proved, finally, that if Major Zagonyi could not recognize us as being in the field, he could count our dead and wounded as his own, barely leaving us a dozen or so as testimony to our presence and the aim of the enemy.
For reasons personal to Major Zagonyi all these facts were suppressed from publication, and the want of generosity shown by that officer has been allowed to take form in the general misconception of the public in our regard.
I beg, general, while apologizing for this personal explanation, which you have been kind enough to permit, to append the report* sent by me, shortly after the affair of Springfield, to my colonel, and also a copy of a letter in reference to this subject to Major Zagonyi. Hoping these documents transmitted will assist to do that justice to my men which I really believe they deserve,

Sir : 1 have waited with a very natural impatience for your twice-promised amende of the manner in which the services of the Irish Dragoons in the late charge at Springfield have been ignored. Not seeing any publication calculated to do them justice, and feeling that they should not be unjustly debarred from whatever merit they may have deserved and you confess to belong to them, not even for the Body-Guard, I now ask you very earnestly to fulfill your promise. For myself I have nothing to ask; for them, and more particularly for the sake of the brigade to which they belong, I not only ask but demand equal and exact justice. A soldier yourself you can appreciate my anxiety for the good fame of my command. Wounded as I am, you can only be the more willing to render further requests and other proceedings unnecessary.

Report of Brig. Gen. Chester Harding, jr., Missouri State Militia.
Hermann, October 31, 1861.
Sm: Having ascertained that a considerable force of rebels had encamped about 8 miles north of Fulton, Callaway County, that their number was increasing, and that they designed an attack upon some one of the important bridges on the Pacific Railroad, I deemed it my duty to cross the river and disperse them. Accordingly, 650 men, taken from Morton’s Independent Ohio Regiment, and the Tenth Regiment Missouri Volunteers, with a section of artillery with two field pieces, were ordered to take a train at this point and proceed to Medora, where a boat from Jefferson City was to be in readiness to transport them over the river. The expedition was to have crossed at midnight on the 27th, but delay in furnishing railroad transportation prevented us from landing at Saint Aubert’s before Sunday afternoon (28th). At Medora I found Brigadier-General Prentiss and some of his staff, who had come from Jefferson on the boat. He accompanied us, but declined to take the command. The men had been under arms since 10 o’clock p. m. of the 27th, and I allowed them to rest for a few hours at Saint Aubert’s.
At 11 p. m. on the 28th we marched, and reached Fulton, 18 miles distant, at sunrise. I there learned that the rebels, anticipating an attack from the Federal forces, had made an arrangement with Brigadier-General Henderson by which they were allowed to disperse, and were exempted from arrest or punishment for their treasonable proceedings. General Prentiss and I had a consultation with the few leading Union men in Fulton, and decided to respect the agreement referred to, especially as I could not leave a garrison in the town to protect the loyal citizens from the vengeance which the secessionists would have taken had we interfered with the persons or property of their leaders. I therefore returned to this place, having' first given General Prentiss an escort to accompany him to Jefferson City.
That whole region is thoroughly disloyal. There is no faith to be placed in anything but the fears of the rebels. On our return a single individual rode up within 200 yards of our advance guard and fired at it, and this is an indication of the universal feeling there. There are not 200 Union men in the county of Callaway. Although we met no enemy, our visit has done some good. The rebels are fully aware that they may expect an instant movement against them the moment they attempt to gather in force. I am happy to say that the most admirable good order and discipline were maintained by Lieut. Col. John A. Turley, commanding the detachment of Ohio troops; Maj. S. A. Holmes, commanding the Missouri Volunteers; and Captain Krech, of the Reserve Guard, in charge of the artillery. Although we passed through a country where we found few but enemies, there was no interference with private property, and no irregularities of any kind were committed.

Report of Col. G. M. Dodge, Fourth Iowa Infantry, with instructions to
Colonel Greusel.
Rolla, Mo., November 9, 1861.
Captain : Having obtained reliable information of Freeman and his forces, on Friday, November 1,1 sent a detachment, consisting of 250 of Fourth Iowa, 180 of Thirty-sixth Illinois, and Wood’s Kansas Rangers, 60 strong, under command of Colonel Greusel, Thirty-sixth Illinois, with instructions to flight Freeman or drive him and forces out of the country ; and, after doing this, to divide the forces, sending the cavalry home by way of Salem, leaving the infantry, under command of Maj. W. R. English, Fourth Iowa, to capture all the property belonging to rebels in Freeman’s army, and report to these headquarters.
The infantry arrived to-night, bringing in a large amount of property, stock, and several prominent rebel prisoners. They drove Freeman from Texas County, and Captain Wood, in command of cavalry, is still in pursuit of him. The amount of stock and property will amount to several thousand dollars, all of it good.
The expedition has proved a success, and I think has rid this section of a thieving, murdering rebel force.
I did not telegraph in relation to expedition, not considering it of that character that required speedy information to headquarters of department.

Colonel : If the men who are away from home are in the rebel army, or if their families cannot give a good account of themselves or their whereabouts, take their property, or that portion of it worth taking ; also their slaves. Be sure they are aiding the enemy, and then take all they have got. They have aided and abetted Freeman in all ways, and most of them are now in the rebel army. You had not been gone long before the enemy were signaled from this vicinity by firing and beacon lights. They could only guess your destination, as no one knew it except you and myself.
Keep account of everything you take and who it is taken from. I think your idea is a good one about dividing your forces. Let the infantry, on returning, visit the Pineys and look out for affairs there. Be careful in taking contraband negroes that their owners are aiding the enemy.

Report of Col. Richard J. Oglesby, Eighth Illinois Infantry, of expedition from Bird?s Point, with instructions from General Grant.
Bird’s, Point, Mo., November 13, 1861.
General : I have to report that upon receiving your order at 12 o’clock at night November 2, I immediately organized the expedition to move inland from this point and in the direction of the Saint Francois River. On Monday morning the forces, consisting of the Eighteenth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, commanded by Col. Michael K. Lawler; the Twenty-ninth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, commanded by Col. James Rearden, and one section of Captain Schwartz’s light artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Gumbart, from Brigadier-General McClernand’s brigade, Cairo, 111., and the Eighth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, Lieut. Col. Frank L. Rhoads commanding; one battalion Eleventh Regiment Illinois Volunteers, Lieut. Col. T. E. G. Ransom commanding; Captain Pfaff’s cavalry; and Captain Langen’s cavalry, Lieutenant Hansen commanding, and Captain Noleman’s Centralia Cavalry, Lieutenant Tufts commanding, were landed at Commerce, Mo. The day was occupied in unloading supplies and arranging transportation for the march. Bearing in mind your order to pursue the rebel forces under Jeff. Thompson wherever they might be found, and to destroy the same if found, I marched directly for Bloomfield, Mo., at which point I was reliably informed the rebel forces were encamped. To avoid delay I moved the column directly towards the Nigger Wool Swamp, and crossed it and the swamp between it and Little River, at Stringer’s Ferry, 7 miles in one day. To do this it became necessary to construct several bridges, and to cut out a new road in several places. The rebel pickets were met by my advance guard on the bridge over the lake in the swamp. A slight skirmish ensued. An effort was made by the rebels to burn the bridge. It was soon repaired, under the direction of Hr. John M. Phipps, assistant surgeon of the Eighth Regiment. In the afternoon, Thursday, 7 miles from Bloomfield, I received a note from Colonel Perczel, of the Tenth Regiment Iowa Volunteers, informing me that he had taken possession of the town without resistance. The forces under General Thompson retreated in the direction of New Madrid on the night of the 6th instant. At Bloomfield I received your order to turn the column in the direction of New Madrid. I had already sent forward on the road towards New Madrid Colonel Perczel with his regiment about 6 miles, when Col. William H. L. Wallace came up with the

remaining companies of his regiment, and took command of the Eleventh Begiment in person. Through Colonel Wallace I received your verbal order to return to Bird’s Point. To avoid the terrible swamp in front of Bloomfield I returned by Cape Girardeau. Colonels Lawler and Bearden marched to Cape Girardeau in two days, the Eighth and Eleventh Illinois and Tenth Iowa following the next day. The whole force arrived at Bird’s Point on Tuesday, the 12th, having marched over 100 miles, and embarked and debarked twice, and traveled by water 85 miles besides, in less than nine days. I detained the forces one day at Bloomfield out of the nine.
The chief object of the expedition having failed, I have to inform you that the information derived about the country, and of the feelings of the inhabitants and the purposes of the rebellion, have fully compensated all the labor it has required. A more unhappy and deluded people I have never seen. . Wherever the column^noved consternation filled the whole community, and the fact that without regard to sex or age the whole people were not outraged and destroyed seemed to stupefy them.
I have to report the wanton destruction of property in one or two instances, otherwise the march through the country was most exemplary and satisfactory. My orders were obeyed with cheerfulness and alacrity. After four days I obtained forage from the people of the country for all the mules and horses. Four-filths of the inhabitants are ready to return to the Union whenever the Government can assure them from punishment by the rebel army. The yoke of Jeff. Thompson is a heavy one, and the people are becoming disgusted at his arbitrary sway. The scrip he has substituted for a good currency is totally worthless. His brutality in murdering in cold blood so many good citizens'of Missouri, and suffering them to rot unburied in full view of the public, has met its just return in the horror with which he and his whole command are beginning to be appreciated by the people of Southeastern Missouri. Bespectfully, yours,

Colonel : A dispatch just received requires me to send a force to the Saint Francois Biver to destroy rebels congregated there. I have determined to give you the command, and will require your regiment and three companies of cavalry from Bird’s Point to prepare for as early a move tomorrow as practicable. The balance of your command will be sent from this side of the river. You will require fourteen days’ rations and about four days’ forage. This latter article, being heavy, must be supplied by the country through which you pass. Thirty or thirty-five teams must be supplied from your side of the river, and to get them you. will have to draw upon the regimental transportation of the whole command there.
Detailed instructions will be drawn up for you before starting.*

Report of Col. Nicholas Perczel, Tenth Iowa Infantry, of expedition from Gape Girardeau, with instructions from General Grant.
Camp Fremont,
Gape Girardeau, Mon November 12, 1861.
Sir : In accordance with orders under date of November 6, 1861, I started with the detachment under the command of Colonel Eoss, taking with me the section of Campbell’s battery and a small body of Lieutenant-Colonel Murdoch’s cavalry as an advance guard. In the afternoon the advance guard saw a picket of the enemy, which retreated before them.
In the expectation of meeting the enemy I pushed forward in quick time, but found Spring Hill, where there was a camp of about 250 of the enemy’s cavalry, deserted. I marched on till evening, and encamped this side of the Castor Eiver.
I had most reliable information of Jeff. Thompson’s forces in Bloomfield. He had 1,500 men, part of whom were cavalry, and three pieces of artillery. I was determined to attack him the next day.
Officers and men seemed to be highly elated at the prospect of a fight, and would no doubt have done their duty.
On the morning of the 7th I received a letter from Colonel Oglesby, informing me that he would be at Bloomfield with his forces between 3 and 4 o’clock in the afternoon, and that he would wait for my arrival. As I was at that time only 6 miles from Bloomfield, and hoping that Thompson might make a stand against my forces, I decided not to wait, but to march forward.
At the moment of starting my scouts brought in two citizens of Bloomfield, bearing a flag of truce; they tendered the submission of their town to the legal authorities and begged for protection. They reported that Thompson retreated the day previous toward Saint Luke. I then marched forward, arrived in Bloomfield at 10 o’clock a. m., took possession of it, and promised protection to the citizens upon condition of their good behavior. Unfortunately some disorders occurred. They were, however, speedily stopped by the appointment of a provost-marshal.
I encamped in the camp recently occupied by Jeff. Thompson, and immediately sent out scouts toward Saint Luke. At 3 o’clock in the afternoon Colonel Oglesby arrived with only a company of cavalry.
His progress having been delayed by bad roads across the swamps, he did not expect to arrive with his troops before the next day. He left a troop of cavalry with me and returned to his forces at Castor River. I sent patrols and scouting parties from Lieutenant-Colonel Murdoch’s horse guard in the direction of the enemy, and protected the camp by sufficient outposts.
At noon on the 8th Colonel Oglesby arrived with his forces, and gave me orders to be in readiness to march in two hours. His first intention was to push after Thompson; his second, to march toward New Madrid; and his third, to march towards Belmont, across Nigger Wool Swamp. He gave me orders to march in the last-named direction, promising to follow the next morning. I marched out and encamped at Bessy’s Mill.
In the night I received a letter from Colonel Oglesby, informing me that our friends had engaged the enemy at Belmont, and tka,t they had been routed, and his determination to return to his detachment via

Cape Girardeau. On this, I in the morning cut across the country and took the shortest route to return to my post. On the road I met Colonel Oglesby, bound for this place.
I stopped at Castor River for the night. On the 10th I marched to White River, and on the 11th arrived at this place. Disappointed though we have been, yet from the spirit our soldiers have manifested in the prospect of a light, I may venture to prognosticate favorably for the future.

In pursuance of directions from headquarters Western Department you will send out an expedition towards Bloomfield—the Tenth Iowa Volunteers. Send with them four days’ rations and four days’ forage. Caution the commanding officer of the expedition in your instructions that no marauding or foraging is to be allowed under any circumstances. Private houses are not to be entered against the will of the people, except in pursuance of orders of the commanding officer, and then only on business to carry out the object of the expedition. When it becomes necessary to have forage for the transportation trains it will be taken and vouchers given at a fair valuation and accounted for. On the return of this regiment it will be ordered here, unless otherwise directed. You will also send to this place, as soon as practicable, so much of the engineer force as can be spared from yotir command.

Col. J. B. Plummer :
Yours of yesterday just received. When I gave directions for the expedition from Cape Girardeau I expected the force from Bird’s Point to protect them from the south, and the whole to meet at Bloomfield, or be within striking distance. Requiring Colonel Oglesby’s command with me, however, I have sent a messenger after it to him in this direction. This will leave your command wholly unprotected from this quarter; hence the necessity of having it stronger than first designed.
Receiving a report from Colonel Ross but a few minutes after you left Cairo of the force he would take with him, and knowing that he had started the morning before you left, I felt that he was strong enough, and did not think of a portion of his command being withdrawn. I should have dispatched to you immediately to prevent the expedition from continuing as it was. You will restore the command to as near what it was as a due regard for the security of your own position will permit, and allow it to proceed as originally designed.

Report of Col. William P. Carlin, Thirty-eighth Illinois Infantry, of expedition from Ironton.
Headquarters Expedition to Indian Ford,
November 10, 1861.
Captain : I have the honor to report that I arrived at this place yesterday evening, 70 miles from Ironton. On Tuesday last Thompson had withdrawn his detachment from this and other points in the neighborhood, and the same day fled from Bloomfield, which, I learn here, was occupied next day by Colonel Oglesby’s command from Caito or Bird’s Point.
Last night I sent my aide, Lieutenant Willett, and a detachment of cavalry, to communicate with the commanding officer at Bloomfield, but on arriving within 3 miles of town he met a messenger, who informed him that the troops there had been ordered to return to Bird’s Point in consequence of a fight at Belmont, that had been lost by our forces.
I find that it will be impracticable to follow up Thompson without making preparations for a long campaign. To this point it is possible for wagons to come, though they retard our march greatly. But beginning here is a miry, swampy region, utterly impracticable for baggage wagons. The country is now almost destitute of forage and provisions, the inhabitants living on corn bread and pork exclusively. During the remainder of this year, if Thompson should return, he can accomplish nothing but to devour what little remains. From all accounts he is disgusted and dispirited, and his forces kept together only by fear of being arrested by us.

I heard of the other moves. I will immediately put my command in marching order, and move to meet one or other of the columns, 1 think the one coming here from Cape Girardeau. I cannot be cut off; but, if the report be true as to numbers, I may be driven southward towards the plank road, but will keep you constantly advised, so that you can take advantage of any false movement they may make. You can rest assured, if Fremont has whipped Price, this movement is a real one; and if not, it is to cover greater ones. I hope there are post-horses from Little Bock to Price’s army, or the Federals will get four or five days’ advantage by telegraph.

Dear General : Another courier has arrived from Scott County, confirming the report from Cape Girardeau County. The last courier says 3,500 men landed at Commerce yesterday at 11 o’clock a. m., and camped last night at Benton. No other couriers have yet arrived, but these couriers from different directions confirming the report have forced me to prepare for action. I have issued orders disposing of my forces for a defense of this position, but as the troops from Cape Girardeau will have to cross no swamp to get here, their numbers may overwhelm me, and force me southward. If there is no possible chance to whip them, I may forego the pleasure of fighting them for the purpose of trying to save this county, which has always been very true to us, and may be sacked entirely if I should kill many of their men. The reports of the night and morning will determine me.
Should they move a large force down this ridge, Columbus is turned, and you will be forced to fight them.

Sir : I moved down to this point yesterday afternoon, and I will move to Camp Prairie this morning and to Camp Watkins this afternoon, if necessary. One column of the enemy encamped at Castor Bridge and one at Carpenter’s Ferry. We are safe from any, unless a column should press on down to New Madrid, which I have every reason to believe they have not, as my vedettes left Sikeston as late as 2 o’clock yesterday. If the coast is clear I will cross over to New Madrid; if it is not, I will remain at the end of the plank road until driven away. I will send all of Lewis’ cavalry over to the east side of the swamp as soon as possible. Luke Byrne’s cavalry will cross the Blanton road to-day to picket the country on that side. {Send me any news you have by a courier, on a fresh horse, to-day, over the plank road and up until he meets me.

Dear Sir : Yours of the 5th,# per Lieutenant Owens, was received night before last, while on my way to Columbus, from which place I have just returned. I took your letter with me to General Polk, and he will write to you at his earliest opportunity; but, as I can give you the information you desire (as it is possible he has his hands full for several days), I will write and let your courier return.
There was a general movement of the Federals on the 1st of this month. Those from Ironton started first and first attracted my attention. I sent my scouts out in the neighborhood of Greenville, and became satisfied that their cavalry had gotten too much in advance of their infantry, and, if their infantry had not already turned back, that I could cut it off. I was making arrangements to carry out my plans, when I received notice that a simultaneous march of several large columns was being made upon Bloomfield. I immediately commenced preparing to retreat, and barely had my baggage safe, when 7,000 of the enemy closed in their net, but found me missing. They probably would have pursued me southward at once, but the descent of the Mississippi having been so signally defeated at Columbus on the 8th, that all the columns have been halted, and probably ordered to return, to plan anew. It seems that the largest force, which was to have marched from Paducah to attack Columbus on the land side, did not come to time, so that the force which landed on the Missouri side, to second the gunboats, was defeated most signally, and the boats forced to return. I understand to-night that Bloomfield has been evacuated, so that probably we may have quiet for a few days, unless the column from Ironton passed down the Black Biver (beyond my information), and advanced too far to receive orders promptly enough to retreat in time.
The battle at Columbus was a hotly-contested and bloody affair, and if the Paducah force had arrived in time, the fate of Columbus might have been sealed. You will see detached accounts in the newspapers, but I will simply state that not less than 300,000 rounds of musketry

were fired in a small, thickly-timbered bottom, and probably no shot longer than 150 yards. The large guns in the bottom and on the gunboats were firing all the while, and for nearly six hours the oldest soldiers say they thought hell had broke loose. *
As soon as the enemy recuperate, they will probably advance again; but it will be a concentrated movement, and, consequently, you cannot expect much help from this end of the line, for we will have our hands full, and have to trust to Providence. My infantry force is now at each end of the plank road, and my cavalry is towards Bloomfield and Sikes-ton, watching the enemy and curtaining any movements I may determine upon.

Dear Colonel : I have just returned from Columbus, where I have been to receive orders, so that I can act in conjunction with the forces there. The signal defeat which the enemy received there has disconcerted all their plans, and therefore may require a change in ours. At the present time I am not disposed to believe that the enemy have really evacuated Bloomfield, although it is probable, as they may all fall back for the time being. If they really have returned, you may move northward, first to the end of the Bianton road, and when the u coast is clear” you can return to Bloomfield. I cannot, as yet, get satisfactory information as to their movements at Carpenter’s Ferry, as some say they are still crossing one way and some the other. I will know to-morrow, and then will determine what to do with the rest of my forces. I could not give more definite instructions than I did, as no facts have developed themselves, and even now everything is in suspense and doubt. There seems to have been a general movement by the enemy, but the defeat of the center column may delay them a few days. In the mean time be vigilant, and I will give them u jessy” yet.

If they do they will have a power from which I cannot escape, and, as the Confederates cannot now help me, I must still exercise my discretion rather than my valor, and show them my heels. You will therefore remain where you are until farther orders. If Bloomfield is evacuated, Pheelan will move up to the Blanton road, and will also move up on this side to the same road.

You should not advance your train farther north than the Cut-off road to the Blanton road, say section 18, township 23, range 10, or Jimmy Nations’, until the purpose of the enemy is further understood, for I may need you on this side of the swamps. There will soon be a general move on the part of the enemy (that commenced a few days ago, but was discontinued by the fight at Columbus). They may march a large column down the Sikeston road, or they may come down the Bloomfield road ; but come they assuredly will, unless they have entirely backed down. Your scouts, patrols, and pickets, both foot and horse, may go up as far as safe (which you must decide), but they must be careful of Noel Hawkins and such u ilk,” who are more dangerous than regulars. I will send Walker’s regiment to this end of the Blanton road to-morrow, and our couriers will pass over that road. If you can employ your men in repairing that road, you will be serving Stoddard County as well as the army. The quartermaster’s goods belonging to your post you will retain with you, but those boxes of clothes I want sent here, so that the Third Begiment of Infantry, which has suffered more and are more remote from home than the others, can receive a due proportion of them. My clothes are packed in some of the boxes. I desire them. The Bichardson Artillery will remain with you, and I desire that you shall create the impression that the whole force is with you, for the blow I desire to strike above here I wish to be unexpected.

of the 11th explained matters some what to your satisfaction, and I will do so fully to Captain White. I have now in the field about 2,000 men, of which 700 are mounted. I have eight field pieces. I did have Colonel Pheelan at Bloomfield, Colonel Walker at New Madrid, and the balance of my force with me at Fredericktown. After returning from Fredericks wn I had my men placed from the Saint Francis to Little River, so that I could move towards Ironton or Cape Girardeau with facility and secrecy. I heard of the approach from Ironton, and prepared to get in the rear of the enemy, to destroy his trains and force him to return, but just then I heard of his return (except Hawkins7 command), and of the concerted movements on my post at Bloomfield. I barely had time to call in my men and leave before 8,000 of them closed down on an empty net. The fight at Columbus disconcerted their plans for the time being, and all their troops have been called in to join the grand army, which I understand they are now concentrating to march down the Mississippi. I had yesterday Colonel Pheelan at the west end of the plank road, with 350 infantry, 200 dragoons, and 3 guns. Colonel Waugh was at the east end of the plank road, with 600 infantry. Colonel Walker was here with 200 infantry, 500 dragoons, and 5 guns. To-day Pheelan will be at the west end of the Blanton road; his dragoons will be in Bloomfield. Walker will be at the east end of the Blanton road (eight miles from here). Waugh will bring his infantry here, and I expect to take the dragoons to Sikeston, and, if possible, again destroy the Charleston Railroad, or make some diversion which will disconcert or delay the plans of the enemy at Bird’s Point. You will see that I am entirely too far away to be of any assistance to you, unless a single column should advance from Ironton (without one from Cape Girardeau), in which case I can, without the enemy being aware of my movements, be at the Indian Ford, or Saint Francisville, in four days, and either force them to come after me or go in their rear. I would be pleased to hear from you often, and any movements which I can make for your benefit, or as part of your plans, I will be pleased to make.

General: I have just received information which I indorse as reliable, for it comes from my own scouts, &c., that the enemy in very large force (7,000) are coming rapidly down upon us. That number was within 30 miles of He la Plaine (58 miles north of this) this morning. As you are aware, I have a very small force here, not exceeding, even if reaching, 700 effective men of all arms, and everyone of them, men and officers, raw and inexperienced. I have a few old cannon (6 and 4 pounders) that General Hardee pronounced worthless and threw aside as such before he left. Besides, I have no artillery company. Captain Roberts, with about 60 men, who have some knowledge of such service, though not regularly trained, left here yesterday evening, by order of

General Hardee, to join him in Kentucky. I have ordered them back to take charge of these guns and do the best we can with them. I hope they will get back by to-morrow night. I have sent a dispatch to General Thompson, wherever he may be in Missouri, to co-operate with me by marching upon the flank and rear of the enemy, and I have requested him to send my dispatch on to you at Columbus, as containing what I wish you to know. I write this to you via Memphis, so as to have two chances to reach you speedily. I have dispatched to every militia and volunteer Officer throughout the counties an appeal to the people to rally to my support at once and from all quarters. It is only a question of time. If all to whom I have appealed come in due time we can beat the enemy, but if I am left alone with my little handful we can only die at our post, as we will do, but we cannot successfully resist such a disparity of force, at least ten to one, and with artillery.
Don’t think I exaggerate or write under undue excitement. I and the little force I have here (which I repeatedLy warned both General Hardee and General Johnston was wholly inadequate for either attack or defense), are resolved to die here alone, if no one comes to help us. To this I pledge myself, for I will never, while alive, retreat. My mind has long since been made up to that ; but I do feel the deepest concern that, if we are permitted to fall here, the invasion of our State will be complete before any other help can come, and our homes and families will be overwhelmed with ruin. Those who for want of timely aid shall permit us thus to be sacrificed will reap a full harvest of self-reproach at least, if not of disgrace. I have ordered up all the boats in the river to take off supplies, sick, &c., but doubt whether they can get here in sufficient number or in time. You know best what to do.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully,

Saint Louis, November 1, 1861.
You are hereby directed to hold your whole command ready to march at an hour’s notice, until further orders, and you will take particular care to be amply supplied with transportation and ammunition. You are also directed to make demonstrations with your troops along both sides of the river towards Charleston, Norfolk, and Blandville, and to keep your columns constantly moving back and forward against . these places, without, however, attacking the enemy.

[Chap. X.
At the same time I was notified that similar instructions had been sent to Brig. Gen. 0. F. Smith, commanding Paducah, Ky., and was directed to communicate with him freely as to my movements, that bis might be co-operative.
On the 2d of the same month, and before it was possible for any considerable preparation to have been made for the execution of this order, the following telegraphic dispatch was received:
Saint Louis, November 2, 1861.
Jeff. Thompson is at Indian Ford of the Saint Francois River, 25 miles below Greenville, with about 3,000 men. Colonel Carlin has started with force from Pilot Knob. Send a force from Cape Girardeau and Bird’s Point to assist Carlin in driving Thompson into Arkansas.
By order of Major-General Fremont:
C. McKEEVER, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Brigadier-General Grant.
The forces I determined to send from Bird’s Point were immediately designated, and Col. B. J. Oglesby, Eighth Illinois Volunteers, assigned to the command, under the following detailed instructions:
Headquarters District Southeast Missouri,
Cairo, November' 3, 1861.
You will take command of an expedition, consisting of your regiment, four companies of the Eleventh Illinois, all of the Eighteenth and Twenty-ninth, three companies of cavalry from Bird’s Point (to be selected and notified by yourself), and a section of Schwartz’ battery, artillery, and proceed by steamboats to Commerce, Mo. From Commerce you will strike for Sikeston, Mr. Cropper acting as guide. From there you will go in pursuit of a rebel force, understood to be 3,000 strong, under Jeff. Thompson, now at Indian Ford, on the Saint Francis River.
An expedition has already left Ironton, Mo., to attack this force. Should they learn that they have left that place it will not be necessary for you to go there, but pursue the enemy in any direction he may go, always being cautious not to fall in with an unlooked-for foe too strong for the command under you.
The object of the expedition is to destroy this force, and the manner of doing it is left largely at your discretion, believing it better not to trammel you with instructions. Transportation will be furnished you for fourteen days’ rations and four or five days’ forage. All you may require outside of this must be furnished by the country through which you pass.
In taking supplies you will be careful to select a proper officer to press them, and require a receipt to be given, and the articles pressed accounted for in the same manner as if purchased.
You are particularly enjoined fco allow no foraging by your men. It is demoralizing in the extreme, and is apt to make open enemies where they would not otherwise exist.
Yours, &c.,
U. S. GRANT,
Brigadier- General.
Col. R. J. Oglesby, Commanding, <j~c., Bird’s Point, Mo.
Col. J. B. Plummer, Eleventh Missouri Volunteers, commanding Cape Girardeau, was directed to send one regiment in the direction of Bloomfield, with a view to attracting the attention of the enemy.
The forces under Colonel Oglesby were all got off on the evening of the 3d.
On the 5th a telegram was received from headquarters Saint Louis, stating that the enemy was re-enforcing Price’s army from Columbus by way of White River, and directing that the demonstration that had been ordered against Columbus be immediately made. Orders were accordingly at once given to the troops under my command that remained at Cairo, Bird’s Point, and Fort Holt. A letter was also sent to Brig.

Gen. 0. F. Smith, commanding at Paducah, requesting him to make a demonstration at the same time against Columbus.
To more effectually attain the object of the demonstration against the enemy at Belmont and Columbus, I determined on the morning of the 6th to temporarily change the direction of Colonel Oglesby’s column towards New Madrid, and also to send a small force under Col. W. H. L. Wallace, Eleventh Illinois Yolunteers, to Charleston, Mo., to ultimately join Colonel Oglesby. In accordance with this determination I addressed Colonel Oglesby the following communication:
Cairo, November 6, 1861.
On receipt of this turn your column towards New Madrid. When you arrive at the nearest point to Columbus from which there is a road to that place, communicate with me at Belmont.

which was sent to Colonel Wallace with the following letter:
Cairo, November 6, 1861.
Herewith I send you an order to Colonel Oglesby to change the direction of his column towards New Madrid, halting to communicate with me at Belmont from the nearest point on his road.
I desire you to get up the Charleston expedition ordered for to-morrow, to start tonight, taking two days’ rations with them. You will accompany them to Charleston, and get Colonel Oglesby’s instructions to him by a messenger, if practicable, and when he is near enough you may join him. For this purpose you may substitute the remainder of your regiment in place of an equal amount from Colonel Marsh’s. The two days’ rations carried by your men in haversacks will enable you to join Colonel Oglesby’s command, and there you will find rations enough for several days more should they be necessary. You may take a limited number of tents, and at Charleston press wagons to carry them to the main column. There you will find sufficient transportation to release the pressed wagons.
U. S. GRANT,
Brigadier- General.
Col. W. H. L. Wallace, Bird?8 Point, Mo.
On the evening of the 6th I left this place in steamers, with McCler-nand’s Brigade, consisting of Twenty-seventh Begiment Illinois Volunteers, Col. K. B. Buford; Thirtieth Begiment Illinois Yolunteers, Col. Philip B. Fouke; Thirty-first Begiment Illinois Yolunteers, Col. John A. Logan 5 Dollins’ Company Independent Illinois Cavalry, Capt. J. J. Dollins; Delano’s Company Adams County Illinois Cavalry, Lieut. J. K. Catlin; and Dougherty’s Brigade, consisting of Twenty-second Begiment Illinois Yolunteers, Lieut. Col. H. E. Hart; Seventh Begiment Iowa Yolunteers, Col. J. G. Lauman, amounting to 3,114 men of all arms, to make the demonstration against Columbus. I proceeded down the river to a point 9 miles below here, where we lay until next morning, on the Kentucky shore, which served to distract the enemy and led him to suppose that he was to be attacked in his strongly fortified position at Columbus.
About 2 o’clock on the morning of the 7th I received information from Col. W. H. L. Wallace at Charleston (sent by a messenger on steamer W. H. B.) that he had learned from a reliable Union man that the enemy had been crossing troops from Columbus to Belmont the day before, for the purpose of following after and cutting off the forces under Colonel Oglesby. Such a move on his part seemed to me more than probable, and gave at once a twofold importance to my demonstration against the enemy—namely, the prevention of reinforcements to General Price, and the cutting off of the two small columns that I had sent, in

pursuance of directions, from this place and Cape Girardeau, in pursuit of Jeff. Thompson. This information determined me to attack vigorously his forces at Belmont, knowing that should we be repulsed, we would re-embark without difficulty under the protection of the gunboats. The following order was given:
On Board Steamer Belle Memphis,
November 7, 1861—2 o’clock a. m.
The troops composing the present expedition from this place will move promptly at 6 o’clock this morning. The gunboats will take the advance, and be followed by the First Brigade, under command of Brig. Gen. John A. McClemand, composed of all the troops from Cairo and Fort Holt. The Second Brigade, comprising the remainder of the troops of the expedition, commanded by Col. Henry Dougherty, will follow. The entire force will debark at the lowest point on the Missouri shore where a landing can be effected in security from the rebel batteries. The point of debarkation will be designated by Captain Walke, commanding naval forces.
By order of Brig. Gen. U. S. Grant:
JOHN A. RAWLINS,
Assistant Adjutant-General.
Promptly at the hour designated we proceeded down the river to a point just out of range of the rebel batteries at Columbus, and debarked on the Missouri shore. From here the troops were marched, with skirmishers well in advance, by flank for about a mile towards Belmont, and there formed in line of battle. One battalion had been left as a reserve near the transports. Two companies from each regiment were thrown forward as skirmishers, to ascertain the position of the enemy, and about 9 o’clock met and engaged him. The balance of my force, with the exception of the reserve, was promptly thrown forward, and drove the enemy foot by foot, and from tree to tree, back to his encampment or the river bank, a distance of over 2 miles. Here he had strengthened his position by felling the timber for several hundred yards around his camp, making a sort of abatis. Our men charged through this, driving the enemy under cover of the bank, and many of them into their transports, in quick time, leaving us in possession of everything not exceedingly portable.
Belmont is situated on low ground, and every foot is commanded by the guns on the opposite shore, and of course could not be held for a single hour after the enemy became aware of the withdrawal of his troops. Having no wagons with me, I could move but little of the captured property, consequently gave orders for the destruction of everything that could not be moved and an immediate return to our transports. Tents, blankets, &c., were set on fire and destroyed, and our return march commenced, taking his artillery and a large number of captured horses and prisoners with us. Three pieces of artillery being drawn by hand, and one by an inefficient team, were spiked and left on the road; two were brought to this place.
We had but fairly got under way when the enemy, having received re-enforcements, rallied under cover of the river bank and the woods on the point of land in the bend of the river above us, and made his appearance between us and our transports, evidently with a design of cutting off our return to them.
Our troops were not in the least discouraged, but charged the enemy and again defeated him. We then, with the exception of the Twenty-seventh Illinois, Col. NT. B. Buford commanding, reached our transports and embarked without further molestation. While waiting for the arrival of this regiment, and to get some of our wounded from a field hospital near by, the enemy, having crossed fresh troops from Columbus, again made his appearance on the river bank, and commenced

﻿Chap. X.]	ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.	271
firing upon our transports. The fire was returned by our men from the decks of the steamers, and also by the gunboats with terrible effect, compelling him to retire in the direction of Belmont. In the mean time Colonel Buford, although he had received orders to return with the main force, took the Charleston road from Belmont, and came in on the road leading to Bird’s Point, where we had formed the line of battle in the morning. At this point, to avoid the effect of the shells from the gunboats that were beginning to fall among his men, he took a blind path direct to the river, and followed a wood road up its bank, and thereby avoided meeting the enemy, who were retiring by the main road. On his appearance on the river bank a steamer was dropped down, and took his command on board, without his having participated or lost a man in the enemy’s attempt to cut us off from our transports.
Notwithstanding the crowded state of our transports, the only loss we sustained from the enemy’s fire upon them was three men wounded, one of whom belonged to one of the boats.
Our loss in killed on the field was 85, 301 wounded (many of them, however, slightly), and 99 missing. Of the wounded, 125 fell into the hands of the enemy. Nearly all the missing were from the Seventh Iowa Regiment, which suffered more severely than any other. All the troops behaved with great gallantry, which was in a great degree attributable to the coolness and presence of mind of their officers, particularly the colonels commanding.
General McClernand was in the midst of danger throughout the engagement, and displayed both coolness and judgment. His horse was three times shot under him.
Colonel Dougherty, Twenty-second Illinois Volunteers, commanding the Second Brigade, by his coolness and bravery entitles himself to be named among the most competent of officers for command of troops in battle. In our second engagement he was three times wounded, and fell a prisoner in the hands of the enemy.
Among the killed was Lieut. Col. A. Wentz, Seventh Iowa Volunteers, and among the wounded were Col. J. G. Lauman and Maj. E. W. Rice, of the Seventh Iowa.
The reports of subcommanders will detail more fully particulars of the engagement, and the conduct of both officers and men.
To my staff, Capt. John A. Rawlins, assistant adjutant-general; Lieuts. C. B. Lagow and William S. Hillyer, aides-de-camp, and Capt. R. B. Hatch, assistant quartermaster, I am much indebted for the promptitude with which they discharged their several duties.
Surg. J. H. Brinton, U. S. volunteers, chief medical officer, was on the field during the entire engagement, and displayed great ability and » efficiency in providing for the wounded, and in organizing the medical corps.
Maj. J. D. Webster, acting chief engineer, also accompanied me on the field, and displayed soldierly qualities of a high order.
My own horse was shot under me during the engagement.
The gunboats Tyler, Captain Walke, and Lexington, Captain Stem-bel, convoyed the expedition, and rendered most efficient service. Immediately upon our landing they engaged the enemy’s batteries on the heights above Co] umbus, and protected our transports throughout. For a detailed account of the part taken by them I refer with pleasure to the accompanying report of Capt. H. Walke, senior officer [No. 3j.
In pursuance of my request, General Smith, commanding at Paducah, sent on the 7th instant a force to Mayfield, Ky., and another in the direction of Columbus, with orders not to approach nearer, however,

than 12 or 15 miles of that place. I also sent a small force on the Kentucky side towards Columbus, under Col. John Cook, Seventh Illinois Volunteers, with orders not to go beyond Elliotts Mills, distant some 12 miles from Columbus. These forces having marched to the points designated in their orders, returned without having Inet serious resistance.
On the evening of the 7th information of the result of the engagement at Belmont was sent to Colonel Oglesby, commanding expedition against Jell*. Thompson, and orders to return to Bird’s Point by way of Charleston, Mo. Before these reached him, however, he had learned that Jeff. Thompson had left the place where he was reported to be when the expedition started (he having gone towards New Madrid or Arkansas), and had determined to return. The same information was sent to the commanding officer at Cape Girardeau, with directions for the troops to be brought back that had gone out from that place.
From all the information I have been able to obtain since the engage-mentj the enemy’s loss in killed and wounded was much greater than ours. We captured 175 prisoners, all his artillery and transportation, and destroyed his entire camp and garrison equipage. Independent of the injuries inflicted upon him, and the prevention of his re-enforcing Price or sending a force to cut off the expeditions against Jeff. Thompson, the confidence inspired in our troops in the engagement wiH be of incalculable benefit to us in the future.

General: Inclosed I send you the report of Brig. Gen. J. A. Mc-Clernand, commanding First Brigade in the late engagement at Belmont, Mo. Also the report of Surgeon Brinton, medical director, who accompanied me on that occasion. [Nos. 2 and 4.]
The Seventh Iowa and Twenty-second Illinois Volunteers were the only troops in the engagement not included in General McClernand’s command. Each of these lost their commanders, wounded, and consequently I have no official report of them. Being on the field myself during the entire engagement, I can answer for the gallantry of officers and men of both these regiments.
The Seventh Iowa lost their colonel (Lauman), wounded severely, and * lieutenant-colonel (Wentz), killed, and major (Rice), severely wounded. Lieutenants Dodge and Gardner and 23 rank and file were killed; wounded, Captains Gardner, Harper, and Parrott, and Lieutenant Reams and 74 others.
Of the Twenty-second Illinois, Colonel Dougherty was badly wounded and taken prisoner. Twenty-one rank and file were killed. Captains Hubbard and McAdams and 74 men were wounded. Information received since the engagement through the Southern press, and from persons coming from the South since, show the enemy’s force in the field to have been over 9,000 men, and their loss in killed and wounded alone not less than 600. My own impression is, their loss was much greater.

The city of Memphis was thrown into mourning for the dead and wounded taken there. Great apprehension is said to have prevailed lest the blow should be followed up with an attack upon them.
The officers and men, with rare exceptions, showed great personal courage, and I have every reason to be satisfied with their conduct. The lesson, though severe, will be of great advantage to the entire command. The object aimed at, to wit, to prevent the enemy from re-enforcing Price in Missouri, and from cutting off two small columns I had been directed to send towards the Saint Francois River, was accomplished to the fullest extent. The enemy have entirely abandoned Belmont, and have been receiving re-enforcements in Columbus continually since the engagement.

If you can make a demonstration towards Columbus at the same time with a portion of your command, it would probably keep the enemy from throwing over the river much more force than they now have there, and might enable me to drive those they now have out of Missouri.

It has been his fortune to have been in all the battles fought in Mexico by Generals Scott and Taylor save Buena Yista, and he never saw one more hotly contested or where troops behaved with more gallantry.

Report of 8urg. J. H. Brinton, TJ. 8. Army, Medical Director.
Medical Director’s Office,
Cairo, III., November 18,1861.
General: I have the honor to submit the following list of soldiers wounded in the recent fight at Belmont, Mo. The total number of injured as yet reported to this office amounts to 247. Of these, as will be seen by reference to the subjoined statement, 10 have already died. It should, however, be stated that from one regiment (viz, the Seventh Iowa Volunteers) no report has as yet been rendered. The number of casualties to this corps have been more in number than to any other regiment, and when the report of the surgeon*, Dr. Witter, shall have been received, the list as already submitted will doubtless be somewhat augmented.*
The reason of the delay with regard to the report of the wounded of the Seventh Iowa Regiment arises from the fact that immediately after the battle of the 7th instant that regiment was ordered to Benton Barracks, Mo., a portion of the wounded being left behind at this place and in Mound City, whilst another portion were conveyed northward with their regiment. Many of the wounded at present in our depot and general hospitals are cases of unfavorable nature. This is owing

to the circumstance that they fell into the hands of the enemy, and were left exposed on the field of battle for at least 18 or 24 hours. They were subsequently returned to us by their captors. Had the medical department of your command been provided with the proper ambulance train this disastrous and mortifying result might have been avoided. The only means of transportation which I possessed consisted of some two or three ordinary army wagons, obtained from the quartermaster’s department. These being destitute of springs, and the country over which they passed being wooded and rough, our wounded suffered much unnecessary anguish.
I would also state that Surgeon Gordon, of the Thirtieth Regiment Illinois Volunteers, and Assistant Surgeon Whitnall, of the Thirty-first Illinois Volunteers, were captured by the enemy, and still remain in their hands.
It affords me pleasure to notice the ability and efficiency of Brigade Surgeon Stearns and the corps of surgeons generally. I would especially instance the conduct of Assistant Surgeon Kendall, of Delano’s cavalry, who freely exposed himself to the fire of the enemy in his efforts to rescue and aid our wounded.

Report of Commander Henry Walke, U. S. Navy.
IT. S. Gunboat Tyler, Mound City, November 9, 1861.
General : Agreeably to your instructions, I proceeded on the evening of the 6th, in company with the IT. S. gunboat Lexington, under Commander Stembel, down the Mississippi, convoying a number of transport steamers as far as opposite Norfolk and near the Kentucky shore, where we all anchored for the night. At 3 o’clock the following morning the gunboats Tyler and Lexington proceeded down the river with the intention of engaging the enemy at Iron Banks, but after running a short distance we were met by such a dense fog as to render any further progress hazardous and unfeasible. We therefore rounded to, and returned to the point from whence we started. I received your special order, and at 6 o’clock we all started, the two gunboats taking the lead. We proceeded to the extreme end of Lucas Bend, where I supposed we were out of the range of their guns. After your troops were disembarked and under marching orders, about 8.30 o’clock, the two gunboats proceeded to engage the batteries on Iron Banks, We each

﻿276	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND 1ND. T\ [Chat. X.
expended several rounds of shell with seemingly good effect, but their balls from the rifled cannon flew by and over us to a great extent, some of the shot going half a mile beyond the transports. Fortunately, however, they did us no damage, and we returned to the transports, where they kept firing at us for a considerable length of time. I finally requested the captains of the transports to move above and out of the range of their guns, which subsequently they did, we ourselves doing likewise.
At 10 o’clock, hearing the battle at Belmont, our two boats again proceeded down to engage their batteries, this time expending more shell and receiving no injury. After an engagement of about twenty minutes, in the mean time the shots flying thickly about us, we again returned to the transports, continuing our fire as long as our shells reached them.
At noon, hearing the continued firing at Belmont, the two gunboats made their third attack upon the enemy’s batteries, this time going nearly a quarter of a mile nearer. We opened a brisk fire of shell, directing many of them to the enemy’s camp at Belmont, their rifled balls still passing beyond and around us, but one of their 24-pounders struck us on the starboard bulwarks, continuing obliquely through the spar deck, and in its course taking off the head of one man and injuring two others? one quite seriously.
After firing a few more rounds we returned, keeping up our fire from the stern guns till out of reach. It is truly miraculous that we have in all our engagements escaped with so little damage. After nearly all the troops had re-embarked and were about ready to start, a sudden attack was made upon the transport vessels by an apparently large re-enforcement of the rebels. Our boats being in good position, we opened fire with our grape, canister, and 5-second shells, and completely routed them—we learn with great slaughter. After silencing the enemy, we continued our fire with the broadside guns, throwing shell on the banks ahead with the bow gun to protect the transports, and throwing shell from the stern gun upon the enemy’s ground so long as we were in reach.
After passing a few miles up the river we met the Chancellor, with Brigadier-General McClernand on board, who stated that some of their troops had been left behind, and by his direction both gunboats returned some distance, picking up between us all there were to be seen, together with a large number of prisoners, some wounded and sick. Every attention was paid to alleviate the sufferings of the wounded, Acting Surgeons Kearney and Goddard dressing their wounds, and the crew of the ships furnishing them with their own hammocks and bedding. We then returned to Island No. 1; met the Bob Boy, with instructions from you ; turned over to her all our soldiers and prisoners, and remained there till an hour after Colonel Cook’s, return from a reconnaissance down the Kentucky side. We then weighed anchor and proceeded to Cairo. Commander Stembel, with the Lexington as consort, supported me in all the duties of the day with most commendable energy and in a most effective manner.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. WALKE, Commander, U. 8. Navy.

Reports of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, U. S. Army, commanding
First Brigade.
Cairo, November 8, 1861.
The expedition of which I advised you on the 6th landed yesterday morning 5 miles this side of Columbus, my command consisting of Twenty-seventh, Colonel Buford; Thirtieth, Colonel Fouke; Thirty-first, Colonel Logan ; Captain Doliins’ company of cavalry, and Captain Taylor’s battery of six pieces, all Illinois volunteers; the Twenty-second Illinois and Seventh Iowa, and Captain Delano’s company of cavalry, under Colonel Dougherty. Within 2 miles from Belmont, opposite Co-lujnbus, the enemy met us in superior force. We beat them, fighting all the way into their camp immediately under the guns at Columbus ; burned their encampment, took 200 prisoners, a large amount of prop -erty, spiked two or three guns, and brought away two. During the action several thousand men were thrown across from Columbus. They formed a heavy column in our rear. We fought the same ground over, and after defeating them returned to our boats. Colonel Buford’s regiment and Doliins’ cavalry, becoming separated from the main body, made a circuit and came to the river above the landing after the boats had left. I returned with transport boats and gunboats, and brought them late at night. General Grant was in chief command. The battle was a terrible one, lasting several hours, and the loss on both sides heavy— probably 300 killed, wounded, and prisoners on our part. The enemy much greater. Many officers are lost. Captain Bielaski, of my stall*, killed; Colonel Dougherty missing; Colonel Lauman wounded. Our force was about 3,500 strong—the enemy double that number. Prisoners say it was more. A flag of truce goes down to-day to provide for the dead and wounded. I will report at large by mail.
JOHN A-. McCLEEKAND,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Major-General McClellan.
Brigade Headquarters,*
Camp Cairo, November 12, 1861.
Sir: I have the honor to report the part taken by the forces under my command in the action before Columbus, Ky., on the 7th instant. These forces consisted of a portion of my own brigade, viz: the Twenty-seventh Begiment, Col. N. B. Buford; the Thirtieth, Col. Philip B. Fouke; the Thirty-first, Col. John A. Logan, including one company of cavalry, under Capt. J. J. Doliins; the strength of the Twenty-seventh being 720 rank and file; that of the Thirtieth, 500; that of the Thirty-first, 610, exclusive of 70 mounted men, making in ail 1,900 rank and file. To this force you added, by your order of the 6th instant, Captain Delano’s company of Adams County cavalry, 58 men, under Lieut. J. K. Catlin, and Capt. Ezra Taylor’s battery of Chicago Light Artillery, consisting of four 6-pounder guns, two 12-pounder howitzers, and 114 men; the total disposable force under my command being 2,072 rank and file, all Illinois volunteers.
Having embarked on the steamer Scott with the Thirtieth and Thirty-first Begiments, on the evening of the 6th instant I left Cairo at 5 o’clock,

and proceeded down the Mississippi to the foot of Island Ho. 1, and lay to for the night on the Kentucky shore, 11 miles above Columbus, as previously instructed by you. Posting a stroug guard for the protection of the boat and those that followed to the same point, I remained until 7 o’clock the following morning. At that hour, preceded by the gunboats Tyler and Lexington, and followed by the remainder of the transports, I proceeded down the river to the designated landing, on the Missouri shore, about 2J miles, in a direct line from Columbus and Belmont.
By 8.30 o’clock the rest of the transports had arrived, and the whole force was disembarked, and marching beyond a collection of corn fields in front of the landing, was formed for an advance movement, and awaited your order. I ordered Dollins’ and Delano’s cavalry to scour the woods along the road to Belmont, and report to me from time to time. The remainder of my command followed the cavalry, the Twenty-seventh in front, the Thirtieth next, supported by a section of Taylor’s battery; the Thirty-first and the remainder of Taylor’s battery next; succeeded by the Seventh Iowa, Colonel Lauman, and the Twenty-second Illinois, Colonel Dougherty, who had been assigned by you to that portion of the command. When the rear of the column had reached a road intersecting our line of march, about miles from the abatis surrounding the enemy’s camp, the line of battle was formed on ground which I had previously selected; the Twenty-seventh on the right and the Thirtieth on its left, forming the right wing; a section of Taylor’s battery was disposed on the left of the Thirtieth and 200 feet in rear of the line; Thirty-first formed the center, the Seventh and Twenty-second forming the left wing, masking two sections of artillery.
By this time Dollins’ cavalry was skirmishing sharply with the enemy’s pickets to the right and in advance of our line, the enemy in the mean time having shifted the heavy fire of his batteries at Columbus from our gunboats to our advancing line, but without serious effect. With your permission I now ordered two companies from each regiment of my command to advance, instructing them to seek out and develop the position of the enemy, the Twenty-second and Seventh pushing forward similar parties at the same time. A sharp firing having immediately commenced between the skirmishing parties of the Thirtieth and Thirty-first ‘and the enemy, I ordered forward another party to their support, rode forward, selected a new position, and ordered up the balance of my command, the Twenty-seventh, to pass around the head of a pond, the Thirtieth and Thirty-first with the artillery crossing the dry bed of the same pond in their front. On their arrival I reformed the line of battle in the same order as before, expecting that the Seventh and Twenty-second would resume their former position on the left wing. This disposition would have perfected a line sufficient to inclose the enemy’s camp on all sides accessible to us, thus enabling us to command the river above and below him, and to prevent the crossing of re-enforcements from Columbus, insuring his capture as well as defeat.
The Thirtieth and Thirty-first and the artillery moving forward promptly relieved the skirmishing parties, and soon became engaged with a heavy body of the enemy’s infantry and cavalry. This struggle, which was continued for half an hour with great obstinacy, threw our ranks into temporary disorder, but the men promptly rallied under the gallant example of Colonels Fouke and Logan, assisted by Major Bray-man, acting assistant adjutant-general of my brigade; also by Captain Schwartz, acting chief of artillery, Captain Dresser, of the artillery, Lieutenant Babcock, of the Second Cavalry, and Lieutenant Eddy, of

the Twenty-ninth Illinois Regiment, who had, upon my invitation, kindly joined my staff. Our men pressed vigorously upon the enemy and drove him back, his cavalry leaving that part of the field and not appearing again until attacked by Captain Dollins on the river bank below his encampment some time after and chased out of sight. Advancing about a quarter of a mile farther, this force again came up with the enemy, who by this time had been re-enforced in this part of the field, as I since learn, by three regiments and a company of cavalry. Thus strengthened, he attempted to turn our left flank, but ordering Colonel Logan to extend the line of battle by a flank movement, and bringing up a section of Taylor’s battery, commanded by First Lieut. P. H. White, under the direction of Captain Schwartz, to cover the space thus left between the Thirtieth and Thirty-first, the attempt was frustrated.
Having completed this disposition, we again opened a deadly fire from both infantry and artillery, and after a desperate resistance drove the enemy back the third time, forcing him to seek cover among thick woods and brush, protected by the heavy guns at Columbus. In this struggle, while leading the charge, I received a ball in one of my holsters, which failed of harm by striking a pistol. Here Colonels Fouke and Logan urged on their men by the most energetic appeals. Here Captain Dresser’s horse was shot under him, while Captain Schwartz’s horse was twice wounded. Here the projectiles from the enemy’s heavy guns at Columbus, and their artillery at Belmont, crashed through the woods over and among us. Here, again, all my staff who were with me displayed the greatest intrepidity and activity, and here, too, many of our officers and privates were killed or wounded.. Nor should I omit to add that this gallant conduct was stimulated by your presence and inspired by your example. Here your horse was shot under you.
While this struggle was going on, a tremendous fire from the Twenty-seventh, which had, under the skillful guidance of Colonel Buford, approached the abatis on the right and rear of the tents, was heard. About the same time the Seventh and Twenty-second, which had passed the rear of the Thirtieth and Thirty-first, hastened up, and closing the space between them and the Twenty-seventh, poured a deadly fire upon the enemy. A combined movement was now made upon three sides of the enemy’s defenses, and driving him across them, we followed upon his heels into the clear space around his camp. The Twenty-seventh . was the first seen by me entering upon this ground. I called the attention of the other regiments to the fact, and the whole line was quickened with eager and impatient emulation. In a few minutes our entire force was within the inclosure. Under the skillful direction of Captain Schwartz, Captain Taylor now brought up his battery within 300 yards of the enemy’s tents, and opened fire upon them. The enemy fled with precipitation from the tents, and took shelter behind some buildings near the river and into the woods above the camp, under cover of his batteries at Columbus. Near this battery I met Colonel Dougherty, who was leading the Seventh and Twenty-second through the open space towards the tents. At the same time our lines upon the right and left were pressing up to the line of fire from our battery, which now ceased firing, and our men rushed forward among the tents and towards some buildings near the river.
Passing over to the right of the camp, I met with Colonel Buford for the first time since his arduous and perilous detour around the pond, and congratulated him upon the eagerness of his men to be the first to pass the enemy’s works. During the execution of this movement Capt. Alexander Bielaski, one of my aides-de-camp, who had accompanied

Colonel Buford during the march of the Twenty-sever al separate from the main command, having dismounted from his hors \ which had been several times wounded, was shot down while advancing with the flag of his adopted country in his hand, and calling on the men in his rear to follow him. His bravery was only equaled by his fidelity as a soldier and patriot. He died, making the Stars and Stripes his winding-sheet. Honored be his memory! Near him, and a few minutes afterwards, Colonel Lauman fell, severely wounded in the thigh, while leading his men in a daring charge. About the same time Capt. William A. Schmitt, of the Twenty-seventh, was also wounded while striving for the advance. Galloping my horse down to the river, I found Captain Bozarth, of Company K, Twenty-seventh Begiment, supported by squads of men who had joined him, sharply engaged with a detachment of the enemy, whom he drove into the woods above the camp. Here the firing was very hot. My own head was grazed by a ball ; my horse was wounded in the shoulders, and his caparison torn in several places. Here, too, one of the enemy’s caissons fell into my hands, and a capture of artillery was made by Captain Schwartz, a portion of the Seventh Iowa gallantly assisting in achieving this result.
Having complete possession of the enemy’s camp, in full view of his formidable batteries at Columbus, I gave the word for u Three cheers for the Union,’* to which the brave men around me responded with the most enthusiastic applause. Several of the enemy’s steamers being within range above and below, I ordered a section of Taylor’s battery, under the direction of Captain Schwartz, down near the river, and opened a fire upon them,, and upon Columbus itself, but with what effect I could not learn. The enemy’s tents were set on fire, destroying his camp equipage, about 4,000 blankets, and all his means of transportation. Such horses and other property as could be removed were seized, and four pieces of his artillery and one caisson were brought to the rear.
The enemy at Columbus, seeing us in possession of his camp, directed upon us the fire of his heavy guns, but, ranging too high, inflicted no injury. Information came at the same time of the crossing of heavy bodies of troops above us, amounting, as I since learn, to five regiments, which, joining those which had fled in that direction, formed rapidly in our rear, with the design of cutting off our communication with our transports. To prevent this, and having fully accomplished the object of the expedition, I ordered Captain Taylor to reverse his guns and open fire upon the enemy in his new position, which was done with great spirit and effect, breaking his line and opening our way to the main road.
Promptly responding to an order to that effect, Colonel Logan ordered his flag in front of his regiment, prepared to force his way in the same direction, if necessary. Moving on, he was followed by the whole force except the Twenty-seventh and the cavalry companies of Captains Dollins and Delano. Determined to preserve my command unbroken, and to defeat the evident design of the enemy to divide it, I twice rode back across the field to bring up the Twenty-seventh and Dollins’ cavalry, and also dispatched Major Brayman for the same purpose, but without accomplishing the object, they having sought in returning the same route by which they .advanced in the morning.
On passing into the woods, the Thirtieth, the Seventh, and Twenty-second encountered a heavy fire on their right and left successively, which was returned with such vigor and effect as to drive back the superior force of the enemy and silence his firing, but not until the Sev-

enth and Twenty-second liad been thrown into temporary disorder. Here Lieutenant-Colonel Wentz, of the Seventh, a gallant and faithful officer, and Captain Marckley, of the Thirtieth, with several privates, were killed, and Colonel Dougherty, of the Twenty-second, and Major McClurken, of the Thirtieth, who was near me, seriously wounded. Here my body servant killed one of the enemy by a pistol-shot.
Driving the enemy back on either side, we moved on, occasionally exchanging shots with straggling parties, in the course of which my horse received another ball, being one of two fired at me from the corner of the field. Captain Schwartz was at my right when these shots were fired. At this stage of the contest, according to the admission of rebel officers, the enemy’s forces had been swelled by frequent re-enforcements from the other side to be over thirteen regiments of infantry and something less than two squadrons of cavalry, excluding his artillery—four pieces of which were in our possession—two of which, after being spiked, together with part of one our own caissons, were left on the way for want of animals to bring them off. The other two, with their horses and harness, were brought off.
On reaching the landing, and not finding the detachments of the Seventh and Twenty-second, which you had left behind in the morning to guard the boats, I ordered Delano’s cavalry, which was embarking, to the rear of the fields, to watch the enemy. Within an hour all our forces which had arrived were embarked, Captain Schwartz, Captain Hatch, assistant quartermaster, and myself being the last to get on board. Suddenly the enemy in strong force, whose approach had been discovered by Lieut. Col. John H. White, of the Thirty-first, who had been conspicuous through the day for his dauntless courage and conduct, came within range of our musketry, when a terrible fire was opened upon him by the gunboats, as well as by Taylor’s battery and the infantry from the decks of the transports.
The engagement thus renewed was kept up with great spirit and with deadly effect upon the enemy until the transports had passed beyond his reach. Exposed to the terrible fire of the gunboats and Taylor’s battery, a great number of the enemy were killed and wounded in this the closing scene of a battle of six hours’ duration.
The Twenty-seventh and Dollins cavalry being yet behind, I ordered my transport to continue in the rear of the fleet, excepting the gunboats, and after proceeding a short distance landed, and directed the gunboats to return and await their appearance. At this moment Lieut. H. A. Bust, adjutant of the Twenty-seventh, a brave and enterprising officer, hastened up and announced the approach of the Twenty-seventh and Dollins’ cavalry. Accompanied by Captains Schwartz and Hatch I rode down the river bank, and met Colonel Buford with a part of his command. Informing him that my transport was waiting to receive him, I went farther down the river and met Captain Dollins, whom I also instructed to embark, and still farther down met the remainder of the Twenty-seventh, which had halted on the bank where the gunboat Tyler was lying to, the Lexington lying still farther down. The rest of the boats having gone forward, Captain Walke, of the Tyler, at my request, promptly took the remainder of the Twenty-seventh on board, Captain Stembel, of the Lexington, covering the embarkation.
Having thus embarked all my command, I returned with Captains Schwartz and Hatch to my transport and re-embarked, reaching Cairo about midnight, after a day of almost unceasing marching and conflict.
I cannot bestow too high commendation upon all whom 1^ had the honor to command on that day. Supplied with inferior and defective

arms, many of which could not be discharged, and others bursting in use, they fought an enemy in woods with which he was familiar, behind defensive works which he had been preparing for months, in the face of a battery at Belmont and under his heavy guns at Columbus, and, although numbering three or four to our one, beat him, capturing several stand of his colors, destroying his camp, and carrying off a large amount of property already mentioned. From his own semi official accounts, his loss was 600 killed, wounded, and missing, including among the killed and wounded a number of officers, and probably among the missing 155 prisoners, who were brought to this post.
To mention all who did well would include every man in my command who came under my personal notice. Both officers and privates did their whole duty, nobly sustaining the enviable character of Americans and Illinoisans. They shed new luster upon the flag of their country by upholding it in triumph amid the shock of battle and the din of arms. The blood they so freely poured out proved their devotion to their country, and serves to hallow a just cause with glorious recollections. Their success was that of citizen soldiers.
Major Brayman, Captains Schwartz and Dresser, and Lieutenants Eddy and Babcock, all members of my staff, are entitled to my gratitude for the zeal and alacrity with which they bore my orders in the face of danger and discharged all their duties in the field. Colonels Buford, Fouke, and Logan repeatedly led their regiments to the charge, and as often drove the enemy back in confusion, thus inspiring their men with kindred ardor and largely contributing to the success of the day. Colonel Logan’s admirable tactics not only foiled the frequent attempts of the enemy to flank him, but secured a steady advance towards the enemy’s camp. Colonel Fouke and his command, exposed throughout to a galling fire from the enemy, never ceased to press forward. His march was marked by the killed and wounded of the foe, mingled with many of his own men. Accomplishing a difficult circuit, Colonel Buford, active, eager, and emulous, was the first to throw his men within the enemy’s defenses. Captain Taylor and Lieutenant White managed the battery attached to my cotnmand with admirable skill and most successful effect. Capt. J. J. Dollins, with his company of cavalry, displayed unsurpassed activity and daring. Having been early detached from his regiment (the Thirty-first), he found his way, in company with the Twenty-seventh, to the enemy’s camp on the lower side, charging his line with an impetuosity characteristic of himself and his brave followers.
Our victory, though signal and extraordinary, cost many valuable lives.
Of the Twenty-seventh, 11 were killed, 42 wounded, and 28 are missing. Among the wounded was Captain Schmitt, already honorably mentioned, and Lieut. William Shipley, of Company A, a gallant and promising young officer, who has since died.
Of the Thirtieth, 9 were killed, 27 wounded, and 8 are missing. Among the killed is Capt. Thomas G. Marckley, of Company D, a brave and Viiluable officer, who died true to his trust.
Maj. Thomas McOlurken, an accomplished and efficient officer, whose services were conspicuous on the field, was severely, and I fear mortally, wounded.	>
Of the Thirty-first, 10 were killed, 61 wounded, and 4 are missing. Capt. John W. Bigby, of Company F, a veteran and faithful officer, being among the wounded ; also Capts. William A. Looney, of Company

0, and Alexander S. Somerville, of Company K, both bold and exemplary officers.
Of Hollins’ cavalry, 1 was killed and 2 wounded.
Of Taylor’s battery of light artillery, 5 were wounded; among whom was First Sergt. Charles W. Everett.
In closing this report, unavoidably somewhat imperfect, I cannot refrain from bearing testimony to the gallantry and good conduct of every arm of your whole force. Each did well; and, rejoicing in it, I cannot but sympathize in the just pride with which their valor has inspired you as their victorious commander.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Report of Col. Napoleon B. Buford, Twenty-seventh Illinois Infantry.
Hdqrs. Twenty-seventh Reg’t III. Yols.,
Cairo, November 9, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report the part which my regiment took in the battle of Belmont on the 7th instant. The regiment, numbering 720 rank and file, were on board the steamer Montgomery at 4 o’clock p. m. of the 6th instant, which landed on the Kentucky shore at foot of Island No. 1 to await the following daybreak, at which time we steamed down the river to a point on the Missouri shore, in full view of the batteries at Columbus, Ky., and at 7 o’clock a. m. I landed the regiment, and took up the position assigned me by yourself on the right of the First Brigade, which was parallel to a bayou, which was in some places dry and in others impassable, and directly opposite one of the roads to Belmont, at the distance of 1J miles from the enemy’s camp. I immediately advanced the first platoon of Company A, under thfc command of Captain Schmitt and Lieutenant Shipley, across the bayou into the woods, to ascertain the nature of the ground and discover the position of the enemy, whose drums were distinctly heard. The detachment had advanced only 100 yards before they were fired upon by a body of cavalry, which they repulsed. As soon as fhe firing was heard 1 advanced the remainder of Schmitt’s company, and supported them with the whole regiment, which I caused to cross the bayou. Schmitt’s company, having advanced about 200 yards farther, were again fired upon by a larger body of cavalry, wounding one of his men, which he gallantly repulsed a second time. At this time, by your orders, Colonel Fouke brought up his regiment to my support, which he quickly formed on my left, and sent out two of his companies as skirmishers. It was here that you found me in advance of the place assigned me, and as the artillery and the other regiments, not of your brigade, had not yet come up, by your orders I moved back to the right of my first position, with Fouke’s and Logan’s regiments all formed in line of battle.
While waiting for the arrival of Taylor’s battery, my regiment was advanced half a mile to the right, and companies A and B sent forward under the command of Captain Schmitt, with orders to feel the enemy and engage him if found in that direction. Taylor’s battery having arrived, the whole attacking force, with the exception of my regiment, moved forward on the direct road to Belmont, and the engagement

became warm, you leading your brigade. From the information I received I became assured that the road I was on led to the rear of Belmont, and that by following it rapidly I would get into action at the right time and in the right place.
Guided by the sound of the fierce battle in which you were all the time engaged, I moved forward. At my request you had detached Captain Bielaski, one of your aides, to attend me, who rode with me at the head of the regiment. As we pressed forward in the woods, Captain Dollins, with his cavalry, appeared on my left, and obeyed my orders with alacrity to go forward and discover the enemy.
Our road soon led to a full view of the river and Wolf's Island, below Belmont, where we met straggling soldiers retreating, of whom we captured several, Captain Parke securing the first one. The troops became animated and quickened their step, and came in sight of the camp, which was defended with an almost impassable abatis of huge sycamore trees.
I here formed our line of battle, the right opposite the abatis, the left in the open space in full view of Columbus, and under the fire of the field artillery in Belmont and the enemy's guns on the opposite side of the river. As we approached by the right flank, before the line could be formed at right angles we received a heavy fire of muskery, which killed and wounded some of my men. While forming under fire the gallant Captain Bielaski, on his charger, was seen animating the men and assisting in forming the line. His heroic bearing was observed by us all. After having his horse shot under him he seized a flag, and, advancing with shouts, he fell mortally wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel Harrington and Adjutant Rust were near me on the right, leading bravely forward, while Major Wilson was doing the same on the left. The nature of the ground, the obstacles, and the heavy cannonading which was reaching us caused each comj)any to take up the best position it could, and all kept up a constant fire, which soon drove the enemy from his camp. Here we lost about 9 killed and 30 wounded.
My next order was to advance over the abatis on the right and across the plain on the left, and occupy the camp over which the enemy's flag •still waved. The order was obeyed on the double-quick, and the camp entered simultaneously by companies A, Captain Schmitt, and G, Captain Southward, and others in such quick succession that I could not distinguish which went forward with most alacrity. Captain Schmitt, with part of his company, and Lieutenant Lytle, with part of Southward's company, were the first to reach the flag, which was torn down by their joint efforts, and it remained in the hands of Lieutenant Lytle, who brought it away, a trophy well earned by the intrepidity he displayed during the whole day. As we advanced to make this attack the u Star-Spangled Banner," borne by Fouke's, Logan's, and other of the regiments engaged, was seen steadily advancing on our left $ Taylor's battery was brought forward and opened fire, the enemy's artillery was captured, and we had possession of Belmont.
While these deeds were being enacted you rode into our midst, and it was by your order that my regiment fired the camp. We had taken about 70 prisoners and many muskets, pistols, horses, and trophies. I placed the prisoners under charge of Captain Schmitt, who was wounded in the enemy's camp, and he and Captain Miles, with other prisoners he had captured, began to return to the boats. Shot and shell from Columbus made it necessary that my regiment should now fall back behind the abatis and into the woods. The victory appeared won. We commenced retiring to our boats, but soon a new attack, made by fresh troops, who had been landed from Columbus in the woods, intercepted
t

our march. We returned their fire by a part of our regiment, and sought to find a new route to return. Covered by the woods, and guided by the descending sun, I led the regiment northward until I reached the bayou we had inarched around in the morning to outflank the enemy, and recognizing the position, went confidently around it and got within 1 mile of the starting-point of the morning, but was admonished to take a northerly direction by the continued sound of musketry between us and where our boats were left in the morning and by the heavy cannonading from our own gunboats. We marched northward in rear of the farms on Lucas Bend, a distance of about 3 miles, before returning to the river near sunset, exposed during the whole march to the shot and shell of our own gunboats, which happily did us no injury.
On reaching the river the fleet of gunboats and steamboats were all far in advance, steaming towards Cairo. We marched forward, greatly fatigued, with the prospect of a long night’s march. Our wounded men were limping along, and all our horses were surrendered to them. The sun was setting. I met a settler, who had a frank, honest face, from whom I borrowed his horse, and mounted Adjutant Rust upon him to gallop forward, and if possible reach the steamer which was nearest us. The steamer was seen to be halting, floating back to Beckwith’s Landing. The adjutant reached the steamer Chancellor, hailed, and was answered by General McClernand that he was halting with the steamer and the two gunboats to take all on board. We soon met you on the shore, happy in knowing you had bravely led the brigade and continued unwearied in securing its safety.
And now how shall I distinguish those of my own command who did nobly? It was our first action. We encountered great odds; the enemy in his fortified position, the thunder of the heavy artillery from Columbus, the whizzing of rifled cannon ; wre had no guides. How could soldiers who had only volunteered a few days ago be expected to brave such odds ? But they did brave them. My thanks are due to Lieutenant-Colonel Harrington, to Major Wilson, and to Adjutant Rust, who nobly assisted in forming the line under the fire and rallying the troops and in covering the retreat; also to Captains Schmitt, Parke, Moore, Miles, Southward, Brooks, Merrill, and Bozarth, and all the officers under their command ; also to Sergeant Jansen, of Company A, and Fourth Sergeant McCormick, of Company B, whom I observed nobly doing their duty. Surg. E. H. Bowman was at his post, dressed the first wounded man, and was the last to leave his post. Happy am I that he is safe. Assistant Surgeon Barrell remained at home by my order to take care of the sick, but obeyed reluctantly. Quartermaster Sears solicited me to accompany the expedition, but as we took no train, I left him in command of the camp at home. Chaplain Rev. Hr. S. Y. McMasters aeconpmnied the expedition, and was unwearied in consoling and dressing the wounded.
We lost 11 killed, 42 wounded, 28 missing, and 14 known to be prisoners. Among the mortally wounded was Lieut. William Shipley, of Company A, from Quincy, a young man of rare merits. He had for some time been unwell, and was by me directed to remain in camp; but when the column marched he was at his post, radiant with smiles, and was in the battle from first to last, receiving his wound on the retreat within a mile of the boats.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Report of Col. Philip B. Fouke, Thirtieth Illinois Infantry.
Headquarters Thirtieth Regiment III. Vols.,
Gamp Me demand, November 9, 1861.
Dear Sir: I received your order to have my Thirtieth Regiment ready to march at a moment’s warning at 11 o’clock p. m., 6th instant. I remained in camp in readiness until your second order was received to embark at 4 o’clock, which was done promptly at the hour named. After landing in Missouri I placed my regiment in the position you directed, and marched forward, with Colonel Logan on my left, and did not march far when the enemy opened upon my command, with infantry in front, and a battery of artillery obliquely raking my lines. We maintained our position steadily for thirty minutes, then moved forward slowly, driving the enemy before us. When I arrived at the corn' field, or open space in front, I found Colonel Dougherty, Twenty-second Illinois Regiment, on my right. The batteries of the enemy there were abandoned. The enemy’s artillery and infantry retreated before us across the field, and took position in a ravine surrounded by, fallen timber in front of their camp. Here I met with Colonel Dougherty. He charged to the right and I moved forward to the ravine, forming in forty paces of the enemy, concealed in fallen timber, and drove him from his position. At that time our artillery came up on my right. I poured a heavy fire into the retreating enemy under your immediate direction, about the same time following up to the cover he had partially abandoned. Colonel Logan’s Thirty-first Regiment came up from the left, and the two regiments charged into the enemy’s camp together.
After the defeat of the enemy at the camp I caused my colors (then riddled with balls) to be planted, my drums to beat, and rallied my regiment in position at the point where we were first attacked by the re-enforcement of the enemy. 1 believe I received the first fire. I lost there 1 lieutenant and 2 privates killed, and several wounded. I was then ordered by you to press forward and cut our way through and protect our batteries. I placed my men, a part in front and a part in rear of the batteries, and protected them to the boat, sometimes lifting them by main force over logs and ravines. As I entered the woods I received a galling fire from the enemy oil the left. I returned three volleys, and as soon as I could disengage one of the guns of our battery which the horses were too much exhausted to pull over some logs in a ravine, I marched forward. It was then that Captain Marckley was killed. He fell dead at my feet, gallantly urging his men to stand by and protect the batteries. I there lost 3 or 4 privates killed and wounded.
When we arrived at the corn field after the first attack in the woods we were again assailed. It was there that 12 or 15 of the Seventh Iowa Regiment fell. They had been separated from their command early in the action, and had been fighting by my side in my regiment during the day, and I must add that they obeyed all my commands cheerfully, and fought gallantly during the whole of the engagement. Major McClurken here fell like a true soldier, in front of the ranks. After passing through the corn field we received one volley on the left of my regiment from the retiring enemy, which wounded 2 of my men. That was the last of the engagement until we got to the boats. My regiment came to the boats in order, bringing off quite a number of the wounded.

I cannot speak too highly of the bravery and gallantry of my command. Three balls entered my saddle. The crupper of my saddle was cut in two by a ball. I had two horses wounded whilst on them. I have a black-silk flag with a scarlet fringe, taken by my regiment during the fight. It belonged to a Tennessee regiment. I took a whole company of Tennesseeans, but they all got away in the last engagement except 28. Those I delivered up at headquarters on my return to Cairo. My total loss of officers and men, including killed, wounded, and missing, amounts to 81.# One-fourth of the guns used by my regiment in the battle either exploded or were rendered useless before the battle was half over.
Your obedient servant,
Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand.

Report of Col. John A. Logan, Thirty-first Illinois Infantry.
Camp McClernand, November 11,1861.
Sir : In pursuance of Special Orders, Ho. 97,1 prepared as many of my command as were in condition to march that were supplied with arms, the whole number being 610 infantry, and 70 cavalry, commanded by Captain Dollins. I proceeded at 1 o’clock on the 6th instant to the steamer Aleck Scott, and then embarked, in connection with Colonel Fouke’s regiment. We proceeded that night 11 miles below Cairo, and remained at the Kentucky shore till morning, when we proceeded with other boats, under command of Brigadier-Generals McClernand and Grant, landing at a farm some 3£ miles above Belmont, in Missouri, opposite Columbus, Ky. We then, in connection with other commands, proceeded to a large farm some 2 miles in rear of Belmont, and formed line of battle under orders. My command was placed on the left, Colonel Fouke to my right, the Seventh Iowa on his right, and Colonel Buford on the extreme right, headed by Captain Dollins’ cavalry, of my command. I was ordered to throw out two companies of skirmishers, which I did—Captain Bees’ company, A, and Captain Somerville,’ Company K, under command of Lieut. Col. J. H. White, of my command. They advanced on double-quick some half mile. Having discovered the enemy, formed line of battle, Company A on the right and K on the left, on the east side of a small field, and there received a fire from the enemy, which was returned, where Company A lost one man killed and several wounded, and Colonel White had several holes shot through his coat, being in advance of his command. The two companies were ordered to advance, which they did, and the fight became general, when Captain Somerville (Company K) was wounded and compelled to retire, First Lieut. H. T. Snyder immediately taking command of Company K. I then ordered up Company I, of my command, under Captain McCook, to support the skirmishers, who formed on the center of Companies A and K, where the ground was hotly contested. I was then ordered to support the three companies with the remainder of my command. I immediately advanced through thick woods to a second

field from where the first engagement took place. I ordered Companies I and K to form on the left and Company A on the right of my command. I then gave Colonel White command of the left wing, and he performed his part of the work nobly. The enemy opened a heavy fire on my whole line from behind a depression that had been made at some time by the river. Several of my men were then wounded and two killed. We returned the fire, and advanced some distance, perhaps fifty paces, where we took cover from trees, logs, and underbrush. Then we opened a fire on the enemy, which was returned. Captain Looney and Captain Rigby were then wounded while fighting gallantly by their men. I ordered the men to lie down. Many of them did so, letting their returned fire pass over the line. The enemy soon gave way, and retreated some hundred yards. I was then ordered to cease firing by General Grant until the enemy’s position could be ascertained. We now formed in as good a line as we eould in the timber and brush, when the enemy again opened on my line a deadly fire, killing several of my men and wounding some twenty.
The engagement then lasted for some length of time, and was really terrific. At one time then I thought they were outflanking us. I extended my line a little more to the left, in the direction of the river. The engagement was continued at the distance of 300 yards, we advancing and they gradually receding. About this time an order was given by General MeClernand to advance along the line. I then ordered my whole command to charge the enemy. This charge was made with a will and a yell that sent the enemy in confusion to their boats, many of them falling on the way. In this charge, sir, I must be permitted to say that the officers and men maintained as good a line and executed the commands as well as could have been done by veteran troops. We drove the enemy from us until they disappeared under cover of fallen timber, protecting their retreat to their boats. I then moved by the right flank until we came to the open field in front of the camp at Belmont, then connecting with Colonel Fouke’s command, who were formed in a depression on the right of the fallen timber in front of the encampment. A captain of the Iowa Seventh fought bravely with me during most of the engagement, he being detached from his command.
I then formed a line of battle on a high piece of ground overlooking the camp. I saw Colonel Buford’s men down by the fallen timber down the river from the camp. . I rode down to Colonel Fouke, and told him that we must charge the camp. He said that he would make the charge in connection with me. At this time I saw Captain Bie-laski take the American flag and start with it, supported by Company A, Captain Bees’ company, and two companies of the Seventh Iowa, who had gone through in advance of my regiment all the way in skirmish fight. Captain Bielaski was then killed while planting the flag of our Union in their encampment. A braver man never fell on a field of battle. I then gave command to my regiment to follow me, and they did so with a yell and a will, Colonel Fouke’s regiment forming the left in the charge. In this charge I saw General MeClernand, with hat in hand, leading as gallant a charge as ever was made by any troops unskilled in the arts of war. In this charge on the enemy I observed Captain Brooks’, Captain Parke’s, and a portion of another company of Colonel Buford’s regiment doing gallant service. Then the battle was hot, but for a moment. The enemy fled, and the day was ours. The flag of the enemy was cut down by E. D. Winters, of Company A, Thirty-first Regiment. In cutting it down he was wounded, as I am

informed by the whole company. When Winters was wounded the flag was torn off by a man in Colonel Buford’s regiment and retained, while the party who claimed to have done so, and have retained the flag, were at all times protected in every movement ^y the advance of my cavalry company, who were detached from my command, and had led Colonel Buford through the woods to the battle-field. I must here mention that Captain Rees’ company (A), of the Thirty-first Regiment, while detached as skirmishers, went through to the camp of the enemy in front of one of the guns of the enemy, and took and spiked the gun, suffering very much in doing so, having some 12 men badly wounded and 1 killed.
After we had taken the camp and burned it with the valuables, the enemy carried above us a very large force, and was attempting to surround us. I asked some of the battery men with us to bring up a gun and fire on them, as they were firing in the field in the rear of us. They did not do so at once. General McClernand ordered me to detail a company to run the battery on the elevation. I did so detail Captain McCook’s company. They ran up a gun, and it was fired twice. A portion of my regiment then opened a fire on them, and they retreated. I being the extreme left all day, I supposed that the command of the regiment on the right would*naturally take the position on the right again, though I observed at the time a deployment in the woods on the left down the river and out straight from the camp. I got my men in line poorly, but as best I could, to make a stand. At that time General McClernand, who was by my side, seeing the enemy reforming in the woods between us and our boats, ordered me to take my regiment and cut their way through them. I must confess that I thought it a pretty hard task, though I felt complimented in getting the job, inasmuch as I was outranked by every colonel on the field. I took my flag, and told Captain McCook to carry it to the head of the column, and die with it in his hands. I gave the order then for the Thirty-first Regiment, and as many more of others as desired, to follow the flag and myself. They did it with a steady and firm step. As we advanced I ordered Lieutenant Pulley, who was acting adjutant on the field, to go to the head of the column and lead, which he did. The enemy gave way before us without firing a gun until we approached the field, some mile up the . river. Then they fired on us. We halted, and returned the fire. The enemy retreated, and I saw them no more until they showed themselves in the field after we had gone aboard of the steamboat Aleck Scott. They then fired a few rounds, but the gunboats soon cleared the coast. My command brought away — prisoners, who have been placed at the disposal of the general in command. Many of the guns of my command choked and burst while in battle, though the boys soon had better ones in their hands. Many of my command lost their blankets • and overcoats on the field by pulling them off and throwing them down to give them fair play in the use of their fire-arms. Some few horses were captured, and many things of small value—papers, books, &c.*

Report of Capt. Ezra Taylor, Battery B, First Illinois Light Artillery.
Camp Lyon, Mo., November 8, 1861.
Sir : I have to report the following casualties, &c., during the expedition and fight which occurred at Belmont yesterday:
Three men seriously wounded: First Sergt. Charles W. Everett, musket-shot in the head ; Sergt. David F. Chase, shot in the arm; Private George Q. White, lost right hand and badly wounded in the face.
Slightly wounded: Privates C. R. Yan Horn and William De Wolfe.
Horses lost: 3 shot on the field,
Horses wounded: 2 in the legs; several others slightly wounded.
Left on the field: 2 caissons, 1 baggage wagon, 2 sets artillery lead harness, 1,000 ball cartridge for Colt’s revolvers, 200 rounds ammunition for 6-pounder guns, 25 double blankets, 20 canteens, 5 coats, 3 caps, 5 Colt’s revolvers, 5 horse-blankets, 6 sabers, 5 lanterns, 3 shovels, 1 overcoat, 2 currycombs and brushes, 2 fuse-gouges, 60 friction-primers, 2 camp-kettles, 20 cups, 1 leg guard, 1 sponge and rammer, 6 whips, 20 haversacks, 2 pick-axes, 4 felling-axes, 1 trail handspike.
Captured from the enemy: 20 horses, 1 mule, 1 6-pounder brass gun, 1 12-pounder brass howitzer, and some fragments of artillery harness, and sundry small articles captured by individuals, not of any particular value to the service.
My force consisted of four 6-pounder field guns, two 12-pounder howitzers, with%gun limbers and caissons complete, 81 horses and 14 mules, 1,000 rounds ammunition for guns and howitzers, 1,000 pistol cartridges, 114 men, with rations and forage for two days. Number of rounds fired on the field, 400; number lost, 200: number brought off the field, 400.
I have to regret the loss of my caissons and baggage wagon, but trust that the Government is amply repaid in the capture of two guns from the enemy. I am highly gratified to be able to report that the officers and men under my command conducted themselves in a manner to deserve my highest commendation and praise as soldiers. I take pleasure in mentioning in particular Lieut. P. H. White and the men under his imme.diate command for the bravery displayed in driving the enemy from his position, silencing his battery, and, under a galling fire from his infantry, capturing two of his guns; and although the result of the battle is anything but satisfactory to me, yet I cannot forbear to say that, considering the ground fought over and the extreme difficulty experienced in handling artillery in the woods, I am satisfied that no men could have effected more under the circumstances.
Your obedient servant,
EZRA TAYLOR,
Captain Light Battery R, First Illinois Artillery.

Report of Col. Henry 'Dougherty, Twenty-second Illinois Infantry, commanding Second Brigade. *
Headquarters Twenty-second Illinois Vols.,
Gamp Lyon, December —, 1861.
In pursuance to your order issued on the 6th of November, I embarked the Twenty-second Illinois Volunteers, numbering 562 men rank and file, with two days’ rations, on board the transport Belle Memphis. Everything being on board the steamer, we moved out into the stream, and after a short trip laid to on the Kentucky shore, near the head of Island No. 1, where we remained through the night in company with other transports from Cairo and Bird’s Point, aboard of which were troops comprising the Seventh Iowa, commanded by Colonel Lauman; Twenty-seventh Illinois, Colonel Buford; Thirtieth Illinois, Colonel Fouke; Thirty-first Illinois, Colonel Logan; also Captain Taylor’s battery of light artillery, together with a small force of cavalry.
The gunboats Lexington and Tyler accompanying us, which took position in the stream, were anchored below the transports. Our officers and men, being comfortably provided for, soon retired for the night, impressed with the probability of realizing their most ardent wishes; for by this time all on board were fully impressed with the opinion that we were bound for Belmont, which the sequel proved to be true.
Having received orders from you during the night through the hands of Assistant Adjutant-General Bawlins, I ascertained that you had placed me in command of the Second Brigade. I immediately transferred the command of the Twenty-second Illinois to Lieut. Col. H. E. Hart, who in accepting it remarked that he felt satisfied that the officers and men would do their duty, which I am proud to say they did to my and I hope to your entire satisfaction.
Early on the morning of the 7th the transports, preceded by the gunboats, moved down the river until within sight of the rebel forces on the summit of the Iron Banks immediately above Columbus, on the Kentucky shore, and, as afterwards proved to be the case, within range of some of the enemy’s batteries of heavy artillery. After the disembarkation of the forces and formation of the Twenty-second Illinois and Seventh Iowa Regiments into line, three companies of the former and two companies of the latter were ordered to remain with the transports, being placed under the command of Captain Detrich, of the Twenty-second Illinois, who was ordered by you to protect the transports and engage any forces of the enemy which might approach them. His report is herewith submitted.
Having passed through a field near where we disembarked and reached the timber, we formed in line of battle, the First Brigade, consisting of the Twenty-seventh, Thirtieth, and Thirty-first Illinois Volunteers, under the command of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, taking the right a little in advance of the Second Brigade, composed of the Twenty-second Illinois and the Seventh Iowa Regiments, under my command, and the whole force under your command in person. As soon as the line of battle was formed the order to advance was received and promptly obeyed. The Twenty-second Illinois and Seventh Iowa advanced for about 500 yards to the margin of a slough, where an order was given to halt and wait for further orders. Here Companies C and B of the Twenty-second Illinois, under the command of Captain Seaton,

and one company of the Seventh Iowa, were deployed as skirmishers, to ascertain and if possible to discover the position of the enemy. Soon the order of advance was again given, and from this point the Second Brigade encountered heavy timber, much of which had been felled by the enemy in order to impede the progress of any attacking force. Regardless of the obstacles thus encountered, the Second Brigade advanced as rapidly as possible for about half a mile, passing over much of the distance at double-quick march.
Hearing firing on the right while the skirmishers of the Second Brigade remained silent on the left, we advanced by a flank movement to the right through almost impenetrable woods, climbing over felled trees and filing around tree-tops in the direction of the firing. Halting a few moments to form a line, we again advanced, and encountered the enemy behind logs and among tree-tops, and at this point the firing commenced on the left, which now seemed to be general along the whole line, the whole force being apparently engaged in action. The enemy for some time obstinately resisted any advance at this point, and a storm of musketry raged along the whole line of the Second Brigade. Shell and shot from the artillery of the enemy along the Iron Banks and the field pieces at Belmont fell thick and fast, and a perfect storm of bullets from his small-arms was here encountered. Many of our brave men were wounded at this point, and some fell to rise no more, sealing their patriotism with their heart’s blood,* but their valor forced the enemy to yield at last, and again the Second Brigade advanced, pressing on over the enemy’s dead and wounded, many of whom implored our men not to murder them, being evidently under the belief of the false and wicked impression £0 industriously sought to be made by many of the leaders of this cursed rebellion that we were barbarians and savages, but instead of murdering them some of our men ministered to their wants and conveyed them to places of safety.
Step by step we drove them until they reached a secondary bank, such as abound through the river bottoms of the West, under which they were protected from our fire, and where they made another desperate stand for about thirty minutes, when our fire became so hot that they retreated precipitately to some open ground near their encampment, covered by a rude abatis of felled timber, strewing the ground as they went with guns, coats, and canteens. Our brave troops followed them with shouts, pouring volley after volley into them. Here the enemy’s movements at this point gave unmistakable evidence of being panic-stricken and defeated, retreating to the river and up the river bank behind the shelter of some brush and timber.
On gaining the open ground near their encampment, opposite to and in. sight of the lower part of Columbus, the relative positions of the different commands for the first time since the commencement of the battle became visible. The Second Brigade, being on the left, had a shorter distance to march in order to reach the enemy than the First, and consequently reached the open ground in front of the enemy’s camp in advance of the right wing. In a few minutes one section of Captain Taylor’s battery of artillery emerged from the timber on the right and took position, when the Seventh Iowa and Twenty-second Illinois fell back and suported the battery, which opened a fire on the retreating rebels and their camp. The battery was well served, and evidently disconcerted the rebels, accelerating their retreat, and spreading consternation amongst them. From that point the Second Brigade advanced with the battery, entered the encampment of the enemy, and captured three pieces of his artillery, one piece being taken possession of by Com-

pany B, Captain Seaton, and one by Company B, Captain McAdams, both of the Twenty-second Illinois, and the third by a part of our forces unknown to me. Two of the pieces were placed in charge of Captain Taylor, who gallantly brought them away from the field, to be used in a better cause in future.
After assisting in the destruction of the rebel camp and property not movable as long as was prudent under the fire of the rebel batteries in and about Columbus, which commanded the whole ground, the order to retire to the transports was received, but not before the rebel flag had been hauled down and the Stars and Stripes, the flag of our fathers, still bright with the glorious memories of the past, was exhibited to their view. After it had been displayed and the field music had played our national air within hearing of the rebels the order to retire was received from you, and our weary forces were called from the camp which they had destroyed.
In the mean time the rebels had transported a large force of fresh troops across the river—seven regiments, according to their own statement, contained in a Memphis paper. These were formed in the timber and in some corn fields between their destroyed camp and our transports. On the return the Second Brigade encountered these fresh forces, and at once engaged them and opened a passage through them. At this time the Seventh Iowa was in the rear of the Twenty-second Illinois, and was somewhat confused. All the field officers and many of the company officers of that brave regiment being either killed, wounded, or taken by the enemy, I told the men that as we had fought our way in we could fight our way out again, and ordered them to keep up a steady fire on the left, which they did with a will, notwithstanding their exhaustion, opening the ranks of the enemy and forcing their way through, in order to reach the transports at the same place we had debarked. On reaching the transports, which were safe and in waiting for us, meeting Lieut. Ool. H. E. Hart, who had conducted himself through the entire battle with the coolness and bravery of a soldier, I ordered him to embark the Twenty-second Illinois Begiment on board the Belle Memphis, while I returned to fetch up the rear of the brigade. On my return I found many of the Iowa Seventh considerably scattered. While cheering them up and hurrying them forward I received a small shot in the shoulder and one on the elbow, and shortly afterwards a bail through the ankle. My horse was also shot in several places, who fell with me and soon expired. I found myself unable to travel, and was consequently captured by the rebels, who treated me with respect and kindness.
The loss of the Twenty-second Begiment Illinois Volunteers during the day was 23 killed, 74 wounded, and 37 missing; total loss, 134. Captains Challenor and Abbott were severely wounded and left upon the field, where they were afterwards taken by the enemy. Captain Hubbard was slightly wounded. Lieutenant Adams was severely wounded in the left arm and taken prisoner. Captains Challenor and Abbott and Lieutenant Adams have since been returned, together with all the noncommissioned officers and privates who were wounded. The loss of the Seventh Iowa Begiment during the action was 26 killed, 80 wounded, and 137 missing; total, 243, making the whole loss of the Second Brigade 377. Among them were Colonel Lauman, severely wounded; Lieutenant-Colonel Wentz, killed, together with most of their company officers, who fought gallantly until stricken down by the enemy. This regiment throughout the battle fought like veterans, dealing death to the

rebels wherever they encountered them. Iowa may well feel proud of her sons who fought at Belmont.
Many of the missing—nearly all, in fact—were taken prisoners, but some, of whom there is no certain information, it is feared were killed. I am informed that as soon as the steamer Memphis got out of the fire of the enemy every attention and care were paid to the wounded, of whom there was quite a number on board. Many of the officers were very active in ministering to their wants, and Surgeons Stearns and Woodward attended them, faithfully performing their duties, dressing their wounds, and extracting many balls while under way to Cairo. Lieutenant Hamilton, quartermaster of the Twenty-second Illinois Volunteers, also assisted, and rendered most efficient aid.
I am further informed that only one two-horse wagon belonging to the quartermaster’s department of the Twenty-second Illinois Begiment was left. It contained nothing, but could not be got aboard, because the bank of the river where the Memphis lay was so perpendicular that a road had to be made with shovels, which consumed too much time. All the horses, including those captured from the enemy, were got on board. Many instances of individual heroism and bravery occurred during the day, but where all acted so gallantly it would be unjust to discriminate. The whole force under your command acted like veterans, and you may justly feel proud of the manner in which they conducted themselves on the well-contested battle-field of Belmont.

Report of Capt. John E. Detrich, commanding detachment Twenty-second Illinois and Seventh Iowa Infantry.
Camp Lyon,
Bird's Point, Mo., November 16, 1861.
After the disembarkation of the Union forces above Belmont on the 7th instant two companies from the Seventh Iowa and three companies from the Twenty-second Illinois were placed under my command, with orders to protect the transports. While waiting for the forces which were debarked to advance out some distance from the river, before throwing out pickets I received orders from one of General Grant’s aides to .march the detachment down the river road to a ravine on the point immediately above Belmont, where another road approached the river, with instructions to engage any detachment of the enemy which might attempt to approach that way, and to observe the firing and movements of the enemy as closely as possible, and to act accordingly for the protection of the transports. As soon as possible after reaching the ravine I threw out pickets on each road in the direction of Belmont. The position was well selected, and commanded both roads. Although under some of the enemy’s guns on the Iron Banks, right on the opposite side of the river, Hie ravine so sheltered the detachment under my command that no injury was sustained there—their shot and shell mostly passing over us, only a few striking near, and only one in the ravine at that place.

I observed the firing closely, as ordered, after it commenced on oar side, and soon felt satisfied that the forces under the command of General Grant were forcing the enemy to retire; heard the cheering of the men as they entered the rebel camp, soon after which the firing of small-arms ceased for a while. In the mean time I had heard the noise of steamers a short distance below, and felt satisfied that the rebels were crossing immediately into, Belmont or above it. The two gunboats moved down to the point, and almost under some of the rebel guns, and opened fire upon them $ soon steamed back agaio toward the transports, which had moved a short distance up the river. Lieutenant Montague, of Company H, Twenty-second Regiment Illinois Volunteers, in command of the pickets, I threw out down the river road, captured one of the artillery horses, and came to me and reported that he heard forces moving through the timber below and toward the right, which, with the movements of the gunboat, inclined me to the opinion that the enemy was moving up through the timber, back of some corn fields, in order to reach the transports unobserved. In the mean time the firing of small-arms commenced again. It was very rapid, and from the sound I judged that our forces encountered the fresh forces of the enemy, and were fighting their way back through them, which proved to be the case. I then called in my pickets, and about 4 o’clock p. m. marched the detachment back to the place of debarkation through some com fields, which screened it from the observation of the gunners at the batteries on the opposite side. There I formed the detachment on open ground, above the lane and below the point of timber where the steamer Memphis lay, and in which the enemy soon appeared, but kept out of range.
After our forces had about all been re-embarked, I received orders to march the detachment on board the transports, and directed the commanders of the two companies of the Seventh Iowa to march on board their transports, which had dropped down—the Memphis at the point of timber, to which place I then marched the three companies of the Twenty-second Illinois.
After all were on board, the enemy came within range on the bank and commenced firing, advancing up to the edge of the high bank where the steamer lay. The men, being fresh, hurried up on the hurricane deck, under command of their officers, a part remaining below, and spiritedly returned the fire of the rebels from the hurricane deck and forecastle of the boat, one of the engineers of which attracted attention by the cool manner in which he loaded a piece in his possession and fired upon the enemy at short intervals, as his duty permitted.
Six men out of the three companies from the Twenty-second Illinois, comprising a part of the detachment which had been placed under my command, were wounded before the boat got away from the river bank and out of range—2 in Company A, 1 in Company H, and 3 in Company 13 3 of the 6 severely. The two Seventh Iowa companies were on another transport, and sustained no loss that I can learn.

Bird's Point, Jfo., November 10,1861.
G-eneral : I herewith hand you the report of the movements of my regiment, with the official list of killed and wounded, at the battle of Belmont, as follows:
On the 5th instant I received your order to hold my regiment in readiness to march at 4 p. m. on the following day, with 24 hours’ rations in haversacks. It was dark, however, before we embarked on the steamer Montgomery, and we soon after got under way. We proceeded but a short distance down the river when we tied up for the night.
Early on the morning of the 7th proceeded on our way, and soon after landed on the west bank of the Mississippi, about 3 miles above Belmont, which is opposite Columbus, Ky. We immediately formed in line in the corn field on the bank of the river about 8.30 o’clock, and were soon after ordered by you to form on the left of McClernand’s brigade, which had already crossed the field. At this time I was joined by Colonel Dougherty, with the Twenty-second Illinois. We remained in this position until Taylor’s battery had disembarked and taken their position, when we received orders to march, which we did in the following order: The First Brigade, consisting of three regiments of infantry and Taylor’s battery ; then followed the Second Brigade, consisting of eight companies of my regiment and seven companies of the Twenty-second Illinois, Colonel Dougherty in command of the brigade; two companies of my regiment andthree companies of Colonel Dougherty’s having previously been detached to guard the boats, and the cavalry were sent in advance scouting. In this order we marched a mile or so, when we formed in line of battle in front of a corn field, the battery taking position in the field.
We remained in this position but a short time, when we advanced in line of battle across a dry slough and immediately in front of heavy timber. Here I received orders to throw forward two companies as skirmishers, which I complied with by sending Company A, commanded by Lieutenant De Heus, and Company F, Captain Kittredge, from my right wing. I soon after sent forward Company B, Captain Gardner, from my left wing. These companies were not long in engaging the rebels, whom they found in force in front and to the left of our position,. and the heavy and continued firing convinced me that we now had work to do. I therefore dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Wentz to ascertain the force of the enemy and their exact position, but before he had time to return I received, through your aide, Bawlins, an order to advance to their support, which I did, bringing my men under fire at double-quick time. From this until about 11 o’clock we fought the rebels slowly but steadily, driving them before us at every volley.
Our advance at this point was slow, in consequence of the obstructions in our way, caused by felling timber and underbrush, but we crept under and over it, at times lying down to let the fire of the artillery and musketry pass over us, and then up and onward again until we arrived at the field to the left of the rebels’ camp. There we were joined by our skirmishers, and succeeded, after a severe struggle, in driving back the enemy and forming our lines immediately. We poured volley after volley on the retiring foe across the field in our front and the battery which was stationed at the head of the encampment on our right. Our fire

﻿Chap. X.)	ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.	297
was so hot that the guns were soon abandoned; the enemy, about 800, were fleeing across the field in the greatest consternation. By a flank movement to the right I brought my men into the open space in front of the battery, which was immediately taken possession of, I believe, by Lieutenant De Heus, Company A, whose flag was soon seen flying from one of the captured pieces. We were now immediately in the rear of the encampment, and were here joined by a part of Colonel Dougherty’s regiment—Twenty-second Illinois. The rebels kept up a sharp and galling fire upon us, but a few well-directed volleys induced them to abscond from their camp suddenly. It was here, where the firing was the heaviest, that Lieutenant Wallen, of Company I, seized the regimental Colors and bore them aloft in front of the regiment’s line, directing the boys’ attention to a fine large flag floating over the encampment, decorated with twelve stars, and on the other with the 66 Harp of Erin” on a green-silk ground. They, with loud huzzas, went forward and secured it. It was in making this charge that my horse was shot. I followed the regiment on foot until we reached the lower end of the encampment, where I was supplied with another horse, which had just been captured by one of the men, when, immediately ordering another charge, we drove all the remaining rebels over the bank of the river at this point (some 12 feet high), and dashed up the river road until we came to the log house which constituted the city of Belmont. At this place there was considerable random firing, the rebels firing from cover of trees and the bank of the river; and it was here, while giving Captain Parrott, of Company E, orders to bring off two field pieces which had been abandoned by the enemy, or to throw them into the river, so as to render them useless against us, that I received a ball through my left thigh, which for a time disabled me, when I was assisted by Captain Parrott to the rear of the tents, where I remained but a short time, as, one of the guns of Captain Taylor’s battery coming along, they placed me on it and took me to the rear of the encampment.
In the mean time our men had received orders to burn and destroy the camp and property which had fallen into our hands, and in a short time the destruction was complete. The rebels, however, not being idle, having several large steamers in the river at Columbus, they were loaded down with fresh troops, which were thrown between us and our place of debarkation, so as in a measure to cut off our retreat. Those of them, also, who had been driven from their guns in the early part of the fight, seeing us falling back towards our boats, took fresh courage and commenced closing in on us; and now, as all the Illinois troops had left us or were leaying, except the Twenty-second Illinois, Colonel Dougherty, we were in danger of being surrounded and cut off. I was apprised of this state of affairs by Colonel Dougherty, to whose bravery I bear testimony, and who lost a limb in his endeavors to bring off safely the rear of his brigade, as well as to that of his noble regiment, which fought side by side on that memorable day. I immediately gave orders to my regiment to retire, myself leading the way, but by this time we were subjected to an enfilading fire which caused us heavy loss. The men behaved in the most gallant manner, deliberately loading and firing as they retired, and although every other man was killed or wounded, they scarcely accelerated their step, but coolly and deliberately made their way to the boats.
It was after the retreat had commenced that Lieutenant-Colonel Wentz was killed. He died on the field of battle like a true soldier. He was truly a brave man, and did his duty well and nobly. Lieutenant Dodge, of Company B, was killed, and Lieutenant Gardner, who

commanded Company I, and Lieutenant Eeam, Company C, mortally wounded. Among my officers more or less severely wounded you will find the names of Major Rice, Captains Harper, Parrott, Kittredge, and Gardner, and First Lieutenant DeHeus, who commanded Company A, of whose bravery I desire to speak in the most emphatic manner. I desire also to direct your attention to Captain Crabb, who was taken prisoner, and who behaved in the bravest manner. But I might go on in this way and name nearly all my entire command, for they all behaved like heroes 5 but there is one or two more I feel it my duty to name as deserving special mention—Lieutenant Boler, adjutant of the regiment, and Lieutenant Estle, whose conduct was worthy of all praise, and Private Lawrence Trigg, whose thigh was broken and he left on the field. He was taken prisoner and his leg amputated, but he died the same day, telling his captors with his dying breath that if he ever recovered to be able to move he would shoulder his musket again in his country’s cause. Under cover of the fire of the gunboats we finally reached our boat between 5 and 6 o’clock, and about 8 o’clock arrived in Cairo.
My entire loss in killed, wounded, prisoners, and missing is as follows, out of an aggregate somewhat over 400: Killed, 51; died of wounds, 3 $ missing, 10; prisoners, 39 5 wounded, 124. Total, 227.
With high esteem, permit me to subscribe myself, general, your obedient servant,

Report of Capt. Benjamin Crabb, Seventh Iowa Infantry.
Washington, Iowa, August 1, 1862.
Sir : After a long absence in Southern prisons, I have been privileged to return to my home, though in a very bad state of health, on account of close confinement and poor food.
I have had the pleasure of reading your report of the part the Seventh Regiment Iowa Volunteer Infantry took in the battle of Belmont, Mo. I am sorry to say it was out of my power to make a report at the time of the part Company H (the company I had the honor of commanding) took in said engagement. I ask the privilege of making a small addition to your report, and that it may be made a supplement to the same.
While the regiment was in line of battle at u the dry slough in front of heavy timber,” at the time you ordered Company B, Captain Gardner, to advance as skirmishers, Company H, myself commanding, was also ordered forward on like duty. Companies B and H advanced in skirmish line together until they arrived at a small corn field some half mile in advance of the main line, where they became separated. Company H continued to advance. Just beyond the corn-field we encountered a rebel company of skirmishers, and immediately engaged them, driving them before us entirely from the woods (through which we were advancing) into the open field of Belmont, where they disappeared beyond a long ridge in the middle of the open field. We were about 80 yards in their rear, just at the edge of the timber. We were in the act of pursuit, when the rebels, who were lying behind this ridge, arose and

﻿Chap. X]	ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.	299
fired upon us with musketry and artillery. We then fell back under a heavy fire until we met the regiment advancing to our support, when we joined it.
We lost one man killed while skirmishing (John 0. Temple), and we believe the first man killed that day. After the destruction of the enemy’s camp and the regiment was ordered to retreat, a part of Company H, by my orders, drew one of the enemy’s guns across the field to near the timber, when, finding it impossible to proceed with it farther (being surrounded on all sides by the enemy), we reluctantly abandoned it. I was captured soon after this.
I have the honor to remain, yours, &c.,

Reports of Brig. Oen. Charles F. Smith, U. S. Army, commanding at Paducah, Ky., of demonstration upon Columbus, Ky.
Headquarters TJ. S. Forces, Paducah, Ky., November 7,1861.
Sir : I report, for the information of the General-in-Chief, that at 2 o’clock yesterday afternoon 2,000 men of all arms (four field pieces and one company of cavalry), under command of Brigadier-General Paine, moved in the direction of Columbus, taking the road to Melvin, some 20 miles distant 5 from thence to return by a detour by the Lovelace-ville and Blandville road ; this to carry out General Fremont’s orders in making demonstrations on Columbus in conjunction with General Grant. One hour after I sent nine companies of a regiment, one company of cavalry, and a section of artillery to Viola, to keep observation on the enemy south of Mayfield, and prevent his assailing General Paine on the flank; this detachment to return by the Melvin road; both commands to be out three days. Heavy firing now heard in the direction of Columbus, caused, it is supposed, by General Grant’s movements towards Belmont.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Pursuant to the instructions of Major-General Fremont, commanding the Department of the West, dated on the 1st instant, directing me to make a demonstration on Columbus, but not to attack it without special orders (see inclosure marked A), on the 6th instant I dispatched the First Brigade of this force, commanded by Brig. Gen. E. A. Paine, and a part of the Second Brigade, under command of Col. W. L. Sanderson, Twenty-third Indiana Regiment, in the direction of

Columbus. (See inelosures marked B and C.) This movement was made in concert with one to be made by Brigadier-General Grant from Cairo, to threaten Belmont and other points west of the Mississippi, his orders being similar to those received by me to threaten but not attack Columbus. (See again inclosure marked A.)
My special instructions to Brigadier-General Paine and Colonel Sanderson (see inelosures marked I) and E) were of the most precise character : to move to a certain point and return by another road; not to make .battle unless pressed thereto from necessity; to make a demonstration by the march.
The reports made to me by General Paine (see inelosures marked F and G) show that he transcended my orders, as he was fully aware of the object for which the detachment was made, for I had communicated to him verbally the nature of my instructions from Major-General Fremont, and that General Grant had similar instructions, and as no circumstance had occurred he might not reasonably have anticipated, such as the canonading in the direction of Columbus, I regard his movement to Milburn and consequent non-return by the Lovelaceville and Bland-ville road as an unjustifiable departure from my orders. His distinct assertion in both reports that he would in a certain contingency have moved to the attack of Columbus exhibits to my mind a fixed purpose from the start to attempt to 'gain notoriety without reference to the public interests or his plain duty as a soldier. Had he by chance carried out his avowed purpose, I am satisfied, from what we know of the strength of the garrison and the inland defenses of Columbus, he would have been entirely unsuccessful and his command probably cut up in its retreat, thereby greatly imperiling the safety of this post, which is deemed of much importance.
On its return his command was, as is generally asserted, totally demoralized as a military body, some of the regiments without order or discipline straggling loosely along the road and committing great excesses. This I attribute to a large extent to the broken-down condition of the men by increasing the length of the march by going to Milburn and injudicious marching altogether. (See inelosures marked H and I.)
In view of what is above set forth, I think the conduct of Brigadier-General Paine and that of the regimental commanders should be investigated for the want of discipline exhibited during the expedition, that of the former especially, for bis departure from my orders; also that of the enlisted men, to ascertain who committed the excesses imputed to them.
I have, therefore, to request that application maybe made for a court of inquiry to sit at an early date to sift this whole matter.

The object of this movement is to induce the enemy to suspect an attack on Columbus is intended. Whilst not avoiding the enemy, should he be within your reach in corresponding numbers you will not attack. The object is a demonstration merely. Nine companies of the Second Brigade, with a section of artillery and some cavalry, will leave here an hour after you to go to Plumley’s Station or Viola, and then return by the road on which you went out.

Sir: We are encamped at Milburn, 31 miles from Paducah. The firing was heard on Columbus all day yesterday, and last night I heard that our troops had taken the batteries on the Missouri side, and that nearly all of the rebels had crossed over there. I sent the scout to the river to communicate with the gunboats, but found that all of the boats and barges had left at dark for Cairo. If the attack had been renewed to-day I should have marched on Columbus. As it is, I am just starting on my return. My soldiers are almost out of provisions. I wish one day’s full rations sent to me to-night on the same road I came on. I shall make 20 miles to day. Be sure and send them, or I shall be out. No accident. All well; some foot-sore.

After marching 5 miles on the morning of the 7th instant heard firing ,at or near Columbus and immediately changed our direction, leaving

Melvin to our left, and took the shortest road leading to Columbus, and at 7 o’clock p. m. arrived at the town of Milburn, aft$r a fatiguing march of 24 miles. I immediately dispatched three messengers to the Mississippi River, with a request to the officer in command of the Federal forces to fire a signal-gun, which, if done, I was determined to march that night on Columbus. At half past 4 o’clock on the morning of the 8th the messenger returned, and informed me that all of the gunboats and all of the Federal forces had returned to Cairo. At daylight I ordered my command to return to Paducah.
I also sent a messenger to the officer in command of a detachment from the Second Brigade to join me on the night of the 7th, but did not effect a junction until the next day. I found the country all quiet—no appearance of any rebel forces—but the Union people were glad to see us. One private of the Twelfth Illinois Regiment was accidentally wounded by the discharge of a musket. My command, being composed almost entirely of volunteers who were on their first march, became foot-sore, and by that means protracted the time of return. My great regret is that I was unable to assist General Grant in his attack on Columbus.

Reports of the most painful character have reached the commanding general from different sources in regard to the conduct of a portion of the troops recently marched to Milburn, under command of Brig. Gen. E. A. Paine. The imputations are of the most discreditable, most disgraceful character to them as soldiers or citizens—that in returning, several regiments (the Ninth and Twelfth Illinois excepted) straggled home in parties without the semblance of military array—a mere armed mob; and that the property- of citizens was wantonly destroyed, and in some instances robbery by violence committed. Such conduct implies a want of discipline that he can scarcely credit, and he calls upon the brigade and other commanders to use their utmost endeavors to remedy such a state of things. That unmerited censure may not attach to any one, the commanding general intends to ask for a legal investigation into the conduct of all concerned.
This order will be read at the head of every company in the camp.

It was a hard-fought battle; lasted from 10.30 till 5 this evening. They took Beltzhoover’s battery, which we retook. They were thoroughly routed, we pursuing them to their boats, 7 miles. The roads were strewn with their dead and wounded, guns, ammunition, and equipments. Our loss considerable; theirs heavy. We are expecting an attack from this side in the morning by large force from Mayfield Creek and Paducah. This will explain the delay of General Pillow’s movement.

My Dear General : I send you to-day my report of the battle of the 7th [following]. I regret the" delay in submitting it, but my head and nervous system generally has been in such a state since the bursting of the gun I have been unable to do more than a little at a time of anything. Besides this, too, I desired to be accurate in my statements and just to every one.
I have to ask, for the satisfaction of our Mends and the country, if there be no impropriety in it, that these reports, when you have examined and submitted them, be published. I have copies of them and will have that attended to. I am still very deaf and my nervous system is still unsteady. I hope, however, in a few days to assume command. I find there is strong reason for believing that Captain Adams is not filling his position as might be desired. His habits, I fear, are bad, and this leads to other things not in keeping with the best interests of the service. My opinion is, that as we are getting up a number of volunteer companies to be organized into regiments, the best thing for him and the service would be to have him made a colonel of a regiment, and sent to the field. It so happens that we now have an opportunity of having his place filled by a person whom I know, and who comes very highly recommended by competent parties in Memphis as possessing the qualities requisite for the commander of that post. This person is Colonel Dixon, of the Memphis Legion. This Legion is an old organization, and one which I have been endeavoring to get to enlist for the local defense. They now consent to it, and are willing to be mustered into the service. They can do the military duty required in Memphis—guarding prisoners, magazines, &c., and he command the post. The gentleman who takes this is one of his captains, and can give you any further information. I send by him also a copy of the monthly report you have asked for.

I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the army under my command in the battle of the 7th:
From information received from several sources I had reason to believe it was the intention of the enemy to attack my position at this place at an early day, provision to meet which was made accordingly. Between 2 and 3 o’clock on the morning of the 7tlr a courier arrived at my headquarters, informing me of the movement of a strong force designed to attack General Thompson’s position at Bloomfield and New Madrid. When, therefore, I was informed shortly after daybreak, through a member of my staff, that the enemy had made his appearance in the river with gunboats and transports, and was landing a considerable force on the Missouri shore, 5 or 6 miles from Belmont, I became satisfied it was his intention to make the attack general. I dispatched immediately messengers to the general officers of division to inform them of my impressions and the position of affairs, with instructions to make such disposition of their commands as the emergency required.
The same information was conveyed to Colonel Tappan, who was in command of the force at Belmont. To General Pillow, whose division was nearest the point immediately threatened, I gave orders in person to move immediately to the relief of Colonel Tappan with four of his regiments. For this service he detailed Colonel Russell’s, Colonel Wright’s, Colonel Pickett’s, and Colonel Freeman’s regiments of Tennessee volunteers. These, with Colonel Tappan’s Thirteenth Arkansas* Captain Beltzhoover’s Watson Battery, and. a squadron of Lieutenant-Colonel Miller’s battalion of cavalry, composing the force on the other side, were deemed sufficient to resist the column reported to have landed. Having an adequate number of steamers at the landing, this order was promptly executed.
My attention was then directed to the proper distribution of the forces for receiving an attack on the Columbus side of the river. Having

examined and found the batteries in the fort in a proper condition, I proceeded up the river to examine the dispositions of General McCown, who was charged with the defenses of the left flank. These I found to be satisfactory. He had already advanced a battery of long-range guns, under the command of Capt. R. A. Stewart, of the Louisiana Pointe Coup6e Battery, to a position from whence he could reach with ease the enemy’s gunboats.
From this point and that occupied by the heavy siege battery, under command of Captain Hamilton, as also from several of the guns of the fort, he opened a heavy fire, which was duly responded to by the enemy. After half an hour’s engagement the boats were driven up the river. At a subsequent period they again dropped down and renewed the conflict, throwing shot and shell into the works. This was continued for an hour, when they were again forced to retire.
Ascertaining that the remaining portion of General Pillow’s division, as well as that of General Cheatham, was in proper position, I returned to the river bank opposite to Belmont. At 10.20 o’clock the firing of the enemy’s advanced guard upon our pickets was heard, and in about forty minutes afterwards the engagement became general with all arms.
Taking my position on the river bank midway between the two points of expected attack, I dispatched one of my aides to the Missouri shore to inform General Pillow of my position and readiness to afford him such support as he might require. In reply he requested me to send him additional ammunition, a regiment of infantry, and a section of artillery, to be held as a reserve. The ammunition and Col. Knox Walker’s regiment were sent him immediately, and instead of a section of artillery I dispatched him two field batteries, those of Capts. W. H. Jackson and Polk. Such a force of field artillery had become necessary from the fact that Captain Beltzhoover’s battery, from want of ammunition, had ceased firing, and the enemy had opened fire with a heavy battery, of the presence of which upon the field I had until then not been apprised. The steamer transporting these batteries, in her attempt to land them on the Missouri shore, by some means lost her stage planks, and the landing at that moment became impossible. She was forced to return to the Kentucky shore. Captain Polk’s battery was landed at a later hour, but too late to render service in the operations of the day.
By this time it was obvious that further re-enforcements had become necessary, and Colonel Carroll’s Fifteenth Tennessee and Colonel Marks’ Eleventh Louisiana Regiment, which had been ordered to the river bank and were held as a reserve, were ordered forward. I directed Colonel Marks to land his regiment higher up the river, with a view to a flank movement which he was ordered to make. Shortly after his landing he was met by General Pillow, who directed him, with his regiment and that of Colonel Carroll, to move rapidly on the enemy’s flank. General Pillow directed Colonel Russell, with his brigade, to support that movement, and himself accompanied this command during the execution of the movement under Colonel Marks. Captain Jackson, who had reported to General Pillow that he could not get his battery ashore, was attached to his staff, and directed to lead this column. In aiding Lieutenant Colonel Barrow, who was in immediate command of the Eleventh Louisiana, to bring a portion of the column into line, he fell severely wounded.
Apprehending every moment an attack in my rear on Columbus, which subsequent information proves to have been the enemy’s plan, it was with great reluctance I lessened the force assigned to its defense. Nevertheless, it was obvious, from the yielding of our columns to the

heavy pressure of the masses of the enemy’s infantry and the fierce assaults of their heavy battery, that further re-enforcements were necessary. I ordered down General Cheatham, with the First Brigade of his division, under command of Colonel Preston Smith. The general, having arrived in advance of his brigade, was directed by me to take the nearest steamer and to move promptly across the river to rally and take command of the portions of regiments within sight on the shore, and to support the flank movement ordered through Colonel Marks. This he did promptly and effectively.
At this juncture the enemy fired our tents, and advancing his battery nearer the river bank opened a heavy fire on the steamers which were transporting our troops, in some instances driving shot through two of them at the same time. Their commanding pilots and other officers, nevertheless, stood firmly at their posts, and exhibited a fearlessness and energy deserving of the highest praise. These boats were the Prince, under Captain Butler, who particularly distinguished himself, the Charm, under Captain Trask, and the Hill, under Captain Newell, with the Kentucky, under Captain Lodwick.
I directed Captain Smith’s Mississippi battery to move to the river bank, opposite the field of conflict, and to open upon the enemy’s positions. 1 also directed Maj. A. P. Stewart, in command of the heavy guns in the fort, to open upon the same position, it being now seen that these guns could be used without causing danger to our own troops.
This joint fire was so terrific as to dislodge the enemy, silence his battery, and cause him to take up his line of march for his boats. He had scarcely put himself in motion when he encountered Colonel Marks first and afterwards General Cheatham in his flank, with both of whom severe conflicts followed, and by whom he was driven in with great loss.
On the arrival of General Cheatham’s brigade, being now satisfied the attack on Columbus for some reason had failed, I took charge of it, together with Captain White’s company of Lieutenant-Colonel Logwood’s battalion of cavalry, and proceeded with them across the river, having first ordered two regiments of General McCown’s division to follow.
On landing I was met by Generals Pillow and Cheatham, whom I directed, with the regiments of General Cheatham’s command and portions of others, to press the enemy to his boats. This order was executed with alacrity and in double-quick time. The route over which we passed was strewn with the dead and wounded of the conflicts of Colonel Marks and General Cheatham, already alluded to, and with arms, knapsacks, overcoats, &c.
On arriving at the point where his transports lay, I ordered the column, headed by the One hundred and fifty-fourth senior regiment of Tennessee Volunteers, under cover of a field thickly set with corn, to be deployed along the river bank within easy range of the boats. This being accomplished, a heavy fire was opened upon them simultaneously, riddling them with balls, and, as we have reason to believe, with heavy loss to the enemy. Under this galling fire he cut his lines and retreated from the shore, many of his soldiers being driven overboard by the rush of those behind them. Our fire was returned by the heaviest cannonading from his gunboats, which discharged upon our lines showers of grape, canister, and shell as they retired with their convoy in the direction of Cairo. It being now sunset, and being left in possession of the field, I ordered the troops to retire.
My first acknowledgments for this signal triumph of our arms and

the defeat of the machinations of our enemies are due to the favoring providence of Almighty God, by which his plans were unvailed and frustrated, and by which the hearts of our troops were made strong in the day of battle. Confiding in the justice of our cause, we have felt we could put our trust in His protection and defense, and He has given us the victory.
Our thanks are due to the brave officers and soldiers who, under God, were the instruments of this victory. To Brigadier-General Pillow, to whom the duty of receiving the enemy’s attack was assigned, is due the credit of meeting that attack with firmness, and of sustaining the heat of the conflict in the early part of the engagement. This he did with persistent energy and gallantry, courageously supporting and encouraging his troops by cheering words and personal example.
My thanks are due to General McCown for the promptitude with which he made the disposition proper for the defense of the left flank on the Columbus side, and for the manner in which he controlled the movements of the gunboats by the judicious management of the field battery of Captain Stewart, the siege battery of Captain Hamilton, and the heavy guns in the fort.
I am indebted also to General Cheatham, who, at a later hour, by his promptitude and gallantry rallied the broken fragments of our columns and directed them with such resistless energy against the enemy’s flank.
Colonel Marks, of the Eleventh Louisiana Regiment, rendered the most efficient service by the decision with which he led his column, in the face of the most discouraging circumstances, to the attack on the enemy’s flank.
The condition of the field after the battle and the route pursued by the flying enemy sufficiently testify to the deadly aim of the Louisianians and Tennesseeans, who composed his command. It was in this attack that the gallant Major Butler lost his life in the performance of a duty in advance of his columns. He was a young officer of high promise, and deeply lamented by all who knew him.
ihe firmness with which Col. J. V. Wright and his gallant regiment sustained themselves on the left flank of the first line of battle, as elsewhere, merits strong commendation.
The Watson Battery was served with decided ability and unflinching courage by its commander, Captain Beltzhoover, who retired his guns from the field only after he had exhausted his ammunition. In this connection also, as belonging to the same command, it is due to Colonel Tappan and his regiment to say that the promptness with which they prepared to receive the enemy, and the determined courage with which they sustained their part of the general conflict, are entitled to approbation.
To Capt. M. Smith, of the Mississippi battery, and to Maj. A. P. Stewart, who directed the artillery in the fort, I am particularly indebted for the skill and judgment manifested in the service of the guns under their command, to the joint fire from which I feel hot a little indebted for turning the fortunes of the day.
But to recite in detail all the instances of skill and courage displayed by individual commanders and their several commands would be to run well through the list of those who were engaged, and to anticipate also the reports of the division and regimental commanders.
The battle was fought against great odds, both as to numbers and position. The Mississippi River dividing the field placed us at a disadvantage which it was necessary to overcome, and although we expe-

rienced an occasional reverse, these reverses were soon repaired, and the results of the day proved beyond all doubt the superiority of our troops in all the essential characteristics of the soldier.
To Acting Assistant Adjutant-General Blake, 0. S. Army j Lieutenant Dixon, C. S. Army Engineers; Captain Champney, Ordnance; Lieutenant Snowden, C. S. Army Topographical Corps ; Maj. H. W. Winslow, acting aide-de-camp, all members of my staff, I feel indebted for their promptness and activity in the execution of my orders and for their support in directing the operations of the day.
In a conflict continued through so many hours and so hotly contested the list of casualties must be expected to be large. Our loss in killed was 105; wounded, 419; missing, 117. Total, 641.
The number of prisoners taken by the enemy, as shown by their list furnished us, was 106, all of whom have been returned by exchange.
Of the enemy’s loss we have no means of accurate information, but from all the sources open to us, the condition of the field, the list of prisoners taken by us, the report of those returned to us, and the reports of the enemy, I am satisfied it cannot fall short of 1,500; fourteen-fifteenths of that number must have been killed, wounded and drowned.
After making a liberal exchange of the captured with the enemy 100 of their prisoners remain still in my hands. I have also a stand of colors, a fraction over 1,000 stand of arms, with knapsacks, ammunition, and other military stores.

RESOLUTIONS of thanks to Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, Brig. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, and the officers and soldiers under their command, for gallant and distinguished services in the present war.
Whereas, under the providence of God, the valor of the soldiers o^ the Confederate States has added another glorious victory, achieved at Belmont, in the State of Missouri, on the 7th day of November last, to those which had been so graciously vouchsafed to our arms, whereby the reduction of Columbus, in the State of Kentucky, has been prevented, and the contemplated descent of the enemy down the Mississippi River effectually staid: Therefore,
Be it resolved by the Congress of the Confederate States of America. That the thanks of Congress are most heartily tendered to Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, Brig. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham, and the officers and soldiers of their gallant commands, for the desperate courage they exhibited in sustaining for several hours and under most disadvantageous circumstances, an attack by a force of the enemy greatly superior to their own both in numbers and appointments, and for the skill and gallantry by which they converted what at first threatened so much disaster into a triumphant victory.
Resolved further. That these resolutions are intended to express what is believed to be the grateful and admiring sentiment of the whole people of the Confederacy.
Resolved further, That they be communicated to the commands of Major-General Polk, Brigadier-General Pillow, and Brigadier-General Cheatham by the proper department of the Government.

Columbia, Tenn., January 16, 1862. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War :
I have received your dispatch, requesting me to explain mine, and the cause of my resignation.* I resigned for the reason stated in my dispatch ; the facts were as stated in that dispatch.
Major-General Polk, by orders, had taken from me, successively, three quartermasters, two commissaries, ray surgeon, engineer, and ordnance officer, and assigned me no others, with this exception, viz: when he took my last quartermaster and I complained of the act, he issued an order appointing a citizen of Memphis, by the name of R. P. Baugh, quartermaster, with the rank of captain, and assigned him to duty with my division. I declined to receive this citizen quartermaster, on the ground that the President alone possessed the power of appointment j that General Polk’s appointment was illegal and void, and that even if Baugh had given bond and security, as required by law, still the appointment would be illegal and his acts all void.
General Polk had, by general orders, prohibited officers of the general staff from receiving orders from any officer but himself. My remonstrances against thus being deprived of my staff, respectfully made, only exasperated him. Being thus stripped of my staff, and inhibited from giving orders to the general staff, I was left without the means of supplying any wants of my command; and I felt that I was reduced to the position of a cipher, and was valueless to the service.
I had occupied this position for more than a month, but being without a remedy, and unwilling at such, a time to quit the service, I had sub-mitted.
The circumstances which led to my resignation were as follows, viz: Soon after General Polk had resumed command (after recovering from the injury received by the explosion of a gun), the army horses and mules were dying for the want of enough food. Upon the fact being made known to me, I reported it to General Polk. He said he would attend to it, but did not. In the course of a few days I again reported that the want was not supplied, and that the horses and mules were dying in great numbers. He again said he would have the necessary orders given) still nothing was done,* and for the third time I brought the subject to his attention, and he again promised that he would see to it.
At length General Cheatham, the commander of field batteries and of cavalry corps, came to me and urged me to take measures to supply forage, saying that if it was not done the horses and mules of the Army would all die. Thereupon I sent for the depot quartermaster (my last division quartermaster), and gave him orders* to send special agents uf the department to the interior of the country to collect and buy forage, and to send along a number of army wagons to haul it to the railroad and river as promptly as possible. The result was that in a few days we had a supply of forage, which lasted until about the 20th of December.
On the 24th of December I again reported that we were out of forage, and that the horses were dying again. He replied that he would see to it. I remarked that the quartermaster staff was not an efficient one, and that unless he did more than barely give orders, hay, &c., would not be had in the required amount.
I then explained to him the measures I had previously taken, which 1 have already explained above. Upon learning that I had given orders
7(1 Neither found.

﻿314 operations In Mo., aril, kans., and ind. t. ton a*, x.
to the quartermaster, he became greatly exasperated, and asked me how 1 dared to give orders to his quartermaster.
I explained to him that the order was given to the depot quartermaster and not to his quartermaster; that the order was given to supply a great public want, which he had failed to attend to; that under the circumstances I felt it to be my duty to give the order; that for proper and lawful purposes I had the right to give orders to any officer of the general staff not on his staff. He said all the officers of the general staff were his and subject to his orders, only. 1 replied, that the officers of the general staff were part of the Army, and intended to supply its wants; that if he took from the line all the officers of the general staff and left the division commanders without, and then inhibited them from giving lawful and proper orders to supply the Army, he was centralizing the powers of the whole Army in himself.
Finding his exasperation increased, and he having become exceedingly harsh, so much so that I found it impossible to stand his violence of temper, I left his quarters and went to my own. On the third day after this I sent in my resignation. Unjust and severe as I felt was General Polk’s censure for attending to a pressing want of the Army which he had neglected to attend to, though his attention had been three times and on as many different days called to it, still I would not have tendered my resignation had this been the first or even second act of injustice or harshness to me.
Shortly after the Army took possession of Columbus, and while the whole Army was under my immediate command under him, he directed me to issue an order declaring martial law over Columbus. I endeavored to dissuade him from this measure, saying that there was no necessity for declaring martial law ; that the people of the town were our friends; that he had in his proclamation promised to protect their rights and uphold the laws and support the civil authorities; that I could control the town and the Army with an armed police, under a chief of police or military governor, as well as if martial law were declared.
I further remarked that martial law was the organization adopted and enforced by the Lincoln Government and Army; that it was the expedient of tyrants and usurpers, and that the South had nowhere adopted it ; that it was a violation of the constitutional rights of the citizen, and could only be justified by extreme necessity, involving the public safety.
The argument had no influence with him; he said I should issue the order.
I begged him to excuse me, and if he would put the measure in operation, to please issue the order himself, saying that I had conscientious convictions against its legality, and that my name should not be connected with the infamy of such a measure in the future history of this war.
My opposition to the measure and my refusal to issue the order exasperated him beyond control; his rage exceeded anything I had ever seen in a sane man. He said he would show me u whether his subalterns should dictate to him his orders.” Finally Colonel De Russy, of his staff, interposed, begged him to be calm, read authority on the subject, and ultimately succeeded in inducing him to abandon the measure. Nor was this all.
On the 7th day of November last General Polk ordered me to cross the river with four regiments of my division, to meet the enemy, then landed and advancing upon the position of Colonel Tappan’s regiment

at Belmont. I had just that morning returned from Bowling Green, where I had been ordered by him.
I obeyed the order as promptly as possible, crossed the river, and disposed my force to receive the enemy. I had barely time to get my troops in position when I was assailed by a very large force. I immediately dispatched an officer with this information to General Polk and requested him to re-enforce me. Subsequently I dispatched another officer to General Polk, stating that I was engaged with a force three times the strength of my own, and that my ammunition w'as growing short, and requested him to re-enforce me promptly and send me ammu • nition.
The fight waxed on, but no re-enforcements or ammunition came.
I ultimately sent a third officer, saying that if I was not promptly re-enforced and furnished with ammunition, I would be overwhelmed by the enemy. My battery was now silenced for want of ammunition, and one regiment and a battalion had expended their ammunition ; still I got neither re-enforcements nor ammunition.
Being now without the means of keeping up a line of fire and pressed hard by the enemy, I had nothing left me but the bayonet, and I ordered the charge, and drove back the enemy’s line against his strong reserve ; but I could not break his line, and was compelled to fall back to my original position.. The enemy’s line was then again advancing upon me ; I repeated the charge the second and third time with like result, but still no support reached me.
After four hours3 hard fighting against a force of three times my own, and after a loss of quite one-fourth the force engaged, to save my command from total destruction I at last ordered the line to fall back to the river bank. There I met with Colonel Walker’s regiment, the first support sent me.	^
This bloody battle was within three-fourths of a mile from the main 7 army; the river interposing, I could not fall back upon it for support. There were not less than 10,000 well-armed and well-disciplined men looking on the conflict from the opposite shore, and this force was within a strong and well-constructed line of defensive works.
The reason given by General Polk for not supporting me more promptly was that he was apprehensive of an attack upon the Columbus side also. I am satisfied that an attack on that side was feared, but as my small force was thrown across the river, from whence there was no retreat, and as I was attacked by a greatly superior force, 1 ought, at any hazard, to have been promptly supported, and not abandoned to my fate for four long hours, and until so much blood and so many valuable lives were sacrificed.
Such a sacrifice cannot be excused by alleged fears of attack on the Columbus side, with the force there in hand and the position it occupied, and with the means to have known if any enemy was near except that which my command had engaged.
Under such circumstances I trust I shall be pardoned for distrusting the efficiency of the commanding general of that army, and for expressing apprehensions that a like occurrence or even a greater calamity awaits his want of fitness to command.
I need therefore only say that this needless sacrifice of so many brave men; the injustice received at his hands in being stripped of my staff; his cruel harshness to me for declining to issue an illegal order and against my convictions of duty, and his unjust censure for supplying to the army a pressing want which he had neglected (a want involving the loss of a large amount of the property of the Government), all en-

tered into my determination and influenced my final conclusion to retire from die service.
- It was a painful step, but as I was reluctant to trouble the Government by complaint at a time of great peril to the country, and inasmuch as 1 knew General Polk possessed the full confidence of the President, and as I had never, as I felt, been recognized by the Government, I felt it my duty to silently retire, not even assigning in my resignation any cause, and the same motives would have induced me to remain silent except for the call for an explanation in your dispatch.
After my resignation was delivered to General Polk he sent for me; asked for an explanation of the cause of my resignation.
I at first declined giving any, but upon his insisting I yielded, and gave him the substance of this communication in explanation of my course.
He said our last interview had been the subject of anxious thought; that he believed I was right about the staff; that he would restore my staff* and modify his orders, and asked my forgiveness (which I granted), and then asked me to withdraw my resignation, which I declined. 4
It is proper further to say that after I had reached the depot on my way home I received his order restoring such members of my staff as still remained at Columbus.
Since I reached my residence I am informed that* the army, deeply distressed at my departure, were engaged addressing a respectful p. ti-tion to the President, expressive of their confidence in me, and requesting him to order me back, when Major-General Polk issued an order intended to suppress this respectful appeal to the President, thus stifling the honest convictions of the army and the sympathy so naturally arising from his injustice to me.
I have seen that order, and though the article of regulations referred to had no application to the case, yet it had the effect designed. This last act of his is a deeper wrong and has done more to shake my confidence in the sense of justice of General Polk than all that had preceded it.
I have enjoyed an intimate friendship for General Polk for about twenty-five years. As a zealous patriot I admire him, as an eminent minister of the gospel I respect him, but as a commanding general I cannot agree with him.
If I were transferred to another field of duty I would be overshadowed and ranked by the very staff who earned their reputation uiider me as their chief in the Mexican war, and who are now nearly all distinguished general officers. I must therefore retire. Would to God it were otherwise.
My reasons may not be satisfactory to some, but I trust they will be sufficient to protect my reputation against the charges of indifference to the cause of our independence and of a want of patriotism.	- .
I have the fullest confidence in the success of our cause and in the wisdom and judgment of the President ; so much so, that I believe he is chosen of God for the work of our national deliverance ; but I cannot have the honor of continuing one of his humble instruments in the glorious work.
I am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,
GID. J. PILLOW, Brigadier-General, C. 8. A.

Sir : I have not had a moment I could call my own since I received from the War Department a copy'of the very extraordinary letter addressed to it by General Pillow [January 16,1862], giving what he styles his reasons for resigning his appointment as brigadier; and I have now time only to say that I have collected from the colonels under his command at the battle of Belmont written proofs of the most flagrant misstatements of facts and events that could well be imagined; and so of other things. So soon as I can find time from my absorbing public duties to attend to my private, I will present this matter in the shape of a reply to his aspersions.
I have the honor to be, your obedieht servant,
L. POLK,
Major- General, Commanding.
Hdqrs. First Corps, Army of the Mississippi,
July 22, 1862.
Hon. G. W. Randolph, Secretary of War:
I received in the month of February last a copy of a letter addressed by Brigadier-General Pillow to the Hon. J. P. Benjamin, then Secretary of War, purporting to assign reasons for his resignation. It was sent me by order of the President [under date of January 30,1862], with the following indorsement, to wit:
The reason stated as given to General Polk is not that reported by General P. The offer to allow the staff officers wanted was a remedy for the complaint; but declining now to return, or to .serve elsewhere, the case seems to be closed, except so far as it may be necessary to correct errors, both of fact and military discipline. It may bo proper to communicate a copv of the paper to General Polk.
J. D.
My answer to this letter of General Pillow should have been sent forward long ago. The occasion of the delay is that it was received just before the evacuation of Columbus and while I was engaged in the duties growing out of that movement. Since then the heavy pressure of succeeding events, following each other so rapidly, has prevented my attending to any duty that might be postponed.
Immediately after General Pillow’s resignation was received by the War Department, the President telegraphed me for the reasons which had induced it. I replied as follows, to wit :
Headquarters First Division, W. D. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, President, #c.:
In reply to your dispatch in regard to the reasons for General Pillow’s resignation, I have to say that the reason assigned by him to me was that the Government had not recognized his claims to such higher rank as in his opinion his services warranted, and under the circumstances he felt it his duty to decline further service.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding.
In his conversation with me General Pillow said, as he had said to many others, both publicly and privately, that the reason for his resignation was the treatment he had received from the President; that while he had complaints against my administration, the grounds

of these had been removed; that a graver difficulty existed in the conduct of the President towards him; that the President did not appreciate him, and had intentionally and systematically slighted and overshadowed him; that his removal to* another field would furnish no relief, as he would everywhere find himself ranked by men whom he had commanded; that he had let himself down by accepting the commission of brigadier-general in the first place; that no argument against his resignation was of any avail with him now, and that he would be “sunk into the bottom of the sea before he would continue to hold his commission any longer.77 In this temper it was he left Columbus, having first arranged for getting up expressions of sympathy among the troops, and through them among the people and the press, as a basis for operating on the President and inducing or constraining his promotion to the office of major-general. Failing in accomplishing that object, and finding himself without a satisfactory reason to assign to the War Department for his resignation, he trumped up the list of grievances contained in his letter to the Secretary, all of which by his own confession had been disposed of already.
When promotion was the object, it was the “ingratitude, the prejudice, or the dullness of the President in appreciating merit that moved him to resign.77 Failing to bring this home either to the mind of the President or the people with sufficient power to secure his promotion, it became necessary to find a reason for retaining the rank held, and therefore the change of tactics.
The real ground for his resignation, then, was to be found in the series of wrongs he professed to have suffered at my hands, and notwithstanding, “if he was transferred to another field, he would be overshadowed by officers whom he had commanded,77 yet by that means his services might be retained, and he actually caused an announcement of the prospect of such a change of commanders to be made in the newspapers as his excuse for withdrawing his resignation, notwithstanding that transfer was to the command of one of those very subordinates by subjecting himself to whose command he had confessed he would be degraded.
But this letter of General Pillow7s to Mr. Benjamin is of such an extraordinary character, it is necessary to notice it in detail—an office I would gladly have avoided, as it will compel me, if it be discharged at all, to discharge it with a directness and fidelity which, while not in accordance with my taste or feeling, is yet demanded by the occasion, and due to the country and to truth,
Having known him well for many years, and received from him frequently the most earnest protestations of personal esteem and regard, I was, nevertheless, not surprised upon my taking command at Memphis to find him exhibiting petty jealousies, indulging in disingenuous criticism, and conducting himself generally as towards a rival, to be undermined and supplanted, rather than towards a brother officer in the commission of the Government, to whom a manly patriotism required he should give a generous support.
This temper runs through the whole of the letter under review. His first charge is, “That Major-General Polk took from me by orders successively three quartermasters, two commissaries, my surgeon, engineer, and ordnance officer, and assigned none others, with this exception, viz, when he took my last quartermaster, he issued an order appointing a citizen of Memphis quartermaster with the rank of captain, and assigned him to duty with my division.77
To this my reply is, in the first place, it is not true, in the form in

﻿Chap. X.]
ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.
319
which it is put, so far as the commissaries and quartermasters are concerned ; and in the second place he had no right, under any law or order then existing, as a division commander, to a surgeon, engineer, or ordnance officer; and, thirdly, the appointment of Mr. Baugh as quartermaster, and his assignment to duty, was in perfect keeping with the invariable usage of the Tennessee Army, just transferred, and was sanctioned by the War Department as a necessity; fourth and lastly, that as commander-in-chief of the army in which he held command it was competent for me alone to judge of the exigencies of the service, and I had the right, as well as the power, to assign staff officers to duty wherever they could be most useful.
The patriotic eagerness with which he repudiated “ Citizen-Quartermaster Baugh,” and took the ground that he had been appointed only by the commanding general, and that to acknowledge him would be to allow of a trenching on the prerogative of the President, sat rather awkwardly on the lips of a man who at the same moment was clamorous for the services of another quartermaster whom he knew had precisely the same sort of commission, and none other. But the Secretary knew nothing of all this, and the artful statement served a present purpose.
The second charge is, “That General Polk had issued orders to the general staff, prohibiting their receiving orders from any one but himself.”
The “general staff77 was my staff, and this order was issued to put a stop to irregularities arising from the obtrusive intermeddling of General Pillow with the general staff and as a rebuke to his misplaced and officious zeal.
The long story which he next introduces, and which he prefaces as “the circumstances which led to my resignation,” concerning the perishing condition of the mules and horses and his zeal in saving them from destruction, is partly true and partly false. It is false that the mules and horses were dying at any time “in great numbers.” There is, indeed, no proof that they did at all for the want of food, for we were at no time in want of corn in the shuck or in sacks'; our chief want was hay, of which the lack of transportation made it very difficult to keep an adequate supply. It is true that he spoke to me on the subject of a want of forage, stating that complaint had been made of the want of it, and that he had, as I heard afterwards, ordered the depot quartermaster to procure forage for the army. It is also true for that act of officiousness I rebuked him sharply and with difficulty abstained from placing him under arrest.
The story about the declaration of martial law, with the flourish about “tyrants and usurpers” -and his “conscientious scruples about his transmitting his stainless name untarnished to the future historian of the war,” resolves itself simply into a discussion as to the name proper to be given to an officer to be appointed and intrusted with the military police of the town of which he was himself already the military commandant; the question being whether that officer should be designated provost-marshal or chief of police^ he taking ground against the former.
As to the statement about my “exasperation to excessive rage,” I leave that to the contempt to which its shameless effrontry entitles it.
The next ground of complaint is one which is entirely new, of which, though in constant habits of intercourse with me after the event, I had never heard until I saw it inserted in this letter. It is in regard to the battle of Belmont, and constitutes, indeed, the only matter of any consequence in his communication.

[Chap. X.
General Pillow, in his narration of the events connected with this battle, states that, having been ordered over the river, he proceeded with the forces at his command, and—
Had barely time to get my troops in position, when I was assailed by a very large force. I immediately dispatched an officer to General Polk and requested him to reenforce me. Subsequently I dispatched another officer to General Polk, stating that I was engaged with a force three times the strength of my own, and that my ammunition was growing short, and requested him to re-enforce me promptly and send me ammunition. The fight waxed on, but no re-enforcements or ammunition came. I ultimately sent a third officer, saying that if I was not promptly re-enforced and furnished with ammunition I would be overwhelmed by the enemy. My battery was now silenced for want of ammunition, and one regiment and a battalion had expended their ammunition; still I got neither re-enforcements nor ammunition. Being now without the means of keeping up a line of fire, and pressed hard by the enemy, I had nothing left me but the bayonet, and I ordered the charge, and drove back the enemy’s line against his strong reserve; but I could not break his line, and was compelled to fall back to my original position. The enemy’s line was then again advancing upon me. I repeated the charge the second and third times with like results, but still no support reached me. After four hours of hard fighting against a force of three times my own, and after a loss of quite one-fourth the force engaged, to save my command from total destruction I at last ordered the line to fall back to the river bank. There I met with Colonel Walker’s regiment, the first support sent me.
How General Pillow could have risked himself in making such a statement as the above, when he knew that witnesses abounded who could disprove all that was material in it, is difficult to account for, except upon the principle that the power to believe one’s own inventions, like all other powers, grows upon what it feeds and is strengthened by exercise.
I have taken the trouble to obtain the written, testimony of all the colonels of regiments who were under his command on that occasion, as well as that of some others, colonels of regiments and others, all of whom testify to what they personally know of the matter.
The papers containing this testimony are herewith transmitted, and are marked from A to M, inclusive.*
We have seen what General Pillow’s statement is as to the time of getting into position.
“ The statement of Colonel Tappan (vide No. 34), on the contrary, is that instead of his having barely time to form his line before he was attacked, “he was in position above three-quarters of an hour.” Lieutenant-Colonel Bell, of the Twelfth Tennessee Volunteers, says u one hour.”
The object to be accomplished in making the time short was to find an excuse for taking a bad position.
General Pillow says he was “ four long hours” without ammunition or re-enforcements, although he had sent three times for them.
Major Winslow (vide No. 38), there acting as my aide-de camp, states that he was sent by me over the river to General Pillow with orders before the fight began; that General Pillow requested him to ask me for a regiment of infantry and a section of artillery as a reserve; that he immediately crossed the river to return, and, while crossing, the battle opened (it is generally agreed that the battle opened from 20 to 30 minutes past 10 o’clock). He adds that a squadron of horse and two batteries of artillery were immediately sent forward.
Brig. Gen. Preston Smith, then colonel of the One hundred and fifty-fourth Begiment of Tennessee Volunteers, acting on the 7th as general officer of the day, says (vide No. 26): “Between the hours of 9 and 10

a. m. of that day, by my order, he caused the Second Regiment Tennessee Volunteers, Col. J. Knox Walker commanding, to be moved down to the river and seut over to Brigadier-General Pillow, commanding the troops at Belmont.”
Lieutenant-Colonel Ross, of the Second Regirhent of Tennessee Volunteers, says his regiment left his camp “at 10 o’clock and proceeded across the river, and arrived on the field of battle between 10 and 11 o’clock.” His officers say (vide No. 17) by 10.30 o’clock.
Here, then, are one regiment, two batteries, and a squadron of horse, not only before the expiration of “four long hours,” but before the lapse of half an hour.
General Smith also says (vide No. 26): “ Immediately after the Second Regiment was brought forward to the river and embarked, by your order, I brought down the Fifteenth Regiment Tennessee Volunteers, and sent the regiment over to Belmont.”
This statement of General Smith’s is supported by that of the officers of the regiment, as furnished by its present commander, Col. R. C. Tyler (vide No. 22), who says it “ passed over between 10 and 11 o’clock.” We have thus a second regiment.
General Smith says (vide No. 26): “ The Eleventh Louisiana Regiment, Colonel Marks commanding, was also sent over immediately after the Fifteenth Tennessee.”
Lieutenant-Colonel Barrow, commanding the Eleventh Louisiana on that day, says (vide No. 35): “ The Eleventh Louisiana Regiment received orders to leave their camp to cross the river on the 7th of November between 10.30.and 11 o’clock a. m. It reached the river in double-quick in about 10 minutes ; there found a regiment waiting to cross (the Fifteenth Tennessee) which preceded the Eleventh Louisiana about 15 minutes. Our regiment was landed at Belmont between 11.15 and 11.30 o’clock, and engaged the enemy a few minutes before 12 m.” This is the third re enforcing regiment. Others, as the One hundred and fifty-fourth Tennessee and Blythe’s Mississippi regiments, composing part of General Cheatham’s division, were brought to the river bank, but in consequence of the fierceness of the fire of the enemy on our transports and the width of the river, some delay was inevitable. They, however, were taken over by myself under the cover of the enemy’s guns, and united in completing the rout of the enemy, driving him to his boats and in his boats up the river.
The first check experienced by the enemy was produced by a crossfire of artillery which I had directed from a light battery placed on the river bank opposite his own battery and from the heavy batteries of the fort. This fire, which was very heavy and destructive, drove him from the field, and started him for his boats.
As he turned to retire he encountered Colonel Marks on his flank first, and then the forces of General Pillow’s army—over which he had lost control—which had been rallied, under my orders, by General Cheatham. These troops, with those from Cheatham’s division, taken over by me—their commander having been sent forward to rally the shattered regiments wandering on the river bank—completed the rout.
Thus far, then, as to re-enforcements, which he had asked for and never received.
But he was as ill-used as to ammunition as he was to re-enforcements, having to fight “ four long hours ” without receiving an additional supply of that, and was compelled to make three successive and 21 r r—VOL III

﻿322	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
desperate, but “ successful, charges with the bayonet,” “ driving back the enemy on his heavy reserves.”
He had five regiments under his command.
The testimony of Colonel Tappan, Thirteenth Arkansas {vide No. 34), is that his regiment “ did not get out of ammunition at any time during the day”; of Colonel Pickett, Twenty-first Tennessee (vide No. 23), “ that his did not give out till 2 p. m.”
Colonel Bussell, Twelfth Tennessee, says (vide No. 18) “ he got out of ammunition,” but directed “ his men to get more out of boxes,” which he told me privately General Pillow had told him “ were under the river bank, where he found them.”
Colonel Freeman, Twenty-second Tennessee, says (videNo. 24) “he does not think that any of his companies got out of ammunition entirely during the day”; that his officers, “when his ammunition was getting low, saw ammunition landing from a boat, helped themselves, and distributed to the men.”
Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan, Thirteenth Tennessee, says (vide No. 21) “ he was nearly out, but being ordered to retire to the river bank, where he would find a fresh supply, he proceeded thither, and helped himself.”
It does not appear, then, that of the five regiments under General Pillow’s command, any one of them was at any time during the first “four long hours” of the fight out of ammunition except that of Colonel Bussell, and while it is not certain that his was entirely out, it appears he found a supply ready at hand, and, as I have remarked, Colonel Bussell told me privately he was directed to that ammunition by General Pillow himself.
Besides this testimony, General Smith (vide No. 26) says, in reference to the supplies of ammunition sent over to Belmont, “ I have to say that between the hours of 11 a. m. and 1 p. m. several requests from General Pillow were received, asking that ammunition be sent over, all of which were promptly attended to by myself and Captain Sharpe, Company A, Blythe’s Mississippi regiment, who was brigade officer of the day for my brigade, and whom I had directed to remain near me to render such assistance as I might require. I attended to the shipment of this ammunition in person.”
See also (No. 39) statement of Captain Butler, of steamer Prince, who transported it, to the same effect.
It was, however, necessary for General Pillow to have his troops get out of ammunition to warrant the three desperate bayonet charges which he says he made in quick succession.
He says, “Getting neither re-enforcements nor ammunition, and being without the means of keeping up a line of fire, and pressed hard by the enemy, I had nothing left me but the bayonet; I ordered the charge, and "drove back the enemy’s line against his strong reserves.”
This, he says, he did “ again ” and yet “ again,” making three of such charges. He then adds, “After four hours of hard fighting against a force [of] three times my own, and after a loss of quite a fourth of the forces engaged, to save my command I at last ordered the line to fall back to the river bank. There I met with Col. Knox Walker’s regiment, the first support sent me.”
As to these three several bayonet charges, see the statements of colonels, already referred to.
Colonel Bussell says his regiment “ charged the enemy but once in the forenoon,” but says nothing of the effects of that charge.
Colonel Tappan says:
We had been engaged about three-quarters of an hour, when the order was given to pharge. As the enemy was not visible to my regiment up to this time, being posted

in the woods, distant 150 or 200 yards, I thought that there was evidently a mistake as to the order, but seeing Colonel Russell’s regiment preparing to move, I ordered my regiment to charge.
The whole line charged up some 70 yards, when, after a few rounds, we fell back by order to our original position. This was the only charge made by my regiment while under the command of General Pillow, and it was the only charge made by the troops in general lino of battle. I am satisfied the troops [enemy] were at least 75 yards distant when we Halted in the charge.
Colonel Freeman states: “We charged about 50 yards into the timber, where we saw the line of the enemy, which was then 75 or 100 yards distant from my own men.” He adds: “We did not reach the position of the enemy nearer than this.”
Colonel Pickett states he received “ but one order to charge, and charged once only”; that his regiment had “fired some seven or eight rounds oiily before the order to charge was received,” but does not say he reached the enemy.
Colonel Vaughan, of the remaining regiment, says: “During the engagement the Thirteenth Begiment came to no direct bayonet charge, and if an order was given to charge, it was not received by the Thirteenth Begiment.”
Comment upon such testimony is unnecessary.
I have now followed this reckless egotist through the extraordinary statement of his characteristic letter, and on the points of material consequence have taken pains to supply the written testimony necessary not only to disprove his allegations, but to fasten upon him a defiant disregard of the obligations of the truth.
He does me but justice in saying that the reason why I did not throw over a larger force from Columbus was that “ I was apprehensive of another attack upon the Columbus side.” I was apprehensive of it, and with reason 5 and it was because I feared it that I deemed it prudent to postpone to the last moment diminishing my force on the really important side of the river. I believed then as now that a plan of attacking both sides of the river had been concerted.
The proofs in my possession did not allow me to doubt it before the battle commenced, and the denunciation of the officers charged with attacking Columbus from the Kentucky side for failing in that attempt, to say nothing of other evidence which came to light after the battle, was conclusive on that point. The denunciation alluded to emanated from an officer of high rank in the Federal Army, and was heard by one of niy own officers while a prisoner during the enemy’s retreat.
The secret of the assault contained in that part of the letter of General Pillow devoted to the battle of Belmont is found in the necessity he felt for some one on whom to visit the blame which so properly attaches to his con duct for the egregious blunders committ ed by him in that battle—blunders which were obvious to his colonels at the moment they were committed—not one of whom supported him in the choice of the position taken by him, but the contrary. He neither took advantage of the standing timber nor of the abatis lying along the river front, nor of any one of a series of ravines lying parallel to the lines of the enemy’s approach, but, as stated in the answer of Colonel Freeman (vide Ko. 24), “posted his troops in an open field, on the top of a ridge,” just in advance of those ravines, uncovered, to be attacked by the enemy under the protection of the standing trees and abatis.
At such a disadvantage, it was not difficult to account for the speedy and disastrous termination of the fight or the mortifying scenes witnessed on the river bank at 12 m., as described by Captain Trask {vide Ko. 40) and seen by all. Such a mode of accounting for it did not suit the

general’s ideas of Ills duty to himself. The temptation to shield himself and throw the responsibility of failure on some one else was one he had never accustomed himself to resist, and therefore a plea of a want of re-enforcements, a lack of ammunition, and the necessity for desperate bayonet charges. How far he has been successful in this the testimony of the officers alluded to will show.
Of General Pillow’s personal bearing on the field I have spoken in my official report of the battle in such terms as the information brought me at the time warranted. I am not concerned to reopen the question as to the justness of the opinion then expressed. Of the disaster itself 1 said no more than I thought necessary, willing for the sake of the cause, especially as we had triumphed, to throw a vail over all errors committed } yet nothing is better known than that General Pillow was badly beaten on that occasion, and that he was rescued from annihilation by the cross-fire of the fixed and field batteries and by the timely aid of Colonel Marks and General Cheatham.
He says I sent for him after his resignation and asked the reason. This is true, and the account of that interview is as correct as he is capable of giving, where his interests tempt him to pervert a conversation. His statement as to my saying he was right in his views as to the staff, the asking his forgiveness for errors committed and wrongs done him, is simply another evidence of his bluntness of perception in one direction and sharpness of vision in another.
He concludes by saying that he is informed—
That the army, deeply distressed at my departure, were engaged in addressing a respectful petition to the President, expressive of their confidence in me, and requesting him to order me hack, when General Polk issued an order intended to suppress this respectful appeal to the President, thus stifling the honest convictions of the army and the sympathy so. naturally arising from his injustice to me.
In reply to this piece of art I have to say I had good reason to believe the whole thing was an affair of his own contrivance to foster insubordination for his advantage, and, being in direct violation of No. 26, Army Regulations, I suppressed it.
In conclusion, he remarks that he had u enjoyed an intimate friendship with General Polk for twenty-five years,” &c. If any intercourse which was the fruit of what he regarded as an u intimate friendship” during that period has been profitable or gratifying to him, I am glad of it. I am compelled to say, however, that while I must confess to an acquaintance for that length of time, so far from its inducing me to admit him to relations which might be dignified by friendship, I have every year found increasing reasons for caution in exposing myself to an unguarded intercourse, and my army experience has not diminished my sense of the importance of such vigilance.
I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

GID. J. PILLOW,
Brigadier- General.
Col. Mackall, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Hdqrs. First Division Army at Columbus,
November 10, 1861.
Under instructions delivered in person b}r Major-General Polk, on the morning of the 7th instant I crossed to the village of Belmont, on the Missouri shore, four regiments of my division, and rapidly as possible placed them in position about 400 yards from the river bank, in line with Colonel Tappan’s regiment and Colonel Beltzhoover’s battery, to receive the large force of the enemy advancing on the small encampment at that place. These regiments, from measles and diseases incident to the Mississippi bottom and absentees, had been reduced to below 500 men for duty, as shown by the daily morning report. They were formed into line of battle with Colonel Wright’s regiment on the left of Colonel Beltzhoover’s battery, and with Colonels Pickett’s, Freeman’s, Tappan’s, and Bussell’s regiments on the right, the last now under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bell, of the battery. These regiments, all told, numbered about 2,500 men.
Before the line of battle was formed I advanced three companies of skirmishers, taken from the regiments of Colonels Tappan, Pickett, and Freeman, under the command of Adjutant Stith, of Freeman’s regiment, to check the advancing column, so as to give me time to make the necessary dispositions for battle, using the utmost possible dispatch. I had barely got the forces in position when the skirmishers were driven in and the shock took place between the opposing forces. Had I been less pressed for time to make the necessary disposition of my small force, my imperfect knowledge of the surroundings of the field would of itself have embarrassed me $ but I had no choice of position, nor time to make any reconnaissance, nor even satisfactory disposition for occupying the field left me.
When the conflict commenced and both lines were fairly engaged I soon observed the enemy’s cavalry turning my left flank and hovering around me, closing the field nearly to the river. Having no cavalry at hand, I was under the necessity of ordering a portion of my force engaged with the enemy in front, weak as was that force, to protect me from that body of cavalry, said to be 450 strong. For this purpose orders were given to Colonel Wright to detach one company of his regiment. He accordingly assigned this duty to Company A, then commanded by Lieutenant Bhea. Several attempts were made by the enemy’s infantry to flank my right and left wings, but the attempt on the right was defeated by the deadly fire and firm attitude of that wing, comprised of the regiments of Colonels Bussell and Tappan, commanded by Colonel Bussell, as brigade commander. The attempt to turn the left wing was defeated by the. destructive fire of Beltzhoover’s battery and Colonel Wright’s regiment, aided by a line of felled timber extend-

ing obliquely from tbe left into the bottom. In these attempts of the enemy and the movement of the troops it was easy to see that his force was large enough to have surrounded my little force with triple lines.
Failing in these efforts to flank my position he pressed heavily forward the advance line, and braced it firmly with his large reserve. I advised Major-General Polk of my position and of the strength of the enemy, and asked for support and a supply of ammunition, which was becoming short from the constant and heavy fire which was required to check the advance of the determined foe. The two wings of the lines stood firm and unbroken for several hours, but the center, consisting of Colonels Pickett’s and Freeman’s regiments, being iq the open field and greatly exposed, once or twice faltered, but my own and the efforts of their officers were promptly returned to their original position, and continued the conflict.
At length Colonel Beltzhoover reported to me that his ammunition was exhausted. Colonel Bell had previously reported his regiment out of ammunition, and Colonel Wright that one battalion of his regiment had exhausted its ammunition. I directed Colonel Beltzhoover to re move his guns to the rear. The team of one gun had run off with the limber, leaving the gun in its position of battery. The others were drawn to the river bank, and Colonel Beltzhoover applied to me to assist him in removing the gun, which he could not remove. I rode up to the right wing of Colonel Wright’s regiment for the purpose of directing a detail of men to remove this gun, but that regiment was'so hotly engaged with the enemy, and were in such close proximity to him, that I thought it better to let the gun go, even if it should be ultimately lost, than to weaken the small force which then held in check the enemy’s masses, pressing heavily upon the regiment.
My battery being silenced for want of ammunition, and one regiment and a battalion having exhausted its supply, and the enemy’s force being unchecked and now emerging into the edge of the field, I ordered the line to use the bayonet. The charge was made by the whole line, and the enemy driven back into the woods. But his line was not broken, and he kept up a deadly fire, and being supported by his large reserve, my line was forced back to its original position, while that of the enemy advanced. The charge was repeated the second and the third time, forcing the enemy’s line heavily against his reserve, but with like result.
Finding it impossible longer to maintain my position without reenforcements and ammunition, I ordered the whole line to fall back to the river bank. In this movement my line was more or less broken, and my corps mingled together, so that when we reached the river bank it had the appearance of a mass of men rather than an organized corps. On my arrival in the rear of the command I met Col. J. K. Walker, of my own division, with his regiment coming to my support. I ordered him to advance his regiment as promptly as possible to check the advance of the enemy’s force and hold him back, so as to give me time to move the force up the river bank and to form the commands, and said to him that I would cross through the fallen timber, turn the enemy’s position, and attack him in the rear. Colonel Walker’s regiment promptly advanced, with the enemy’s force in the open field, and held him in check until his line of fire and artillery had cut down a large portion of the regiment, when it was forced back, and sheltered itself under the bank of the river, from which position the regiment kept up a constant fire while it moved by the flank up the river bank. When the enemy’s force reached the bank of the river he was met by the fire of Captain Smith’s battery (of General Cheatham’s divisiop) from the op-

posite side of the river, which being well directed, together with that of the heavy guns from the works above Columbus, made him recoil from the front.
In the mean time I had advanced the main body of my original force in broken order up the river to a point where I could cross through the fallen timber to make the flank movement. There I met Colonel Marks’, of Brig. Gen. J. P. McCown’s division, and Colonel Carroll’s (of my own division) regiments, ordered by Major-General Polk to my support. I immediately placed these fresh troops under the command of the gallant old veteran Colonel Marks, at the head of the column, and directed him to lead the advance in double-quick time through the woods and to the enemy’s rear, and to attack him with vigor, telling him that I would support the movement with all the forces formerly engaged, though from their conflict of four hours with such superior numbers it was hardly to be expected that they could act with the same vigor as the fresh troops. In this movement I directed Colonel Russell, who was commanding a brigade, and who had throughout the day promptly executed all my orders and aided me with disposition and movements, to rally and push forward his command to the support of Colonel Marks’ attacking column. My brave young friend Capt. W. H. Jackson, who reported to me for duty on my staff (being wholly unable to get his light battery on shore), I directed to lead this column against the enemy’s rear. The movement was promptly and gallantly made, and was a complete success. The enemy finding himself between two fires, that of Smith’s artillery in front and of Colonels Marks’ and Russell’s column in the rear, after a feeble resistance, broke and fled in great disorder, and was hotly pursued by our troops.
The brave General Cheatham, now having reached that part of the field, by his presence added new vigor to the pursuit. The enemy’s forces were cut to pieces by a destructive fire until they had reached a point far in the bottom, when General Cheatham thought it prudent to halt the column and to bring up his brigade, which was on the way. Having returned to the river bank for that purpose, where he met General Polk (bringing with him Colonel Smith’s brigade, of General Cheatham’s division), who had now arrived, General Polk ordered the pursuit continued with the whole force, accompanying the pursuing column himself until we reached the point where the enemy had made his surgical headquarters and depository of stores of ammunition, baggage, &c. Here we found a yard full of knapsacks, arms, ammunition, blankets, overcoats, mess chest, horses, wagons, and dead and wounded men, with surgeons engaged in the appropriate duties of their profes- * sion. The enemy’s route of retreat was strewn likewise with many of these articles, and abundantly with blood, dead and wounded men. The pursuit was continued under the immediate command and direction of Major-General Polk until we came in sight of the enemy’s gunboats and transports.
Upon reaching the new field of duty, by direction of the major-general,
I ordered the victorious commands as they arrived to move as rapidly as possible through the corn field to the bank of the river, directing the different corps entering opposite the ground they would occupy on the river bank, and lining the bank for more than a mile, when, being in position, they should open their fire on the troops, and as the boats passed up the river to give the enemy their fire. I need not say that this whole movement was admirably executed. When the fire opened it wTas so hot and destructive that the troops on the boats rushed to the opposite side of the boats and had to be forced back by the bayonet to

prevent capsizing. They did not take time to unloose the cable, but cut all loose, and were compelled to run through the fire of sharpshooters" lining the bank for more than a mile. I also directed Captain Taylor’s company, of Lieutenant-Colonel Logwood’s battalion (Tennessee volunteers), with whom was Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, to pursue up the river bank the enemy’s cavalry and 2,000 of his infantry that could not be taken on board in their distressed condition. These last were so fleet of heel, and had got so good a start, that the cavalry could only overtake the stragglers and slow of foot, many of whom were made prisoners. These fine horsemen and admirable marksmen could not return, however, from such a pursuit without delivering with their rifles volleys of salutes to their Northern brethren, with whom they so much regretted to part, and whose better acquaintance they sought to make.
This ended the day, so glorious to our arms |hat its refulgence will be seen by the descendants of the gallant men who formed the army long after their remains shall have moldered into dust and all else lost in oblivion except the memory of their glorious deeds. That the small Spartan army which withstood the constant fire of three times their number for nearly four hours (a large portion of them being without ammunition) did its duty gallantly is manifest from the length and character of the conflict, the great inequality of numbers, and the result; that the officers were all at their posts, nobly meeting all their responsibilities, is proven by the fact that the field officers were nearly all dismounted, some of them having had two horses killed under them.
In the case of Colonel Beltzhoover, whose guns were lost, I deem it proper to say that when his ammunition was exhausted I ordered him to take his guns from the field. He brought them (all except one) to the bank of the river under a fire of the enemy, which it was easier to face than to retire from. The gun he had no means of removing was committed to my charge. He fought his guns gallantly until all his ammunition was exhausted, and then removed them with the retiring force as far as it was possible to remove them on the bank of the river. They were then abandoned. He had 45 of his horses killed, and all wounded except 1. This is the highest vindication of his almost unequaled gallantry. I am happy to say, however, that we recaptured all of those guns but two, and captured one of the enemy’s guns. We likewise captured arms, ammunition, knapsacks, ambulances, mess-chests, and portfolios of general officers, surgical instruments, and all the vast paraphernalia of an army, nearly sufficient for the wants of a new army.
In such a conflict of arms, illustrating so fully the superior mettle of the Southern soldier, a conflict in which all did their duty, it is impossible to discriminate. To mention individual officers or men who distinguished themselves would require a catalogue of the whole. I must content myself by referring the major-general to the reports of colonels and brigade commanders. To the noble dead, who have sacrificed their lives in vindication of the honor and rights of their country on the bloody field of Belmont, we may be excused for paying a last tribute of respect. They died like heroes. Many of them falling were seen still fighting until overwhelmed by superior numbers. Their noble spirits departed to Him who presided over the bloody field and crowned our arms with a victory scarcely having a parallel in history.
I am reluctant to close this report without special notice of my personal stall, more especially since they have no one else by whom testimony to their good behavior and gallant conduct can be borne. Major Finnie, my division quartermaster, and Captain Jackson (commanding one of

my splendid batteries, but in the action on duty on my staff) were dangerously wounded while executing my orders. Captain Jackson’s horse received six balls at the time he was himself wounded. Major Ilenry, my assistant a<Jjutant-general, had two horses killed under him. Captain Bethel’s horse was wounded. Lieutenant Pillow, my son, had his horse killed. Lieutenant Long, one of my aides-de-camp, alone escaped untouched. Colonel Burch, my legal aide, was absent under my orders upon important business connected with this department of the service. These facts prove them to have been at the post of duty. I need not add that they rendered me important aid in my trying and responsible position. The fact of two of them being cut down and the others demounted placed me for a large portion of the conflict in a position not a little embarrassing for want of staff officers. I must also acknowledge the very valuable assistance I received from Major Winslow, aide-de-camp to Major-Geneial Polk, who reported to me for duty, and who was active and efficient in bearing my orders the balance of the day, in doing which he was greatly exposed.
Small portions of the Mississippi and Tennessee cavalry, forming a portion of this army, reached me late in the conflict, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Logwood \ and Lieutenant-Colonel Miller, accompanying the command, reported with a small command upon my arrival upon the bank of the river, and were promptly placed in position to meet the enemy’s cavalry on the left. From this portion of the line I received no further trouble, and though no general conflict took place with the enemy, it was doubtless owing to the fact that he did not choose to accept a trial of strength at their hands.
Having spoken in words of not undeserved praise of the heroic little army that withstood for four hours three times their numbers of the picked troops of the enemy and of those brave officers and men of Generals Cheatham’s and McCown’s divisions, whose good fortune it was to participate in that brilliant achievement, and of the timely aid rendered from the field and fixed batteries already mentioned, I must be permitted to ascribe the glorious results, full of miraculous incidents, to the overruling providence of a merciful God, and to acknowledge thus officially and publicly my profound consciousness of His sustaining power over my own heart and resolution of purpose, and in shielding my person from the many perils with which my pathway through this dark and bloody field was beset.
That our loss should have been severe in such a conflict might be expected. That of the enemy’s was more than treble ours. Of this we had the most abundant evidence in the incidents on the field, in his flight, and his helpless condition when assailed in, his crowded transports, with the fire of thousands of deadly rifles. I transmit herewith a list* of our killed, wounded, and missing, numbering 632. Of this number 562 were of my own division and Tappan’s regiment, which constituted the force originally engaged.
We have no means of knowing accurately the loss of the enemy, but we buried of the enemy 295. The enemy, under a flag of truce, were engaged at the same labor a large portion of the day. We have near 200 Federal prisoners wounded, and the enemy had 7 ambulances (which we captured) actually engaged in taking their wounded from their surgical headquarters to their boats while the action was progressing. We have the most unquestionable information from persons who were in Cairo when the Federal fleet returned, who state that the enemy were a day and a half removing and burying their dead and wounded

from their boats; and all accounts from Cairo, and from persons who were with the boats during our fire, represent the fire on the enemy huddled on the transports was more destructive than that of any part of the battle. A captain of one of the transports of the enemy’s expedition represents the loss to be 1,800 or 2,000 men. With these sources of information, and all the light these afford, I think the enemy’s loss could not be less than 2,000 men.

I ordered our men to fire on them, which order was promptly obeyed; the enemy began to cut the horses loose without exchanging the fire; they succeeded in getting off with five of the horses. I advanced upon the battery, found it to be the Jeff’. Davis, and saw that she was not spiked; only one horse was captured with the piece. The first persons who came to my relief were Lieut. F. H. Williamson, of my own company; a Captain Hunt, of Colonel Tappan’s regiment; Captain Chew, of the Second Eegiment Tennessee Volunteers; and a quartermaster of the Thirteenth Arkansas Regiment, whose name I regret I did not learn. My remark to these gentlemen was that “Here is my prize!” I care nothing for any glory on the occasion, but I think we should have credit for what we have accomplished.

Topp, acting as aide-de-camp to Col. J. Knox Walker, who was in command of the brigade, reports that it was about 10.15 a. m. when we were on the boat crossing the river, and about 11 o’clock when we engaged in the battle. He also reports that before General Cheatham arrived, and while getting the men in line during the rally, he looked at his watch, and it was 2 p. m. Capt. Sam. Vance reports that it was about 10.15 a. m. when we left our encampment, and that we were landed on the Missouri side in about half an hour; that Col. Preston Smith brought the order for our march. Lieut. Jeff. Brady reports that he looked at his watch and it was 10.15 a. m. when we were on board of the boat on our way to the battle-field, and thinks we were in the battle by 10.30 a. m., and that it was 12.45 o’clock when the doctor was dressing his first wound; at the same time our men were retreating from the river bank. I think it was about 10 a. m. when we left our encampment, and engaged in battle before 11 a. m. We were detained a very few moments on the Kentucky side of the river. From all the information 1 can gather from the officers with whom I have conversed, and my opinion, we left our encampment and were in the battle between the hours of 10 and 11 a. m. on the morning of November 7 last, at the battle of Belmont, Mo.

Report of Col. R. If. Russell, Twelfth Tennessee Infantry.
Columbus, Ky., February 23, 1862.
Sir: Your note requesting an answer to certain questions in regard to the battle of Belmont has just been received. I subjoin your questions and my answers to them:
Question 1. Did your regiment get out of ammunition on the day of the battle of Belmont? If so, were you not informed by General Pillow, when you apprised him it was running short, that there was ammunition on the river bank at your disposal; and did not your messenger, or the messenger of Lieutenant-Colonel Bell, then in command, on going to the place indicated, find boxes of ammunition of various kinds, as stated ?
Answer. My regiment did get out of ammunition and I ordered a detail of men to proceed to the bank of the river, where they found ammunition. They carried some boxes to the regiment, but found the cartridges to be too large. They then went back to the river bank and got others and distributed a part of them, but did not get through before the regiment fell back.
Question 2. Did you receive orders for your regiment to charge the enemy with the bayonet during the battle? Was this order given and the charge made before youi messenger went after the ammunition or afterwards ?
Answer. I did receive orders for my regiment to charge with the bayonet. The order was given and the charge made while the messenger was gone after the ammunition.
Question —. Was the charge made because your ammunition being gone, you had nothing to rely upon but the bayonet ?
Answer. I do not know what influenced the commanding officer to order the charge.
Question 3. When you charged, did your regiment reach the position of the enemy and drive him back or did it stop short of his position ? If so, how far short ?
Answer. My belief is that it did not reach the position of the enemy by the distance of from 50 to 75 yards.
Question 4. Did you make more than one charge during the day ?
Answer. My regiment charged the enemy once in the forenoon in the woods and once in the afternoon in the open field.
Being assured that the above questions have been asked only for the purpose of getting at the true history of the battle of Belmont, I have consented to answer them, and have done so frankly and, as I believe, truthfully.

Tlie regiment was ordered to cross over the river at Columbus, Ky., at 9 o’clock on the morning of the 7th of November, 1861, and on its arrival on the Missouri shore was ordered into line of battle by Brigadier-General Pillow. The regiment took its position on the extreme right, its left resting on Colonel Tappan’s Arkansas regiment. We remained in this position for nearly an hour, when the enemy attacked us in strong force. Colonel Eussell (then commanding the brigade) gave us the order to charge, which was promptly obeyed, and we drove them back 30 or 40 yards. Finding that our new position was not a good one we fell back to our original position, which we held for three or four hours afterwards. During the time that we held this point my men got out of ammunition. I had sent for some twice, but the only kind that 1 got was the minie cartridge, a cartridge too small for the muskets used by my men. When the minie cartridges gave out we had to retreat to the bank of the river, where we obtained a full supply of the musket cartridge. We* again formed line and attacked the enemy, when he commenced to retreat to his gunboats.
Having made my report immediately after the engagement, an5 not having a copy of the same, I am unable to give you a full report.*

Report of Col. John V. Wright, Thirteenth Tennessee Infantry.
Hdqrs. Thirteenth Tennessee Regiment,
Columbus, Kg., November 8, 1861.
On yesterday morning at 9 o’clock, in obedience to orders, I caused my regiment to be formed, and marched rapidly to a position in front of headquarters of Brigadier-General Pillow. From thence I was ordered on board the steamer Prince, and conveyed across the river to the Missouri shore, where I was met by General Pillow, who ordered me to form my line as rapidly as possible on the extreme left and immediately to the left of Watson’s Battery of artillery. This last order was promptly obeyed by marching the regiment to the distance of three-quarters of a mile, to a position where we found the battery already posted. I was ordered by General Pillow in person to detach from my command a company to be sent to the left, and posted on a road leading down the river. I accordingly, through Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan, detached Company A, under the command of Lieutenant Matt. Rhea, for that purpose. I was then ordered by General Pillow to hold my position, and if the firing on the right (which had already commenced) should continue for any considerable time to move my regiment up to the right. My regiment was posted on an open field near the edge of the woods, and on ground considerably elevated. It was about 10 o’clock in the morning when I took my position on the field, and had been there but a short time until I was actively engaged by the enemy, who were posted behind the woods in my front. Though only about 80 yards in front of me, the obstructions were so numerous that the enemy could not be seen. My men returned the fire almost immedi-

ately, and stood their ground, bravely defending their position, though the killed and wounded were falling thick and fast on every side.
In a very short time after the attack commenced on me I heard a heavy fire of musketry on my left, and knew that Lieutenant Rhea, with his command, was engaging the enemy. I immediately communi cated this intelligence to General Pillow, meantime holding my position, my men receiving and returning an incessant fire. This was kept up for near an hour and a half; when I ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Yaughan to report to General Pillow that my ammunition was nearly exhausted and that my men were suffering greatly from the fire of the enemy. Colonel Yaughan returned, and brought with him orders from General Pillow for my regiment to retire. I gave the order, and the regiment retired to near the river, where some confusion occurred, and a portion of the regiment went up the rieer, led by Colonel Yaughan, and the balance followed me up the# bank of the river, taking protection from the artillery under the bank of the river. The two lines were united again at the upper landing, where I was ordered by Col. J. Knox Walker, commanding brigade, to fall in with my command on the left of the Second Tennessee Regiment and proceed to charge the enemy. This was done most promptly, and in a short time we found ourselves in the presence of the enemy, who were moving to the right. We formed line rapidly, and poured a most destructive fire upon them, my men shouting and huzzaing as they rushed on to the charge.
At this time I was on foot, having had my horse shot under me in the previous engagement. Here a great number of the enemy were killed and wounded and a great many prisoners captured. Soon after this I was ordered by General Pillow to halt my regiment and march back to the river with the prisoners, resupply my men with ammunition, and wait there for orders. I gave the order, but owing to the noise a large number of my men did not hear the command, and only a portion halted, the others continuing in pursuit of the flying enemy until they made their escape on the boats. They returned, bringing with them many more prisoners.
My loss was about 149 in killed, wounded, and missing; that is to say, 25 non-commissioned officers and privates and 2 commissioned officers killed, 73 privates wounded, and 49 missing. Most of those missing are from the company (A) which was sent out under Lieutenant Rhea as skirmishers, and are supposed to have been captured by the enemy attempting to rejoin the regiment. Captain Burton, of Company A, was not in command of his company, on account of sickness, but he was on the field near his men, and Lieutenants Rhea and Middlemas were both killed, fighting bravely. Captains Wisdom, Wilkins, Morgan, Pittman, and Latta were wounded, but not dangerously. Adjutant Morgan was slightly wounded in the arm, as was Surg. J. A. Forbes. Lieu tenant-Colonel Yaughan had two horses shot under him, and exposed himself, most gallantly discharging his duties. Lieutenant Arnold, of Company A, was slightly wounded in the breast. Lieutenant Edwards, of Company I, was wounded.
I feel that it is due I should mention the names of H. H. Falls and Arch. Houston, citizens of Tennessee, and Charles L. Roberts, citizen of Alabama, who were here temporarily, and who fell into the ranks and fought with the regiment during the engagement. Mr. Houston was wounded in the face by the bursting of a shell, and Mr. Roberts was killed early in the engagement.
I cannot speak in terms of praise too high were I to attempt to do justice to the gallant officers and men under my command. Though

unused to war, and in their first engagement, they stood and received a fire from the enemy which might have made veterans quail, and did not abandon their position until their object was accomplished, and they were ordered by General Pillow to retire. To mention all the individual acts of bravery and gallant bearing would make this report too lengthy. Suffice it to say that all, officers and men, behaved themselves bravely and coolly, and to my entire satisfaction.

John Y. Wright, was formed on the left of Watson’s Battery, and occupied the extreme left of our line of battle, which position it held until nearly the last round of ammunition was exhausted, when we received orders to retire to the bank of the river, where we would find a fresh supply. After supplying ourselves with ammunition the regiment was reformed and ordered to join in a flank movement to intercept the retreat of the enemy, which was promptly obeyed, and in a short time we came in sight of the fleeing enemy, whom we pursued to their gunboats, some distance up the river.
During the engagement the Thirteenth Tennessee Regiment came to no direct bayonet charge, and if an order was given to charge bayonets, it was never received by the Thirteenth Regiment.

having opened a sharp fire upon us apparently along’ the whole line. When we had fired some seven or eight roui ds, believing the firing to be ineffectual, I ordered it to cease, and remained in position. A few minutes elapsed, when, in obedience to an order from General Pillow, I ordered a charge. The order was obeyed with the greatest gallantry and spirit, in double-quick time, for some 200 yards, through open ground, to the edge of the woods, the latter portion of the distance under fire. Upon reaching the woods a tremendous fire of musketry suddenly opened upon my line from the concealed enemy at very short distance, when, seeing myself apparently unsupported in the charge on my right, I ordered a halt, and ordered my command to load and fire kneeling. The fire of the enemy was one continuous roar, showing the force immediately opposed to my regiment to be at least double its numbers and excellently armed. My command loaded and fired kneeling for some three-quarters of an hour with perfect coolness and determination, and during this time we sustained nearly all of our heavy loss, the enemy in front of us seeming to be re-enforced. The firing from our lines ceased on the right of my regiment, but did not abate in front of me, and learning that the center of our brigade had fallen back, the battery retiring, and that the enemy were outflanking us on the right and left, I ordered my command to withdraw, and form behind the first elevation in the rear of our position, and the color to be planted there. In this position I remained for some time awaiting orders, when, seeing a demonstration of the enemy on our front and left, I fired three or four rounds. At that time, our ammunition being nearly exhausted and no support being in sight, I ordered my command to retire and form at the levee, where, however, I succeeded in rallying but a portion of the regiment. While in this position the enemy’s flag was run up some 300 yards to our left, and we fired upon it our last cartridges—three rounds. At that time, having been engaged some hours, and our ammunition being exhausted, the first re-enforcement arrived, which I understood to be the Second Tennessee, and that they were ordered to the left, relieving my men, and our batteries opened from the east side of the river, in consequence of which I moved my command by the right flank farther up the river bank to refresh the men, collect the scattered, and get ammunition.
We were there when General Polk arrived, and I was ordered by him to remain there for orders. The only order which I afterwards received was to embark on the Prince for Columbus.
I may add that a more gallant charge was never made than that of the Twenty-first Regiment, nor was ever displayed greater heroism under a more galling fire for so long a period, under greater relative disadvantages of position. For particulars of casualties I refer to the report made by my adjutant this morning. I will only add in general that we had 78 killed and wounded, and of the latter were 4 captains out of 8 in the action and 5 lieutenants. Every mounted officer had his horse shot.	. .
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Colonel Twenty-first Regiment Tennessee Volunteers.

Hdqrs. First Division, Western Department,
Columbus, February 17, 1862. Colonel Pickett, Twenty-first Tennessee Volunteers:
The truth of history may require certain facts to be fixed by the testimony of parties best qualified to fix them. I have to ask, therefore, that you would at your earliest convenience reply to the following-inquiries :
1st. Did your regiment receive an order to charge the enemy during the battle of Belmont? If so, how many times was that order given and how many times did you charge?
2d. How many rounds had you fired before you were ordered to charge the first time?
3d. Did your regiment, when it charged, reach the position -occupied by the enemy, or did it for any reason halt before reaching it ?
4th. Did your regiment get out of ammunition during the battle ?
Respectfully, &e.,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding.
Hdqrs. Twenty-first Regiment Tenn. Vols.,
Near Tupelo, Miss., July 10, 1862.
Your note of the 8th instant,* making interrogatories in reference to the action of my regiment in the battle of Belmont, was received yesterday. I have to reply as follows :
1.	I received but one order to charge, and charged once only.
2.	My regiment had fired some seven or eight rounds before the order to charge was received.
3.	My regiment reached the skirt of the woods held by the enemy when the charge began, who fell back some 40 or 60 yards. I halted my regiment in the edge of the woods, because I was considerably in advance of my support on my right or left, believing the odds too great to proceed until supported. This position I held for a length of time estimated from three-quarters of an hour to an hour and a half under a galling fire, hoping that our line on my right and left would advance. It did not do so, and, the enemy beginning to turn my left, I fell back to a small ravine a short distance in rear of our original line of battle.
4.	My regiment got out of ammunition about 2 o’clock, as I suppose, having no time-piece. We got our supply near the river bank where you landed. I had sent my orderly to Columbus for it, and it was brought here by Capt. T. Y. Hyde, my quartermaster.
Allow me, general, in this connection, to say that when your official report of the battle was published there was a universal feeling of mortification and sense of injustice felt in my command, both by the officers and the men. We were barely mentioned as having been in the original line of battle, but no notice was made of their gallant unsupported charge made through an open field for 150 or 200 yards under a galling fire against a concealed foe, and of their holding the enemy in check for so long a space of time considerably in advance of the rest of our line.
We would be obliged to you, general, for placing us right on the
* No note of that date found; it may have been a repetition of the inquiries made in that of February 17, to which the above letter of Colonel Pickett is evidently an answer.

record, and I would be under personal obligations for such a statement for my own use as you may think proper. Please see Colonel Russell’s report; he commanded our brigade.

Report of Col. Thomas J. Freeman, Twenty-second Tennessee Infantry, in reply to interrogatories from General Polk.
Hdqrs. Twenty-second Regiment Tenn. Vols.,
February 23, 1862.
Dear Sir : In reply to the questions propounded in your note of today [copy following], in reference to the battle of November 7, last, at Belmont, I submit the following reply:
In answer to question No. 1, u Was I ordered to charge bayonet,” &c. % I reply, I was so ordered by General Pillow himself, under the following circumstances : My regiment was in the open field, but kneeling, and protected by a ridge that runs through the com field in which we were posted from the balls of the enemy. General Pillow rode up in the rear of the left wing of my regiment and asked the question if we could not charge and drive the rascals out. Captain Lindsay, of Company B, replied that he thought we could. I made no reply. General Pillow then asked me the same question, directing it to me by name. I replied I would charge if he ordered me to do it. He then said he ordered me to charge. 1 immediately ordered my regiment to charge bayonet, which they did. We did not reach the enemy’s position, but charged, I think, about 50 yards into the timber, over a fence, as we went. Before we reached the timber I think we had to pass over about 75 yards, crossing the fence mentioned. In crossing it my line was broken, and the men went into the woods in great disorder, but rushing on gallantly. I remember as I rode into the woods—which I did immediately in rear of the men who were foremost in the charge—seeing the line of the enemy, which I think was at least 75 or 100 yards from my own men, and in the midst of a forest of heavy Mississippi bottom -timber. My regiment did not reach the position of the enemy nearer than this, as an order was shouted along the line, coming from the left, to a Retire!” u Retire!” Whether the order came from General Pillow I do not know. The first I heard of it was as I plunged into the timber. A captain of mine was walking down towards the left wing shouting, u Retire; you are running into the fire of Pickett’s men and the artillery,” both of which were on my left. I ordered my men to go on and spurred my horse-on. We then began, as we entered the timber, to receive a most tremendous volley of musketry, and soon after the word passed down the line from the left to retire, and the men came back, passing me under a most tremendous fire. I give, as the reason why the men did not reach the enemy’s position, the above order (whether received from General Pillow or not I have never learned), and the further fact that I believe we would have been compelled to retire in a few moments by the tremendous fire of the enemy, which for a time seemed almost entirely

﻿340	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
concentrated at this point on my regiment; and my men would have had, from the place we started in the field, to charge, I think, between 150 and 200 yards to reach the enemy. He was not in view at the time we were ordered to charge, nor did we know his strength. In fact, the charge at the time into the timber was more like a plunge into the forest to ferret the enemy out and then drive him back, and it was because I could not see the propriety of the charge at the time that I made no reply to the general question of General Pillow, asking if we could not charge and drive the rascals—perhaps damned rascals—out. I thought it best to wait in my protected position in the field until the enemy came out, as he would have soon done in advancing upon us, and as soon as he was clear of the protection of the timber to have poured in my fire and then to have charged him and have driven him back, especially if my fire had produced confusion in his ranks, as I think it certainly would at point-blank range and in plain view. I think the charge was ill-judged and almost impossible to have been executed with success against an enemy in such numbers as he soon after developed and as I felt assured he had at the time the order was given me, and he at the same time enjoying the protection of the heavy timber for his men.
Second question : u Were you ordered to charge or make more than one charge F I answer, I have no knowledge of any other order to charge bayonet than the one I have referred to. We advanced on the enemy, firing for a short time in the fight in the timber in the woods near the river, about the time or just before he commenced to retire, but I do not think there was any order given, as far as I am informed, to charge bayonet.
Third question : As to getting out of ammunition, I answer, I think some of my companies had got short of ammunition when we got back to the river, and filled up their cartridge-boxes at the river, but I was never informed that there was any ammunition to be had by any one. One of my lieutenants, and perhaps some other officers, saw ammunition being landed from a boat, and helped themselves to it and distributed it to their men. I don’t think any company was out of ammunition entirely during the day.
In answer to the fourth question : At the time of the charge ordered by General Pillow I should say I certainly had in my companies an average of at least twenty-five rounds of ammunition to each man, some more and perhaps some less, but I hardly think there was any man who had less.
Fifth : As to the judiciousness of the position selected for the line of battle, I reply that I had the opinion at the time that no worse arrangement of our forces could have been made on the ground than was made, and that opinion is confirmed by an examination of the ground since the battle. It is difficult to present the objections to the propriety of the position without a map of the field, as perhaps the objection that best applies may be stated in general terms to be that there was a total failure to take advantage of any protection that is abundantly furnished by the nature of the ground immediately in our rear, or to take any advantage of such protection at all, except that Lieutenant-Colonel Bell’s regiment, I think, was placed oh the extreme right, and protected by taking position in a narrow ravine with a ridge in front. Perhaps Colonel Tappan’s regiment may have been somewhat protected. My own regiment (the Twenty-second Tennessee) and Colonel Pickett’s (the Twenty-first Tennessee) were placed in an open corn field. The Twenty-second was posted in front of a rise in the ground behind which I ultimately placed them, the left extending from the

﻿Chap. X.] .
ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.
341
fence across this portion of the corn field, with this bank of what had been a ravine behind them, and in about 30 or 40 yards of the fence. Behind the fence a few paces was the forest, so that the enemy in approaching were concealed by the timber, while my men were in plain, open view in a corn field, having no protection whatever. As one of my men expressed it to me soon after the battle, he felt like he was fighting a duel with his enemy behind a tree and he in the open field. Immediately in my rear was a fence on a similar rise in the ground to the one in the field; behind this fence was a ravine, in which my men, and in fact two regiments, might have stood, have been protected by the fence and the ridge on which it was placed; could have been concealed here until the enemy had come into the field in front, when we could have swe^t the entire field with our bullets. The enemy would have been compelled to have approached my position through the open corn field for near 150 yards, perhaps farther, while we would have been comparatively defended. Colonels BelPs and Tappan’s regiments, being placed on my right* concealed in the same ravine, could have been used to flank the enemy on his left, while Colonel Wright, on the extreme left, would have rested on the wood beyond, where our artillery should have been placed. His regiment might have been moved round the edge of the woods so as to flank the enemy’s right, while our artillery would have had full play on his center as he approached my regiment and Colonel Pickett’s in the center of our line, and that while the enemy would have been compelled to march through the open field for several hundred yards. Had the position above indicated been ours after we reached the point where our line was formed, I think we could have conquered in one hour at most with but small loss.
However, I think a still better position might have been taken much nearer the river, which would have given us more time to have arranged our plan for the battle, as the enemy would have been longer in reaching us. Some 300 yards from where we landed is a ravine, or what is called a slough, the bank or rising ground of which would have given ample protection to a line of infantry. This ravine is the same, I believe, that runs down back of the fence, except it is deeper, I think, in the field at the point I mention. Between this fence and the river a large amount of timber had been cut down, forming an abatis, on which our right might have rested, and have been perfectly protected from the advance of the enemy if he had attempted to have outflanked us.
Our infantry could have been placed in this ravine, protected by its banks, until our line reached the timber. It might have been extended into the timber, in order to have had our extreme left protected. Our artillery, placed about the center of the field and of our line, could have played on the enemy at point-blank range as he approached, and that while he was entirely exposed in the open field, and have been supported and protected by the infantry concealed in the ravine only a few paces behind it, that could have swept the field clean of the enemy with musketry, and hardly have been exposed at all. He would have thus been exposed in the open field while we were protected. On the contrary, the enemy in the battle came up under cover of the woods, while we were, except on cur extreme right, in an open field, within point-blank range of the woods. 1 should say we ought to have been placed far enough back in the field to have compelled him to come out of the timber in the open field before he was in full range; that is, provided we were to be placed in the open field with woods all around it, except a narrow slip of the field that runs back to the river bank.
Another objection to the jfian of battle is that the field artillery we

﻿342	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. # [Chap. X.
had was placed so far on our left and in such position that I do not think five of the enemy were touched by a shot from it, and, besides, the enemy in his approach attacked first near our center my regiment [and] soon after Colonel Pickett’s, while entirely protected by the cover of the woods. He was able to pour in all his fire on us from the woods, while the artillery, although firing, wasted every shot among the trees firing at an unseen foe, the shot ranging from 20 to 30 feet generally above the heads of the enemy. Surely artillery should have been so placed as to fire on an advancing enemy before he is in proper distance to pour in the fire of his musketry. If the artillery had been placed with the open field in front of it, supported by our infantry, and the [enemy] compelled to pass over in approaching it, it might have sent destruction into the ranks cf the enemy, instead of simply scathing or shivering the trees of the forest as it did, doing no other damage whatever.
Such are, briefly as I can write it, some of the leading objections that present themselves to the plan of the battle adopted by General Pillow on the 7th. I have looked over the field once since the battle, and my conclusion then was that it would be very difficult to place our troops in a position where they would be more exposed to the fire of the enemy, except Colonel Bell’s regiment, and perhaps Colonel Tappan’s, and where he would be less exposed to injury from our fire.
These are the opinions I formed at the time, and have never seen any cause to change them. I may not be able to make my objections so clear as I would desire, from the difficulty of present ing the topography of a field distinctly in words, but I am confident that each objection I have presented to the position would be palpable to almost any man who would examine the ground or make himself at all familiar with it.
Perhaps it is proper to say that in giving distances I cannot be understood to do more than approximate to the true or precise distance, as I have only formed my opinion of these things from a survey of the field hastily made on the day of battle, as a matter of course, and in passing over it once since.
I have hastily written these things during repeated interruptions, and fear I have failed to express my views as clearly as is desirable, but the main objections are perhaps given in such form as to be understood.
I shall cheerfully contribute, and with great pleasure, too, to the cause of truth in this matter, as I think the public have had a most imperfect and incorrect impression made as to the true state of the facts of the battle of the 7th.
Most respectfully, yours, &c.,

The following are the questions I propose to propound to you, and which you were pleased to say you would answer:
1st. Were you ordered to charge the enemy with the bayonet during the day of the battle of the 7th November? If so, did your regiment reach the enemy’s position or did it stop short %

2d. Were you ordered to make more than one charge1?
3d. Did you get out of ammunition during the battle ? If so, were you informed there was ammunition on the river bank at your disposal, and by whom ?
4th. If you were short of ammunition at any time, was it after you had been ordered to charge or before ?
5th. What is your opinion of the judiciousness of the position selected for the line of battle % If objectionable, why ?
Your early reply to these inquiries will oblige, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Brig. Gen. B. F. Cheatham, C. S. Army, comdg. Second Division.
Headquarters, Camp Moore, November 8, 1861.
Sir: In obedience to the order of Major-General Polk I herewith transmit a report of the operations of the forces under my command in the engagement opposite Columbus on the 7th instant.
I remained with Major-General Polk near the battery on the hill until the hour of 10 a. m., when, under his orders, I rejoined my own division, having previously placed it in position, and awaited orders from him. At about the hour of 12.30 p. m. I received orders from Major-General Polk to bring forward to the river one of my brigades, and immediately advanced to that position the First Brigade, Col. Preston Smith commanding, composed of the One hundred and fifty-fourth Senior Begi-ment Tennessee Volunteers, commanded by Lieut. Col. Marcus J. Wright, and the regiment of Mississippi Volunteers, commanded by Col. A. K. Blythe, leaving the Second Brigade of my division, composed of the Sixth and Mnth Begiments Tennessee Volunteers, Col. William H. Stephens commanding, in possession of the right of our lines, which position was occupied by this brigade during the entire day.
On my arrival at the river bank fronting the town my command was drawn up preparatory to crossing to the opposite shore. Just at this time the enemy obtained possession of the field and camp, but recently occupied by the Thirteenth Arkansas Begiment and Captain Beltz-lioovePs light battery, and drove our troops under the river bank and up the stream to a point opposite the position occupied by the troops under my command, and brought forward their batteries close up to the river bank, and opened a brisk cannonade upon my troops and the steamers detailed to transport the command across the river. Seeing the impracticability of throwing the troops across the river at this time, resulting from the confusion of the transports underfire, their embarkation was suspended for a short time, and under the orders of Major-General Polk I proceeded with my staff aboard the steamboat Prince, to cross over and rally the large body of troops then on the opposite side of the river, and attack the enemy in the flank. Just as I was in the act of going aboard the steamer, not willing to lose the service of either one of my staff, I dispatched Lieutenant-Colonel Ashford, late of the Second Begiment Tennessee Volunteers, to inform Major-General Polk that I had placed the battery of Capt. Melancthon Smith, of the Second Brigade of my division, in the rear of the town near the hospital,

and to request him to send an order to Captain Smith to advance his battery to the river near the mill, and shell the camp and held before mentioned and at this time in the possession of the enemy, and I am happy to inform you that the order was executed in the most gallant and effective manner, and contributed not a little to the general success of the day.
Upon my arrival on the opposite side of the river I found the fragments of the Thirteenth Eegiment Arkansas Volunteers, Colonel Tappan; Second Eegiment Tennessee Volunteers, Colonel Walker 5 and Thirteenth Eegiment Tennessee Volunteers, Col. John V. Wright, formed and anxious to again confront the enemy. These regiments with others had already suffered severely in the engagement of the forenoon. In a few minutes these three regiments formed in line under my direction, the Thirteenth Arkansas in front, followed by the Second and Thirteenth Tennessee, and moved directly back from the river in the direction of the enemy’s transports and gunboats, intending, if possible, to take them in flank. Advancing about a half mile I suddenly came upon about 50 mounted men, who were hailed and found to be Illinois cavalry, and at the same moment and immediately in front I discovered a large body of troops, the Seventh Iowa and Colonel Logan’s Illinois Eegiment, drawn up inline of battle. I immediately ordered my column forward and formed a line in a small ravine, the Thirteenth Arkansas on the right, flanked by the Second and Thirteenth Tennessee, with some detached companies from other regiments, and at once opened upon the enemy a most terrific fire, and which they promptly returned, but under the rapid and galling fire of our columns the enemy soon wavered and were charged upon with the bayonet and completely routed, and under the continuous fire from our column in pursuit were slaughtered from that point to within a few hundred yards of their gunboats, lying more than 2 miles from the position in which we engaged them. Here it was that Capt. J. Welly Armstrong fell while gallantly calling to his men to follow him in the pursuit of the dismayed and retreating foe.
In this engagement we recaptured several pieces of artillery, took 40 of the enemy as^prisoners, besides a large number killed and wounded. After the rout began I sent forward with the troops my adjutant-general, James D. Porter, jr., and returned in the direction of Columbus to meet my own command, for which I had sent my aide-de-camp, Maj. F. H. McNairy, so soon as I discovered the enemy posted in front. On my arrival near the river I met Major-General Polk, and reported in person the rout of the enemy, and the successful operations of the forces under my command.
Colonel Smith in the mean time had succeeded in crossing the river with his brigade, and I immediately ordered him forward at double-quick, hoping to arrest the flying column of the enemy. On arriving at the dwelling-house used by the enemy as a hospital for the wounded General Polk came up with the head of his column, and remained with it until we arrived at a point directly opposite to the gunboats of the enemy, when under his order I directed Colonel Smith to move the heads of his command to the river above the boats of the enemy, and, facing by the rear rank, throw his left below them. Seeing the boats in the act of moving off, Lieutenant-Colonel Wright moved the right wing of the One hundred and fifty-fourth to the right and immediately in front of the enemy, and finding them hurrying on board, deployed his command as skirmishers, and opened a destructive fire on the enemy. The left wing of the One hundred and fifty-fourth, with Colonel Blythe’s Mississippi regiment, both under Colonel Smith, charged down

on the retreating boats and opened a fire upon them ; Lieutenant* Colonel Miller, of the First Battalion Mississippi Cavalry, with a part of his command, joined us here, and having dismounted his command, rendered important service in the attack on the gunboats. Before making the attack on the enemy’s boats I detailed Captain Fitzgerald, of Company F, One hundred and fifty-fourth Begiment, with 16 men as skirmishers, who after the attack rejoined the command, having killed 3 of the enemy and captured 8 prisoners; these, with 4 captured by Lieutenant-Colonel Wright’s command, were delivered over to the proper authorities. I have no means of ascertaining the amount of injury inflicted on the enemy by this attack on his transports, but conclude from the coolness and deliberation of my men in taking their aim that the slaughter must have been considerable.
On my return from the attack on the gunboats I detailed a force to bring in the wounded and prisoners. I also ordered Captain White, of the Tennessee cavalry, to proceed down the lake and look after a body of the enemy who were supposed to have retired in that direction. He reported on the following morning that he captured 8 prisoners.
In concluding this report I beg leave to return, through the major-general commanding, my thanks to the officers and men under my immediate command for the coolness, courage, and gallantry exhibited in the engagement at Belmont. To the two gentlemen composing my staff, Major Porter and Major MeNairy, I am much indebted for their zeal, promptness, and gallantry on the field, as I am also to John J. Campbell and Albot L. Bobertsou, two young gentlemen members of my military family, acting as volunteer aides, both boys in years, yet exhib iting the spirit of veterans. For a detailed report of the operations of my own division of the army I refer you to the copies of reports of Col. Preston Smith, commanding the First Brigade, Col. W. H. Stephens, commanding the Second Brigade, and Lieut. Col. John H. Miller, commanding First Mississippi Battalion of Cavalry, herewith forwarded.

Report of Col. Preston Smith, One hundred and fifty-fourth Tennessee Infantry, commanding First Brigade, Second Division, and his reply to interrogatories from General Polk.
Headquarters First Brigade,
Columbus, November 10, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit to you the following report of the part taken by my brigade in the engagement with the enemy in Missouri on the 7th instant, under instructions from headquarters.
At about 10 o’clock a. m. I ordered the One hundred and fifty-fourth Senior Begiment, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, and the Blythe Mississippi regiment, under command of Col. A. K. Blythe, to be put under arms on their respective regimental grounds, and held in readiness to move at a moment’s notice, with a full supply of ammunition.

﻿346	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
About 1 o’clock p. m. both these regiments were moved down to the river to be transported to the Missouri shore. While moving up Front street, the enemy on the opposite bank, having possession of Colonel Tappan’s camp, opened a brisk fire on my line with shell and grape, which was continued until the head of my command had reached the lower battery near Major-General Polk’s headquarters, when they changed their fire to the boats in waiting to carry us over, throwing shot and shell through and about the transports so frequently as to render it impracticable for us to go on board for some time. Their batteries having been silenced, my command was moved on board of the Kentucky and Charm, and quickly landed on the opposite shore. While my command was being formed, Brigadier-General Cheatham came up from the direction of the firing back in the woods, and ordered me to move the One hundred and fifty-fourth Senior forward in double-quick, as the enemy were driven back by the troops under his command previous to our arrival and were then in retreat. This was done under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, I accompanying them, and sending back Major McKairy to move Colonel Blythe forward, which was done. When about 5 or 6 miles above Columbus I discovered the transports of the enemy along the shore convoyed by two gunboats, and on which their troops were being embarked, they having thrown away everything calculated to impede their flight, the woods and fields being strewn with overcoats, knapsacks, cartridge-boxes, &c.
Major-General Polk, who, in company with Brigadier-General Pillow, had rejoined Brigadier-General Cheatham near this point, directed me to move the head of my command forward to the river, above the boats of the enemy, and, facing by the rear rank, throw my left below them, thus encircling and preventing them returning into the woods. While executing this order it became necessary to change the movement on account of obstacles, and believing them about to move off, I caused Lieutenant Colonel Wright to move the right wing of the One hundred and fifty-fourth Senior Begiment to the right and below the enemy, the left wing and Blythe’s regiment being led on to the river above by Brigadier-General Cheatham, and when opposite the transports, and distant some 200 yards, I gave the order to charge, which was most promptly and gallantly done; about one-half of the right wing being led in person by Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, who, finding the enemy hurrying on board, deployed those under his immediate command as skirmishers and opened a galling fire on the enemy.
The remainder of the right wing, by my order, deployed and fell on their center, and also opened their fire on the crowded and confused mass of the flying enemy. This fire was continued with great effect for more than half an hour. The gunboats of the enemy, having been cut loose from the shore, were moved out in the stream, opened a heavy fire with shell, grape, and canister, sweeping the ground occupied by the command, killing 1 man and wounding 12 others) a detail of which I have heretofore had the honor of submitting to you. The troops of the enemy having embarked, they cut their lines and steamed beyond the range of our guns. They continued to play on us from their gunboats, which occurring, I ordered the command to retire to cover near by, which was done in good order. Capt. Edward Fitzgerald, of Company F, who had been sent with 16 men as skirmishers, rejoined the command, reporting 8 prisoners—1 lieutenant, 1 sergeant, and 6 privates—and having also slain 3 of the enemy. These prisoners, with 4 others captured by the command under Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, were handed over to the proper authorities.

There were 27 muskets, some knapsacks, and clothing taken by the command, the first of which has been turned over to the quartermaster; also one mule, which has been reported to the quartermaster.
I cannot speak too highly of the bearing of the officers and men of my command. They displayed the greatest coolness and determined courage, and, although under fire for the first time, bore themselves like veterans, sustaining the reputation of Tennesseeans and Mississippians on the glorious battle-fields of New Orleans and Buena Yista.
I have also to report the taking of seven wagons, with a small lot of ammunition and officers7 camp furniture, by Lieutenant-Colonel Wright, which was brought down, under the orders of Major-General Polk, by Brigadier-General Cheatham and myself, and turned over to the Quartermasters Department.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General : In answer to your interrogatories I have to say that on November 7, 1861,1 was on duty as general officer of the day for the army at Columbus, Ky. As part of my duty I reported to you early on that morning information of the movements which I had acquired. I found you in the saddle, being already advised of the movements of the enemy. Notice was sent to the several brigade commanders to have their troops in hand ready to move at a moment’s notice, fully equipped for the field and ready for action.
Between the hours of 9 and 10 a. m. of that day, by your direction, 1 caused the Second Tennessee Regiment, Lieut. Col. W. B. Ross commanding, to be moved down to the river and sent over to Brigadier-General Pillow, commanding the troops at Belmont, this officer having gone over with several regiments at an early hour of the morning. Immediately after the Second Tennessee Regiment was brought forward to the river and embarked by your order I brought down the Fifteenth Tennessee Regiment, Maj. J. W. Hambleton commanding, and sent this regiment over to Belmont. The Eleventh Louisiana Regiment, Colonel Marks commanding, was also sent over immediately after the Fifteenth Tennessee; these last-named two regiments being crossed over by 10.30 a. m. or soon after. By this hour (10.30 a. m.) the light batteries of Captains Jackson and Polk had also been sent over on the steamboat H. W. R. Hill. A squadron of cavalry had been previously sent over under Lieutenant-Colonel Logwood.	•
In reference to the supply of ammunition sent over to Belmont I have to say that between the hours of 11 a. m. and 1 p. m. several requests from General Pillow were received, asking that ammunition be sent over, all of which were promptly attended to by myself and Captain Sharpe, Company A, Blythe’s Mississippi regiment, who was brigade officer of the day for my brigade, and whom I had directed to remain near me to render such assistance as I might require. I attended to the shipping of this ammunition in person. I remained near you at the river, except when absent to execute some order of yours, until about 1

p. m., when I received orders to move my brigade down to go forward to the battle ground. It is proper for me to add that on my return to the river that evening, on my way back to Columbus after the engagement was over, my attention was called to the large quantities of ammunition at different places on the river bank, some fifty boxes being untouched, and which was brought over to Columbus on the morning of the 8th.

Report of Lieut Col. M. J. Wright, One hundred and fifty fourth Tennessee Infantry.
Hdqrs. 154th Senior Beghment Tenn. Vols.,
Columbus, Ky.j November 9,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit to you the following report of the part taken by my command in the engagement with the enemy on the 7th instant:
On the morning of that day, between 9 and 10 o’clock, in obedience to your order, I formed my regiment in line within the lines of my encampment, where we remained awaiting further orders until about 1 o’clock, when I was ordered to move to the river.
Having arrived on the bank of the river, after some little delay we embarked on board the steamer Kentucky nearly opposite the headquarters of Major-General Polk, and were soon afterwards landed on the opposite shore, where we formed, and were ordered by Brigadier’ General Cheatham to follow in pursuit of the retreating enemy. I moved the regiment in double-quick time in the direction indicated by General Cheatham, who led our advance, accompanied by yourself, Major-General Polk, and General Pillow.
At a distance of some one and a half or two miles I was ordered to halt and send out a party of skirmishers on the side of a neighboring corn field. In obedience to this order, I detailed Capt. Edward Fitzgerald, of Company F, and 16 of his men, and then moved up the road rapidly until we came in sight of the enemy’s boats, three in number, supported by two gunboats.
At this point we found large quantities of baggage scattered in the road, indicating that our pursuit had been very close. We moved from herS through a .corn field fronting the enemy’s fleet of boats, Colonel Smith leading the line, until we came to a lane dividing the field, and which led to the enemy’s boats, the left wing of the regiment, under lead of General Cheatham, having filed around the field and taken position on the left and up the river. As we passed down the lane I discovered an officer mounted in front of the boats, and evidently urging the rapid embarkation of the troops. I ordered the men to reserve their fire until Colonel Smith should have placed the leading companies in position on the right, which he immediately did, and a volley of well-directed musketry was immediately opened by the leading companies upon the boats. I ordered the companies in the rear to pass

around rapidly, take position in line, and commence firing. This order was promptly executed. The fire was at once returned by volleys of musketry from the boats and rapid discharges of grape, canister, and shell from the gunboats.
The fire was kept up on both sides with very little cessation for about one hour, when the boats, having succeeded in cutting their cables, moved out under cover of th<$ gunboats. As the gunboats ascended the river they continued their fire, and their new position giving them a better range of shot, Colonel Smith ordered us to fall back to the field on the right.
The boats being by this time out of gun-shot range, I directed Adjt. W. H. Stovall and a detail of 10 men to remain with me and gather up our wounded men off the field. This duty being performed, we took possession of seven wagons, a lot of harness, some blankets and trunks, which the enemy had left in their flight, and placed them in charge of a guard to be brought down on a boat, which General Pillow had informed me soon after the enemy retired he would have sent up. To insure the coming up of the boat promptly, I sent a horseman to General Polk requesting that it be sent up at once, and it was accordingly brought up by General Cheatham and Colonel Smith and all the captured property secured.
Our entire loss was 1 man killed and 12 wounded. The loss of the enemy was very heavy, but its extent I am unable to estimate correctly.
We took possession of a number of overcoats on our return $ also a considerable number of blankets, knapsacks, and clothing of all sorts left by the enemy in their retreat. We also captured some muskets, which have been turned over to the quartermaster of this regiment.
I cannot speak in terms too highly of the gallantry and coolness displayed by the men under my command or that of the company officers. It will suffice to say that all, both officers and men, showed themselves worthy of their positions, of the cause in which they are engaged, and of the lasting gratitude of their country.
Captain Fitzgerald, with his scouting party, captured 8 prisoners—a lieutenant, a sergeant, and 6 privates—and killed 3 in his skirmish. Four other prisoners were captured by men in my command—a surgeon and 3 privates—all of whom were delivered to the proper authorities.

Camp Moore, near Columbus, Ky.,
November 8, 1861.
Sir : In obedience to the order of Brig. Gen. B. F. Cheatham, I have the honor to report to you the part taken by the First Battalion of Mississippi Cavalry, under my command, in the engagement of the 7th instant, in which a glorious victory was achieved by our forces. And first allow me to record with gratitude the kind Providence which shielded us in the day of battle and saved so many from “the destruction that wasteth at noonday.”
The squadron of cavalry under the command of Capt. A. J. Bowles, consisting of the Thompson Cavalry and Bolivar Troop, Lieut. L. Jones commanding, were the only part of my command in the engagement, and I herewith hand you the report of Captain Bowles of his skirmishes with the enemy before the general engagement began. Those companies had been detached from my battalion for a month past, and encamped on the west side of the river, with the Thirteenth Arkansas Eegiment, Colonel Tappan commanding, and the Watson Battery, Captain Beltzhoover commanding, and acting as pickets and reconnaissants for those forces. In accordance with your order, it being expected that an attack would be made on the Kentucky side, my companies on the east side of the river were stationed as pickets on the different roads leading to Columbus. I crossed the river to join that portion of my command there, and reached the field about 10.30 o’clock a. m., and very soon the engagement opened. I am proud and happy to learn from the gallant Colonel Tappan, of the Thirteenth Arkansas Eegiment, that the two companies named above did the most effective service, and held the enemy in check most steadily until time was given to dispose our forces and form the line of battle. And I now also declare my high appreciation of the gallantry which I learned was displayed by Captain Bowles, of the Thompson Cavalry, and Lieutenant Jones, of the Bolivar Troop, and the noble men under their command. Soon after my arrival on the field, Captain Bowles and Lieutenant Jones came in with their companies and placed them at my disposal. By order of Brigadier-General Pillow, a position was assigned to me near the left wing, and very soon the battle raged in all its fury around us, and no men ever fought more bravely or retired more steadily when forced from their position by overwhelming numbers than did many in our lines. My men did their duty and retired in order to the river. I there received an order from Brigadier-General Pillow in person to meet the enemy below, who were attempting to flank us on the left. I immediately offered my squadron down the river along the narrow defile between

﻿Chap. X.]	ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.	351
the brink and the dense fallen timber on the right. At the mouth of this defile, about a quarter of a mile below the battle field, we met the Federal cavalry in full force, outnumbering us two or three to one. My men were thrown on the right into line and the fight began. Seeing our desperate position, with the enemy sweeping the field in our rear, the heavy fallen timber on our right, and the Federal cavalry in front, I felt that a desperate move alone could extricate my noble little band. I knew they were equal to the emergency, and in desperation I ordered u Charge,” and a charge” rang from a hundred voices; the enemy fled in wild confusion, and we were safe.
We followed until I learned that a regiment of infantry were in reserve below, and then ordered a halt. My men were then brought into line, and soon afterward Lieutenant-Colonel Logwood came up with Captain Taylor’s company of Tennessee cavalry and took his position on my left. Here we remained an hour and a half in agonizing suspense, learning that the enemy had swept everything before them to the river above us, and having the regiment of infantry and the force of cavalry between us and the battle-field. At one time they brought their force up in full view, but dared not make the attack. At last they withdrew, and feeling our way cautiously with advance guards and reconnoitering parties, we made- our way back to the battle-field, and then learned for the first time that the enemy had retreated. The squadron immediately dashed off in pursuit, overtook the rear of our forces about 1 mile from the battle-field, and came upon the enemy just as they entered their boats, but it was too late. We took our position above their boats, and for a half hour poured a destructive fire from our u Maynard rifles.” Thus- ended the terrible rout of our enemy, and a glorious victory was achieved by our forces. We had 1 man wounded, and 9 horses killed and a number wounded. My men demeaned themselves as became Mississippians, evincing cool courage and daring intrepidity.
My special commendation is due Adjutant L. Lobdel for the aid given me and the courage he displayed.

then ordered my companies to fall back, which was done in good order, and again took a position and repulsed their skirmishers a second time. This manner of fighting continued for an hour and a half, until we had fallen back upon our infantry. I then received orders from Brigadier-General Pillow to move to the extreme left of our lines, at which time Lieut. Ool. J. H.

In obedience to your instructions I have the honor to report the part my division (Third) took in the action of the 7th instant.
Early in the morning of the 7 th my advance picket reported two gunboats and transports coming down the river, and soon afterwards that the boats had landed on the Missouri shore and were disembarking troops. I at once advanced Capt. B. A. Stewart, Pointe Couple Battery, under the protection of Lieutenant-Colonel Kennedy, Louisiana Battalion. The two gunboats dropped down the river, and were at once engaged with Captain Stewart’s battery and Captain Hamilton’s siege-guns. The battery below also opened upon the gunboats. After half an hour’s engagement the boats were driven up the river. The major-general came upon the field and informed me that he anticipated an attack on this side.

In the mean time the enemy had landed a large force on the Missouri shore, and soon after engaged the forces sent to re-enforce Colonel Tappan, under the command of Brigadier-General Pillow. The enemy finally succeeded in reaching the river below Belmont, and planted a battery that played upon our boats. The gunboats again dropped down’ the river. About the same time I received information from the general commanding that a large force was on their side of the river. I saw that the plans of the enemy were to prevent re-enforcements from crossing the river. I sent an order to Lieutenant Humes to advance Captain Bankhead’s battery to the shore and drive the Federal battery and troops from the position they had taken, but this had been effected, by an order already given by the major-general, by Captain Smith’s battery and the rifled gun in the fort. The gunboat after an hour’s conflict again retired, after having come low enough down the river to throw shells into the works.
At about 11 o’clock I was informed that Colonel Marks’ regiment, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Barrow, Colonel Marks commanding First Brigade, was ordered to cross the river, Colonel Marks commanding. I saw with pride and pleasure the noble and decisive part their regiment played in the action. I send inclosed Colonel Marks’ report. Towards the close of the day, by order of the major-general, I sent Colonel Neely’s (Fourth Tennessee) regiment and Colonel Scott’s Twelfth Louisiana Regiment across the river, commanded by Colonel Neely. These regiments crossed too late to take an active part in the action. The heaviest fire from the gunboats was against the batteries of Capt. R. A. Stewart and Capt. S. H. I). Hamilton, resulting from their advanced position. They and their men deserve credit for the effective service rendered. The heavy battery under the command of Maj. A. P. Stewart rendered effective service both against the gunboats and the enemy across the river. It is proper here to state that I ad vanced Col. E. W. Gantt’s Arkansas regiment, not properly belonging to my division, upon the Milburn road, to report any attack from that quarter, in the execution of which order Colonel Gantt came very near losing his life from the bursting of a shell.
I take pleasure in commending the gallant conduct of my staff, Lieut. Balt. Barrow, acting assistant adjutant-general; Maj. George W. Mc-Cown, aide-de-camp; Maj. E. W. Dyer, quartermaster; Lieut. G. P. Smart, adjutant artillery, who remained with me during the day, and Capt. George T. Moorman, acting aide-de-camp, who were much exposed in the line of their duty—Major McCown and Captain Moorman on both sides of the river.
I regretted that I was deprived of the service of Major Bradford, adjutant-general, and Lieut. Henry S. Foote, jr., aide-de-camp, who was absent under orders. Sergt. E. M. Ross was much exposed, and useful in bringing me accurate information.
Major Butler, of the Eleventh Regiment, fell mortally wounded in advance of his regiment. Lieut. J. R. Alexander was killed, gallantly leading his men. Lieuts. R. R. Dennison and James Miller were wounded.
I send a list of the killed and wounded.* I am happy to say that all my command, wherever employed, exhibited coolness and decision.

Report of Col. 8. F. Marks, Eleventh Louisiana Infantry, commanding First Brigade, Third Division,
Headquarters First Brigade, Third Division,
Columbus, Kg., November 8, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on the morning of the 7th instant, after receiving your order to hold my brigade in readiness for further instructions, I received order from Major-General Polk to report at his headquarters with the Eleventh Begiment in reserve until further orders; in about fifteen minutes the general ordered me on board the steamer Charm, to proceed across the river to the Missouri side, and by a flank movement to attack the enemy in the rear. On landing I moved up along the river bank until I saw General Pillow, who gave me the same order, and instructed me as to the proper direction to obtain that position. 1 then directed the head of my column towards the point indicated by the general and where the fire of the enemy seemed to be the hottest. In about fifteen minutes I had reached a position beyond their fire, and moved up through the bushes until I came in view of a body of men, who appeared to be the enemy, drawn up in an open field towards our left, but partially hid from our view by an intervening rise of ground. They displayed or had amongst them a Confederate flag; at the same time a party on our right called out to us, “ For God’s sake, don’t fire on us ; we are friends.” I ordered my men to withhold their fire, thinking they might be so. I then ordered Major Butler to advance to the edge of the woods, to ascertain what regiment it was. As soon as they discovered the major the main body opened fire on him. I then ordered my men to commence firing, which they did rapidly and in gallant style. Lieutenant-Colonel Barrow, in immediate command of the Eleventh Begiment, at this moment brought up the left wing, placed them in line, and joined in the general fighting. In about hair an hour the enemy’s column, now separated in two divisions, the one trying to flank me on the right and the other on the left. I divided my command, and, with the assistance of Colonel Barrow, promptly seconded by all the officers of the line, got it in a position to front the enemy each way; we again opened a general fire for about an hour, at the expiration of which time the enemy broke and fled, hotly pursued by our troops for about half a mile, when I had them recalled and formed in line, at which General Polk arrived upon the field and ordered me to join General Cheatham (who had, I supposed, just arrived with fresh troops) in pursuit of the enemy which pursuit, led by General Polk, was continued; the enemy being constantly fired on by Cheatham’s command until they were driven under the batteries of their gunboats, which opened a terrible fire of shot, shell, and balls, to which we had no means of reply.
General Polk then ordered us to return to the bank of the river, as no further good could be accomplished by our muskets when opposed to their floating batteries. Our loss in this affair was, as per detailed statement herewith transmitted, 12 killed and 42 wounded; amongst them was the gallant Butler, who fell while bravely discharging his duty. Lieutenant Alexander, of the Cannon Guards, Company D, fell during the hottest of the fire, while gallantly cheering on his men to action. As to the enemy’s loss I cannot state with any accuracy, but we counted in the immediate range of our fire over a hundred dead bodies, besides a larger number wounded and prisoners 5 amongst the latter was Major McClurken, Thirtieth Illinois Begiment, who was, shot train his

horse while cheering on his men to attack our lines, and Adjutant Boler, Seventh Iowa Regiment, was brought in uninjured by Private McDonough and Corporal McDavitt, Dillon Guards. Private T. I. Long, Catahoula Greys, was brought to me by Lieut. Jos. H. Miller, Dillon Guards.
Where all, officers and men, behaved so gallantly, it would be invidious to discriminate. I cannot refrain, however, in this connection of speaking in terms of high commendation of the conduct of Col. R. H. Barrow during the whole engagement. To the coolness and promptness of Capt. John J. Barrow, Rosale Guards [Co. I], I feel confident I owe the preservation of ray life.
Capt. William H. Jackson, of light artillery, who was severely wounded in the heat of the engagement, I am requested by Colonel Barrow to tender the thanks of the Eleventh Louisiana Regiment for valuable and gallant service rendered. Private William G. Gaillor, of Memphis, belonging to Captain B alien tine’s company, Shelby Light Dragoons, who volunteered to go with Company A, of my command, to the battle, was severely wounded while gallantly doing his duty. In short, sir, in order to do justice to the Eleventh, I would have to refer you to its muster-roll. All did their duty and all deserve the thanks of their country.
Adjutant White, of the Eleventh, and Assistant Adjutant-General Langan, of First Brigade, have my thanks for valuable service rendered. W. E. Edwards was attached to my person, and behaved gallantly throughout the battle.

Report of Col. J, C. Tappan, Thirteenth Arkansas Infantry, with interrogatories from General Polk and answers thereto.
Columbus, Ky., November 9,1861.
Sir : On the morning of the 7th instant, about 7 o’clock, I received information from you that the enemy were landing troops on the Missouri side of the river, a few miles above town, with an order directing me to ascertain at once what they designed by such action and to get my command at Camp Johnston (opposite this place) ready for any emergency. I immediately ordered out the two cavalry companies of Colonel Miller’s Mississippi battalion, that were with us, Captain Montgomery and Captain Bowles (Captain Montgomery’s being commanded by Lieutenant Jones), directed them to proceed up the river to watch the enemy, and to report what they were doing; then ordered Colonel Beltzhoover, of the Watson Battery, to get ready, and had my own regiment formed in line of battle. After consultation with Colonel Beltzhoover, I directed two of his guns to be stationed on the south side of an old field back of my encampment, with Captain Pollard’s company of my regiment to sustain them, commanding one road. Four guns were placed on the northwest point of said field, with companies of Captain Hunt and Captain Harris ,r the balance of my regiment was formed on the right of said battery, about a hundred yards from the river and fronting from

it. I would here state that, before arranging my troops, one of the cavalry belonging to Captain Montgomery’s company returned, informing me that the enemy had landed a large force; that they were forming into line some 2J to 3 miles from our camp, witji a view, as was supposed, of making an attack upon us. We had been ready in line some twenty minutes or more, when Brigadier-General Pillow came up with Colonel Russell’s and Colonel Freeman’s Tennessee regiments and took command, directing my three companies left with the guns to return to the regiment, and putting Colonel Russell’s regiment on my right and Colonel Freeman’s regiment on my left, between the Watson Battery and my left wing, a little to the rear of the battery. This was about 9.30 or 10 o’clock in the morning. I am informed that Colonel Pickett’s Tennessee regiment came across the river about the same time and was placed in line on the left of the Watson Battery.
By order of General Pillow I sent out Captain Shelton’s company as skirmishers; they were absent some three quarters of an hour, when they were driven in by the enemy, who opened upon us with a heavy firing, and the engagement became general between them and our regiments on the right of the Watson Battery.
From the time my command took their position in readiness for the enemy and the commencement of the general engagement at least an hour "and a half elapsed, during which time we were advised every few minutes by our cavalry of the progress the enemy were making towards our line. My regiment was engaged over an hour and a half, being subjected to and returning the fire of an overpowering force of the enemy, when, Colonel Russell’s regiment getting out of ammunition, we gradually and in good order, without any confusion, retired through the timber recently cut down by my command to the bank of the river, where upon the bank I again formed my regiment into line. The regiment suffered more during the above period than at any other time during the day.
After our last formation we remained some half an hour exposed to the fire of the enemy, which we returned, when some of our troops, being overpowered by an overwhelming force, were compelled to retire, and my camp fell into the possession of the enemy, which they only partially destroyed. I then fell back some 150 yards up the river, where I again formed my line in connection with troops commanded by Col. J. Knox Walker, Lieutenant-Colonel Yaughan, of Colonel Wright’s Tennessee Regiment, and Major Stewart, of Colonel Freeman’s regiment. Just as our line was formed Brigadier-General Cheatham came across the river, leaving his forces to be brought over by yourself, took charge of our troops thus formed, and led us in person. We came across the enemy about 200 yards from the river, and for fifteen minutes or more the firing was exceedingly spirited on both sides. The order being given for a charge by General Cheatham, we rushed upon the enemy, killing a great many of them and causing them to run in great disorder and confusion. I pursued them some short distance, when we were overtaken by yourself, General Pillow, and directly afterwards by General Cheatham, with Colonel Smith’s Tennessee regiment and Colonel Blythe’s Mississippi regiment, who pursued the enemy to their boats. I take great pleasure in alluding to the gallant conduct of Colonel Beltzhoover, of the Watson Battery, who did great execution with his guns, and who only retired after getting out of ammunition. His report is herewith attached. The gallant conduct of the two cavalry companies before mentioned deserves to be referred to with praise. They watched the movements of the enemy, resisted their approach, and

kept us posted every few minutes. I lost 12 men killed, 45 wounded, and 25 missing.
The bearing and conduct of my officers and men, with scarcely an exception, is worthy of commendation. Although they were under a heavy fire for several hours they bore themselves gallantly, executing every order with coolness and without confusion. I would state that cavalry pickets were posted every night by my orders on the only two roads leading to the encampment, at a distance of from 2£ to 4 miles.
The night preceding the attack the pickets were out at their stations as usual and came in after light, after which time the enemy landed their boats. It was not necessary to keep out cavalry pickets during the day, from the fact that a view of the river and opposite country is so extensive from Columbus that I could have been more readily advised of the approach of the enemy from headquarters than by our pickets; as in this case we had sufficient notice of their approach from yourself.
. I have to report the capture of 130 guns, which have been turned over to the proper department.
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

vember 7 last at about a quarter to 9 o’clock. We had been in position at least half an hour when Brigadier-General Pillow came up and took command, changing my line and placing Colonel Russell’s regiment on my right and the regiments of Colonel Freeman, Colonel Pickett, and Colonel Wright on my left. We were in line after this last formation one hour or more before the general engagement commenced. We had been engaged fully three-quarters of an hour when an order to charge was given. As the enemy was not visible to my regiment up to this time, being posted in the woods and distant some 150 or 200 yards, I thought that there was evidently a mistake as to the order, but on seeing Colonel Russell’s regiment preparing to move, I ordered my regiment to charge. The whole line charged up some 70 yards, when, after a few rounds, we fell back by order to our original position. This was the only charge made by my regiment while under command of Brigadier-General Pillow, and it was the only charge made by the troops formed in the general line of battle. I am satisfied that the enemy were at least 75 yards distant from us when we halted in the charge, while to have advanced farther in the charge, we would have been in danger from our battery on our left and of being flanked by the enemy, who were in force on our right. We maintained our original position some half an hour after falling back, exposed to a most galling fire from the enemy, who advanced upon us as we fell back. My regiment did not get out of ammunition at any time during the day.
Being in command of the post at Belmont, I disposed of the forces I had charge of in such way as to guard the only two roads by which the enemy could approach my camp. Two guns of the Watson Battery were placed so as to cover the road that led round towards the river and extended up to my eamij. The balance of the guns (four in number) were stationed so as to guard the road that led directly across from the point at which the enemy landed, my regiment having been placed on the right of said guns so as to command the road and at the same time to protect the battery. My line vas formed in front of a field in the woods, which would have protected i i if it had been extended either on the right or left.
When Brigadier-General Pillow took command he removed the two guns from the lower road and placed them with the other guns. I would here state that it was in direction of said road that a regiment of the enemy came into the rear of our troops and took possession of my camp. General Pillow also moved my regiment back some 40 yards, so that my left extended up to the side of the field, placing Colonel Russell on my right in the woods, and Colonels Freeman, Pickett, and Wright on my left in the open field. I placed one of my companies with the two guns mentioned herein, and two of my companies with the four guns herein referred to, which companies were sent back to my regiment on Brigadier-General Pillow taking command.

We stood as thus placed until the arrival of Brigadier-General Pillow, who ordered your companies back to the regiment, and united my battery at the edge of the woods and the bend of the right-hand road from the usual landing of the enemy’s gunboats. There we stood doing our best until the whole line retreated to the river. At the river I formed in battery again, although I had no ammunition, and so remained until carried down the bank by the force of retreating troops. My loss is 2 killed and 8 wounded and missing; 45 horses killed; 2 guns missing.
I feel bound to mention, for your favorable notice, Lieut. 0. P. Ball, than whom a braver or more accomplished officer cannot be found, and Privates White and Frederick. I am afraid Lieutenant Ball is seriously wounded by being run over by a caisson.

Report of Maj. Henry Winslow, Aide-de-Camp.
Columbus, Ky., December 1, 1861.
General : I herewith communicate for your information the occurrences preceding and during the battle of Belmont:
On the morning of November 7, at 2.10 a. m., I was awakened by a messenger bearing dispatches from General Thompson, who was introduced into your room by me, and at daylight another messenger arrived, informing me that the Federals were landing troops on the Missouri side above Columbus. I immediately communicated the information to you, and was directed to proceed to the quarters of Brigadier-General McCown, and inform him of this fact, and also to direct him (General McCown) to send a strong force of infantry and cavalry in that direction on this side of the river. Having performed this duty, I proceeded up the river to obtain such information by personal observation as I deemed might be useful. With an excellent glass I watched their movements until I was satisfied as to their numbers and intention, which was reported by me to yourself.
About 10 a. m. I was directed by you to cross the river and carry some orders to General Pillow. This I did, finding him about 100 yards in advance of his line of battle (which was formed in an open field), returning from reconnoitering the enemy’s position. General Pillow requested me to say to you that he wished a regiment sent across and held in reserve on the bank of the river and a section or two of artillery. I immediately recrossed the river and made known to you his wishes.
The firing commenced when I was about half-way across the river. I suggested to you that a squadron of cavalry might be used to advantage, and was directed by you to order two companies from Colonel Logwood’s battalion to proceed at once across the river. Captains Jackson’s and Polk’s batteries were also ordered across.
About 12 m. I was ordered by you to recross the river and ascertain

﻿Chap X.1	ENGAGEMENT AT BELMONT, MO., ETC.	361
the progress of the battle. On arriving on the Missouri shore I found our troops retreating in some disorder up the river, the enemy having driven them back. I asked an officer the cause of this, and he replied that the men were out of ammunition. I directed him to supply himself from a quantity lying in boxes under the bank. 1 proceeded up the river, sending the men back who were under the bank for a supply, but found, upon an examination of the cartridge-boxes of several, both above and below the bank, that they had a good supply. Finding that the confusion was becoming worse, and the men inclined to rush upon the transports, I endeavored by expostulation and entreaties to halt them, but in vain. I then rode to the head of the colurnh, and applying the saber to the leading files it had the desired effect. By this time I had arrived in the vicinity of General Pillow, who had a regiment, or part of one, halted and in line, and to whom, being without staff officers, I volunteered my services for a time. I told him of your wish to know how the battle was going, to which he replied the men were falling back, and that he wished to make a flank movement upon the enemy. I reported to him there was plenty of ammunition on the bank of the river, and what I had done, stating to him that I had heard there was a scarcity, but that it was not so, and I asked him if the men could not be got to try the cold steel, to which he replied he had tried that, but could not get the men to stand it. I asked him for permission to make a trial myself, but he said he thought his present movement the best.
After remaining for some time with him I told him I must report to you the condition of things, and asked him if he had any communications to send to you, to which he replied to inform you of his intended flank movement.
1 crossed the river on the Prince about 2 o’clock and stated to you his message, and also that my opinion was that the battle was lost unless re-enforcements were sent across; that the troops were in retreat and appeared to have lost all confidence in their officers, and that I thought your presence alone would restore order and save the day. These re-enforcements were sent across and were followed by yourseif. When, after executing some orders given me by you, I joined you on the Missouri side the enemy were in full retreat.

I was present at the battle of Belmont; was in command of the Prince as captain. Went over to the battle-field about 9.30 o’clock with a part of General Pillow’s staff and staid upon the battle-field until about 11.30 or 12 o’clock, when I left, having been sent over to General Polk by General Pillow. 1 was sent to General Polk with a message from General Pillow to the effect that he must have ammunition and re-enforcements or he must withdraw his forces from the field. Ammunition had been sent for and brought over to the battle-field by

my boat, the Prince, previous to my being sent by General Pillow. This ammunition was lying in boxes on the bank neat* the water’s edge when I started with the message of General Pillow to General Polk about re-enforcements and ammunition..
I delivered the message from General Pillow to General Polk at about 12 or 12.30 o’clock, when he was standing upon the bank with his1 staff on the Columbus side of the river. As soon as 1 delivered the message % to General Polk he sent off one of his staff to have the ammunition put on my boat. I immediately took it across the river. I suppose I was not kept waiting for the ammunition more than ten minutes. When I was crossing the river with the message from General Pillow to General Polk I met the Charm and the H. E. W. Hill going across to the battle-field with re-enforcements.
Colonel Dougherty, of the Federal Army, about the close of the battle, was brought on my boat very badly wounded and evidently expecting to die. In answer to a question which I asked him, as to how the battle had gone, his remark was that we had routed them and whipped them like dogs. I asked him that if it was a fair question I would like to know how many men the Federals had on the field, and he told me between 7,000 and 8,000. I learned afterwards from him that he was acting brigadier that day.

Report of Capt. W. L. Trask, steamer Charm.
Columbus, Ky., February 14,1862. Sir: In answer to the following questions propounded by you, to wit: What service did you perform with the steamer Charm on November 7, 1861; also, at what time did you land certain troops'? I beg leave to make the following report:
At 8 o’clock on the morning of November 7, 1861, being in command of the steamer Charm, and lying at the wharf or landing at Columbus, having arrived that morning from below and just finished discharging our load, I received orders from headquarters to get up steam and hold myself in readiness for any emergency that might arise, as the enemy were reported landing in Lucas Bend, a short distance above, and an immediate attack was expected. A few minutes later we received orders from the quartermaster to transport a quantity of commissary stores across the river to Colonel Tappan’s (Thirteenth Arkansas) regiment. This duty I performed without delay.
At this time several regiments of troops were embarking on board the steamers Prince and H. E. W. Hill for transportation across the river. Upon our return to Columbus after delivering the commissary stores, at 9 a. m., Dr. Bell and staff, of the medical department, embarked on board the Charm, and desired to be taken across the river. A number of soldiers belonging to the different regiments already taken over also came on board at that time and crossed over with the surgeons. They (the soldiers) numbered about 150, and were parts of different companies and regiments .left behind by their commanders from the other steamers.

Upon our landing at 9.30 a. m. on the Belmont side, at the point afterwards occupied by the enemy—the battle haying already begun and now raging furiously, with the report of musketry gradually coming nearing the river—we found on the river bank a number of our wounded soldiers, and I immediately ordered them to be taken on board to be transported acr oss to Columbus. Upon landing on the Columbus side, and after the wounded had been put on shore, at 11 a. m. Colonel Marks7 (Eleventh Louisiana) regiment began to embark on the Charm. After they were on board we took on a quantity of ammunition and one company of Colonel Logwood7s cavalry, causing some delay. We, however, succeeded in getting away from the landing at 11.30 o’clock, and crossed the river under a heavy fire from the enemy’s cannon, they having at this time driven in our forces, planted their batteries on the river bank, and directed them particularly at our boat, and they were otherwise engaged in burning our tents and destroying our camp, with no one that we could perceive at the time engaging them except the batteries from the Columbus side.
Upon landing, at 12 m., on the Belmont side, and *at a point about 400 yards above the position occupied by the enemy’s battery—at that [time] playing on our boat—we found the landing obstructed by our disorganized forces, who endeavored to board and take possession of our boat, and at the same time crying: uDon’t land!” “Don’t land!” “We are whipped!” “Go back!” &c. We, however, succeeded in landing six companies of Colonel Marks’ regiment, when the disorganized troops previously spoken of made a rush on our boat and forced me to give the order to back the boat from the landing, leaving my stage planks on the river bank and still having on board the remaining four corny:dines of Colonel Marks’ regiment; also Colonel Logwood’s company of cavalry. At this juncture I moved up the river some 200 yards, intending to effect .a landing of the remaining companies of Colonel Marks’ regiment by letting them jump from the guards of the boat when she touched the bank. This Laccomplished successfully, but found myself unable to land the cavalry company for want of stage planks and the repeated efforts of our disorganized troops to board the steamer.
I now concluded to recross the river to the Columbus side and allow the cavalry to embark on some other boat or borrow stage planks from some other steamer. I succeeded in doing the latter through the kindness of Captain Lodwick, of the steamer Kentucky. Upon crossing the river to Columbus, after landing Colonel Marks’ regiment, the enemy’s cannon still being directed upon us, we [were] struck several times by their shot. One ball, in passing through the boiler deck, tore off several splinters, one of which prostrated one of the pilots, Mr. Cayton, stunning him severely, but not otherwise injuring him. A lady close by, who had refused to go on shore, but had persisted in staying aboard to assist and relieve the wounded, coolly assisted him to arise, and did not show the least evidence of fear during the entire day. No other person was hurt on our boat. In this connection I will state that the entire crew, with one exception, behaved gallantly and assisted me in managing the boat, each man attending to his peculiar duties well under all the trying circumstances of the day [and] in a very efficient manner. With the exception above mentioned every man did his duty nobly.
We now landed a short distance below the foot of the bluff, but being still an especial mark and an excellent target for the enemy’s artillery, we obeyed an order from the commanding general and moved some * distance higher up. Finding it impossible to select a suitable lauding for the successful embarkation of the re-enforcements then in waiting,

we again moved down the river to a point near the foot of the bluff and alongside the steamer Kentucky, when we took on board a part of Colonel Blythe’s (Mississippi) battalion and Colonel Smith’s (Tennessee) regiment, under the commanding general’s especial direction. On our attempt to back out from the landing after the troops were on board we found ourselves hard aground, and were delayed until the steamer Prince came to our assistance and succeeded in pulling us off. We now crossed over the river and landed the troops and cavalry on the Belmont side. This was about 2 p. in., and in time to join in the pursuit of the enemy, now in full flight from the battle-field, having been first turned by Colonel Marks’ regiment, landed from the steamer Charm the trip previous. After the troops were landed we began taking on the dead and wounded and some prisoners, among the latter of whom were Major MeClurken, of the Illinois troops, and Adjutant Boler; also a Yankee flag* was brought in displayed on our jack-staff, to the great delight of our i>eople.
We continued as busily as possible, and made a number of trips back and forth after this time, carrying over our victorious troops to the Columbus side after their return from the pursuit of the enemy.
We continued to work until midnight, when we were ordered down the river after corn by the quartermaster, working all night, the day following, and the next night without cessation.
Upon our return to Columbus after our trip for com we were permitted to rest and clean out the boilers of the steamer, now very much in need of that service from their constant use for more than ten days.
I have made the foregoing statement'and report in answer to your queries, and I trust that it will meet with your approval and approbation.

Report of Capt. H. P. Hawkins, Independent Company Missouri Cavalry.
Patterson, Mo., Sunday p. m.9 November 16,1861.
Sir : In conformity with your desire, expressed in order of 12th instant and received at Greenville, I visited Doniphan, Ripley County, and went within 6 miles of the State line. I have just returned to this place with my company, all safe. I succeeded in capturing the lieutenant in command of the rebel pickets at Doniphan. Owing to our want of knowledge of their location, the rest were enabled to escape by a most precipitate retreat. From the manner of their start, would not be astonished to hear they were still running. We followed them on the Pitman Ferry road some 2 miles south of Doniphan, and would have gone through to the ferry, but prudence dictated a retreat. We had accomplished all we expected.' We routed the pickets, captured 1 or 2 horses, several guns, pistols, blankets, saddles, &c.
I am reliably informed that Colonel Borland is in command of the forces about Pocahontas. The militia of ten counties is ordered out for thirty days to capture Pilot Knob. I do not think the colonel will cross the State line. The infantry (3,000, to be increased to 10,000) is stationed at Walnut Springs, 5 miles north of Pocahontas. The cavalry (1,700) are stationed as follows: 1,000 are stationed 5 miles south of Pitman’s Ferry, 400 are stationed at different points between the main body and the ferry, 300 were stationed 3 miles south of town; the pickets stationed at Doniphan were about 15, in charge of a lieutenant. He reports the pickets numerous, and from 10 to 20 at each post.
I find the southern part of the State stripped of almost every kind of produce, and many families along our route are absolutely suffering for many of the necessaries of life. I found the inhabitants in great fear of outrages supposed to be committed by the Federal troops. I adopted a mild and uniform course of treatment towards those persons with whom we came in contact. It was expected by the rebel citizens of Doniphan that we would destroy their town. Mr. Leeper, myself, and one or two others acquainted with the families of some of the prominent citizens, called on their families, and advised the men to remain at home and live as they had heretofore, loyal citizens. I am well satisfied our trip below has done much good towards reconciliation and establishing a friendly feeling towards our Union troops.
My orders are to u remain at Greenville till further orders.” Want of subsistence and shoeing of horses compelled me to return to this point. It is 10 miles north of Greenville, aud a much more desirable place to camp. Will remain here until further orders. My men are all in good condition. Many of my horses are badly used up.

I will do my best, and if I cannot get the onedesired, I will get some other, and by this means stop navigation for a week, except under large convoy.

Dear General : Your favor, by the Prince, is at hand,* and I will cheerfully undertake the expedition, but will not risk it on the route you propose. The enemy have been alarmed at the proximity of my pickets to Bird’s Point, and are now guarding the roads leading to the railroad. I will go by Sikeston, Jones’ Ford, and to the river, at Commerce, or below the Big Island, and will startle the enemy, if I do not capture them. It will be impossible for me to capture any particular boat, as it will not do to lay in ambush too long; but I will get some boat and stop the navigation for a week, except under the convoy of land forces and gunboats. This will give you time, which is now of vast importance. I will start this afternoon, and be in position by sunrise to morrow.
Yours, most respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON, Brigadier- General) Commanding.

insriOUNT CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
Fort Leavenworth, Kans., May 10,1861. Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
A. A. G., Hdqrs. Army, Washington City:
Colonel : I deem it of sufficient importance to report for the information of the Lieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief that I am credibly informed the governor of Missouri has established at Saint Joseph a permanent camp of State troops. The force now embodied and encamped and drilling consists of eight companies—one as light artillery, having two iron guns, taken from Liberty Arsenal; three companies of dragoons, and four of infantry. This force, by order of the governor, is to be increased from the interior. Should Missouri secede, not a doubt but offensive operations against this post will be attempted. At present I have troops sufficient to repel any force now at Saint Joseph. If informed of additional ones arriving I shall, without hesitation, call on the governor of the State of Kansas for one or two regiments of infantry, to assist in the defense of this place and the towns on the right bank of the Missouri River. It is known there are stored at Fort Kearney large quantities of ordnance, ordnance stores, subsistence, and clothing, and it has been reported to me that the mustering of the State of Missouri troops at Saint Joseph is to make a sudden foray on Fort Kearney, to capture its stores, particularly the park of 12-pounder howitzers. Should I learn that Missouri troops have crossed the river for this or any other object aggressive to the rights of the citizens of this State or interest of the United States Government, I shall, with my disposable force, immediately attack them.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Army, I resumed command of the Department of the West the 11th instant. On my arrival at {Saint Louis I found very great excitement prevailing throughout the community in eonsequence of the capture, on the 10th instant, of the brigade of Missouri militia, milder the command of Brig. Gen. D. M. Frost, while in camp near this city, by the United States forces, under the command of Oapt. iL Lyon, Second Infantry. I am informed that a detailed report of that affair was forwarded previous to my resuming command of the department, but I deem it proper to state that the conduct of Captain Lyon on the occasion meets with my entire approval.
As serious apprehensions were entertained yesterday morning that the excitement existing in the city would result in an outbreak in the course of a few hours unless allayed, I deemed it necessary to issue a proclamation, of which the inclosed is a copy, and which, I am assured, was well received and had the effect to tranquilize the public mind. I also ordered up from the arsenal some 250 regular troops, with four pieces of artillery, to aid the civil authorities in the preservation of the public peace. I am happy to add that all indications of the threatened disturbance have disappeared.

PROCLAMATION.
Military Department op the West,
Saint Louis, Mo., May 12,1861.
I have just returned to this post, and have assumed the military command of this department. Ko one can more deeply regret the deplorable state of things existing here than myself. The past cannot be recalled. I can only deal with the present and the future. I most anxiously desire to discharge the delicate and onerous duties devolved upon me so as to preserve the public peace. I shall carefully abstain from the exercise of any unnecessary powers and from all interference with the proper functions of the public officers of the State and city. I therefore call upon the public authorities and the people to aid me in preserving the public peace.
The military force stationed in this department by authority of the Government, and now under my command, will only be used in the last resort to preserve the peace. I trust I may be spared the necessity of resorting to martial law, but the public peace must be preserved, and the lives and property of the people protected. Upon a careful review of my instructions I find I have no authority tQ change the location of the Home Guards. To avoid all cause of irritation and excitement, if called upon to aid the local authorities in preserving the public peace, I shall in preference make use of the Begular Army.
I ask the people to pursue their peaceful avocations, and to observe the laws and orders of their local authorities, and to abstain from the excitements of public meetings and heated discussions. My appeal I trust may not be in vain, and I pledge the faith of a soldier to the earnest discharge of my duty.

Saint Louis, Mo., May 14, 1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Edqrs. Army, Washington, JD. G. :
Sir : I have the honor to transmit herewith, for the information of the General-in-Chief, a copy of a proclamation I deemed it necessary, in view of the existing condition of affairs in this quarter, to address to the people of Missouri.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. S. HABKEY, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
[Inclosure.]
Military Department of the West,
Saint Louis, May 14,1861.
To the People of the State of Missouri:
On my return to the duties of the command of this department I find, greatly to my astonishment and mortification, a most extraordinary state of things existing in this State, deeply affecting the stability of the Government of the United States as well as the governmental and other interests of Missouri itself.
As a citizen of Missouri, owing allegiance to the United States, and having interests in common with you, I feel it my duty as well as privilege to extend a warning voice to my fellow-citizens against the common dangers that threaten us, and to appeal to your patriotism and sense of justice to exert all your moral power to avert them.
It is with regret that I feel it my duty to call your attention to the recent act of the general assembly of Missouri known as the u military bill,” which is the result, no doubt, of the temporary excitement that now pervades the public mind. This bill cannot be regarded in any other light than an indirect secession ordinance, ignoring even the forms resorted to by other States. Manifestly, its most material provisions are in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States. To this extent it is a nullity, and cannot and ought not to be upheld or regarded by the good citizens of Missouri. There are obligations and duties resting upon the people of Missouri under the Constitution and laws of the United States which are paramount, and which I trust you will carefully consider and weigh well before you will allow yourselves to be carried out of the Union under the form of yielding obedience to this military bill, which is clearly in violation of your duties as citizens of the United States.
It must be apparent to every one who has taken a proper and unbiased view of the subject that, whatever may be the termination of the unfortunate condition of things in respect to the so-called Cotton States, Missouri must share the destiny of the Union. Her geographical position, her soil, productions, and, in short, all her material interests, point to this result. We cannot shut our eyes against this controlling fact. It is seen and its force is felt throughout the nation. So important is this regarded to the great interests of the country, that I venture to express the opinion that the whole power of the Government of the United States, if necessary, will be exerted to maintain Missouri in her present position in the Union. I express to you, in all frankness and sincerity, my own deliberate convictions, without assuming to speak for the Government of the United States, whose authority here and elsewhere I shall at all times and under all circumstances endeavor faithfully to uphold. I desire above all things most earnestly to invite

[Chai\ X.
my fellow-citizens dispassionately to consider their true interests as well as their true relation to the Government under which we live and to which we owe so much.
In this connection I desire to direct attention to one subject which, no doubt, will be made the pretext for more or less popular excitement. I allude to the recent transactions at Camp Jackson, near Saint Louis. It is not proper for me to comment upon the official conduct of my predecessor in command of this department, but it is right and proper for the people of Missouri to know that the main avenue of Camp Jackson, recently under command of General Frost, had the name of Davis, and a principal street of the same camp that of Beauregard, and that a body of men had been received into that camp by its commander which had been notoriously organized in the interests of the secessionists, the men openly wearing the dress and badge distinguishing the Army of the so-called Southern Confederacy. It is also a notorious fact that a quantity of arms had been received into the camp which were unlawfully taken from the United States Arsenal at Baton Rouge, and surreptitiously passed up the river in boxes marked “ Marble.”
Upon facts like these, and having in view what occurred at Liberty, the people can draw their own inferences, and it cannot be difficult for any one to arrive at a correct conclusion as to the character and ultimate purpose of that encampment. No Government in the world would be entitled to respect that would tolerate for a moment such openly treasonable preparations. It is but simple justice, however, that I should state the fact that there were many good and loyal men in the camp who were in no manner responsible for its treasonable character.
Disclaiming as I do all desire or intention to interfere in any way with the prerogatives of the State of Missouri or with the functions of its executive or other authorities, yet I*regard it as my plain path of duty to express to the people, in respectful but at the same time decided language, that within the field and scope of my command and authority the usupreme law” of the land must and shall be maintained, and ho subterfuges, whether in the forms of legislative acts or otherwise, can be permitted to harass or oppress the good and law-abiding people of Missouri. I shall exert my authority to protect their persons and property from violations of every kind, and I shall deem it my duty to suppress all unlawful combinations of men, whether formed under pretext of military organizations or otherwise.

Sir : In common with thousands who have perused your admirable proclamation of this morning, I return you the thanks of a citizen of Missouri for its patriotic tone and tranquilizing assurances. There is nothing in this paper which in my opinion needs explanation, yet I wish to be able to answer, with the authority of your name, a question which I have already replied to on my own judgment.
Last evening a gentleman of the highest respectability and intelligence, from Greene County, Missouri, asked me whether I supposed it

was the intention of the United States Government to interfere with the institution of negro slavery in Missouri Or any slave State, or impair the security of that description of property. Of course my answer was most unqualifiedly and almost indignantly in the negative. I told him that I had no means of forming an opinion which was not open to every other private citizen, but that I felt certain that the force of the United States would, if necessary, be diverted for the protection of this as well as any other kind of property. Will you be good enough to spare from your engrossing military duties so much time as may be required to say whether I answered correctly ?
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect, your most obedient servant,
THOMAS T. GANTT.
May 14, 1861.
Thomas T. Gantt, Esq., Saint Louis, Mo.:
Sir : I have just received your note of this date, inquiring whether, in my opinion, you were correct in replying to a citizen of Southwestern Missouri as to the purpose of the United States Government respecting the protection of negro property. I must premise by saying that I have no special instructions on this head from the War Department, but I should as soon expect to hear that the orders of the Government were directed towards the overthrow of any other kind of property as of this in negro slaves.
I entertain no doubt whatever that you answered the question you mentioned correctly. I should certainly have answered it in the same manner, and I think with the very feelings you describe. I am not a little astonished that such a question could be seriously put. Already, since the commencement of these unhappy disturbances, slaves have escaped from their owners, and have sought refuge in the camps of United States troops from Northern States, and commanded by a Northern general. They were carefully sent back to their owners. An insurrection of slaves was reported to have taken place in Maryland. A Northern general offered to the executive of that State the aid of Northern troops, under his own command, to suppress it. Incendiaries have asked of the President permission to invade the Southern States, and have been warned that any attempt to do this will be punished as a crime. I repeat it, I have no special means of knowledge on this subject 5 but what I have cited, and my general acquaintance with the statesmanlike views of the President, makes me confident in expressing the opinion above given.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. S. HARNEY,

East Saint Louis, III., May 15, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War ;
I think it of the utmost importance that an additional regiment, consisting exclusively of Irishmen, should be raised in Saint Louis. It will at once settle matters in Saint Louis, and do away with the prejudice against the Government troops, which consist almost exclusively of Germans.

I take great pleasure in submitting to you the following paper, signed by General Price, commanding the forces of the State, and by myself, on the part of the Government of the United States. It will be seen

that the united forces of both Governments are pledged to the maintenance of the peace of the State, and the defense of the rights and property of all persons, without distinction of party. This pledge, which both parties are fully authorized and empowered to give by the Governments which they represent, will be by both* most religiously and sacredly kept, and, if necessary to put down evil-disposed persons, the military powers of both Governments will be called out to enforce the terms of the honorable and amicable agreement which has been made. I therefore call upon all persons in this State to observe good order and respect the rights of their fellow citizens, and give them the assurance of protection and security in the most ample manner.
WM. S. HARNEY. Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[SubinelosTire.]
Saint Louis, May 21,1861.
The undersigned, officers of the United States Government and of the government of the State of Missouri, for the purpose of removing misapprehensions and allaying public excitement, deem it proper to declare publicly that they have this day had a personal interview in this city, in which it has been mutually understood, without the semblance of dissent on either part, that each of them has no other than a common object equally interesting and important to every citizen of Missouri— that of restoring peace and good order to the people of the State in subordination to the laws of the General and State Governments. It being thus understood, there seems no reason why every citizen should not confide in the proper officers of the General and State Governments to restore quiet, and, as among the best means of offering no counterinfluences, we mutually recommend to all persons to respect each other’s rights throughout the State, making no attempt to exercise unauthorized powers, as it is the determination of the proper authorities to suppress all unlawful proceedings, which can only disturb the public peace.
General Price, having by commission full authority over the militia of the State of Missouri, undertakes, with the sanction of the governor of the State, already declared, to direct the whole power of the State officers to maintain order within the State among the people thereof, and General Harney publicly declares that, this object being thus assured, he can have no occasion, as he has no wish, to make military movements, which might otherwise create excitements and jealousies which he most earnestly desires to avoid.
We, the undersigned, do therefore mutually enjoin upon the people of the State to attend to their civil business of whatsoever sort it may be, and it is to be hoped that the unquiet elements which have threatened so seriously to disturb the public peace may soon subside and be remembered only to be deplored.

appointed by the governor of the State will not be complied with, and the Government could not accept officers appointed by a traitor under any circumstances.
As the brigade will be under command of General Lyon, will it not be best to allow him to nominate the officers, subject to the approval of the President? Send him the order by telegraph immediately.
The agreement between Harney and General Price gives me great disgust and dissatisfaction to the Union men; but I am in hopes we can get along with it, and think that Harney will insist on its execution to the fullest extent, in which case it will be satisfactory.
F. P. BLAIR, Jr.
Washington, May 27, 1861.
Brig. Gen. W. S. Harney,
Commanding Department of the West, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Sir > The President observes with concern that, notwithstanding the pledge of the State authorities to co-operate in preserving peace in Missouri, loyal citizens in great numbers continue to be driven from their homes. It is immaterial whether these outrages continue from inability or indisposition on the part of the State authorities to prevent them. It is enough that they continue to devolve on you the duty of putting a stop to them summarily by the force under your command, to be aided by such troops as you may require from Kansas, Iowa, and Illinois. The professions of loyalty to the Union by the State authorities of Missouri are not to be relied upon. They have already falsified their professions too often, and are too far committed to secession to be entitled to your confidence, and you can only be sure of their desisting from their wicked purposes when it is out of their power to prosecute them. You will therefore be unceasingly watchful of their movements, and not permit the clamors of their partisans and opponents of the wise measures already taken to prevent you from checking every movement against the Government, however disguised, under the pretended State authority. The authority of the United States is paramount, and whenever it is apparent that a movement, whether by color of State authori ty or not, is hostile, you will not hesitate to put it down.

In view of the large amount of public property at Fort Kearney, and for the purpose of effectually holding in check the Indians in its vicinity, it has seemed to me very important that its garrison, which consists at present of a single company of dragoons, should be re-enforced as soon as possible.
I have also directed Lieutenant-Colonel Sedgwick, Second Cavalry, now at Fort Wise, to repair to Fort Leavenworth and there await further orders, presuming that before he can reach Leavenworth instructions will have been issued requiring his presence with the regiment to which he has recently been promoted.

Interference by unauthorized parties as to the course I shall pursue can alone prevent the realization of these hopes, and although the policy they might inaugurate might be more brilliant in a military point of view, and far more expensive to carry out, it could not secure the results the Government seeks, viz: The maintenance of the loyalty now fully aroused in the State and her firm security in the Union.
I entertain the conviction that the agreement between myself and General Price will be carried out in good faith, but while entertaining this belief I shall watch carefully the movements of the State authorities. I have reliable means of obtaining information of their movements, and any violation of their pledge and any attempt at rebellion will be promptly met and put down.

Your informant must be mistaken; neither the governor nor myself know anything of troops being raised in Arkansas for Missouri. Should any troops enter our borders, I will cause them to return instanter.
STERLING PRICE,
Major-General, Commanding Missouri Volunteers.
Headquarters Missouri State Guard,
Jefferson City, Afo., May 29, 1861. Brig. Gen. W. S. Harney, U. S. A., Saint Louis, Mo. :
General : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two communications of date 27th instant.
In reply to your propositions to establish or organize Home Guards in certain localities, I have to say, that such a step, in my opinion, would bring about the very state of things we mutually desire to avoid, to wit, hostilities between the Federal and State Governments. In the present state of excitement among the people, the arming of one portion of a community by the Federal Government would very naturally be looked upon by the other in a spirit of jealousy, and, in my opinion, would have a tendency to excite those who now hold conservative peace positions into exactly the contrary attitude, an example of which we have in Saint Louis. It wrould undoubtedly, in my opinion, lead to neighborhood collision, the forerunner of civil war. Additional reasons might be urged why you should abandon the establishment of these Home Guards, palpable to yourself, if the desire is to avoid civil war in Missouri,
With regard to the other point in your letter, relative to complaints of Union men, I have instituted strict inquiry relative to every case within my knowledge, and beg leave to reassure you that in no single instance have these acts been instigated or recognized by meetings or organizations of any kind; but wherever and whenever happening, prove to be the offspring of irresponsible individuals, and no effort has been left undone on my part to prevent even this, and shall be continued in the future. You will observe from published orders that I positively enjoin upon all citizens of the State the scrupulous protection of individual property and rights, irrespective of political opinions. With these views and deductions I feel assured that you will agree with me, that to carry out your proposed plan would be exceedingly injudicious, if not ruinous, to the peace of the State. General, it is my unchanged and honest intention to carry out to the letter the agreement entered into between us, and I can but feel assured, from the high sense

of honor that has always attended your public acts, that you will, with equal fidelity, observe the same on your part.
On receipt of your telegram of yesterday I immediately dispatched two highly respectable citizens of Springfield, who replied that no troops from Arkansas were expected or desired. The assertion in the Democrat that wagons had been sent from Sedalia to Arkansas for arms is wholly untrue. Should, however, troops enter Missouri from Arkansas or any other State, be assured that I will cause them to return, and thus save you from the taking of a step which I could not, with justice, construe into any other light than a violation of our agreement, and such a violation as would, in my opinion, undoubtedly precipitate civil hostilities.
I have the honor to be, general, with much respect, your obedient servant,
STERLING PRICE, Major-General, Commanding.

General L. Thomas,
Adjt. Gen. U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C. :
Sir : I received last evening paragraph 1 of Special Orders, No. 135, of May 16, from your office, and instantly relinquished command of the Department of the West. This morning your letter of May 27 reached me, and as other communications have been addressed to me from your office as department commander since May 16, and as I have learned the purport of telegraphic dispatches recently received from Washington by Colonel Blair and Mr. Gantt, of this city, I am led to conclude that it was not the intention of the President i should be relieved. I shall, therefore, at once resume the command of the department, and I beg that the President may be assured that jf I am permitted to conduct operations here as my judgment may dictate I anticipate no serious disturbance in the State. I am sure that many of the reports which have reached the President relative to the condition of affairs in Missouri have proceeded from irresponsible sources. Upon investigation here of complaints seemingly aggravated it has appeared in several instances that they were groundless or greatly exaggerated. Matters are progressing as satisfactorily in this State as I could expect considering the very great excitement that has latterly pervaded the community.

Brig. Gen. L. Thomas,
Adjt. Gen. U. S. Army, Washington, D. C. :
Sir: Authentic information exists of the presence at Memphis of General Beauregard, and of the movement of Ben. McCulloch with troops and light and heavy arms up the Arkansas and White Rivers. Troops from Arkansas have already taken position at Fort Wayne, which is at the northwest corner of Arkansas. Very mysterious and industrious movements of the secessionists of this State towards the southwest indicate an intended co-operation of forces from the South, Arkansas, and this State, to enter it from that quarter with a large armament and force. This I am disposed to believe is contemplated in connection with a movement under Beauregard from the South on Cairo. Cairo should, therefore, receive due attention, while a movement from here towards the southwest should be made. This latter movement I intend to undertake in connection with the troops of Kansas, and in carrying out this project I may need support from the States of Illinois and Iowa, and I have accordingly forwarded to the governors of those States a copy of your letter of May 27,1861, to General Harney, and have asked them to inform me whether they can furnish me with troops, and if so how soon and where, as I may need them to occupy some particular points or to garrison this post.
I would respectfully ask that the orders of the War Department over the troops in this department and calls upon the States indicated may have the above object in view.
I am embarrassed and even distressed for the want of camp equipage and accouterments, but shall do whatever can be done for my relief by getting manufactured at this city as many of these things as can be so supplied. This will, however, prove but a partial relief, and more will be needed from other sources.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Bvt. Brig. Gen. L. Thomas,
Adjutant-General U. 8. Army, Washington, D. C.;
General : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, containing instructions to put down all attempts to commit outrages on loyal citizens of Missouri.
In reply to that letter I respectfully refer you to my communication of the 29th ultimo, written and mailed before the receipt of yours. I therein informed the Government that I had reliable means of obtaining information of the movements of the State authorities, and that I should promptly punish any violation of agreement and put down any attempt at rebellion. The many complaints of individuals, by letter, setting forth that acts of oppression were committed by the secessionists, have received my careful attention, and an investigation has proved the majority of them to be without foundation. As an instance of the groundlessness of these mischievous rumors I cite the report, which obtained currency, that Ex-Governor Stewart and other loyal citizens had been driven from Saint Joseph, and the ex-governor promptly publishing an unqualified denial that such outrage was perpetrated, clearly proves that there is a disposition on the part of some parties to manufacture excitement where cause does not exist.
My confidence in the honor and integrity of General Price, in the purity of his motives, and in his loyalty to the Government, remains unimpaired. His course as president of the State Convention that voted by a large majority against submitting an ordinance of secession, and * his efforts since that time to calm the elements of discord, have served to confirm the high opinion of him I have for many years entertained.
My whole course as commander of the Department of the West has been dictated by a desire to carry out in good faith the instructions of my Government, regardless of the clamor of the conflicting elements surrounding me, and whose advice and dictation could not be followed without involving the State in blood and the Government in the unnecessary expenditure of millions. Under the course I pursued Missouri was secured to the Union, and the triumph of the Government was only the more glorious, being almost a bloodless victory 5 but those who clamored for blood have not ceased to impugn my motives. Twice within a brief space of time have I been relieved from the command here 5 the second tifne in a manner that has inflicted unmerited disgrace upon a true and loyal soldier. During a long life, dedicated to my country, I have seen some service, and more than once I have held her honor in my hands; and during that time my loyalty, I believe, was never questioned; and now, when in the natural course of things I shall, before the lapse of many years, lay aside the sword which has so long served my country, my countrymen will be slow to believe that I have chosen this portion of my career to damn with treason my life, which is so soon to become a record of the past, and which I shall most willingly leave to the unbiased judgment of posterity. I trust that I may yet be spared to do my country some further service that will testify to the love I bear her, and that the vigor of my arm may never relax while there is a blow to be struck in her defense.
I respectfully ask to be assigned to the command of the Department of California, and I doubt not the present commander of that division is even now anxious to serve on the Atlautic frontier.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
WM. S'. HARNEY, Brigadier-General, U. 8. Army.

Booneville, Mo., June 18,1861.
Dear Harding : You have heard of us and our leaving Jefferson City on the 16th. We debarked next morning a little above Rockport, and had not proceeded more than 2 miles before we met their advanced pickets, and soon after their whole force. At first the secessionists made a weak effort, which doubtless was intended to lead us on to their stronghold, where they held on with considerable resolution, and gave us a check for a short time and made some havoc. On moving forward, however, a straggling fire from the right and left made it necessary to move on with caution and slowness, and we reached the city about 2 o’clock p. m., where we were met by many people, under consternation from the erroneous impression that great violence would be perpetrated upon persons and property. I have been engaged more or less in removing this impression. I regret much that my proclamation was not published promptly, so that I could have had it here for distribution. I get no news of what is going on around us, but much fear the movement from Texas, and hope the subject will engage the attention of the General Government. Keep McClellan advised upon the matter. I had hoped some of our Iowa troops would have been in this region by this time, but hear nothing of them. My suspense just now is painful.

Sir : In reply to your communication of the 20th instant, asking for information in regard to the steamer Swan, I have the honor to state as follows the circumstances which led to her seizure:
The Swan contracted with one Colton Green, an agent from Governor Jackson to Jefferson Davis, for the shipment of arms from New Orleans to Saint Louis, and took them on board at Baton Eouge in boxes marked u Marble.” The boat’s register contains a record of these boxes as shipped from Baton Rouge, the words Baton Rouge being stricken out, and New Orleans written instead. The captain and clerk of the boat were part owners, and another of the shareholders (Pegram) was on board, and knew the contents of the boxes before the boat reached Cairo, if not at the time of their shipment. Pegram took command of the boat while passing Cairo, the captain secreting himself on the boat, for the purpose of avoiding a vigorous search by the United States officers at that post—the captain being a well-known secessionist, while Pegram passed as a Union man. The arms were delivered at Saint Louis, and the day after captured in Camp Jackson. They consisted of two 24-pounder howitzers, an 8-inch siege mortar, six Cohorn mortars,

and 500 muskets, with a considerable supply of ammunition. A part only of the muskets were taken, the rest having been sent to the interior. These were all evidently United States arms, brought from the Baton Rouge Arsenal. The owners of the boat and its agents I considered as deliberately supplying the means of warfare to the troops of Camp Jackson, who as a body were evidently hostile to the United States. The boat is, in my opinion, properly a forfeit to the General Government, and should be held subject to some suitable adjustment before the courts of the country or at the close of the existing difficulties. The well-known proclivities in favor of secession of the district judge of Saint Louis make him'an improper person to adjudicate the matter. The boat is now employed in transporting troops and supplies on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
N. LYON,
Brigadier-General, U. 8. Volunteers, Commanding.
The statement of facts by General Lyon is known to me to be true. An additional fact, not stated by General Lyon, has some bearing upon the matter, to wit, the original memorandum of the shipment of the arms, showing that it was made at Baton Rouge, and that the change of the boat’s register was a fraud. The original invoice of the arms, signed by the ordnance officer of the Confederate States and shipped to Colton Green on the steamer J. C. Swan, is also in the hands of the Government officers.

Special Orders, \	Headquarters Camp Cameron,
No. 1.	)	Booneville^ Mo., June 29, 1861.
Col. John D. Stevenson, Seventh Regiment Missouri Volunteers, is assigned to the command of the Missouri River from Kansas City to its mouth and the adjacent country. His headquarters will be at this place. Colonel Stevenson will move as soon as practicable with that portion of his regiment which is now armed to the post assigned, leaving the remainder to join him as soon as it shall be in proper condition; He will establish and maintain at Springton, Booneville, and Jefferson City posts of sufficient strength to hold possession of those places and furnish detachments for operations in the surrounding country. He will keep two arm^d boats patroling between Sherman and Kansas City, one above and one below Booneville, exercising a strict surveillance over ferry-boats and others navigating the river, and prevent their being used in transporting hostile troops or in other illegitimate traffic; and if in his opinion it shall be necessary for the accomplishment of the above purpose, he will seize and keep possession of such boats.
The armed boats will make frequent landings and send parties to scout the surrounding country, gain information of hostile parties and break them ui), concerting measures, if necessary, with the adjacent post for this purpose, and give effectual protection to loyal citizens. Boats passing up and down the river will habitually be required to go in company with the armed boats. Colonel Stevenson will detail intelligent and trustworthy officers to attend to the transportation, preservation, and issue of supplies for the troops under his command, and will give as much as possible of his personal attention to the matter, to the end that the strictest economy may be enforced and the comfort and effi-

ciency of the troops secured. The proper garrison for each post will be about six companies, and the force for each boat two companies. Each post should have at least one field piece, and each boat a 24-pounder howitzer.
Col. Chester Harding will designate the troops necessary, in addition to Colonel Stevenson’s regiment, to carry into execution this order.
As soon as Colonel Stevenson shall be prepared to garrison the posts specified above, Col. Henry Boernstein will proceed with his regiment to Saint Louis, and take post at the arsenal or at Jefferson Barracks, as may be determined by Colonel Harding, where the regiment will have an opportunity to reorganize for three years’ service.

Dear Colonel : I hope to move to-morrow, and think it more important just now to go to Springfield. My force in moving from here will be about 2,400 men. Major Sturgis will have about 2,200 men, and you know what force lfhs gone to Springfield from Saint Louis, so that you see what amount of provision s we shall want supplied at that point. Please attend to us as effectually as possible. Our line should be kept open by all means. I must be governed by circumstances at Springfield. You will, of course, have due attention to ‘the southeast. The State Journal is outrageous, and must be stopped; you will take such measures as you think best to effect this. Our cause is suffering from too much indulgence, and you must so advise our friends in Saint Louis. Colonel Stevenson must have pretty strong garrisons at the points he occupies on the river, and he must have support from other States as occasion seems to require. Colonel Curtis is, I suppose, on the Hannibal and Saint Joseph road $ rigorous measures should be shown the disorderly in that region. Our operations are becoming extensive, and our staff officers must keep up with our emergencies. We need here a regular quartermaster and commissary. Cannot something be done for us from Washington1?

Besides garrisoning Jefferson City, Booneville, and Lexington, General Lyon has marched southward with 2,400 men, in round numbers. There are at Springfield and Mount Yernon, and on the way there from Rolla, about 3,000 rgen, under the command of Capt. T. W. Sweeny, Second Infantry, acting (under election and by order from Brigadier-General Harney) as brigadier-general of the U. S. Reserve Corps of Saint Louis. In addition to these there are about 1,000 of the Home Guard and Rifle Battalion protecting the line of communication from Saint Louis to Spring-field. As this line has become the most important one in the whole State, and as it is threatened by hostile bands under General McBride and others, it has been deemed best to place it under the command of Colonel Wyman, Thirteenth Illinois Yolunteers, who went down to Rolla with his regiment last night. He will establish his headquarters either at Rolla or Lebanon, beyond the crossings of the Gasconade River, as he finds most expedient.
Colonel Marsh’s Twentieth Illinois Yolunteers are now at this point to be equipped. After being fitted for field service they will move down to Cape Girardeau, within 50 miles of Cairo, where they will, in case of necessity, be subject to the orders of General Prentiss, but if not called for at that point, will stop the transportation of arms, munitions, and supplies which has been carried on between New Madrid and Cape Girardeau, and break up the rebel camps that have been formed in the vicinity.
General McClellan has placed at the disposal of General Lyon one of the regiments at Quincy. Orders have been sent for it to come here, where it will be equipped, and then sent down the Iron Mountain Railroad to Ironton, from whence it will proceed to Greenville, in Wayne County. Five companies of the Sixth Regiment II. S. Yolun-

teers are at Ironton, or in the vicinity, and the remainder of the regiment will proceed there as soon as it is fully organized. General McClellan has also placed the remainder of General Pope’s brigade at the disposal of General Lyon. No more troopss .will be called for at present, but there may hereafter be occasion for a large force, with artillery and cavalry, in the southeastern counties.
As soon as General Lyon’s plan of campaign developed itself the secessionists in the southeast began to organize their forces. They have hitherto been met, as well as possible, by expeditions from Cairo and from this place, and by Home Guards organized and armed under General Lyon’s authority. These expeditions were necessarily confined to temporary visits to disaffected regions, and have accomplished little. The whole of the southeast requires permanent occupancy by our troops, as it contains more enemies than any other portion of the State. Apart from this, information has been and is received here daily from different sources, including the reports of our own scouts, who have gone as far as Pocahontas, Ark., that our disloyal citizens are being armed with Baton Rouge muskets, brought up the White River, and troops from Tennessee and Arkansas are concentrating in the vicinity of the State line. These reports differ as to numbers, but agree in all other important particulars. It is apparent that the enemy design an invasion of the southeastern portion of the State with a considerable force, and rely upon the inhabitants of the swamp counties for active co-operation. The country in the lower part of Scott County and in Stoddard, Dunklin, Mississippi, Pemiscot, New Madrid, and Butler Counties is what is known familiarly as the u earthquake country,” having been turned from prairie into swamp land by the earthquake of 1811. It is a country as difficult to overrun, if held by hostile people, as the Florida Everglades, and the bear-hunters of that region will be hostile the moment that an advancing column of the rebels enters it.
The troops sent to Cape Girardeau and to Greenville are not designed to enter the swamp country, but to hold the approaches by which an advancing enemy must pass, and to overawe and to keep down the organization of hostile bands of our own citizens, as well as to encourage, organize, and distribute arms to those who are loyal. Time will show how much this force will have to be increased. There is no occasion for immediate re-enforcement. I will send a communication upon another subject by this maiL

Sir : I wish to call your attention to a matter which needs speedy action on the part of Congress.
Before the call for the Convention which met in this State on February 28th last, citizens of Saint Louis organized and partially armed themselves with the intent to hold the city and county true to the Government, without regard to the remainder of the State.
In addition to furnishing troops for four regiments of volunteers, who entered the service for three months immediately after the President’s

first proclamation, five regiments of these citizens, numbering about 4,700 men, were enrolled on May 7, 8, and 11, under the name of the U. S. Reserve Corps, by authority of the President. The condition of their enlistment was that they should not be called upon for service outside of Saint Louis County without their consent.
This corps has accomplished and is accomplishing much good. Half of it is now in the field at Booneville, Jefferson City, Lexington, and in the southwest. The other half is in Saint Louis, anxious for active duty, but retained as a matter of precaution. The time is drawing near when their term of enlistment will expire. It will be necessary that a force be kept in Saint Louis, and at the same time there are defects in the present organization which should be avoided in establishing a more permanent corps. The men have false notions about discipline and subordination, thinking that, as they are privileged soldiers, as well as substantial men of families, they have the right to determine by vote what they will do. In one instance two companies volunteered to go to Jefferson City at a time when that exact amount of force was required; came to the arsenal, were equipped, provisioned, and quartered for the night. Transportation was provided, and in the morning at reveille the men were ordered to fall in. Seventy of them refused to go, pleading their privilege of not being sent out of the county as their excuse. I disarmed them, took away their equipments, and sent them out of the garrison, but have since restored their arms, in consequence of explanations that their officers had not informed them of the service which they had been called upon to perform. I mention this as one instance, showing that in certain cases these troops cannot be depended upon.
As I was connected with the Reserve Corps organization up to May 11, at which time I came here, I will respectfully offer some suggestions as to a reorganization of that body: I would recommend that Col. John McNeil, senior colonel of the corps, and Lieut. Col. Robert White, of the Fifth Regiment, now at Booneville^ be authorized to raise two regiments for the war by enlistment from the Reserve Corps. It is important that Americans should command. These regiments should have no condition attached to their enrollment, except, perhaps, that they will not be ordered out of the State. Even this will not be necessary, if they understand that their chief duty will be to garrison this place, and defend the city. Two regiments will be enough. The remainder of the corps can be disbanded, and their arms returned. These arms are rifled, and of newer pattern than any which the Illinois troops and a portion of ours have.
I would further recommend that these two regiments be kept on duty at all times. At present the men, when not on guard or other duty, attend to their ordinary avocations. I would suggest also that there be a brigade organization of the two regiments, with or without a brigadier, but that the commanding officer have the necessary staff officers to assist him. Colonel Blair and F. A. Dick, esq., may be able to give valuable information.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : I arrived at this place early this evening two or three hours in advance of my troops, who are encamped a few miles back. I have about 5,000 men to be provided for, and have expected to find stores here, as I have ordered. The failure of stores reaching here seems likely to cause serious embarrassment, which must be aggravated by continued delay, and in proportion to the time I am forced to wait for supplies. * * * I shall endeavor to take every due precaution to meet existing emergencies, and hope to be able to sustain the cause of the Government in this part of the State. But there must be no loss of time in furnishing me the resources I have herein mentioned. I have lost in reaching this place about four days’ time by the high waters in Grand and Osage Rivers, which made it necessary to ferry them. The same difficulty prevented Sturgis from co-operating with Sigel in time to afford any aid. Please telegraph to McClellan and to Washington anything in this letter you deem of importance to those headquarters. Shoes, shirts, blouses, &c., are much wanted, and I would have you furnish them, if possible, in considerable quantities.

Col. Chester Harding, Jr.,
Adjt. Gen. Missouri Vols.j Saint Louis Arsenal, Mo.:
Colonel : General Lyon is now here with about 7,000 men. Of these, fully one-half are three-months’ volunteers, whose term of service has nearly expired, the latest expiring on the 14th of August. Governor Jackson is concentrating his forces in the southwestern part of the State, and is receiving large re-enforcements from Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Texas. This effective force will soon be certainly not less than 30,000 men—probably much larger. All idea of any further advance movement, or of even maintaining our present position, must soon be abandoned unless the Government furnish us promptly with large re-enforcements and supplies. Our troops are badly clothed, poorly fed, and imperfectly supplied with tents. None of them have as yet been paid, and the three-months’ volunteers have become disheartened to such extent that very few of them are willing to renew their enlistment. The blank pay-rolls are not here, and the long time required to get them here, fill them up, send them to Washington, have the payment ordered, and the paymaster reach us, leaves no hope that our troops can be paid for five or six weeks to come. Under these circumstances there remains no other course but to urgently press upon

the attention of the Government the absolute necessity of sending us fresh troops at once, with ample supplies for them and for those now here. At least 10,000 men should be sent, and that promptly.
You will send the inclosed dispatch* by telegraph to General McClellan and also to the War Department, and forward by mail a copy of this letter. Lose no time in fitting for tbe field the three-years’ volunteers now at the arsenal, and send them here as soon as possible. Call for Colonel McNeil’s regiment of Home Guards to garrison the arsenal, and allow him to organize it for the regular three-years7 service, if he desires to do so. It is believed that the remaining Home Guards will be sufficient for the city. Should it be necessary, their term of service can be renewed for a short period for the purposes of a city garrison. ‘ The general is not aware whether Colonel Smith’s regiment has yet taken the field. If not, he presumes that both his and Colonel Bland’s regiments may be sent here without delay. You may doubtless leave the southeast part of the State to General Prentiss. Should Saint Louis be in danger from that direction, troops could be easily called from Illinois and Indiana for its defense. Moreover, a force moving on Saint Louis from the south would be exposed to attack in rear from Cairo. Hence there seems to be little or no danger from that direction. Unless we are speedily re-enforced here we will soon lose all we have gained. Our troops have made long marches, done much effective service, and suffered no small privations. They have received no pay nor clothing from the Government, and the small stock furnished by private contribution is now exhausted, so that unless the Government gives us relief speedily our thus far successful campaign will prove a failure.

Springfield, Mo., July 17, 1861. Colonel Harding, Jr., Saint Louis Arsenal, Mb.:
Sir : I inclose you a copy of a letter to Colonel Townsend on the subject of an order from General Scott, which calls for five companies of the Second Infantry to be withdrawn from the West and sent to Washington. A previous order withdraws the mounted troops, as I am informed, and were it not that some of them were en route to this place they would now be in Washington. This order carried out would not now leave at Fort Leavenworth a single company. I have companies B and E, Second Infantry, now under orders for Washington; and if all these troops leave me, 1 can do nothing and must retire, in the absence of other troops to supply their places. In fact, I am badly enough off at the best, and must utterly fail if my regulars all go. At Washington, troops from all the Northern, Middle, and Eastern States are available for the support of the Army in Virginia, and more are understood to be already there than are wanted; and it seems strange that so many troops must go on from the West and strip us of the means of defense. But if it is the intention to give up the West, let it be so; it can only be the victim of imbecility or malice. Scott will cripple us if he can. Cannot you stir up this matter and secure us relief'? See Fr6-mont, if he has arrived. The want of supplies has crippled me so that I cannot mdve, and I do not know when I can. Everything seems to combine against me at this point. Stir up Blair.

Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the Army, Washington, D. C.:
Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Special Orders, No. 112, from headquarters, under date of July 5, directing the removal from the Department of the West of Companies B, E, F, G, and H, Second Infantry, and of Captain Sweeny, now acting as brigadier-general (by election) of volunteers. The communication reached me yesterday at this place.
I have been drawn to this point by the movements of the rebel forces in this State, and have accumulated such troops as I could make available, including those in Kansas. My aggregate is between 7,000 and 8,000 men, more than half of whom are three months’ volunteers, some of whose term of enlistment has just expired; others will claim a discharge within a week or two, and the dissolution of my forces from this necessity, already commenced, will leave me less than 4,000 men, including Companies B and E, involved in your order.
In my immediate vicinity are rebel troops amounting to 30,000 and

upwards, as is currently reported, which are constantly augmenting and accumulating arms and stock. They are making frequent lawless and hostile demonstrations, and threaten me with attack. The evils consequent upon the withdrawal of any portion of my force will be apparent. Loyal citizens will be unprotected, repressed treason will assume alarming boldness, and possible defeat of my troops in battle will peril the continued ascendency of the Federal power itself, not only in the State, but in the whole West.
If the interests of the Government are to be sustained here, and in fact in the whole valley of the Mississippi, large bodies of troops should be sent forward to this State instead of being withdrawn from it, till by concentration there may be ability to overpower any force that can be gathered in the West against the Government. Troops properly belonging to the valley of the Mississippi—from Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio—have already been drawn to the East. The moral effect of the presence of the few regulars in my command is doubtless the main consideration that holds the enemy in check, and with them I may be able to retain what has already been achieved until I am strengthened, but any diminution will be imminently hazardous. The volunteers with me have yet had no pay for their services, and their duties have been arduous. Their clothing has become dilapidated, and as a body they are dispirited. But for these facts they would probably nearly all have re-enlisted.
I have no regular officer of the Pay Department, nor of the Commissary or the Quartermaster’s Departments, and the affairs of both are consequently indifferently administered. But for the immense interests at stake I could never have undertaken the great work in which I am engaged under such discouraging circumstances. Under this state of affairs, presumed to be unknown at headquarters when the order was issued, I have felt justified in delaying its execution for further instructions from the department, so far as the troops with me are concerned.

General Prentiss has eight regiments at Cairo, and could spare five of them to go into that country. If we once lose possession of the swamps of that region, a large army will be required to clear them, while if we get possession first and hold the causeway, a smaller force will do.

General : Before referring to your recent communications, allow me to explain the state of affairs in other parts of Missouri outside, of your line of operations.	*
Before you left Booneville I had the honor to advise you that large forces were gathering at Pocahontas. In accordance with your instructions, I communicated freely by telegraph with General McClellan, and, as I supposed, succeeded in having placed at your disposal sufficient troops from Illinois to hold the swamp counties of the southeast. Accordingly, I commenced by sending Bland’s regiment to Ironton, with directions to proceed as far as he could, with entire safety, in the direction of Greenville. At the same time Colonel Grant’s regiment was-ordered here, to proceed to Bloomfield, and Colonel Marsh to Cape Girardeau, where he could have easy communication with either Cairo or Bloomfield. I armed 800 Home Guards in Cape Girardeau and Scott Counties, to act as skirmishers, scouts, and guides in the marshes, and obtained authority from the Secretary of War to raise a force of mounted scouts. With these forces, and with arms for Home Guards in Wayne, Stoddard, and Butler, I expected to keep down local rebellion in that region, encourage Union men, hold the causeway through the swamps, and prevent the approach of an army from Pocahontas until the commanding generals and the authorities at Washington became convinced that it was the design of the enemy to march upon Bird’s Point and Saint Louis as soon as sufficient strength was gathered.

General McClellan countermanded his order to Grant. I could get no answer in regard to equipping Buell’s battery (though now the authority is here and a portion of the battery in service on the Missouri River), and Bland and Marsh are at the points which they were sent to, without the force to accomplish the object named. * General McClelland reason for countermanding the order to Grant was that Cairo was threatened. Therefore, instead of occupying the country through which the enemy must come, eight regiments are lying in that sickly hole, Cairo, where General Prentiss can see the whole of them at once. He also has cavalry and two light batteries.
A week since General McClellan telegraphed that he had the same definite information of troops crossing from Tennessee and coming up from all parts of Arkansas to Pocahontas, which I had learned from our scouts and spies (one of them a pilot on a Memphis boat which had conveyed some of the troops over), and had sent to him.
Now, in the southeast we stand thus: Two regiments, not in communication with each other ; no artillery, and a few Home Guards, against, what they expect to be, 20,000 men (regular troops, well provided), who design marching upon Saint Louis.
I have explained all this to General Fremont, who will be here Tuesday, and who (as does General Pope) understands the threatened movement, and will take vigorous measures to meet it.
So much for the southeast. Meanwhile, your departure from Boone-ville, and the necessity of having 1,800 troops to garrison Jefferson City, Booneville, and Lexington, encouraged the rebels in Northeast Missouri. Brig. Gen. Tom. Harris gathered a force below Monroe Station, in camp. I took the liberty of ordering Colonel Smith, of Illinois, who was lying 18 miles from him, to break up the camp. He waited a day or two until Harris had got together 1,600 men, proceeded part way, shut himself up in a seminary, and sent back for re-enforcements, as his men had been marched off in such a hurry that they forgot to fill their cartridge boxes and had only four rounds apiece. He was relieved, and Harris marched southwestwardly, on his way through Callaway County, to make a combined attack upon Jefferson City, with forces from Pettis, Osage, and Linn Counties.
To check this, I ordered up Schlittner’s regiment from Cairo. As soon as the boat arrived I gave Colonel Schiittner his marching orders, and immediately went to work to equip his regiment. McKinstry helped, and both of us worked all night. The field officers, except Hammer, and nearly all the company officers went up town, and McKinstry and I were colonels, captains, adjutants, and quartermasters, as occasion required. I finally got them off, to go to Jefferson City, to cross there. As the regiment was in the worst possible state of discipline, and as Hammer is no soldier (Schiittner and the balance I put in arrest as soon as they appeared at the gate at reveille), I couldn’t trust him, and ordered McNeil to take seven of his companies and follow him and take command. Hammer had with him forty-two mounted orderlies. The two commands united were to proceed from Jefferson City, via Fulton, to Mexico, between which two places last named Harris was.
At the same time Col. M. L. Smith, Eighth Regiment, with two companies, and four companies of the Second, under Schaefer, were sent up to Mexico by rail, where it was arranged with Hurlbut that either Palmer’s or Grant’s regiment should join them and scour the country down toward Jefferson. After fully entering into the plan, and after I 26 r R—VOL in

had sent off our forces, Huiibut sent Palmer on to guard the Chariton Bridge with his entire regiment, and left Smith to do the best he could. I, of course, immediately re-enforced him. Meanwhile the enemy burned the bridge above Mexico.
Hammer telegraphed from Hermann that he concluded to leave the river there, as transportation was easily procured, and that he had made arrangements to effect a junction with McNeil. The next I heard of him he was at New Florence, on the railroad, and McNeil, with 460 men, was near Fulton, where I then knew he would meet Harris. You can imagine my anxiety, and afterward my relief, when I heard from that brave fellow McNeil that he had fought and routed the rebels.
The next day after this affair General Pope sent me word that he would go into Northeast Missouri with a large force. He has done so. He expects to have 7,000 men there, two batteries, and four companies of cavalry. McNeil still lies at Fulton. Hammer came down from the railroad, and McNeil has ordered him here. Everything quiet in Callaway. The northeast may be considered secure.
From Jefferson I have had nothing but trouble. It being impossible to supply the places of Boernstein’s six companies, I have left him there, and—but I won’t stop to mention his performances.
At home our friends are alarmed, and the city is uneasy. I receive about five deputations per diem, warning me that I ought not to send away so many troops (2,200 U. 8. Beserve Corps left), and sometimes hinting that I will be overhauled by higher powers for doing so. The only danger is in case-of an advance from Arkansas. But the first demonstration will result in clearing Saint Louis of its secession element.
As far as your command is concerned, I fear that you think I have been neglectful of my duties, but I cannot admit the fact. Every order that you have sent 1 have immediately put into execution, and have seen it executed, so far as I could give my personal supervision to it. Mismanagement of transportation at Bolla, to which place 110 wagons had been sent before Brown moved, and probably the inferior kind of transportation furnished, accounts for the delay in getting supplies forward. Arms, ammunition, and provisions were lying for weeks at Bolla, while I supposed they were going forward, and I was not informed of the fact. When I did learn it I telegraphed to Washington, and had instructions sent to McKinstry to buy everything I required. McKinstry has also had sent to Bolla, at my request, one of Yan Vliet’s experienced clerk’s, Thomas O’Brien, to whom I have given the entire control of quartermaster’s affairs from Bolla onward. A large number of army wagons, with mules, have been bought and sent down, and I trust that there will be no more trouble there. Two hundred and fifty thousand rations were ordered on the 6th $ 4,000 shoes and clothing to match were ordered on receipt of your letter of the 13th, and I presume are all on the way. I know that part have been shipped.
The line of communication from Bolla to Springfield is kept open by Wyman and Bayles. Wyman’s is a splendid regiment, and lam trying to get other troops to supply his place and send him forward; but I am embarrassed by conduct which I scarcely think meets your approval, although I am informed that you gave your consent to it. Lieutenant-Colonel Hassendeubel, who arrived here yesterday, but has not reported himself, brought up with him one of Bayles’ companies (Company L, Bifles, Fourth Begiment formerly, but since organized with others as a battalion), and has ordered Company M up, also, for the purpose of forming a three-years’ regiment, of which he is to take the command.

I have been strengthening Bayles all I could. There are three com panies here now, mustered and ready to go down as soon as armed (by Tuesday at furthest), and the other two companies will be ready during the week, in all probability. The ten companies were to be commanded by Saxton. He is said to be on his way here at this time, and Saxton would be invaluable, either in command on the line or with you. When Lieutenant-Colonel Hassendeubel reports I shall send that company back, unless I am satisfied that he had good authority for his action.
As to re-enforcements, I shall reorganize the Second and Fourth under their captains, and put the first ten companies formed into one regiment, without regard to the preferences of individuals. This can be done during the week, as Boernstein, Schaefer, and Hammer are all to come here to-morrow.
The surplus can be organized under a temporary battalion organization, sent to the field, and afterwards filled up.
Smith’s Eighth can go down during the week, and a splendid regiment it is.
Last night the adjutant-general gave me authority to accept any regiment that offered. Two are formed in the country. Both will be ready in two weeks. Others will come. I have caused the notice of the authority to be published. Bland can’t be spared; nor can Curtis’ men. Saint Joe and the surrounding country are reported to be ready to rise. In fact, the whole State is.
McNeil can doubtless raise a regiment without difficulty. He is ordered home as soon as Pope relieves him.
The Ninth and Tenth are filling up fast, and can be ready in two weeks, probably. These statements are made upon the supposition that arms and equipments will be here as ordered.
Mulligan’s regiment of Illinois Volunteers, I forgot to say, arrived here yesterday for arms. I sent some companies to Jefferson to-day, and the remainder will go up Tuesday.
But, better than all, General Fremont telegraphed me last night that he would start for Saint Louis immediately, and when I can have the opportunity of going over the map with him I trust that he will use his power to fill this State with troops. A few weeks’ delay would make the whole State a battle-field.
And now, general, I can say that to be relieved of the responsibility which I have had upon me since you left, without the authority, after the change in the department command, to do what I saw was necessary, with my representations to the department generally unnoticed, and without even a competent clerk to aid me in the ordinary routine of business, is truly a relief 5 and no one can be so glad that Fremont is coming as I am. I have never before had the time to write you fully, and I presume that now the office is full of people, who are waiting upon the same errands with which you were formerly so much annoyed.
I shall always feel proud of the confidence which you have placed in me, and I hope you will think that I have endeavored to justify it.
Very respectfully and truly,
CHESTER HARDING, Jr.

An investigation of the circumstances attending the difficulties along the line of the North Missouri Railroad, and the wanton destruction of

bridges, culverts, &c., makes it manifest that the inhabitants of the villages and stations along the road, if not privy to these outrages, at least offered no resistance to them, and gave no information by which they could have been prevented, or merited punishment inflicted upon the criminals.
I desire the people of this section of the State to understand distinctly that their safety and the security of their property will depend upon themselves, and are directly and inseparably connected with the security of the lines of public communication.
It is very certain that the people living along the. line of the North Missouri Railroad can very easily protect it from destruction, and it is my purpose to give them strong inducements to do so. I therefore notify the inhabitants of the towns, villages, and stations along the line of this road that they will be held accountable for the destruction of any bridges, culverts, or portions of the railroad track within 5 miles on each side of them. If any outrages of this kind are committed within the distance specified, without conclusive proof of active resistance on the part of the population, and without immediate information to the nearest commanding officer, giving names and details, the settlement will be held responsible, and a levy of money or property sufficient to cover the whole damage done will be at once made and collected.
There seems to be no method of enlisting the active agency of the citizens along the line of this road for the protection of a public work in all respects so beneficial to them, except by making it their very evident personal interest to do so, ana I desire them to understand that they will be compelled to pay in full of property or money for any damage done in their vicinity. It has been impossible heretofore even to ascertain the names of the criminals engaged in this kind of work, although they were well known to everybody in the neighborhood. If people who claim to be good citizens choose to indulge their neighbors and acquaintances in committing these wanton acts, and to shield them from punishment, they will hereafter be compelled to pay for it; or if they disapprove, their objections must take more tangible form than mere words. It is not to be expected that the General Government will occupy a large force merely to protect from the people of this part of the State a work built for their own benefit, or to defend from outrages and hostility communities which encourage violations of all law by giving no information and by offering no sort of resistance. I therefore expect all law-abiding citizens at once to take measures to secure the safety of the North Missouri Railroad in their vicinity, and I notify all others that upon the safety of the road depends the security of their , own property and person. To carry out the intentions set forth above, divisions and subdivisions of the road will be made as soon as practicable from these headquarters, and superintendents and assistant superintendents appointed by name, without regard to political opinions, who will be held responsible for the safety of the railroad track within their specified limits. They will have authority to call on all persons living within these limits to appear in such numbers and at such times and places as they may deem necessary to secure the object in view. I expect all good citizens who value peace and the safety of their families and property to respond cheerfully to this arrangement, and to assume to themselves the care and protection of their own section.

Wyandotte, Kans., July 22, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir : Owing to the danger on onr southeastern frontier Governor Eobinson is in that quarter endeavoring to protect our people as best he may. In his absence I feel compelled to lay before you the present condition of our State, hoping that we may obtain relief. We have no State arms; every effort to obtain them has thus far proved a failure. All of our volunteer troops in the United States service have been ordered from the State, and we are left wholly to the mercy of secession Missouri in the east, and an Indian frontier on our south and west, and not an arm or an ounce of ammunition to protect ourselves with. In this vicinity, and in fact all along the eastern border, we are constantly menaced by threatened attacks from Missouri.
Could we be supplied with some State arms, to be properly distributed among our State troops, we should feel perfectly secure. Can we, by any process whatever, obtain these ?
Truly yours,
J. P. ROOT,
Lieutenant- Governor.

His Excellency Samuel J. Kirkwood, Governor of Iowa:
Sir : Your letter to General Hurlbut, with a communication from Colonel Bussey, has been transmitted to me. In reply to it I have to say that I most cordially accept the proffered aid in maintaining peace and quiet in those portions of North Missouri bordering on the Iowa line. In sending your State or other forces into Missouri be pleased to intrust their command to discreet and prudent officers, who should be directed to keep me advised of all their operations, and who should inform me frequently of all matters of interest or importance connected with the condition of that region. It is not my purpose to make arrests for opinion’s sake, but rather to force the people throughout this section to keep the peace among themselves, and to keep open their own lines of public communication. It is impossible that the Federal Government can employ for any length of time so large a force merely to protect public works against destruction by those for whose benefit they were built, and it is my purpose to offer such inducements to the citizens of this State as will be sufficient to secure their own active agency in protecting their lines of railroad and other works of public convenience or necessity. I have published a Notice to the people along the line of the North Missouri Railroad, which I intend also to apply to the Hannibal and Saint Joe Road, based on these views, a copy of which I herewith transmit.* As I shall enforce the penalty to the letter I hope to see good results follow before many days.
Your active interference in North Missouri will, I fear, be very shortly necessary, and in a stronger force than you suggest. The unfortunate repulse of our forces at Manassas has aroused the whole secession element in this State to renewed activity, and intelligence received this morning from Saint Louis has compelled me to suspend, for the present, further movements of the troops from this place in the direction of the Hannibal and Saint Joe Road.

Five steamers were to leave Memphis last night to take troops from Randolph to New Madrid. Union City troops are under orders to cross Mississippi.

Orders, )	Headquarters Army of the West,
No. —. j	,	Springfield, Jfo., July 26,1861.
In consequence of reports of seizures of persons and property not authorized, nor consistent with the purpose and policy of the General Government, the following orders are given:
The persons and property of all law-abiding citizens will not be molested, and it is intended this exemption shall apply to all persons, whatever may be their private opinions, who remain peaceful and quietly pursue their avocations, and who do not take nor excite others to take an attitude of hostility to the General Government. The exception here indicated has reference to such persons as are exciting others to acts of rebellion, and are themselves in arms against the General Government, and any seizure of their property will be made only upon proper authority, and will have reference solely to the means of disarming and depriving them individually of power for mischief, and not to the injury of families or the wanton destruction of property.
In cases of necessities of the service, where private property is seized or pressed into the use of the Army, the sanction of the commander on the spot must be given, and the property either paid for or a certificate of the seizure and a statement of the price due given.
The cases of plundering, wanton destruction of property, and disregard of personal rights, of which the general commanding has heard with pain, have been disgraceful to our troops, a violation of his own orders, and contrary to the purposes of the General Government. In thus expressing his disapproval of such conduct of the unscrupulous members of his command, he declares his determination to use all possible means to suppress it, and calls upon all not subject to this imputation to use all their exertions to this end, and all officers are enjoined to adopt the needful measures of vigilance and rigor to correct this evil.

a while, till lie becomes familiar with the details of affairs in the State 5 but he will have a full staff* of regular officers, and must be able to spare you soon. You are much needed here, and will be more so soon. It will soon be very necessary for me to be with my regiment, and officers fit for staff duties are very scarce here/ We have heard of the defeat of our troops in Virginia, though hardly enough to judge of its extent. I fear this will prevent our getting re-enforcements. If so, the next news will be of our defeat also.
Re-enforeements should be sent on at once. Our men are very much in need of clothing, particularly shoes. Many of the men are entirely barefooted, and hence unable to march. I hope something can be done for us soon.

Dear Sir: I have your notes about matters in Saint Louis, &c., and your proceeding seems to me perfectly correct. Now that matters North seem more quiet, cannot you manage to get a few regiments this way ? I am in the deepest concern on this subject, and you must urge this matter upon Fremont, as of vital importance. These three-months’volunteers would re-enlist if they could be paid, but they are now dissatisfied, and if troops do not replace them, all that is gained may be lost. I have not been able to move for want of supplies, and this delay will exhaust the term of the three-months’ men. Cannot something be done to have our men and officers paid as well as our purchases paid for % If the Government cannot give due attention to the West, her interests must have a corresponding disparagement.
Yours, truly,
N. LYON,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Memorandum by Colonel Phelps, from General Lyon, to General Fremont,
' July 27.
See General Fremont about troops and stores for the place. Our men have not been paid, and are rather dispirited $ they are badly off for clothing, and the want of shoes unfits them for marching. Some staff officers are badly needed, and the interests of the Government suffer for the want of them. The time of the three-months’ volunteers is nearly out, and on returning home, as most of them are disposed to, my command will be reduced too low for effective operations. Troops must at once be forwarded to supply their place. The safety of the State is hazarded; orders from General Scott strip the entire West of regular forces, and increase the chances of sacrificing it. The public press is full of reports that troops from other States are moving toward the northern border of Arkansas for the purpose of invading Missouri.

Station Greenfield, Mo., July 27,1801. Brigadier-General Lyon, Commanding, Springfield, Mo. :
Dear General: Another scout has returned from the southwest, and reports that bodies of the Confederate troops are in the vicinity of Carthage, Sareoxie, Bowers’ Mills, and some other points, apparently moving north. He learned from some of these men that McCulloch had moved east in the direction of Cassville, and that Bains was moving north, and that the intention was to move on Springfield and attack it on the west and south. He also learned that if any movement was made upon them by your command that they would receive you with masked batteries. My impression is, however, that their movements are more for provisions and forage than anything else at this time. They are sweeping all before them as they advance. Some forty-seven families, driven from the vicinity and below Carthage, passed through this place on yesterday. They give startling accounts of the depredations that are being committed by the rebels as they return. I will start a train of twelve or fifteen wagons with wheat for Springfield to-morrow morning. I shall have to get material for making sacks before I can have it ground. The material is not to be had here, nor in Melville. I will send an order for it to Springfield by the train. We shall be able in a few days to forward considerable quantities. I sent a squad of my men out on yesterday and started a machine. The owner was somewhat contrary, and I concluded to assist him, in my way. All is working smoothly. I learn to-day I can have the sacks made as soon as I get the material. Then, if necessary, I will start one or two secession mills in addition to what will grind willingly. Unless I hear of something important from below to-night, I will look up another machine to thrash wheat to morrow. I have a man in Rains’ camp at this time. When he returns I will report. We are scouting the country as far west as Lamar and south to the rebel camp.

Pleasant Plains, Iowa, Jtily 28,1861. Governor S. J. Kirkwood :
Dear Sir : Since my dispatch to you, dated Leon, July 23, communicating a general account of the recent troubles on the border of Bing-gold County, 1 have the honor to report to you further troubles, with my action in the premises, with the hope that it will meet your sanction.
On my return home from Leon, I was met by a messenger from Capt. W. C. Drake, of Corydon, who was at that time stationed at Allenville, on the border of Ringgold County, informing me that Colonel Cranor, of Gentry County, Missouri, had sent to him for assistance and re-enforcements, as the rebels were fortified on Grand River, reported to be from 800 to 1,200 strong, with three pieces of artillery. Colonel Cranor had under his command about 300 Union Missouri men, badly armed, and over 100 Iowans, who had volunteered under him. I dispatched a messenger from Garden Grove to the various armed companies within reach, ordering them to march and concentrate at Allenville immediately, also at Chariton. Communications were sent to Keokuk and Burlington for two pieces of artillery, to be forwarded to me, if they could be obtained. I also sent a messenger to Captain Drake, to ascertain more minutely the facts as to the condition of affairs in his vicinity. I started for Captain Drake’s camp, but was met 25 miles this side by the returning messengers, whom I had sent the day before. These confirmed all the intelligence brought me the day previous.
On reaching Captain Drake’s camp I ascertained that messengers had just arrived from Colonel Cranor’s command, conveying the information that the belligerents, then within 4 miles of each other, had made a treaty of peace. I have seen a copy of it, and it is in substance as follows : Each party was to lay down its arms, return home, and assist each other in enforcing the laws of Missouri against all offenders. This was a decided victory gained by the rebels, as the terms were general, and embraced the obnoxious u military bill ” of that State, and such laws as the rebel legislature, then in session in the southern part of the State of Missouri, might thereafter pass, under the auspices of Governor Jackson.
Colonel Cranor resides in the neighborhood of a large body of secessionists, and was no doubt influenced to enter into such a treaty in consequence of intimidation and threats against his life and property. The

secessionists in that region are more bold than before, and have recommenced mustering under the military laws of the State, which are obnoxious to the Union men, and to which they will not submit. The Union men of that region of the State are indignant and mortified at the terms of the treaty. Many have become disheartened, have abandoned their property and their crops, .and are leaving the State. The same feelings have taken hold of many families on the border, in Iowa. I have seen several families who, abandoning everything to the fates, have returned to friends in other States. The loyal men of both States, separated merely by an imaginary line, have the same sympathies in a common cause. Whatever excitement is raised or demonstration made in Missouri tending to injure the property and destroy the lives of Union men of that State appeals for aid to friends and neighbors in Iowa; nor do they appeal in vain. The arming and military parades made by our companies along the border at most points have produced most salutary effects; it strengthens and inspires the Union men of Missouri, and carries over to them the neutrals and a great many terror-stricken secessionists. They voluntarily come forward every day and take the oath of allegiance.
In connection with the subject of my last dispatch to you, I would say that at least 1,500 citizens of Iowa left their harvest fields and families and rushed into Missouri to the relief of the Union men. These citizens were armed in every conceivable manner, without officers, system,, or drill. They generally traversed a country broken with timber and undergrowth. Had the rebels displayed sufficient nerve and skill they might have killed and captured them all; or had a general engagement taken place, our citizens, without officers, system, or drill, might have slaughtered each other.
The loyal men of Missouri express their gratitude to the people of Iowa for their timely aid and support on every trying occasion. Everything they possessed was cheerfully offered free of charge to render our citizens as comfortable as possible. I know several gentlemen who not only fed hundreds of Missouri citizens and their horses daily, for over a week at a time, but spent hundreds of dollars, sometimes their last dollar, in this benevolent manner. On account of the excitement and constant alarm along the border our citizens lost much valuable time by frequent hurrying to arms ; therefore a vast amount of grain was lost on the fields.
In view of apprehended outbreaks, sooner or later, on the border of Ringgold and Taylor Counties, I have ordered into camp at this place those companies which have received marching orders and are already on the way to the scene of difficulty. For the reasons before stated, coupled with the news of our late reverses at Manassas Junction, the rebels here and elsewhere will be inspired with new vigor. I came into camp last night with three companies $ the rest will follow to day and to-morrow. I have commenced systematizing every department of the service, placing the most competent men in the various positions $ the strictest discipline will be adopted, and drill performed as in the United States service. Every arrangement necessary for the comfort and health of the soldiers will be carried out. The most rigid economy will be practiced, and an exact account rendered of every cent of expense incurred. The times are such that the people demand that something be done at once and effectively. We are so situated on the border that when we are called upon to act we must act at once. Heretofore we had no system; if called into action, our men were liable to be cut off by the enemy and by one another. All the companies called

into camp are armed except the cavalry, decidedly the most effective on the border. For want of better, I shall arm them with muskets as far as I can.
I have ordered into camp on the line between Taylor and Ringgold Counties two companies for thirty days, unless sooner ordered to disband, as you may direct. I will keep out scouts for the next ten days in the vicinity where danger will be most, likely to occur. I will be ready to strike at a moment’s notice. If I am convinced that matters are settled, I will in less than two w^eeks strike camp.
By that time I am of the opinion we shall be able to determine, with some degree of certainty, the shape things will assume at the strong secession holds. There has been a settled understanding among the secessionists throughout Missouri to strike a blow simultaneously with Governor Jackson, who is operating in the southern portion of the State. I will report to you as often as I can my* proceedings.
The principal design of the secessionists in the northern portion of the State is to keep up the excitement as much as possible, to divert attention from Jackson’s operations, while they will do all in their power to harass the Union men in both States. They will not come to a regular engagement. In Gentry County alone they will number at least 1,000, who are continually on the tramp, day and night, skulking in the bush.
We have derived a great deal of authentic information through our scouts, who have penetrated their camps and councils, coming in upon them from the southeast and passing for secessionists.
The 300 muskets have just arrived.
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

VII. Each commanding officer will send out such patrols and scouting parties as may be necessary to keep him informed of all matters pertaining to his jurisdiction, and will be vigilant and prompt in suppressing all combinations against the authority of the United States or the peace of the country.
No arrests will be made for opinion’s sake, unless the parties are engaged in open acts of hostility, or are stimulating others to such acts by inflammatory words or publications.
It is* the mission of the forces under my command in North Missouri to restore peace and safety to a region distracted with civil commotion, and to bring to punishment the infamous assassins and incendiaries who have been infesting this country.
All the forces in North Missouri, therefore, are cautioned against excesses of any kind, and especially against any depredations upon the persons or property of any citizen of Missouri.
Discipline and good order are essential to the efficiency and good repute of any military force, and they will be exacted from the forces under my command with all the power vested in me. The honor and reputation of their States depend upon the good conduct of the troops they have sent into the field, and I expect all commanding officers to notice, with the greatest severity possible under the articles of war, all infractions of military discipline and of good order.

Headquarters Western Department,
Saint Louis, July 30,1861. The President op the United States:
My Dear Sir : You were kind enough to say that as occasions of sufficient gravity arose I might send you a private note.
1 have found this command in disorder, nearly every county in an insurrectionary condition, and the enemy advancing in force by different points of the southern frontier. Within a circle of 50 miles around General Prentiss there are about 12,000 of the Confederate forces, and 5,000 Tennesseeans and Arkansas men, under Hardee, well armed with rifles, are advancing upon Ironton. Of these 2,000 are cavalry, which yesterday morning were within twenty-four hours’ march of Ironton. Colonel Bland, who had been seduced from this post, is falling back upon it. I have already re-enforced it with one regiment; sent on another this morning and fortified it. I am holding the railroad to Ironton and that to Bolla, so securing our connections with the South. Other measures which I am taking I will not trust to a letter, and I write this only to inform you as to our true condition, and to say that if I can obtain the material aid I am expecting, you may feel secure that the enemy will be driven out and the State reduced to order.
I have ordered General Pope back to North Missouri, of which he is now in command. I am sorely pressed for want of arms. I have arranged with Adams Express Company to bring me everything with speed, and will buy arms to-day in New York. Our troops have not been paid, and some regiments are in a state of mutiny, and the men whose terms of service have expired generally refuse to enlist. I lost a fine regiment last night from inability to pay them a portion of the money due. This regiment had been intended to move on a critical post last night. The Treasurer of the United States has here $300,000 entirely

unappropriated. I applied to Mm yesterday for $100,000 for my paymaster, General Andrews, but was refused. We have not an hour for delay. There are three courses open to me: one to let the enemy possess himself of some of the strongest points in the*State, and threaten Saint Louis, which is insurrectionary; second, to force a loan from secession banks here; third, to use the money belonging to the Government, which is in the treasury here. Of course, I will neither lose the State nor permit the enemy a foot of advantage. I have infused energy and activity into the department, and there is a thorough good spirit in officers and men. This morning I will order the treasurer to deliver the money in his possession to General Andrews, and will send a force to the treasury to take the money, and will direct such payments as the exigency requires. I will hazard everything for the defense of the department you have confided to me, and I trust to you for support.
With respect and regard, I am, yours, truly,

The commanding general in North Missouri being about to assemble in one camp, away from the railroad lines, all of the forces under his command, has determined to commit to the people of North Missouri the peace and quietude of their own section, and with these the safety of their property. Certainly the people of the various counties have today the same machinery of government and the same power of self-protection against lawless marauders as they had a year ago, and it only needs the same active agency and the same common interest to bring together for such a purpose all those who have anything at stake. It is demonstrated by sufficient testimony, and by the experience of the past two weeks, that the disturbances in Northern Missouri have been made by small parties of lawless marauders, which at any other time could have been easily suppressed with no more than the usual exertions of the people against breaches of the peace in times past. Certainly quiet and good order are of all things desirable in civilized communities, and should form a common bond of union between citizens of 27 R R—vol in.,

every shade of political opinion. When these desirable results are secured, there will no longer be a necessity for the presence of armed forces in North Missouri. It is therefore the purpose of the general commanding in this region of country, before removing the military forces under his command from their present stations, to visit with a considerable force every county seat and considerable town in North Missouri, and in each to appoint a committee of public safety of persons selected from those of all parties who have social, domestic, and pecuniary interests at stake. Each committee shall consist of not more than five persons, and wherever it can consistently be done, the proper county officers shall be selected as members. No one thus appointed shall be permitted to decline or shall fail to perform his duties, under such penalties as the commanding general shall affix. These committees shall be charged with the duty of maintaining peace and order in their respective counties, and shall have power to call out all citizens of the county, to assemble at such times and places, and in such number's, as may be necessary to secure these objects. Any one who shall refuse to obey such call will be turned over to the military authorities. If the people of the counties respectively are not willing or able to enforce the peace among themselves, and to prevent the organizing of companies to make war upon the United States, the military force will perform the service, but the expenses must be paid by the county in which such service is necessary. To secure their prompt payment, a levy of a sufficient amount of money will be at once made and collected by the officer in command. Upon the call of a majority of the committee of public safety in each county, troops will be sent to keep the peace, but as such expeditions are for the benefit of the people concerned, who have in nearly every case the power .to discharge the service themselves, the troops thus sent will be quartered upon them, and subsisted and transported by the county in the manner above specified for the whole period it may be necessary for them to remain. If, in consequence of disturbance not reported by the committee, the general commanding finds it necessary to send a force into any county to restore order, they will be in like manner billeted upon the county, unless the combination against the peace were too powerful to be resisted, or the parties engaged were organized in other counties, and brought on the disturbances by actual invasion. It is not believed that the first case can arise in any county of North Missouri; and, in the second, the forces will be marched into the county or counties where the marauding parties were organized or whence they made the invasion, and will in like manner be quartered upon them. Where peace and good order are preserved, the troops will not be required; where they are disturbed, they will be restored at the expense of the county. To preserve the peace is the duty of all good citizens, and as all will suffer alike from the breach of it, men of every shade of political opinion can act cordially together in the discharge of a duty as full of interest to one as to another. By performing this simple service as in times past, and which it is certainly as much their interest and their duty to discharge to-day, the people of this section of the country will be spared the anxiety, uneasiness, and apprehension which necessarily attend the presence of armed forces in their midst, and will again enjoy that security of person and property which has hitherto been their privilege. All persons who have heretofore been led away to take up arms against the United States are notified that by returning and laying down their arms at the nearest military post, and by performing their duty hereafter as peaceful and law-abiding citizens, they will not be molested by the military forces, nor, so far as

Headquarters District of North Missouri,
Mexico, August 3, 1861.
J. H. Sturgeon, Esq., Saint Louis, Mo. :
Dear Sir : Your letter of the 1st instant is before me.* I will, with great satisfaction, reply to your inquiries, as well from personal regard for yourself as that it gives me the opportunity to explain clearly what few persons in your city seem to comprehend.
When I arrived in North Missouri to assume the command I found the whole country in commotion, bridges and railroad tracks destroyed, or in great danger of being so, and the entire population in a state of excitement and apprehension unwarranted by the faets. My first object has been to restore quiet and secure the safety of public and private property. The only persons in arms, so far as I could learn, were a few reckless and violent men, in parties of 20 or 30, who were wandering, about, committing depredations upon all whose sentiments were displeasing, and keeping this whole region in apprehension and uneasiness. I found that those who had been quiet had been no more; had taken no part to prevent the outrages committed by these lawless bands, and had not even been willing to give information by which they could be apprehended or prevented from engaging in hostile and lawless acts against the peace of the country. So soon as these marauders found that troops were approaching, which they easily did, from the very persons who ask for protection, they dispersed, each man going to his home, and, in many cases, that home in the very town occupied by the troops. Parties of these men would leave their houses and families in the immediate vicinity, and engage in forays upon Union men and their property in the immediate neighborhood, being sure that those even most opposed to their lawless conduct would carefully shield them from exposure. The mass of the people stood quietly looking on at a few men in their midst committing all sorts of atrocious acts, and neither attempted to prevent them nor to give any information by which they could have been prevented and punished. This was the actual state of things in a large part of the eastern counties of Northern Missouri. When troops were sent out against these marauders, they found only men quietly working in the field or sitting in their offices, who, as soon as the backs of the Federal soldiers were turned, were again in arms and menacing the peace. To such an extent had this gone that there was no safety of persons or property in North Missouri except to the secessionists, and the Union men were too timid or too much in the minority to offer the least resistance. My first object was to restore peace and safety, so that the forces under my command could be removed from the vicinity of the settlements, and to do this with the least bloodshed, the least distress to quiet persons, and the least exasperation of feeling among the people. Two courses were open to me to effect this desirable result: The
Not foilnd.

first was to put in motion in all parts of this region small bodies of troops, to hunt out the parties in arms against the peace, and follow them to their homes or places of retreat, wherever they might be. This course would have led to frequent and bloody encounters, to searching of houses, and arrests in many cases of innocent persons, and would only have resulted in spreading the apprehension of distress over districts hitherto quiet. I was and am satisfied that the people of the counties in North Missouri are abundantly able to keep peace among themselves, and this is all I ask or exact from them. It is certainly their interest that they should do so. To spare effusion of blood, destruction of life or property, and harassing and ofttimes undiscriminating outrage upon the people, I have determined to present to the people, if possible, some common inducement to preserve the peace in their own midst. The common bond is their property, always in my power, though the owner might be beyond my reach. I believed, as I do now, that as soon as it was felt that only by preserving peace and quiet among themselves, and not molesting public or private property, there would result security of person and property and the power to pursue unmolested their several avocations, Union men and secessionists would alike engage in putting a stop to lawless and predatory bands, and that the persons themselves who had joined these armed marauders would soon cease their forays and abandon their organizations when they discovered that they had no sympathizers at home, and that every act they committed hostile to the peace of the country was a blow not only at their own property and safety, but also at that of their own friends and relatives. Certainly, loss of property is not to be weighed for a moment with loss of life or personal liberty, and as I believe firmly that the policy I have adopted will bring peace and quiet to North Missouri with the least destruction of human life, I intend to enforce it promptly and vigorously in all cases. Security of property and the absence of the military depend simply upon the people of North Missouri keeping the peace among themselves as in times past, and if they fail to do so they will be less wise than most of their race. I have not the slightest disposition to play the tyrant to any man on earth. I only ask the people of North Missouri to keep the peace and respect the rights of others in their own midst, and this I mean to exact from them if I have the power. If they will only do this, as they have done in times past and can easily do now, they will neither see me nor my command. I sincerely hope that these views may be satisfactory to you, and remain,
Yery truly, yours, &c.,

Capt. John 0. Kelton:
Captain : I have the honor to report, for the information of the general commanding the department, that by a simultaneous movement 1 shall to-night or to-morrow morning occupy in force the county seats of the nineteen counties lying east of the North Missouri Eailroad and its proposed continuation north to the Iowa line. The three Iowa regiments have been instructed to move as follows: The cavalry regiment to Memphis, the county seat of Scotland Cour^ty, and thence to Edina, the county seat of Knox, near which it is reported that a camp of 2,500 secessionists has been established; one infantry regiment to march upon Edina direct from Keokuk; the other to come down to Canton, and thence to march upon Edina by way of Monticello. These three regiments will effect a junction to-night or to morrow morning at that point. Brigadier-General Hurlbut is instructed to occupy Palmyra, Shelbyville, and Bloomington, the county seats of Marion, Shelby, and Macon. He has probably done so to-day. Colonel Marshall, with 500 infantry, 100 cavalry, and two pieces of horse artillery moved from this place day before yesterday with the design of occupying Paris, the county seat of Monroe, and thence upon New London and Hannibal; Captain McNulta, with 100 cavalry, upon Bowling Green, the county seat of Pike County, from Montgomery City, on the line of North Missouri road. Captain Peck, Twenty-first Illinois Volunteers, with 300 infantry, from Warrenton, on this road, marched yesterday, and occupies to-day Troy, the county seat of Lincoln. Five companies of infantry, under Major Goddard, occupy Fulton, the county seat of Callaway County. Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, with 400 hundred men, occupies Huntsville, seat of Eandolph County, to-day. Macon City, the junction of Hannibal and Saint Joe road, is held by five companies of Sixteenth Illinois Volunteers; and Sturgeon, on line of North Missouri road, by four companies of the Fourteenth.
If these movements have been made promptly and vigorously, by tomorrow morning the forces will occupy all those points, and as no place of retreat for armed parties of secessionists will be left in all that region without the certainty of encountering some portion of the United States forces, it is expected that they will either be taken or dispersed. The object of these movements was as much to put in operation the policy marked out in General Orders, No. 3,# from these headquarters, copies of

which are inclosed, as with an expectation of finding any considerable force in arms against the United States. I inclose also copy of instructions issued to officers in command of these various columns,* as also copy of a letter addressed to J. H. Sturgeon, esq.f These various papers will explain fully the policy I am pursuing and the reasons therefor. ‘ In addition to the reasons thus assigned, I have to say that, by pursuing the system of hunting out these guerrilla parties, the whole force under my command will be as much demoralized and as little fitted for active service in campaign as the marauding parties themselves. I am compelled to pursue some policy, however harsh, which will enable me to assemble my forces in a camp of instruction, that I may establish that discipline and habit of service essential to any efficiency in the field hereafter. Eaw troops such as these grow worse every day by this system of small detachments scattered over the country on police duty, and if it be pursued for two months, I shall have a mob and not an army to command.
I have selected a point near Brookfield, on the Hannibal and Saint Joe Railroad, for a camp for all the forces under my command. Water is abundant and good, and the ground fine rolling prairie, with timber at hand on both sides. I shall move to that point as soon as the quartermaster in Saint Louis can send forward transportation. It is my design in moving to that point to occupy in succession Columbia, Fayette, Glasgow, and Keytesville.

Sir : I am desirous of placing a force of* 3,000 men near the southern part of New Mexico, from which to threaten Arkansas and Texas. In operating in the Indian Territory and Arkansas we will be met and opposed by a large force of Texans, now encamped near to San Antonio, unless we keep them idle by a force threatening them with attack. The northern central portion of Texas is loyal, but at this time is overawed by rangers. A force occupying El Paso, Tex., could be moved either upon San Antonio or into the Indian Territory, and thence into Arkansas. The rebels have a large number of troops scattered along the frontier, which our force would threaten, and we would thus keep idle three times the number of our own troops. The force designed for El Paso should be drawn from the Pacific States, and should be composed largely of artillery and cavalry, and should be moved by steamer to Guaymas, and thence by land to its destination. I would therefore urge upon you the great necessity to the public service of having this brigade placed in motion at once from California to El Paso.

There is danger of their falling into the hands of the Texans. Nevertheless the regulars must come away as ordered.

My Hear Sir : The within paper, as you see, is by Hon. John S. Phelps and Hon. Frank P. Blair, jr., both members of the present Congress from Missouri. The object is to get up an efficient force of Missourians in the southwestern part of the State. It ought to be done, and Mr. Phelps ought to have general superintendence of it. I see by a private report to me from the Department that eighteen regiments are already accepted from Missouri. Can it not be arranged that part of them (not yet organized, as I understand) may be taken from the locality mentioned and put under the control of Mr. Phelps, and let him have discretion to accept them for a shorter term than three years or the war—understanding, however, that he will get them for the full term if he can*? I hope this can be done, because Mr. Phelps is too zealous and efficient and understands his ground too well for us to lose his service. Of course provision for arming, equipping, &c., must be made. Mr. Phelps is here, and wishes to carry home with him authority for this matter.

To the President :
Sir : An invasion of the State of Missouri by troops under the command of General McCulloch has taken place. €)ther invasions of that State are threatened by troops from the State of Arkansas and Tennessee. We recommend you receive into the service of the United States from the State of Missouri troops to serve for six months, to be employed in preserving peace and quiet in that State and to repel the threatened invasions, and also to remove the seat of war from among the people of that State to the southward; to invade Arkansas, and to keep the Indians west of that State in subjection.
If this suggestion shall be adopted, we recommend 5,000 stand of improved arns, in addition to those already sent to Missouri, be forthwith sent, with a proper supply of clothing, camp and tent equipage, ammunition, and means with which to obtain commissary and other quartermaster supplies, and also medical supplies, &c. Arms for cavalry and equipments should also be furnished for a battalion or regiment of mounted men to be raised in Southwest Missouri, in addition to the arms before mentioned. Arms will be needed when Arkansas shall be invaded to arm men of that State who are Union men, and willing to enter the military service of the United States.
The munitions of war we have mentioned we think should be sent to Springfield, Mo., for use at that point and its vicinity.

A special train will be sent to take up your regiment to Jefferson Barracks this morning at 9 o’clock. You are directed to proceed with it to Pilot Knob, and take command of the force stationed there under Colonels Brown, Hecker, and Bland. You will find at the post an officer of Engineers, Major Kraut, engaged in laying out intrenchments, which you are requested to push forward with all possible rapidity, employing for this purpose whatever number of men Major Kraut may judge as practicable to use advantageously. It is intended to so strengthen the frontier as to make it tenable against any force likely to be brought against it, and to this end additional men and stores will be immediately sent forward. To aid in the works, two companies of the engineer regiments will be sent forward to-day, together with four heavy barbette guns. No lighter guns are at this moment disposable. No enemy is reported as advancing with the intention of turning your position and breaking up your communication with Saint Louis by destroying the railroads in your rear. You are to scour the country in advance as far as your means will allow, keeping a watchful eye upon the approach by Fredericktown, and informing yourself* immediately of intended movements by employing reliable spies, agreeably to the instructions of yesterday’s date addressed to Col.

My Deae Me. Blaie : The greater part of the old troops, especially the foreign element, is going out of service. The new levies are literally the rawest ever got together. They are reported by the officers to be entirely unacquainted with the rudiments of military exercise. To bring them before the enemy in their present condition would be to have only an unmanageable mob. I can remedy this if I can be authorized by the President and Secretary of War to collect throughout the States instructed men who have seen service. With them I could make a skeleton—meager enough, but still a frame-work—on which to form the army. This authority ought to be allowed, and the cost of transportation. Don’t lose time, but get it quick. I assure you it will require all we can do, and to do it in the best manner, to meet the enemy.
I ought to be supplied here with four or five millions of dollars, and the disbursing officers allowed to sell them at the ruling discount. All such equipments as I can procure abroad in much less time than I could get them here I ought to be allowed to send for.
These are my suggestions. They are valuable?!* Pray act upon them ; and what you do do quick. It would subserve the public interest if Commander John Bodgers were removed and an officer directed to report to me to have command of the operations on the Mississippi. Show this to the President.
The contest in the Mississippi Yalley will be a severe one. We had best meet it in the face at once, and by so doing we can rout them. Who now serves the country quickly serves her twice.

Capt. John C. Kelton, Asst Adjt Gen., Saint Louis, Mo. :
Sir : Inclosed herewith please find consolidated report of the troops at this place as near as can be given at present.* I arrived here yesterday, and assumed command, in pursuance of directions from Maj. Gen. J. C. Fremont. Since that time I-have studied the nature of the ground it may become necessary for me to defend, the character of the troops, and the means, &c., to do it with. From all that I have yet learned from spies and loyally-disposed citizens, I am led to believe that there is no force within 30 miles of us that entertain the least ideaN of attacking this position, unless it should be left so weak as to invite an attack. It is fortunate, too, if this is the case, for many of the officers seem to have so little command over their men, and military duty seems to be done so loosely, that I fear at present our resistance would be in the inverse ratio of the number of troops to resist with. In two days more, however, I expect to have a very different state of affairs and to improve it continuously. Spies are said to be seen every day within a tew miles of our camp; marauding parties are infesting the country, pillaging Union men, within 10 miles of here. At present I can spare no force; in fact, have not suitable troops to drive these guerrillas out and afford to Union citizens of this place or neighborhood the protection I feel they should have. Artillery and cavalry are much needed, and the quartermaster’s department is yet quite deficient. The number of teams would scarcely suffice for the use of this as a military post without making any forward movement, and the horses of those we have are many of them barefoot and without forage. I have taken steps to remedy those latter defects.

ceived to lead to the supposition that this place is in danger of an immediate attack. The enemy, however, reconnoiters to within a few miles of onr picket guards, and I would therefore urgently recommend that cavalry and field artillery be sent here as early as they can be spared. From information received to-day, which I am disposed to think reliable, General Hardee is at Greenville, with 2,000 men and six or eight field pieces, with 1,000 more troops thrown forward to Stoney Battery, near Brunot. Of this force one-third is represented to be cavalry, well mounted and equipped. This being a healthy location, I would recommend that one or two of the newly-organized regiments, say Smith’s, now at Jefferson Barracks, and some other one, be sent here for drill and discipline. This would enable me to use the troops now here for scouting parties without calling upon the new volunteers for much service, that would take them from their (Jrill. If equipments complete for one hundred mounted men could be spared, particularly the carbines and revolvers, they could be efficiently used here. The twenty-four mounted Home Guards now here are destitute of suitable arms, and are almost useless in consequence.

Saint Louis, August 10,1861. Maj. Gen. John 0. Fremont, Saint Louis:
Dear Sir : At the present time the counties of Monroe, Ralls, Marion, and Shelby are infested by bands of armed men, encamped in different places, and frequently changing their place of encampment. It is believed that at the present time a large majority of the people of Monroe and Ralls Counties favor secession. In Marion and Shelby the majority is not so large. I think the number in camp in these counties must be between 1,000 and 2,000, and such is the communication kept up between them, that if they desired to concentrate a force at any point, I have no doubt they could bring out over 2,000 at short notice, including those who are usually at home at their work. In addition to the rifles and shot-guns of the country they have some muskets with bayonets; these are said to be about 400 in number. They also have two cannon, 6 and 9 pounders, made at Hannibal. It is said they have others, taken from the Liberty Arsenal. I think they have others.
These men are exceedingly bitter in their feelings of hostility, and have been led on until many of them are fit for any deed. Usually they are ignorant; they are fed on falsehood, and are encouraged in their course in the strong belief that Jackson is soon to reinstate himself as governor of the State. To this the defeat at Manassas and the invasion of the State from the South, aided by false statements, such as that Bird’s Point has been taken and that Lyon and Sigel have been cut up, give great encouragement.
It must be confessed that there have been many aggravating causes to produce this state of things. You already knowthe many depredations committed by the soldiery. Perhaps this has not been the worst. Frightful stories as to what the soldiers would do if they came into the State preceded them on their approach to a place. Many were ready to run from fright. It occurred to my knowledge in a good many cases where men thus ran and did not obey the order to halt—which very 28 R R—VOL HI

likely they did not understand if they heard—they were fired upon, not single shots, but volleys, in the presence but without the command of officers. Whether any were killed in this way I do not know. It has been reported to me that soldiers have repeatedly fired from trains at quiet, peaceable citizens. I believe this, though I have not seen it. Very many have been arrested without any cause, except that they were reported secessionists, and not only this, but indignities have been put upon them, such as requiring them to “mark time/7 dig ditches, and sink-holes for filth. The present week, Mr. McAfee, speaker of the last house of representatives, was arrested and required by General Hurlbut to dig trenches in the hot sun, as I was told, all day. Hurlbut himself told me he set him at it. McAfee is no doubt a very bad and dangerous man, still it was admitted that it was very doubtful if any charge could be maintained against him. If he is now let go for want of cause to hold him, I fear he will be able to do us much more hurt than heretofore.
Now, sir, when these facts, which are bad enough, are greatly exaggerated by crafty men, they have led many, especially young men, into a bad cause from really noble and generous impulses. When once they are in, and have committed the overt act, it is hard to get them out. These things have tended greatly to weaken the Union cause, and in the State where I am acquainted there are far less Union men than two months since.
Many timid Union men, who have seen secessionists grow more numerous, bold, and threatening, have thought they would succeed. Many such, who can, have left the State or are intending to leave it, while perhaps a larger number think it is of no use to struggle against it, and bow to the storm. I have dwelt at length on the condition of things and the causes, that you may know better how to adapt the remedy.
Complaint is made by officers that they cannot get information. It is well known that the wrath of an unscrupulous foe falls on the head of an informer, and there never has been, and is not to-day, any adequate protection for such men. Few are bold enough to take the position.
You no doubt desire to retain all your present friends if possible, and strengthen their hands, while you weaken the enemy, and give them the least possible just occasion to complain. I think if an arrangement could be made to pay for the destruction and loss wantonly and unlawfully done by the soldiery, it would go far to place the Government right before the public mind. The Government is now industriously made responsible for these abuses. Then, if persons should be exempt from arrest for their opinions, for the same reason should not their property be protected also ? Yet it is the published purpose of General Pope to hold communities responsible for acts of violence committed among them. This might do in a foreign country, but I do not think it can be done here, without alienating friends and making the feeling still more bitter on the part of the enemies. The present plan of appointing leading secessionists to look after and protect the railroads works in this way: They are authorized to call out who and as many as they please at all times. «They use this to order out the Union men, to their great annoyance, intending, no doubt, if they fail fully to respond, to report them, and as far as possible have them held responsible for any damage. It is already creating great dissatisfaction. The principle of holding peaceable, quiet men responsible in a military contribution for damages done by lawless and violent men is one which can never meet with favor in the popular mind. It is said these roving bands cannot

be reached, but well-informed men in the country think differently. A suitable mounted force would be required, and it can be done. At least their cannon can be taken, and they are a u tower of strength?? to them in their moral effect on the community.
You may consider much that I have written impertinent. I can only say I have not so intended it. I have felt that in the multitude of your cares there were many facts of which you were not aware. The work to be done in Missouri I consider far more delicate and difficult to do well than if it were a State in open hostility to the Government. I shall call attention to a few points on our road, and I have done. At Hannibal are all < ui repair shops and a large part of our engines and rolling stock. If those were destroyed it would greatly cripple the road. The destruction of the South River Bridge, between Hannibal and Palmyra, would cut us off from there and produce nearly the same effect. This bridge is one-fourth of a mile long and sixty feet high. The bridges at Chariton and Grand River are important, and would seriously embarrass the operations of the road if they were destroyed. No other bridge would delay trains more than a few days if destroyed. 1 think these bridges and Hannibal should be guarded. There are especial reasons for an attack on Hannibal. I am confident the rebels can bring a force of 2,000 men if they choose. There are only between 300 and 400 Home Guards to protect it. If attacked, we are determined to whip the enemy, but it is not prudent, as it is the key to the whole route, and it must be the only reliable route for communication and transportation to all the country west from now until next spring.
Begging pardon for this trespass on your time, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Ool. Cyrus Bussey, Commanding Regiment Iowa Cavalry:
Sir : I inclose herewith copies of printed order to regulate the policy to be pursued by any forces serving in the District of North Missouri. You will please concentrate your regiment as rapidly as possible, with such arms for their use as you can in any way procure. So soon as they are thus concentrated you will enter the State of Missouri with your whole force, and march slowly through the several counties of Clarke, Lewis, Scotland, Adair, and Shelby, occupying in turn the county seats of each long enough to restore peace and to appoint the committees of public safety specified in the order. These committees will (consist of not less than five persons, three if possible to be secessionists and men of property and standing. You will notify each of his appointment by official letter, and receive no excuse from any of them against serving. You will read and carefully explain to them the special order and the responsibilities they as well as their people incur under it, and impress upon them the certainty of the immediate execution of every penalty specified for breach of the peace among them. Make public their names everywhere and report them to me. Distribute the printed order along the line of march, calling the special attention of the people to it.
If armed bodies of men are authentically reported to you, march upon and disperse them, sending all prisoners taken in arms to this place for trial. Assume the command of all the Home Guards or other armed bodies serving in your region on the behalf of the United States or for

the protection of Union citizens of that section. Furnish me at once with a return of all such forces, showing their number, station, place of enrollment, equipment, and the authority under which they are acting. Leave a confidential person at Keokuk to communicate every day with me by telegraph, giving me all information pertaining to your operations, the state of your command, and of the country you are operating in. Communicate with the commanding officer along the line of Hannibal and Saint Joseph road, and comply with any instructions he may give you for concerted action.
A brigadier-general in the United States service will be sent to that region of country, under whose command you will place yourself and all your forces, as well as the Home Guards. Until his arrival you will yourself exercise this command. I wish you always to bear in mind that it is my purpose to enlist the entire agency of the secessionists in the preservation of peace among themselves and their neighbors, under the severe penalties prescribed. I call your particular attention to Special Orders, No. 9, herewith inclosed.*

To Colonel Schaefer,
Commanding Second Regiment Missouri Volunteers:
Sir : Information has just reached this department that this morning a force of cavalry about 150 strong took possession of Potosi. A train of cars will be immediately sent to Jefferson Barracks, upon which you will forthwith proceed with your regiment to Mineral Point, on the Iron Mountain Eailroad, and from that place you will, either by railroad or on foot, as may seem to you most expedient, but using all possible precaution, advance upon and retake Potosi, and hold it at all hazards, endeavoring, if possible, to take prisoners. Orders have been given to replace immediately the Home Guards under Colonel Kallmann, hitherto stationed on that railroad.
J. 0. FREMONT,

Headquarters Western Department,
Saint Louis, Mo., August 12, 1861. Col. J. McNeil, TJ. S. Reserve Corps, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Sir : Inasmuch as the term of the several regiments of the U. S. Reserve Corps in Saint Louis has expired, or in a few days will expire, and the men be paid off, and as the present state of political affairs in Missouri, as well as the movements and designs of the enemy, will not permit their being permanently disbanded, I have determined, in order to promote the common welfare and protect public and private property, to have them forthwith reorganized:
The new organization will comprise five regiments of infantry, with a reserve of two companies to each ; two squadrons of cavalry ; and two batteries of light artillery.
*Not found.

## p. 437 (#451) ############################################

﻿Chap, xj	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------UNION.	437
The troops will be required to enlist for the war, unless sooner discharged, and will, except the reserve companies, be subject to the same regulations and receive continuously the same pay as the volunteer regiments. The reserve companies will be required to replace the Home Guard regiments should the latter for any cause be called to other counties of this State, and will receive the regular pay of volunteers for such actual service. When not in service the reserve companies will be under more liberal regulations; they will not be obliged to perform guard duty, and their hours of drilling will, so far as possible, be made to conform to their peculiar public and private position.
In order to acccomplish without delay this urgent reorganization of the Home Guard of the city of Saint Louis, you are hereby directed to assemble your regiment at its headquarters, and ascertain from each man under your command whether he would prefer to continue in the regiment or to join the cavalry or artillery, or serve only in the reserve for the above-mentioned peculiar emergencies. After ascertaining in this way the wishes of the men, you will proceed immediately to the reorganization of the infantry regiments. The companies will, in the first place, elect their company officers, who will thereupon nominate their field officers, and submit their names for approval to the general commanding the department. The colonels, when accepted, will nominate a brigadier, and submit his name in like manner for approval. After his appointment a brigade-inspector will be selected by the general commanding. The officers of the regiment having been decided upon, the reorganization of the regiment, and, if possible, also that of the reserve companies, should be immediately completed, and the returns submitted to this department.
You will communicate this order to all the members of your regiment, and proceed with the execution of it until the election and approval or a colonel, who will, immediately after his appointment, report himself, with his officers, to these headquarters, when the regiment will be uniformed, armed, equipped, and provided with everything necessary for actual service, and at the same time with special instructions for drill and discipline.
The rolls of those men who should prefer to join the cavalry or artillery you will also submit as early as possible, with the officers suggested, to these headquarters. Should any deficiency exist, this department will supply all the different companies with efficient officers and complete their organization.
As it is my design to have in each regiment one company of sharpshooters and one company of pioneers, all the best marksmen should be concentrated in one company and all the best mechanics in another, under officers best adapted to the command of those companies.

are required to send out, with all necessary precaution, a moving column on the road to Greenville, whose duty it will be to ascertain the enemy’s forces, movements, and intentions. A report having reached this department that Potosi had been captured by a force of the enemy’s cavalry, I yesterday ordered Colonel Schaefer, with his regiment, strengthened by two companies of Illinois troops and fifty Illinois cavalry, to retake and hold that place.
After the occupation of Potosi, Colonel Schaefer is directed to report to you and to make the proper disposition for the protection of the railroad and bridges.
Major Kraut, at present in Ironton, will be ordered to this city for the purpose of erecting fortifications here. His place will be supplied by First Lieut. William Hoelcke, of the Engineer Corps, who will be instructed, immediately upon his arrival, to report himself to you and to carry on and complete the work commenced by Major Kraut.

Ironton, Mo., August 12,1861. Capt. John C. Kelton, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Since my report of yesterday my scouts have returned from towards Brunot, having penetrated as far south as a point occupied by the enemy’s most advanced pickets the night before. All had left, and from the best information received two forces are moving, one as if to come in upon the railroad from the west, the other from the east. Marauding bands are still reported on the road from Potosi to Caledonia and farther south. To-morrow I shall have a party in pursuit of them. Yesterday quite a party of horsemen were 7 miles south of here on a road west of the one leading to Brunot, but could not be found this morning. Without cavalry it is impossible to pursue these bands with any prospect of overtaking them, and with the amount of picket guard, fatigue, and other duty that must necessarily be performed, it is difficult to spare men for these scouting parties. To-day my guard detained the mail coming in, and I have stopped the delivery of letters to a. few suspected persons, and the forwarding six packages of letters, as follows: Four to points in Arkansas and Memphis, via Little Rock, and one to Brunot. These will be detained, awaiting the decision of the department commander thereon. I am entirely without orders for my guidance in matters like the above, and without recent acts of Congress which bear upon them.
I would respectfully urge the necessity of forwarding to this point, say, forty complete teams. About one hundred good and well-broken mules, now in use about the furnaces, can be purchased here $ also harness and some good wagons.

You will do all you can to capture the party of rebels who are infesting the country through which you pass, but be careful about crediting reports you receive from citizens. When it is necessary to get provisions for your men, you will take them from active secessionists, if practicable ; if not practicable, from Union or law-abiding citizens, giving an order on the post commissary here for the pay. Compel persons whose teams you press to send teamsters to take the teams back. You have my private instructions how to conduct this pressing business so as to make it as little offensive as possible.

I have reliable evidence that about 3,000 troops, mostly mounted, but badly armed, staid near Fredericktown last night, and expressed the intention of moving to-day toward Farmington, with the intention of coming in and destroying the railroad. At the same time it is very reliable that 5,000 well-armed men, under General Hardee, are advancing upon this place. I express you the facts, and leave it to the general commanding whether in his judgment more troops should not be sent. I have to report at the same time that 32-pounder iron pieces sent here are not yet mounted, and I fear cannot be to-morrow.

General Grant, commanding at Ironton, attacked yesterday at 6 by a force reported at 13,000. Railroad seized by the enemy at Big River Bridge, on this side of Ironton. The governor of Ohio postponed my urgent request for aid until ordered by you. Will you issue peremptory orders to him and other governors to send me instantly any disposable troops and arms ? An artillery company of regulars at Cincinnati, which has been there three months. I have applied for it repeatedly. The enemy is in overpowering force, and we are very weak in men and arms. We have neglected nothing, and will do all that is possible, but not one moment should be lost in giving us any possible aid in fixed artillery and men with arms in their hands. A little immediate relief in good material might prevent great sacrifices.

Sir: Since my report of yesterday two spies have come in, and report the position of the enemy about the same as yesterday. Two companies sent from here yesterday morning traveled northwest to Caledonia, meeting there three companies from Potosi; found all quiet, as infantry must necessarily do, unless they fall in with an overwhelming party. With the troops from Potosi is one company of Colonel Schaefer’s regiment, which I have ordered to Saint Louis by to-morrow’s train, understanding that Colonel Schaefer had been ordered there. To-night I have sent out towards Frederiektown Colonel Hecker, with all of his regiment not otherwise on duty.
I will call your attention again to the fact that there is no field artillery or cavalry at this post. Both are much needed, especially if effective movements are to be made from here. There are three 24-pounder

pieces, four 32-pounders, and one 6-pounder brass piece, without a limber. Ammunition sufficient for not exceeding thirty minutes’ steady firing. Heavy ordnance can be of no special service here, for there is no point scarcely where point-blank range of a 6-pounder can be got.
To-day, supposing an attack possible, I had eleven teams, belonging to the Pilot Knob Iron Company, drawn into service, giving a receipt for them. The command was directed to make storehouses of the wagons for their provisions, so that, in case of a move to the support of our pickets becoming necessary, supplies could be moved to them without delay. Every move of the enemy seems to evince a determination to fall upon the railroad at some point north at the same time an attack is made here. I am not fully persuaded that an attack will be made here for the present, but hold my command ready to make the best resistance possible with the means at hand.
The engineer ordered here to relieve Major Kraut has not yet arrived, and, under the instructions from General Fremont, I do not understand that Major Kraut is to be relieved until his successor does arrive. I understand that equipments for 100 horses are here, but the fact was never reported to me officially.
I should have stated in the proper connection that I have no artillerists, nor officer suitable to take command of a company to drill them as such. I would respectfully recommend the appointment of an ordnance sergeant for this post.

Sir : I have to-day to note the arrival of two regiments of infantry— Colonel Lauman, Seventh Iowa Regiment, and Colonel Thayer, First Nebraska Regiment. I have also ordered the Twenty-first Regiment Illinois Volunteers, under Colonel Alexander, forward upon the Greenville road, and Col. Frederick Hecker, Twenty-fourth Illinois Volunteers, upon the Fredericktown road, taking five days’ rations, with instructions to form a conjunction at Brunot. I expect to follow tomorrow with artillery, should any arrive, a few companies of infantry, and more provisions, if means of transportation can be procured $ otherwise I shall send teams back from Brunot or Greenville for additional rations.
I purchased to-day sixteen wagons and sixty-eight mules, subject to the approval of Major-General Fremont. These teams are well adapted for our use—more suitable and more efficient than those which we have heretofore employed or found in the service of this command. I shall to-morrow purchase five more wagons and twenty mules on the same terms. The teams which I have conditionally purchased have been for some time in the service of the Government without charge if now purchased ; otherwise to receive compensation.
Requisitions were made upon Quartermaster McKinstry some days since for camp equipage, &c., but as yet I have received nothing. At this time I have not a single tent for my headquarters, nor is there any stationery in the quartermaster’s department.
Several prisoners now in my charge I shall at the earliest convenience send to the arsenal, with charges accompanying.
Since writing the above a messenger has come in from a spy I have out, who reports the rebel force much greater than has heretofore been represented—from 25,000 to 30,000. The spy mentioned is an officer in disguise. From representations made by the messenger, the information which has caused them to retreat was obtained from a preacher of this place, who managed to get out of camp, and is now back again, without a pass. I have ordered his arrest, and will have him sent to Saint Louis if caught.
I shall move with the detachments of my command, viz, the Twenty-first and Twenty-fourth Illinois Regiments, towards Brunot, subject to any order from your department, and will report as often as practicable.

To-day I move upon Fort Scott, to stay the advance of the enemy into Kansas, and protect a large train turned hack upon that point after the retreat of General Sigel. I hope to concentrate by Monday some 1,700 troops at that point, to fortify and to call on the people of that portion of Kansas to rally upon us. We should be re-enforced at the earliest possible moment with not less than three regiments. We should be supplied with artillery and small-arms, horse equipments, &c. Kansas is destitute. I have a thousand horses now arriving and eager men to mount them, but without arms or equipments.
Our men are without uniforms, blankets, or shoes. The Government promised to supply us, but as yet have failed. With supplies, when Sigel advances, I trust to operate upon the flank of the enemy to some purpose.

In consequence of the firing on the trains of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph road, General Hurlbut, with 600 men and two pieces of artillery, has been occupying Marion County for the past ten days, and enforcing the provisions of General Orders, No. 3, from these headquarters, which requires the inhabitants to furnish quarters, subsistence, and transportation in case of difiieulties of the kind. The effect has been complete, and in compliance with solemn pledges on the part of the citizens, presented by a delegation sent to me, they were yesterday relieved from the penalty. The force under Martin Green has been driven into the northern part of Adair County. Colonels Moore and Bussey from the east, and 550 men and two pieces of artillery from the south, are moving upon him, and will probably unite to day in the immediate vicinity of his camp. No doubt his forces will disperse, as has been usual. No surprises are possible in a country where all the inhabitants are willing to warn, if not to assist, such parties. With these exceptions all is quiet in North Missouri, as reported to me by the committees of public safety appointed in conformity to General Orders, No. 3. That order seems to have united all responsible persons who have anything to lose in efforts to preserve the peace, and they have organized for that purpose. If any skirmishing is done, it will be done by the people themselves, who are abundantly'able to protect themselves, and who have a motive to do so which they had not before. Of course they wish troops sent to do this service, as it will save them the necessity of personal exertion, but I think it best that they should do the work themselves where it can be done.
Both railroads are undisturbed since the penalty inflicted in Marion County. Of course there is much excitement and uneasiness among the people since the affair at Springfield, but I think from the best

information I can get that it will result in no disturbance of moment. I have ordered all the forces in and near Jefferson City to concentrate at some strong point in the town or immediate vicinity, and shall order Colonel Worthington’s Iowa regiment, after visiting Booneville, Glasgow, Lexington, and Brunswick, to return and take position also at Jefferson City. I transmit a letter from General T. L. Price, bearing on this subject.*
Authentic intelligence from Booneville represents everything quiet and no fear of a disturbance. I have encouraged the formation of Home Guards to act under the orders of the commanders of the U. S. troops at every point occupied by them, but have given them no encouragement as to being armed, equipped, or rationed by Government, except such as have been authorized by the general commanding the department. I have the honor to request to be furnished with the names, place of residence, and forces authorized to be thus raised within my district. Bumors and exaggerated stories are current, but after as full information as can be procured by letters and reports, I think North Missouri can be left as it stands without apprehension of serious disturbance.
If consistent with the views of the general commanding, I would be glad if two companies of Marshall’s cavalry and a section of Davidson’s artillery, now at Jefferson Barracks, could be placed at my disposal for temporary service of six or eight days.
I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

You will make your reports to these headquarters, and receive rations from here. Owing to the scarcity of transportation at this point, you will only take with you five days’ rations, and order back as much of your train as can be spared, under a small escort, to get new supplies. Instructions, if not given before, will be sent to you at Fredericktown. You should move as early as Tuesday morning, if practicable.

to forbid the transporting of artillery, he returned to New Madrid, where he was on Friday morning, with all his forces.
Jeff. Thompson’s main body was at Sikeston this morning. He has a detachment at Benton of some 500.
I have the honor to inclose you a letter from Ex-Lieutenant-Governor lieynolds (a copy of which has been sent me) j also another from Jeff. Thompson to me, containing several threats.
I plead guilty to the charge of having written the note mentioned, and would have done as I promised had Captain Price committed the threatened outrages on the peaceable citizens of Commerce. My threats had the desired effect, and prevented his doing any act of violence there. I tried hard to get hold of Captain Price and his troop of marauders, but they always run, even when but half their number of foot soldiers are opposed to them. The young man Price and his brother-in-law, who were taken prisoners, have been notoriously active in aiding the enemy. Their father, the brother of Captain Price, was the agent for procuring supplies for the New Madrid forces, and his mules, servants, and family were all engaged in transporting them.
I am happy to learn that the pretended governor of the State disapproves of the proclamation of his commanding general, and I shall most certainly endeavor to aid him in carrying on the war according to civilized usage. I can furnish the ex-governor with information which, if he means what he writes, will keep him steadily engaged for some time in punishing Missouri forces.
I will dispatch you by telegraph from Jonesborough to night as to whether I shall take any action in regard to the Branch Bank at- this place.

Silt: Capt. Charles Price, of the Missouri State Guard, has received a letter from Messrs. B. S. Curd and William M. Price, dated Cape Girardeau, August 10, 1861, in which they write: “The colonel says that if you attack Commerce to-night he will hang us.” With this note is another, recognized to be in the handwriting of Col.

The gentlemen held by Colonel Marsh are, as I am credibly informed, citizens of this State, and unconnected in any way with military operations.

captured Mr. William M. Price wantonly burned his father’s warehouse and took away a large quantity of corn and 60 mules. Similar outrages are believed to have been very lately committed at the farm of General N. W. Watkins, near Cape Girardeau, and also by Colonel Marsh’s troops. I therefore, in the interest ol humanity, lay these matters before you, and request a frank answer to these inquiries:
Does this conduct of Colonel Marsh and his troops meet your approval % If not, what steps do you propose to take in respect to the guilty parties and in order to prevent the repetition of such conduct ?
It is the desire of the Missouri State authorities to conduct the present war according to civilized usages, and any departure from them by Missouri forces will be properly punished by their officers if aware of it. I deem it proper to add that on seeing Colonel Marsh’s letter 1 immediately instructed the general commanding the Missouri State Guard in this district to hold in close custody a number of prisoners recently taken by him and belonging to your forces. Should Colonel Marsh’s future treatment of Messrs. Curd and Price necessitate the hanging of any of those prisoners in retaliation, I am content that impartial men shall judge who is morally responsible for their melancholy fate.

The inhabitants of Commerce have mostly fled to Santa Fe, in Illinois, a village opposite. They are full of stories of wanton and cruel destruction of the property of Union men, killing stock, stealing horses, burning corn fields, destroying household property, robbing women and children of their wearing apparel, and of carrying off young girls to their camp.
The inhabitants of Commerce are earnest in their entreaties that some force may be sent to protect them.

The gunboats are already ordered to Commerce, and cavalry scouts sent upward along the shore to watch the enemy’s movements. Asking your attention to these facts, you are directed to detach a force of your command sufficient, in concert with our troops at Cape Girardeau, to prevent the enemy from taking possession of Commerce and interrupting the free navigation of the Mississippi Biver. I have received no report from you either in relation to your own proceedings or the strength and movement of the enemy, but presume that you have made dispositions to prevent General Hardee’s command at Greenville (reported to be about 7,000 men, 2,000 horses, ten 6-pounders, and two 12-pounders) from co-operating with the rebel forces moving from Charleston.

Jefferson City, Mo., August 22, 1861. Capt, Speed Butler, Asst. Adjt. Gen., Saint Louis, Mo.:
During yesterday I visited the camps of the different commands about this city, and selected locations for troops yet to arrive. I find a great deficiency in everything for the comfort and efficiency of an army. Most of the troops are without clothing, camp and garrison equipage. Ammunition was down to about ten rounds of cartridges, and for the artillery none is left.
The artillery here consists of four 6-pounders, without artillery-men, and one 24-pounder howitzer, too heavy for field use. The post quartermaster and commissary have not been here since my arrival, so that I cannot report fully as to these departments. They are apparently in a bad condition. There are no rations to issue. The mules sent some time since are guarded in a lot, no effort being made to get them into teams, and a general looseness prevailing. I have fitted out an expedition of 350 men to scour the country around where the cars were fired into day before yesterday. Such information has been received here as will probably lead to the arrest of many of the parties engaged. The party in pursuit will subsist off of the community through which they pass. Stringent instructions have been given as to how supplies are to lie got. From reports received here the whole of this country is in a state of ferment. They are driving out the Union men and appropriating their property. The best force to put this down would be mounted Home Guards, and I would therefore recommend that as many as possible of this class of troops be put upon horses. Generally they are able to mount themselves, and when they cannot, horses could be obtained from good secessionists who have been aiding and abetting the Southern cause. I would further recommend that companies of Home Guards be received without any reference to their being organized into regiments. They can be attached to other regiments either by companies or squadrons, and be quite as effective as if in large bodies.

Since my last report the Twenty-fifth Illinois Regiment, Colonel Coler commanding, and seven companies of the First Illinois Cavalry have reached here.

Colonel Marshall goes in command of the expedition, taking with him all his own command, about 300 Home Guards, and a section of Taylors battery, should it arrive in time. They will subsist on the country through which they pass, under full instructions. I am not fortifying here at all. With the picket guard and other duty coming upon the men of this command, there is but little time left for drilling. Drill and discipline are more necessary for the men than fortifications. Another difficulty in the way of fortifying is that I have no engineer officer to direct it; no time to attend to it myself, and very little disposition to

The instructions of General Fremont relative to the seizure of the banks at Lexington and Liberty have been communicated to Colonel Marshall, who was under marching orders at the time the instructions were received. It is not possible to spare men from here for the expedition to Paris without leaving this place too much exposed. With re gard to the Home Guards I should like to have some instructions. I have not been able to learn head nor tail about them, notwithstanding all my efforts. I know there are many of them—some mounted, others with teams, and some without arms, teams, or saddle-horses. I would recommend that some officer be sent here with special instructions as to how they are to be organized and received, and who will have no other duty to attend to until this is performed. The party sent out by me to the neighborhood of where the cars were fired into on Tuesday has returned. The report has not yet been received, but may be in time to accompany this. A few persons have been arrested who are suspected of having been engaged in the firing.
I have no reliable information as to the movements of McCulloch’s forces, but there is a current rumor here that he is moving towards this point. From a spy who came in yesterday I learn that companies are being organized in all the counties west of here. Some of these bands are acquiring considerable proportions. Many troops have crossed the Missouri River from the north within the last two weeks, and are joining the forces on this side. If I had sufficient force, all that could be stopped.

intend to defend the line of the Marmiton, including Fort Scott. But as that post cannot be fortified, I am withdrawing therefrom all trains and stores not required for immediate use. This, the Little Osage line, about 12 miles north, I can, and am fortifying, and here I will establish such depots as are necessary while organizing the brigade. There are now at Fort Scott about 1,200 men, say 600 cavalry, and about the same number of infantry, including the little artillery. The cavalry will be employed in defending the border and dispersing such parties as they can reach. The infantry are drilling industriously, and all at work filling up their companies. At this point we have two companies, about 100 men, engaged in erecting intrenchments and drilling.
Three miles in advance, on Fish Creek, on the road to Fort Scott, we have 40 men; 5 miles below, at Barnesville, 3 miles from the line, on this river, on the military road from Kansas City to Fort ^cott, we have about 100 men intrenched and drilling; at Mound City we are fortifying, to be manned by the local militia.
With a small force on last Monday I could have destroyed Bains’ Division ; he was within 30 miles of us. Yesterday we dispersed a force at Ball’s Mill. Kight before last we sent a force south to disperse a camp ; they have not yet returned. Dean’s command, about 230, that you are conversant with, left us yesterday to return to Bates County.. This morning at 3 o’clock I received a dispatch from him and Jennison, informing me that 500 rebels had crossed the line and were threatening Paola and Osawatomie. I directed him to pitch in and clear the border between us and Kansas City, calling in such assistance as he could get from the country. I at the same time directed Montgomery to send a body of cavalry along the border north from Fort Scott up the military road.
Our little force will be actively employed to defend Kansas and confuse Missourians. But, sir, I assure you that Fort Leavenworth, and Kansas should be defended from this point, and the idea of holding artillery to rust at Fort Leavenworth does not strike me with any favor. I hope the first troops forwarded will bring down artillery that can be used to some purpose.
General Weed has this moment come in from Fort Scott. He says the enemy is threatening; that a large force is marching upon us ; that a rumor reached Fort Scott yesterday that our party, under Williams, had a fight; we feel some uneasiness, but hope for the best. All the Government stores and trains will be removed back upon this line today and night from Fort Scott.
Can you not send us re-enforcements; with it, we could jday hell with Missouri in a few days.

Headquarters District North Missouri,
Saint Louis, August 25, 1861,
Maj. Gen. John 0. Fremont,
Cotndg. Department of the West, Saint Louis, Mo. :
General : In view of my conversation with you this morning, I have the honor to report as follows:
The policy of making the people along the lines of railroad in North Missouri responsible for any damage done to the roads has perfectly secured them from destruction since it was established. The system of holding property of counties responsible for breaches of peace enlists by the only method possible the active agency of the secessionists in keeping down riots and disturbances. When so large a portion of the population sympathizes with the authors of the atrocious acts of guerrilla warfare which have hitherto disgraced North Missouri, it is impossible to apprehend the perpetrators of such outrages. Since the population has been notified that their property would be made to pay the expense of suppressing such disturbances, thousands of persons have taken an active part in preventing them who never did so before. Marion County, from which came the protests against this policy, has been the worst county in the State. At the request of a deputation from that county, it was relieved from the first levy made for firing into a train on the Hannibal and Saint Joseph road, but the troops which had been quartered at Palmyra had not proceeded 3 miles from the place before the train carrying them was fired into from the road-side, and one man killed and several wounded. They are now under contribution for this second and aggravated charge.
I have received intelligence from x>ersons of character in most of the counties of North Missouri stating that this policy alone, and the fear of the penalty to property prescribed in it, prevents the secessionists from driving out Union men and destroying their property. The secession papers in North Missouri are now entreating the population to preserve the peace, because the leading State-rights men (secessionists) are made to serve on committees of safety against their will, and their property is made responsible for any violence or breach of peace committed by their friends. Whenever it is discovered that the penalty set forth will not be executed, I firmly believe that every county in North Missouri will be in a state of tumult, and will require for the restoration of peace five times the force now needed. It is possible that some lukewarm Union men may turn secessionists under the operation of this policy, but it is my sure conviction that if it be not enforced thousands of good Union men will be driven from their homes and their property despoiled. By enforcing it in Marion County, the only place it has been necessary to do so, I feel sure there will result quiet in that section of country. Where outrages are so expensive, they will not be repeated. The system of pursuing the perpetrators of these outrages can lead to no good results while so large a body of people sympathize with them. Its only effect is to break down and demoralize our forces, to carry distress and apprehension to districts hitherto quiet, and to render our forces less and less fit for service.
I do not doubt, from the results up to this time, that the policy of holding property responsible is the true policy, and I firmly believe that if the penalty now hanging over Marion County be rigidly enforced, there will be no occasion for anything of the kind there or elsewhere a second time. I therefore respectfully, but earnestly, request you to suffer this penalty to be exacted, lest a much worse thing befall that

people hereafter. It is, of course, entirely in the power of the people of the various counties in North Missouri to keep the peace among themselves. If they will not do so, it surely is not harsh to require that the expense of having it done should be paid by the county. No one will say that if this policy be abandoned there will be anything like quiet in North Missouri. It is the object of the protestants against it to have large forces of Home Guards, paid and subsisted by the United States, raised in their midst, so that much money will be distributed among them, and the United States shall pay a large local police force of their own people. If they have to pay the expense themselves, they will take care that nothing occurs that will render such a force necessary. It is to be borne in mind that the disturbances in North Missouri are purely local and personal, and have no view to the result of the great operations of Government. The people in that region are merely fighting with each other, in many cases to satisfy feelings of personal hostility of long standing. It is a war which can only be ended by making all engaged in it suffer for every act of hostility committed. As I am satisfied from personal examination and experience that this policy will keep North Missouri quiet with the smallest force, and that a departure from it now will only result in an uprising in every county against the Union men, which will require large forces to be withdrawn from here to put it down, I most urgently recommend that no favorable reply be made to those who have addressed you on this subject. On the one side there is the risk of alienating a few men hitherto half-way for the Union 5 on the other the risk of having a considerable portion of the people in every county of North Missouri in arms against the peace. One failure to enforce rigidly this penalty will destroy all belief that it will ever be enforced at all.
Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,
JNO. POPE,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Boston, August 27, 1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington:
Sir : The State of Missouri is so important to the Union, that I suppose you will be glad of any information regarding it which comes from a reliable source. I hand you a few extracts from the late letters of Mr. Hayward, general agent of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad. Through the agencies of this line across the State he has great facility for obtaining information and judging of the progress of our cause in the northern portion of the State. His views with regard to the probable effect of measures which have been heretofore taken towards suppressing the rebellion in that vicinity have shown so clear a judgment as to give with us here much weight to his opinions.
With rebel camps forming undisturbed all along through that part of the State their early concentration into another formidable army may reasonably be looked for. All they seem to lack is a leader for a vigorous demonstration. It is the opinion of some of our best-informed citizens, obtained from their Southern correspondence, that the possession of Missouri is regarded of the utmost importance to the Southern cause. The possession of the lead mine of that State by the rebels will also be a most unfortunate thing for the country. Its position, lying between the rest of the free States and Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and even Cali-

forma on the west, and controlling the banks'of the Mississippi opposite Kentucky and half of Tennessee on the east, makes its early possession by the Government a vital matter connected with any movements in the Mississippi Valley. Surrounded as it is by,free States, any delay in its subjugation will have a damaging effect upon the Government at home and a disastrous influence abroad. It is supposed that very great efforts will be made by the secessionists of that State to carry in their favor the election soon to be held for new State officers. Union voters near the borders are being driven out, and large numbers of others with their families put in such extreme peril that self-preservation is rapidly joining them to the forces of the enemy. While it may be true that the Union force can beat more than their number of rebels if it can get at them, the general character of the rebels in that State is such, that their subjugation by an equal number of Government soldiers will certainly be a very expensive and tedious process, if not a total failure. Large bodies of mounted guerrillas will require a large force and severe measures to bring them to terms, and it seems to me that every day’s delay in pushing the most vigorous offensive measures in North Missouri is fraught with great peril and mischief that it will cost much blood and treasure to correct.
In view of the intense activity of the enemy—his rapidly gaining strength; his continued successes, with the choice of secession or Union soon to be voted on in the selection of State officers, and the larger part of the voters now in the control (by friendship or fear) of the .rebels— seeing so much affecting not only that State, but the whole cause at stake there, I have felt it my duty to write you, upon whom rests so much of the responsibility in this matter.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Extracts from letter of J. T. K. Hayward to J. TV. Brooks, dated u Steamer Hannibal City, August 13,1861.”
I go down to-day with a committee from Palmyra to see what can be done to put a stop to the outrages perpetrated on the community by Government troops, partly under orders of officers and partly without orders. I will state the case in part, Last week our trains were fired into several times about 6 miles west of Palmyra, in Marion County. On Thursday night a party of rebels came into Palmyra, disarmed a few Union men, and did some trifling damage. I think there is good reason to believe that the cars were fired into by rangers from another county, and without any knowledge of the people near them, and that the course is disapproved and reprehended by nearly all. The citizens, I think, are generally opposed to violence, and some of the leading secessionists interfered to prevent trouble and bloodshed when the rebel band visited Palmyra. Now, to carry out General Pope’s programme, some 600 men are sent to Palmyra, and the county court notified to provide them with rations and pay all expenses. In their failure the city council is notified to do it at county expense, and in their failure notice is given that they shall take it where they can most conveniently find it, and that these men will be quartered there until they (the people) arrest and deliver over to military authority the men who have been guilty of these offenses. Yesterday, as the rations were not forthcoming, they sent out a company of troops, and visited the stores, and took

enough for two days’ rations, givingorders on the county. In addition, contrary to all general orders, many citizens were arrested without cause, and generally soon discharged. Houses also have been opened and searched, and for no good reason. Then, as a sample of what is done by some officers, last week a man named McAfee (speaker of the last house of representatives) was arrested. General Hurlbut ordered him to be set to digging trenches and pits for necessaries, at which he was kept all one day when the mercury ranged about 100 degrees in the shade. A few days after he was taken from Macon to Palmyra, and the general ordered him to be tied on the top of the cab on the engine. It was prevented by our men, who, when persuasion failed, the engineer swore he would not run the engine if it was done (and I upheld him in it), and as he was being marched to the engine to mount it the signal was given, and the train started, giving them barely time to get on the cars. When there is added to this the irregularities of the soldiery— such as taking poultry, pigs, milk, butter, preserves, potatoes, horses, and in fact everything they want ; entering and searching houses, and stealing in many leases ; committing rapes on the negroes and such like things—the effect has been to make a great many Union men inveterate enemies, and if these things continue much longer, our cause is ruined. These things are not exaggerated by me, and, though they do not characterize all the troops, several regiments have conducted in this way, and have also repeatedly fired on peaceable citizens—sometimes from trains as they passed—and no punishment, or none of any account, has been meted out to them. Then, drunkenness is a great curse of officers and men. Fremont would no doubt be glad to have things different, but he has a great deal of care and responsibility thrown upon him. It is a new sphere of duty, and one with which he cannot be very familiar. Then he hardly knows who to trust and confide in. I presume he feels that other parts of his field demand his attention more urgently, and he intrusts these matters to Pope and Hurlbut. “ Then,” he says to me, u the Government appoints and sends these men. It is hard to get rid of them. I must prefer charges and maintain them,” &c. If the thing goes on this way much longer, we are ruined. I fear we cannot run the road or live in the country except under military protection. It is enough to drive a people to madness, and it is doing it fast. I heard a good Union man in Palmyra, who keeps a hotel, say : u I am doing what I can and feeding these men. I get nothing ; $1,000 will not make me whole, and if it goes on much longer I am ruined, and if this is the way my property must go I would rather apply a torch to it.” I urged upon Fremont that the best disposal he could make of the money it would require would be to appoint a commission to appraise the damage and loss occasioned by the lawless acts of the soldiery and have them paid. The members of one regiment at one time sent over sixty horses and mules to Quincy, with orders to send them to Chicago and sell them on their own account. They were discovered and sent back, with orders to return them to their owners; which was done, I think, in most cases. This same regiment, it is claimed, took off several negroes when they left town, and I think there is no doubt of it. I shall now make a strong effort to have these abuses corrected. I hope to succeed. If I fail here, I shall have to depend upon influences to be brought to bear elsewhere. I say again we shall be ruined in our cause unless there is a change. I can fully substantiate all I have written.

I am on my way from Saint Louis home. I have waited on General Pope with a committee from onr county, and have succeeded in obtaining promises from him which are tolerably satisfactory. I hope he will carry them out.
The news of recent movements in the State is exciting, and I fear its effect on our community. It is of great importance that the Government should be successful here and elsewhere now. The death of General Lyon casts a gloom over us all. Troops at the Iron Mountain are threatened, but have not been taken, as it was reported this morning. I think if re-enforced soon, as is intended, the enemy will be in shape to be cut off completely. I hope it will be done.
Saint Louis is under martial law, but it is quiet now. I think it will be, although many anticipate trouble at any time, and no doubt it would require but little to start a fight. It is thought there are 8,000 secessionists in the city who would rise if they saw a chance to do so with any hope of success. Over 7,000 are organized and armed for the Government, and have signals so arranged that they can be got together at their rendezvous in 20 minutes. I hear there are about 18,000 troops in Saint Louis to-day$ besides, there is great activity in military circles. NTo one can see what will turn up next. There seems to be at present in our part of the State a disposition on the part of good citizens of secession sympathies to cease hostilities and urge those who will fight to enlist and join the regular forces. The partial success of the rebels, and the fact that in greatly superior force they are constantly advancing into the State, is what I most fear. On the other hand, it is very strange, with all our boasted superiority in men and resources, that the rebels manage at nearly every point to meet our troops with greatly superior numbers. There are screws loose somewhere. I am tired of receiving blows. I want to see the war offensive on our part. This course of events will soon ruin our cause before the world.
Extract from letter of J. T. if. Hayward to J. W. Brooks, dated uHanni‘
bal, August 17, 1861.??
Most of this week has been spent in efforts for peace and conciliation. Things were getting to such a pass here that no one felt safe, and all could see that the matter as it was going on would soon be much worse, and men on either side would be shot down at sight, while property would be entirely insecure. I think it is a consciousness of this that has made our most respectable and leading secessionists manifest a desire of late to have a stop put to this irregular warfare. At least I have taken advantage of this disposition and worked with them, I trust, to some purpose 5 it remains to be seen to how much. Our train was fired into last night, and one man killed and three wounded. It was a train mostly of soldiers. A ball passed close to the head of the conductor, aimed, as is believed, at him expressly. Two of our best runners have left in consequence of their trains being fired on. We intend, however, to run the road if Farley and myself have to go on the engines and run them. But we must have a change in our military * rule here or we are helplessly gone. It is a load the Union men cannot bear.

Dear Sir : Our train was tired into yesterday. There were troops on board. No one hurt. If we cannot have a change in the administration of military affairs here in North Missouri our cause will be ruined. There are a good many rebel camps known to be within 3 to 10 miles of the road. Union men constantly driven out. Trains fired into, &c., and yet no effort made to attack them.

Sir : Your attention is called to the unprotected and defenseless state of Booneville, in Cooper County. It has been reported at these headquarters by Capt. Joseph A. Eppstein, commanding U. S. Reserve Corps at that place, that the Home Guards have, owing to the withdrawal of the U. S. troops, been obliged to leave Booneville, leaving their families unprovided for and their property exposed to depredation. Captain Eppstein was intrusted with the raising and organizing of a battalion of'Home Guards in Cooper County, but cannot proceed there unless re-enforced. Major Kraut, of the Engineer Corps, has been ordered to proceed at once to Jefferson City to commence the work of fortification there, and will report to you.
No intelligence is received at these headquarters from you. I desire that you will make full and frequent reports concerning your own forces and movements, as well as of the numbers, acts, and designs of the enemy, as far as known to you.

General : I have the honor to say that your letter of yesterday, transmitting information received from General Grant, has been submitted to Major-General Fremont. He directs me to say, in reply, that arms and ammunition have been sent to Colonel Morgan’s 750 men at Brookfield. It is believed that it will warrant the withdrawal of a por-- tion of the Illinois volunteers from the line of the railroad in that vicinity, with a view to a movement south and southwest. He suggests that the service near Palmyra and Paris is so well guarded by the opportunity of succor from Illinois on one side and from Iowa on the other, that considerable detachments may safely be made from General Hurl-but’s force to aid in operating in this, from Brookfield and vicinity towards Jefferson City and Lexington, and in keeping the navigation of the Missouri River from hostile interruption. With these suggestions the general commanding leaves the disposition of matters to yourself.

OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X
IRONTON, Mo., August 27, 1861.
Assistant Adjutant-General,
Department of the West, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Sir: Brig. Gen. B. M. Prentiss left here this forenoon in pursuance of your order, taking all the troops here except my regiment, the First Nebraska, and the Twenty-first Illinois, and a few companies now occupied in guarding the bridges of the Iron Mountain Bailroad.
The Twenty-first Illinois is at Marble Creek, some 12 miles southward on the Greenville road. This regiment is without transportation. I shall send all the teams I can procure for it to return with in the morning.
For the present, several companies of the two regiments now here having been detached for railroad guard duty, the command is in a state of great weakness. We are far too much extended for our numbers. But the importance of holding all the positions now occupied, coupled with the certain expectation of being re-enforced before morning, together with the want of transportation, has induced me to remain as we are. If the two promised regiments fail to reach me by morning, I shall deem it my duty to contract our limits, taking care to remove the guns back within the lines.
I am under no apprehension of an attack to-night, because, though the rebels are quickly informed of our movements and condition, it is impossible for them to have received intelligence at Bolinger’s and Greenville in time, after General Prentiss left, for them to reach us to-night.
A well-known Union man from Cedar Creek, Mr. Edward Settle, came in this evening. He says the rebels are encamped at Bolinger’s Mill, in command of Jeff. Thompson, who proposes, in conjunction with Hardee, to take this place. It is believed here among the more intelligent Southern sympathizers that McCulloch is also advancing on this point, and that we will here have to oppose a large force. I am satisfied it is the settled opinion of those men that there will be a most formidable attack here before many days. The importance of this opinion arises from the fact that they have means of knowing, while we are in ignorance of the enemy’s movements.
The squadron of 150 horse arrived this afternoon and will be sent forward to-morrow to General Prentiss. Could they be retained, the position and probable numbers of the enemy might soon be ascertained with some degree of certainty. There is much in the drift of circumstances, taken in connection with the fact that they subsist by taking everything in the country, to indicate the concentration in and around here of an army many times larger than had been deemed possible for them.
I am not aware that any inquiry has been ordered in the case of Colonel Hecker, nor what, if anything, has been done in the premises. There are no papers left me touching the matter.
I am, sir, respectfully,
P. E. BLAND, Colonel, Commanding.
P. S.—August 28.—No troops having come down, I shall apply all our energies to the contracting of our limits within reasonable dimensions. It will be difficult to do this before night, having only eight disposable teams and one regiment to move some 10 or 12 miles. Last night the fact of our exposed situation gave me greater uneasiness than I had yet ever experienced.
Bespectfully,
P. E. BLAND.

Jefferson City, Mo.y August 27, 1861. Capfc. Speed Butler, Saint Louis, Mo. :
Two spies, one from the neighborhood of Lebanon and the other from Springfield, have come in this morning. The one from Lebanon reports that the Southern Army is traveling north in small bodies, and secessionists say with a view of concentrating about Linn Creek. The citizens of Lebanon expected a body of 10,000 men within a few days of the time my informant left. The one from Springfield reports substantially the same thing, so far as the leaving of troops in detachments goes. He says that after the battle of Springfield the rebels concealed a portion of their artillery and commenced a retreat without burying any considerable portion of their dead. Finding, however, that a retreat had commenced from the other side, they returned to Springfield, after having made a retrograde movement of some 5 miles.
1 sent out on Sunday a detachment of Home Guards to arrest two secession captains that I learned had come in. They succeeded in finding them by coming upon them in the night. Their names are J. Johnson, of Miller County, and B. Barnd, of Cole. These men claim to have come in under the proclamation of Governor Gamble, and with the intention of laying down their arms. I have proof, however, William Mathews, John Hicks, and Aaron Bell being witnesses, that B. Barnd stated that these difficulties had to be settled by the sword, and that he (Barnd) was going back to Jackson’s army, and that Johnson was also going. The manner and apparent ignorance of these men as to condition of affairs about Springfield goes very far against the plausibility of their having come in in good faith.
I have appointed an ordnance-sergeant here to take charge of all stores that may arrive.
I am getting teams broken in as rapidly as possible. I have to report that the harness sent here is entirely too light and very inferior in quality. The chains are so light and brittle that they snap with the least strain. I have been compelled to order the purchase of new traces here for the teams we are working, and shall be compelled to do so as fast as additional ones are hitched up.
The detachment that left here a few days since to arrest parties for firing into the cars west of here brought in a number of prisoners, but from all the evidence they were the most innocent men in the county. I had them liberated. I would renew my recommendation of yesterday, that a large force be concentrated here) that the road be prepared and possession taken, and protection be given to all the counties bordering on the Missouri.

Dear Colonel: Your brother, the Postmaster-General, has handed me your letter of the 21st of August. I asked him to let me have it, in order that I might, by a few words, strengthen your hands and General Fremont’s, and disabuse both him and you of some errors which may give trouble.
If there was any deficiency in the quartermaster’s department in Mis-

souri, the blame does not rest here; all requisitions have been promptly met here, and the officers have been instructed to spare no effort and no means of their department in aiding to the extent of their power General Lyon’s movements.
I gave to General Fremont, in addition to Major McKinstry, Captain
T-------, who I fear from what I have since been told is not as prudent
as zealous. I take it for granted that General Fremont leaves estimates of prices of supplies to his quartermaster, and when I find, as Quartermaster-General, that the prices are probably too high, it is my duty to the Government and to General Fremont, as well as to this Department, to say so. At the same time, I understand that there may be reasons of time, of quality, which induce a general to order a purchase at a higher rate, and while I communicate to the quartermasters information as to the ruling prices of horses—the market rates—I called upon the Treasury to send all the money he asked for.
Tell General Fremont that no man more than myself desires to sustain him; no one is more ready to take a responsibility to assist him, and that he has, in my opinion, already the power which you say ought to be conferred upon him by the President. Whatever a general commanding orders, the subordinates of his staff are by regulations compelled to do, if possible.
If General Fremont orders Captain Turnley to pay $1,000 for an ax, Captain Turnley will be supported by this Department in obeying. The propriety of such a payment, however, will be between General Fremont and the Government.
The general is charged with saving the country. The country will be very careful to approve his measures, and will judge his mistakes, if any, very tenderly if successful. Success crowns the work, and let him spare no responsibility, no effort, to secure it, and above all let him not take in ill part what is done with a sincere desire to assist him, and let him not estrange friends by too hastily finding fault with their counsels.
All the requisitions for money for Missouri have been promptly passed through this office; the delay, if any has occurred, is at the Treasury Department, which has allowed the Department to fall in debt in Cincinnati and Philadelphia, each about a million of dollars, for clothing and camp equipage.
There are wagons making in Cincinnati, which Captain Dickerson will send to Saint Louis if wanted; those made at Milwaukee I ordered to Saint Louis long ago. A number of wagons were ordered to be made in Saint Louis, and authority given to Major McKinstry to provide all that might be required for moving the armies of that department.
In regard to advertising and delay, the law of 1861 and the regulations expressly provide that in case of public exigency supplies are to be bought in open market, as between individuals. Exercise this power. Moreover, advertisement or public notice does not require postponing opening of bids for a month, or a week, or two days.
If forage, wagons, horses are wanted, the law, the necessity are fully met by putting a notice in the paper and purchasing as fast as offers come in—the next day or the same day; take the then lowest bid or the then most advantageous offer. The day after you will have a still better offer; take that for# a portion of your supplies, and so on until you have all you need. By this system I have brought down the prices of horses from $128 to $120, of wagons from $141 to $108, since ! came here, and have got abundant supplies.
These explanations will, I hope, remove many difficulties from the

train. As soon as tlie train was stopped it was ascertained that a keg or part of a keg of powder had been put upon the track, and so arranged with combustibles as that it would explode when the train went over it. It did explode, but most fortunately without injuring any person or damaging the track in the least. I immediately dispatched 40 of my best-mounted men to the point, with orders to re-enforce the guards already on the road-and to arrest any suspicious persons they might find. A messenger is just in from them, and informs me they have found two places where the rails have been removed from the track, evidently with the intention of destroying the train with troops which was to have left here at 3 o’clock this morning. As soon as it is light enough to admit I shall start the train, on which is embarked the Second Kansas Regiment and some good track-repairers, and I trust there will be but little delay in getting through. The receipt of this will enable you to judge.
I am of the opinion that two good and full regiments should be sent here at once, one of them to go into camp at Salem, Dent County, and one at Saint James Station, a point 12 miles east of this, on the Southwest Branch of the Pacific Railroad. By this means we could scour the counties of Crawford, Dent, Phelps, and Maries thoroughly, and not weaken this post to a degree that would be impolitic or dangerous.

Circumstances, in my judgment, of sufficient urgency render it necessary that the commanding general of this department should assume the administrative powers of the State. Its disorganized condition, the helplessness of the civil authority, the total insecurity of life, and the devastation of property by bands of murderers and marauders, who infest nearly every county of the State, and avail themselves of the public misfortunes and the vicinity of a hostile force to gratify private and neighborhood vengeance, and who find an enemy wherever they find plunder, finally demand the severest measures to repress the daily

increasing crimes and outrages which are driving off the inhabitants and ruining the State.
In this condition the public safety and the success of our arms require unity of purpose, without let or hinderance to the prompt administration of affairs. In order, therefore, to suppress disorder, to maintain as far as now practicable the public peace, and to give security and protection to the persons and property of loyal citizens, I do hereby extend and declare established martial law throughout the State of Missouri.
The lines of the army of occupation in this State are for the present declared to extend from Leavenworth, by way of the posts of Jefferson City, Rolla, and Ironton, to Cape Girardeau, on the Mississippi Kiver.
All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within these lines shall be tried by court-martial, and if found guilty will be shot.
The property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States, or who shall be directly proven to have taken an active part with their enemies in the field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use, and their slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared freemen.
All persons who shall be proven to have destroyed, after tlie publication of this order, railroad tracks, bridges, or telegraphs shall suffer the extreme penalty of the law.
All persons engaged in treasonable correspondence, in giving or procuring aid to the enemies of the United States, in fomenting tumults, in disturbing the public tranquillity by creating and circulating false reports or incendiary documents, are in their own interests warned that they are exposing themselves to sudden and severe punishment.
All persons who have been led away from their allegiance are required to return to their homes forthwith. Any such absence, without sufficient cause, will b^ held to be presumptive evidence against them.
The object of this declaration is to place in the hands of the military authorities the power to give instantaneous effect to existing laws, and to supply such deficiencies as the conditions of war demand. But this is not intended to suspend the ordinary tribunals of the country, where the law will be administered by the civil officers in the usual manner, and with their customary authority, while the same can be peaceably exercised.
The commanding general will labor vigilantly for the public welfare, and in his efforts for their safety hopes to obtain not only the acquiescence but the active support of the loval people of the country.

The commanding general sincerely regrets that he finds it necessary to make any reproach to the patriotic army under his command. He had hoped that the rigid enforcement of discipline and the good example of the mass of the enlightened soldiery which he has the honor to lead would have been sufficient to correct in good time the irregularities and license of a few who have reflected discredit upon our cause and ourselves. But the extension of martial law to all the State of Missouri, rendered suddenly necessary by its unhappy condition^ reik

ders it equally imperative to call the army to good order and rigorous discipline.
They are reminded that the power to inflict the extraordinary severities of the now governing law is rigidly confined to few, who are to be held strictly accountable for its exercise.
They are also reminded that the same necessity which requires the establishment of martial law demands also the enforcement of the military law, which governs themselves with the same sudden severity. The commanding general therefore strictly prohibits all vexatious proceedings calculated unnecessarily to harass the citizens, and also unauthorized searches, seizures, and destruction of property, except in cases of military necessity, and for which the officer authorizing or permitting it will be held strictly and personally responsible. All officers commanding districts, posts, or detachments are enjoined to use the utmost prudence and circumspection in the discharge of their duties. Under the circumstances a strict obedience to orders, close attention to duties, and an earnest effort to protect and to avoid harassing innocent persons is requested and expected everywhere from officers and men.
The commanding general trusts that he will find few occasions to reproach the troops. He hopes and believes that he will find many to admire and commend them.	'	.

Maj. Gen. John C. FrLmont:
Dear Sir : An effort is being made to get up a panic in our State, and I am told messengers have been sent to you representing a fearful state of things on our border. As some parties are interested to have

war on our border, and consequently may not be impartial in their reports, I desire to say that we are in no danger of invasion, provided the Government stores at Fort Scott are sent back to Leavenworth and the Lane brigade is removed from the border. It is true small parties of secessionists are to be found in Missouri, but we have good reason to know that they do not intend to molest Kansas in force until Jack-son shall be reinstated as governor of Missouri. Indeed, when a short time since a guerrilla party came over and stole some property from our citizens, the officers in command of the Confederates compelled a return of the property, and offered to give up the leader of the gang to our people for punishment. But what we have to fear, and do fear, is that Lane’s brigade will get up a war by going over the line, committing depredations, and then returning into our State. This course will force the secessionists to put down any force we may have for the^ own protection, and in this they will be joined by nearly all the Union men of Missouri. If you will remove the supplies at Fort Scott to the interior, and relieve us of the Lane brigade, I will guarantee Kansas from invasion from Missouri until Jackson shall drive you out of Saint Louis.	9
I am i>rogressmg rapidly with the organization of the Home Guard, and have arranged for speedily filling one of the Kew Mexico regiments. With reference to the other, I am expecting to hear from your secretary. A gentleman here thinks he could furnish five companies for the Second Kew Mexico Begiment in a short time if Mr. Wood has not filled it.
Could I have one company of cavalry and one ci artillery in the Home Guard regiment, provided the State furnish the guns or a part of them and the cavalry company furnish their own horses and horse equipments? If so, I should like it.
I think the outfit for the Kew Mexico regiments could be purchased here to good advantage, so far as mules, wagons, and provisions are concerned.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
C. KOBIKSOK.
Washing-ton, D. C., September 2, 1861.
Major-General FrLmont :
My Hear Sir : Two points in your proclamation of August 30 give me some anxiety:
First. Should you shoot a man, according to the proclamation, the Confederates would very certainly shoot our best men in their hands in retaliation; and so, man for man, indefinitely. It is, therefore, my order that you allow no man to be shot under the proclamation without first having my approbation or consent.
Second. I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph, in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberating slaves of traitorous owners, will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them against us; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky. Allow me, therefore, to ask that you will, as of your own motion, modify that paragraph so as to conform to the.first and fourth sections of the act of Congress entitled “An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes,” approved August 6,1861, and a copy of which act I herewith send you.
This letter is written in a spirit of caution and not of censure. I

I have seen your message to the President. The governor of Indiana telegraphed some days since that matters in Kentucky presented a threatening aspect. He was then advised, by consent of the President, to hold his four regiments in camp for the emergency he feared. One regiment has since been ordered from camp, the others remain there. Under your statement that rebel forces are probably being moved into Kentucky, is it advisable to send regiments from Indiana to your assistance %
If this Department was more fully advised by you of the wants of your department, we might be able to serve you more promptly. It certainly is my desire to give you every possible assistance.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Headquarters,
Jefferson City, Mo., September 6, 1861. Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont, Saint Louis, Mo.:
General : The news since yesterday is still more convincing that Price, Parsons, and Eains are directing their movements up the Osage, with the view eventually, 1 think, of taking position somewhere on the river above here, probably just below Lexington.
Their movements certainly threaten Fort Scott, and they may attack it; but their intention is, in my judgment, to take a strong position on the river and cut us off from the forces above. This is necessary for them to do in order to get the forces and supplies now raised in Northeast Missouri across the river.
In my communications to General Pope some days ago I ventured to suggest the propriety of sending a reliable force to occupy Warsaw or some point in that vicinity. A well-managed force at this point would in a great measure prevent recruits and supplies being raised there for McCulloch’s forces. It would render Price’s movements very insecure, as he would be nearly if not quite cut off from McCulloch, and might, if he moves farther north, be easily captured by a concentrated movement of troops upon him from this place, Fort Scott, Warsaw, and Lexington.
The plan submitted to you by Major Kraut for the defense of this place meets with my approval. A few well-selected sites for field-works, flanked and supported by a series of block-houses, abatis, &c., seem to be the best I could recommend. The material for building here is abundant, and sites which would secure them from the range of the enemy’s artillery can generally be found. Should you think proper to order these worffs to be commenced it would do much to allay the fears of the citizens of this place. There seems to be no grounds of fear from immediate danger, but they think so.
The Home Guards give me much trouble on account of not being clothed and equipped. When called upon for duty they make this a complaint.
Keports (not very reliable) last night state that Colonel Worthington had taken possession of Columbia.. The rebels evacuated it at his approach, but had made a stand some 4 miles from there in such force that he was doubtful about attacking them. I have a regiment and boats in readiness to succor him at once should it be necessary.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Shelbina to Macon City (Hudson) by a band of rebels, under Greeu, numbering about 3,000, where he is now cut off from all lines of communication east of his position.
In order to arrest the constant depredations of the rebels in Marion, Monroe, Shelby, Macon, and adjoining counties, and to visit on them the whole rigor of martial law, I have resolved upon a combined attack on Green’s men and their total annihilation.
To effect this object you will be re enforced by the First Kansas Regiment and the Twenty-third Indiana Regiment.
Brigadier-General Sturgis will advance on Macon City (Hudson) with the Twenty-seventh Ohio Regiment; Colonel Groesbeck’s Thirty-ninth Ohio Regiment; one squadron Fremont Hussars, under Captain Yon Blume; and Captain Schwartz’s full battery, under command of the first lieutenant.
You will leave a comparative reserve at Palmyra, and then advance west towards Salt River, and jou will, under any circumstances, endeavor to put yourself in communication with the command of Brigadier-General Sturgis, who will operate towards the east against Shelbina.
It will be your object not only to Glisperse the enemy, but to follow him into his hiding places and annihilate him.
After having put yourself in communication with Brigadier-General Sturgis by means of a reliable messenger, and after General Sturgis has advanced east towards Shelbina, you will force the passage of Salt River (should the bridge be destroyed, you will find a suitable bridge towards the north or south), and thus make a combined attack on the rebels.
After the junction of the forces has been accomplished, Brigadier-General Sturgis will be under your command.
As communication between you and General Sturgis will be subject to the constant hazard of interruption, you will report by telegraph as often as necessary to these headquartercS, whence dispatches may be sent to him.
I inclose a copy of the order addressed to Brigadier-General Sturgis.

General Pope will endeavor, with his disposable force, re-enforced by the First Kansas and the Twenty-third Indiana Regiment, to force a passage across Salt River, or to gain a crossing by some other means.

The President:
My Dear Sir : Your letter of the 2d, by special messenger, I know to have been written before you had received my letter, and before my telegraphic dispatches and the rapid development of critical conditions here had informed you of affairs in this quarter. I had not written to you fully and frequently, first, because in the incessant change of affairs I would be exposed to give you contradictory accounts; and, secondly, because the amount of the subjects to be laid before you would demand too much of your time.
Trusting to have your confidence, I have been leaving it to events themselves to show you whether or not I was shaping affairs here according to your ideas. The shortest communication between Washington and Saint Louis generally involves two days, and the employment of two days in time of war goes largely towards success or disaster. I therefore went along according to my own judgment, leaving the result of my movements to justify me with you.
And so in regard to my proclamation of the 30th. Between the rebel armies, the Provisional Government, and home traitors, I felt the position bad and saw danger. In the night I decided upon the proclamation and the form of it. I wrote it the next morning and printed it the same day. I did it without consultation or advice with any one, actiug solely with my best judgment to serve the country and yourself, and perfectly willing to receive the amount of censure which should be thought due if I had made a false movement. This is as much a movement in the war as a battle, and in going into these I shall have to act according to my judgment of the ground before me, as I did on this „ occasion. If upon reflection your better judgment still decides that I am wrong in the article respecting the liberation of slaves, I have to ask that you will openly direct me to make the correction. The implied censure will be received as a soldier always should the reprimand of his chief. If I were to retract of my own accord, it would imply that I myself thought it wrong, and that I had acted without the reflection which the gravity of the point demanded. But I did not. I acted with full deliberation, and upon the certain conviction that it was a measure right and necessary, and I think so still.
In regard to the other point of the proclamation to which you refer, I desire to say that I do not think the enemy can either misconstrue or urge anything against it, or undertake to make unusual retaliation. The shooting of men who shall rise in arms against an army in the military occupation of a country is merely a necessary measure of defense, and entirely according to the usages of civilized warfare. The article does not at all refer to prisoners of war, and certainly our enemies have no ground for requiring that we should waive in their

benefit any of the ordinary advantages which the usages of war allow to us. As promptitude is itself an advantage in war, I have also to ask that you will permit me to carry out upon the spot the provisions of the proclamation in this respect. Looking at affairs from this point of view, I am satisfied that strong and vigorous measures have now become necessary to the success of our arms; and hoping that my views may have the honor to meet your approval,
I am, with respect and regard, very truly, yours,
J. C. FREMONT.
Headquarters Western Department,
September 8, 1861.
The President :
My Dear Sir: I send by another hand what I ask you to consider in respect to the subject of the note by your special messenger.
In this I desire to ask your attention to the position of affairs in Kentucky. As the rebel troops driven out from Missouri had invaded Kentucky in considerable force, and by occupying Union City, Hickman, and Columbus were preparing to seize Paducah and attack Cairo, I judged it impossible, without losing important advantages, to defer any longer a forward movement. For this purpose I have drawn from the Missouri side a part of the force which had been stationed at Bird’s Point, Cairo, and Cape Girardeau, to Fort Holt and Paducah, of which places we have taken possession. As the rebel forces outnumber ours, and the counties of Kentucky between the Mississippi and Tennessee Bivers, as well as those along the latter and the Cumberland, are strongly secessionist, it becomes imperatively necessary to have the co-operation of the loyal Union forces under Generals Anderson and Kelson, as well as of those already encamped opposite Louisville, under Colonel Bousseau.
I have re-enforced, yesterday, Paducah with two regiments, and will continue to strengthen the position with men- and artillery. As soon as General Smith, who commands there, is re-enforced sufficiently to enable him to spread his forces, he will have to take and hold Mayfield and Lovelaceville, to be in the rear and flank of Columbus, and to occupy Smithland, controlling in this way the mouths of both the Tennessee and the Cumberland Bivers. At the same time, Colonel Bousseau should bring his force, increased, if possible, by two Ohio regiments, in boats to^ Henderson, and, taking the Henderson and Nashville Bailroad, occupy* Hopkinsville, while General Kelson should go with a force of 5,000 by railroad to Louisville and from there to Bowling Green.
As the population in all the counties through which the above railroads pass are loyal, this movement could be made without delay or molestation to the troops.
Meanwhile General Grant would take possession of the entire Cairo and Fulton Bailroad, Piketon, Kew Madrid, and the shore of the Mississippi opposite Hickman and Columbus. The foregoing disposition having been effected, a combined attack will be made upon Columbus, and, if successful in that, upon Hickman, while Bousseau and Kelson will move in concert, by railroad, to Kashville, Tenn., occupying the State capital, and, with an adequate force, Kew Providence.
The conclusion of this movement would be a combined advance toward Memphis, on the Mississippi, as well as the Memphis and Ohio Bailroad? and I trust the result would be a glorious one to the country,

General J. H. Lane,

General: I received your note of the 7th last evening, and the communication by Lieutenant Hollister, U. S. Army, at the same time. As requested, I will forward copies. Indeed, I have forwarded to General Fremont copies of all your reports, in order to place before that officer a full and comprehensive view of affairs in your section of country.
You are not aware that the communication with Saint Louis via the Hannibal and Saint Joseph road is and has been cut off the past week, and in order to obtain a co-operation of the troops at Jefferson City, I have communicated by telegraph to Omaha, thence by mail to Burlington, thence by telegraph to General Fremont, suggesting the propriety of dispatching a column from Jefferson City to attack on the east whilst you were attacking on the west. This proposition will reach General Fremont to-night, the 9th. I have been, and shall continue to be, unceasing in my efforts to strengthen you with men and means; but, general, let me advise you to husband all your supplies, especially ammunition. I am aware that new levies are not so easily handled as veterans, but the everlasting admonition for economy will in time have its effects. I propose to send Lieutenant Hollister back to you in a day or two, after instructing him in the details of his duties, and I would suggest that he be placed upon ordnance duty at your headquarters, to superintend the distribution of the supplies pertaining to that important branch of the public service. I hope you will adopt early and active measures to crush out this marauding which is being enacted in Captain Jennison’s name, as also yours, by a band of men representing themselves as belonging to your command. Captain Wilder will be able to give the details of their conduct at Leavenworth City, and doubtless their atrocities in other localities have been already represented to you. Please have a formal examination into the plundering of private and public buildings which has recently taken place, as I am informed, at Fort Scott. It will be necessary for representation to higher authority and for the adjustment of the accounts of disbursing officers.
I have hSard nothing as yet from Colonel Peabody. I inclose you an extract from an official letter received yesterday from Lieutenant Case, acting assistant quartermaster at Kansas City. I cannot strengthen the sentence by any official information. If the troops are there, they must have been sent from Jefferson City—ordered first upon Lexington, then west—and Colonel Peabody’s command may be with them.
A few days since I recommended the employment of spies to scour the country 100 miles west of Scott, to give information of any movement of the enemy towards the Santa Fe road. I hope you have initiated the work.

In accordance with Colonel Peabody’s order I forward you the following information, which was received at 7 o’clock yesterday evening: Col#nel Peabody marched from Lexington towards Warrensburg Sunday, intending to camp at said point last night, where the Irish Brigade awaits them. When the junction is formed, the strength of the combined forces will be 4,000. Colonel Peabody, acting under the impression that General Lane is retreating on this point before Price, says that he will form a junction with General Lane 25 or 30 miles south of this point; also that I must move from here to keep the communications open between him, General Lane, and Colonel Marshall, in command at Lexington. Should the forces leave here at this time, we give the town up to pillage. Of this I am satisfied. Rains’ advance is at Harrisonville, west of Warrensburg 30 miles. The enemy is gathering around in detached parties from 200 to 500. I forwarded a copy of Colonel Peabody’s command to General Lane. Has been on the road twelve hours.

From all I can learn Green’s band is some* place in the vicinity of Florida. Nothing has reached me yet from General Pope. Considering the raw character of the troops under my command, I would respectfully suggest that if a few companies of regular infantry could be spared from Rolla, they would add greatly to our hopes of success in case we should fall in with the whole rebel force. The rebels, furthermore, are all, or nearly so, mounted ; and should they feel disposed to scatter (which they are sure to do if we are too strong for them), it will be impossible to overtake them with infantry, and therefore more cavalry (particularly regular) is very desirable.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Please inform me if you have received information from up the Ohio.

Sir : Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2d instant, is just received. Assuming that you, upon the ground, could better judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing your proclamation of August 30 I perceived no general objection to it. The particular clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves appeared to me to be objectionable in its non-conformity to the act of Congress passed the 6th of last August upon the same subjects$ and hence I wrote you, expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly. Your answer, just received, expresses the preference on your part that I should make an open order for the modification, which I very cheerfully do. It is therefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed as to conform to and not to transcend the provisions on the same subject contained in the act of Congress entitled “An act to con-

Cairo, III., September 11, 1861. Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont, Saint Louis, Mo. :
Since my report of last night nothing has transpired of note, except the information that re-enforcements to the number of about 5,000 men arrived at Columbus last night. About that number crossed to the Missouri shore. The rebels have not shown themselves as far up the river to-day as yesterday. To-day a soldier, representing himself as a member of Colonel Bowen’s regiment, deserted, and succeeded in reaching our gunboats. He states that he is from Wisconsin, emigrated to Southern Missouri last year, and when our difficulties broke out was pressed into service. He says that Jeff. Thompson’s forces, about 2,600 men (700 of them cavalry), occupy ground opposite Columbus. They are badly armed and clothed. Last night 5,000 men from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee arrived, and about an equal number crossed to the Missouri shore. These troops are represented as well clothed and armed. Provisions, blankets, clothing, ammunition, and arms are plenty in their camp; thinks most of their pork is obtained from Ohio. Heard the officers talk of attacking Bird’s Point and Cairo at times; then again of awaiting an attack where they are. Are throwing up breastworks along the whole front of Columbus. They are represented to have thirty-five to forty pieces of artillery (a portion rifled) and six or seven siege pieces in position, and more on the ground ready to put up. In Colonel Bowen’s regiment there are quite a number of Northern men, who are not there from choice, but only await an action to turn on their officers and leave the Southern Confederacy forever.
I would respectfully urge the necessity of having clothing of almost every description, particularly shoes, blankets, and shirts, forwarded here as soon as possible. Tents also are required. Cavalry is much needed; also cavalry equipments for the troops here and more batteries of light artillery. All the re-enforcements that can be spared for this post, of every arm of service, would be welcome. There are two companies of the Seventh Iowa Regiment now stationed at Potosi, Mo.; the balance of the regiment here. I would recommend that they be relieved and sent to their regiment.

It is altogether untrue that any bridges or culverts have been destroyed between this place and Hannibal, as stated in the papers. Since my arrival in this section a trestle work was destroyed by Green. It was repaired, and day before yesterday spread out as the train passed over. It was a simple accident. It is now repaired, and the road is clear to Platte River. The news that Green has crossed at Glasgow is undoubted. He has carried out of North Missouri a large part of the ruffians and bridge-burners who have committed outrages. Within a few days all will be quiet again. I go forward to Saint Joseph, and thence to Keokuk. I will have Glasgow and Brunswick immediately visited by a strong force, and as soon as the regiments of Glover, Moore, Tindall, and Foster are ready I will turn the regiments to the line of the Missouri River.

The drunkenness, incapacity, and shameful* neglect of duty of many officers of rank in this district have brought matters to a sad state in North Missouri. I shall repair the mismanagement rapidly; but to do so effectually the principal offenders must be brought to punishment. I have sent Colonel Blair, Second Kansas, and Major Hays and Captain Ralston, Sixteenth Illinois, to Saint Louis in arrest. Charges will be transmitted as soon as there is a moment’s leisure to make them out.

ment of clothing be sent here at once; also accouterments, arms, and tents. I am very glad to hear that cavalry is to come here immediately, and would also be pleased to hear of the expected arrival of more artillery.
I am of opinion that if a demonstration was made from Paducah towards Union City, supported by two columns on the Kentucky side from here, the gunboats, and a force moving upon Belmont, the enemy would be forced to leave Columbus, leaving behind their heavy ordnance. I submit this to your consideration, and will hold myself in readiness to execute this or any plan you may adopt. I inclose you a map, giving a sketch of the proposed field of operations.
I telegraphed to-day, requesting that six telescopes be sent here. They were suggested by Colonel Waagner, and I think are much needed. A lage map of Kentucky is much needed.

All boats passing your post not recognized as in the employ of tlie Government will be bailed and brought to, papers examined, and, if necessary, cargo. Everything must be done to prevent the enemy’s receiving supplies.
The work on the fortifications should be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. Protect all loyal citizens in all their rights, but carry out the proclamation of General Fremont upon all subjects known to come under it. Keep out pickets and scouts, so that you cannot be surprised.
I have no information about the Home Guards under your command, but as long as they carry United States arms and Government rations, they are entirely subject to the orders of the commanding officer. Should they refuse to obey you, arrest the officers, disarm the soldiers, and report the matter at once to General Fremont, and also to me.
If you are strong enough to give protection to points distant from you, it may be done; but be cautious to have always the post protected.
I approve of your course in sending Captain Stewart’s cavalry by boat. I should not have ordered them by land after the storm of yesterday.

Captain Prince:
Sir : I am moving north with a smart little army of about 1,500. The attack at Humboldt compelled me to leave a larger force at Forts Scott and Lincoln and Barnesville than I intended. I left at Fort Scott about 800 troops^ at Fort Lincoln about 300, and at Barnesville about 150. I have directed the erection of six stockades on our southern border; Captains Holt and Ford to erect one on Turkey Creek, on the neutral lands immediately south of Bourbon County; Captain Miller at Humboldt; Captain Scott at Le Roy; and other competent captains, one on Verdigris, one on Fall River, and one on Walnut.
I have ordered a system of signals to be established by which they can arouse the country. These stockades will soon be completed, and our southern border, I think, secure.
As yet I have heard nothing of Peabody or the force moving from Sedalia. I w ill move north and east as far as I can safely with my force until I can hear from them, and probably pitch into Butler, Harrison-ville, and Papinsville, so as to disturb the rear of the advancing column of the enemy. My whole moving force will be at the Trading Post at 10 o’clock this morning.
I have been compelled to dispatch a force from Fort Scott, and Ford and Holt from Turkey Creek, to follow7 the marauders who attacked Humboldt, with orders to follow them to the Arkansas line or take them. I have offered a reward of $1,000 for the head of Matthews.

I understand the object of your note to be to inquire whether it was my intention to shoot the wounded who might be taken prisoners by the forces under my command. The following paragraph, extracted from the proclamation, will be strictly enforced within the lines prescribed against the class of offenders for whom it was intended, viz :
All persons wfto shall be taken with arms in their hands within these lines shall be tried by court-martial, and if found guilty will be shot.
The lines are expressly declared to be those of the army in the military occupation of this State.. You have wholly misapprehended the meaning of the proclamation. Without undertaking to determine the condition of any man engaged in this rebellion, I desire it to be clearly understood that the proclamation is intended distinctly to recognize all the usual rights of an open enemy in the field, and to be in ail respects strictly conformable to the ordinary usages of war. It is hardly necessary for me to say that it was not prepared with any purpose to ignore the ordinary rights of humanity with respect to wounded men or to those who are humanely engaged in alleviating their sufferings.

We have moved this far with our limited force, clearing our front and rear as far as practicable, for the purpose of co-operating with the force under your command and the column under Colonel Peabody. We have been unable to hear anything from either column. Can you give us any information as to either column % If Peabody has been driven back, Kansas City should be largely re-enforced, and a column moved

down the border until we get into communication. The enemy yesterday were concentrating at Rose Hill, intending, I think, to prevent a junction of Peabody’s command and mine and as a flank movement upon Kansas City, and should be met by a counter-movement, as I have suggested.
I started a dispatch to Captain Prince last night, which he will get to-day, communicating the same information and making the same suggestion. I have a force actually engaged at Ports Scott and Lincoln and Barnesville, and are now starting a small force at the Trading Post, and occupying this place with 700 cavalry, 700 infantry, and two pieces of artillery. Yesterday I cleared out Butler and Parkville with my cavalry about 20 miles.
You are now posted as to my command and of my movements; reciprocate by letting me hear from your column and Colonel Peabody’s at the earliest possible moment.

Sir: Reconnaissances which I had made yesterday disclose the fact that the enemy have broken up their camp above Belmont, also that they have no force from there to4 some distance beyond Charleston.
As telegraphed by me to-day, I believe they are leaving Columbus; whether marching upon Paducah or leaving Kentucky altogether I will try and determine to-morrow. I have ordered the Tenth Illinois Volunteers, Colonel Morgan commanding, to Fort Holt, to take the place of the Twenty-fourth, leaving to-night, and the Seventh [?] Iowa to Elliott’s Mills, near Fort Jefferson, to take the place of the Nineteenth Illinois.
I would call your attention to the fact that there are many troops here without arms, and some armed with the Austrian musket, which, with the caps now furnished, is unreliable; also that clothing, camp and garrison equipage, and accouterments are deficient. Requisitions, I am told, are before the proper Departments for all these articles. Money is mucli required here to pay for secret services. It is highly necessary to get » information which cannot be obtained from our own reconnoitering parties, and without money to pay, the services of citizens cannot much longer be obtained.

Boad to Hannibal open, except Platte Biver Bridge (finished to-morrow), and all quiet. Secessionists, numbering some 2,500, in detached bands, retreating southward, to cross river below Independence. I have sent column of 1,000 men and three pieces of artillery, under Colonel Smith, to march rapidly from this place in pursuit, and the Iowa regiment, with one piece of artillery and 50 irregular horse, to move rapidly from Cameron upon Liberty, and there effect junction with Smith. There is no doubt in my judgment that the large train of plunder will be captured, though, as usual, I presume the forces will disperse, and, being cavalry, will mostly escape, unless Smith can surprise them. Lhave put all irregular forces—Home Guards and others—in motion scouting the country on all sides. Colonels Cranor and Edwards—the first commanding irregular forces of Missouri volunteers, the second about 600 Iowa State troops—will be here to-day, having swept whole region north of this place clean. I put. them immediately in motion along both sides of railroad, to clean out the small squads remaining in the woods from Saint Joseph to Chillieothe. In five days North Missouri will be again quiet, and the regiments of Tindall, Moore, Foster, Morgan, and Glover will return. So will you please send Tindall’s regiment as soon as possible to Chillieothe!
I go East to-day to urge into the field the regiments named. There are some disturbances of minor importance in the extreme northeast, and I must get to Canton and Keokuk, without awaiting the return of Smith’s command. Can Glover and Bussey get their cavalry armed at once!

Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
General : I send as special messenger, for the essential means of defense for this Territory and people, Benjamin E. Pegram, who is fully furnished with dispatches and instructions to represent the extreme dangers enveloping our position. This people are inclosed in a circle of hostile elements converging upon them, and are utterly destitute of arms, ammunition, or any weapons of self-preservation. The Indians are hostile, and pushed upon us by enemies and their emissaries from the outside.,
New Mexico can only be regarded as likely to aid the advance of the enemy. A strong army corps, such as that lately withdrawn from Utah, will protect this people and reconquer New Mexico. I ask that this army corps may be stopped on its eastward march, and deflected down the foot of the mountains to this place. The greatest economy in time and military operations will be the result of such a policy. The population is 30,000, but so beleaguered and destitute of materials and provisions as to be helpless and without a place of retreat from the advancing enemy. The essential supplies are 10,000 muskets, rifles, and equipments 5 2 field batteries and supplies of fixed ammunition for use in the field, and abundant reserve supplies.
The extreme desperation of our position, calmly appreciated, will, I know, secure your prompt action. Energy, loyalty, and bravery preeminently belong to the mountain people. To conquer their enemies appears to them more glorious than to perish. Essential military assistance is all they require to preserve themselves and assist their country’s cause.

I need all the troops now here and expected. I ask the Department most urgently to permit me to retain the remainder of the 5,000 infantry called for, and to substitute therefor two regiments of Illinois cavalry, accepted by the War Department, and which I am unable to arm.

Capt. W. E. Prince,

Sir : * * * I am here within 24 miles of Harrison ville, and there is nothing in the way of forming a junction with any troops that may be moved upon that point. You will find inclosed Colonel Blunt’s report of what he is doing south and Captain Hayes’ and Lieutenant-Colonel Moore’s report of the forces at Fort Lincoln and Barnesville.
I very much doubt the policy of forming a junction which will require my moving farther north than Harrison ville. There is nothing in Jack-son County in the way of a force moving from Kansas City on Harrison-ville. If a column could move from there while I am moving upon it

## p. 499 (#513) ############################################

﻿Chat. X.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------UNION.	499
through Butler, we might catch some of the cowardly guerrillas between us and the border, while, if I move up the border and form a junction near Kansas City and then move on Harrisonville, the effect would be to herd the enemy, as Sigel did at Carthage and Lyon did at Spring-field.
Start your column from Kansas City for Harrisonville, give me notice of the time of their arrival, and I will meet them there. My infantry having marched all day Sunday and my cavalry yesterday and to-day, they will be compelled to rest for one day and night, and we cannot move until the ammunition arrives, which you say you have sent.
No one feels the importahce of making a diversion in favor of Peabody more than I do, if it is true he is falling back on Lexington. A column united at Harrisonville could make that diversion, and if it be true that a force is moving from Sedalia, they could unite and perhaps cut off Price’s and Bains’ commands.
Another reason in favor of these views : A movement up the border will enable the enemy to concentrate and strike me in the rear.
Forts Scott, Lincoln, and Barnesville are endangered. While here I can cover them, and a movement into the interior protects them. The two Kansas regiments, if they are intended for my command, should be hastened forward to this point. It is a commanding position for the protection of Kansas and the striking of Missouri. Forage is plenty, vegetables for the men to be had for the gathering, good quarters, good water, and plenty of timber.
I am informed that there are three companies of Jennison’s regiment at Fort Leavenworth mustered in. They should be armed and sent forward without delay.
I received a letter from Sickles, of Chicago, who says he has several companies for my brigade. They should be hastened to this point.
Should Kansas City be threatened, a column here could strike them while this column is being strengthened. Be assured we will not be idle. Whenever and wherever we can strike the enemy it shall be done. I am just informed that the last words of the gallant Johnson were, “ Come onr boys !”
Can you not induce Captain Beno to send me down a 12-pounder ? I am told you have one. I have as brave and skillful artillery officers as there are in the world.

I have received no confirmation of the rumor that General A. S. Johnston was to take command. I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that the Tenth Illinois Eegiment, Colonel Morgan commanding, has but seven companies in it, and the Eleventh Illinois has but nine companies. These two regiments are commanded by colonels of experience, and who have profited by their experience. I would therefore urgently recommend that the governor of Illinois be requested to assign companies to these regiments, to fill them up as soon as possible. 1 left here after 1 o’clock this morning for Cape Girardeau, and returned, arriving at 2 p. m.

It is also recommended to obtain by every mode, especially by strong scouting parties, all possible information in regard to the strength and movements of the enemy, and it is especially enjoined upon them to send daily reports to the commanding general whether any movements have been made by the enemy or their own forces or not, and also to communicate daily with the commanders of adjoining divisions.

I have no new move of the enemy to report. I still continue active reconnaissance, and have, I believe, driven the enemy back to Columbus and Belmont. Every day our advance scouts come in sight of parties of rebels, but they always retreat upon sight of our troops. I have withdrawn all the troops from Fort Jefferson and strengthened the command at Korfolk. Should re-enforcements be sent here,however, I will retake that position. It was only abandoned this morning. The three men reported missing by me day before yesterday have all returned, with the loss of one horse.

It is reported to me by Captain Waite, of gunboat Tyler, that his men cannot receive pay short of Cincinnati. As it would be attended with much injury to the service to grant leaves of absence for his men to go there for their pay, and with great expense, either to the men or to the Government, to send them, I would respectfully recommend that some arrangement be made by which they may be paid here. The number of applications for discharge on surgeons’ certificate of disability has become so great, and as it appears to me granted on such trivial grounds, that I have felt it my duty to throw such restrictions in the way that certificates cannot be obtained in future when not really deserved.

Col. J. B. Plummer,
Eleventh Regiment Missouri Vols., Saint Louis, Mo,:
Sir : You have been appointed by the commanding general of the department colonel of the Eleventh Begiment Missouri Volunteers, now serving at Cape Girardeau, and commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bayles. The general directs that you proceed forthwith to that post and assume command of the regiment and post. It is believed that there is much in the condition of the service there that demands the attention of an officer of experience. He therefore calls your attention to the necessity of reorganizing the service, and particularly of pushing the entrenchments or forts there to a speedy completion. You will please also give your attention to keeping yourself informed of the movements, strength, and position ot* the enemy by the employment of reliable scouts or spies, and convey, by special express riders or other expeditious means, a report of important movements to the general himself. Such persons as you find in the vicinity of your post engaged in conveying information to the enemy you are directed to deal summarily with. It is notorious that every movement of our troops near Ironton, even of small parties, is immediately conveyed by express riders to the enemy. It is notably so also at Cape Girardeau. Beport by letter to General Grant, as your post is within the district comprising his command.

I will leave at Fort Scott Major Judson’s command of about 800 men, about 100 men at Fort Lincoln, and an irregular force which I have had organized and placed in forts all along the southern and eastern border. Inclosed you will find copies of reports of the commandants of Forts Scott, Lincoln, Barnesville, and some of the forts on the southern border, by which you will see all that has transpired at those points.*
You will see by the reports I inclose that rumors are rife that there is a force moving on Southern Kansas. If such is the case, God only knows what is to become of Kansas when we move on Kansas City.
I hope, as you have now opened communication with me, to hear from you frequently. I trust you will approve the march on Osceola and its destruction. It was the depot of the traitors for Southwestern Missouri. The movement was intended, first, to destroy the ammunition train; second, as a demonstration for the relief of Peabody; third, hoping to hear of a force moving from Sedalia; and, fourth, a covered movement I supposed we would have to make to the north. Our march east was through Papinsville, Prairie City, down the south side of the Osage, returning through Pleasant Gap and Butler to this point.
I inclose you a printed copy of a proclamation * which I have issued, which it is hoped will meet your approbation.

I have ordered the officers of the Quartermaster’s Department to take immediate measures to procure the articles required. The proper estimates for funds will go forward by mail in one or two days. I have respectfully to ask that you will make arrangements with the Treasury Department, and advise me by telegraph, authorizing Capt. P. T.

Should the enemy expose a week point on either side of the river, you may inflict upon him a combined blow; but at present I am not in favor of incurring any hazard of defeat. It is not impossible that the enemy may cross at Belmont and attempt to march upon Cape Girardeau by way of Charleston. Should you be unable with your limited force to prevent this by the occupation of Charleston, you will do so by frequent demonstrations and strong reconnaissance in that direction.

Capt. Chauncey McKeever,
Saint Louis, Mo.:
Everything here is quiet, and no rumors to disturb it. I have heard this evening that Hardee has arrived at New Madrid from Bloomfield, probably to re-enforce Johnston at Columbus. I scarcely credit the rumor, but it may be true. There are quite a number of troops at this place doing service that have never been sworn in. I would respectfully request that a mustering officer be sent or some one already here be duly authorized to act as such.
I have in confinement here a soldier charged with willful and malicious murder, committed^upon a fellow soldier. The crime was perpetrated in Missouri, where it is impossible to bring a criminal to justice by usual process. By law he cannot be tried in any court out of the State where the offense was committed. I would, therefore, ask if he cannot be tried by a military commission.
The cold season is now so nearly at hand, that it is time to think of providing winter quarters for the garrison that must necessarily occupy this place. Log huts could be cheaply built, but even they would cail for the outlay of some money. Credit will not do at this place longer. I understand that the credit of the Government has been already used to the extent of some hundred thousand dollars, and no money ever paid out. This causes much murmuring among the citizens, and unless the paymaster is soon sent to pay off the troops the same may be expected from the soldiers. I would respectfully urge, therefore, that funds be ordered here for the quartermaster’s department, and also that the troops be paid off as soon as practicable.

I have telegraphed to General Grant to know in what way I can most advantageously assist him, &c.
My scouts report no movement this way from Columbus. About 2,000 of the enemy from Columbus are in Feliciana.

I have to-day concentrated my command at this place, Bird’s Point, and Fort Holt. The work of placing these points ip a strong defensive condition wili be prosecuted with all our force. There is no enemy on the Missouri side of the river from Cape Girardeau to New Madrid, except Jeff. Thompson’s force at Belmont. I had troops in Charleston last evening. All quiet there. The packets plying between Saint Louis and Cairo constantly leave freight at points above here intended for the interior. This enables the enemy to supply all his wants.
Day before yesterday I sent a force to Charleston to bring back goods that had been landed for that place. Accompanying is an inventory of the goods seized. I have my serious doubts whether there is any law authorizing this seizure, but feel no doubt about the propriety of breaking up the trade now carried on. I respectfully refer this matter to the general commanding the Western Department for instructions. There is evidently a large force moving from Columbus to the interior. Whether upon Paducah or not I do not know.
I received a dispatch from General Asboth to send two companies of cavalry from here to Georgetown, Mo., via Saint Louis. My force is so small, especially cavalry, that before sending them I asked to have them replaced with other troops.

Sir: I received verbal instructions from Colonel Woods, chief business manager for Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont, to proceed to Washington and ask for money and arms for the use of the Western Military Department.
Permit me to say that a very large sum of money is required to meet the obligations incurred from contracts made by order of the commanding general in the prosecution of the war in Missouri. The credit of the Government is suffering greatly, and individuals are seriously embarrassed from the non-payment of debts due in Cincinnati, Saint Louis, and elsewhere. To the question, “How much money shall I

﻿512	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X,
ask for in Washington V’ Colonel Woods answered, u Twelve million dollars.” Of course I assume no personal responsibility in respect to the amount, as I have had no connection with business transactions in Saint Louis.
I am instructed also to procure arms, which are greatly needed both for the infantry and cavalry. Several thousand soldiers are now in Saint Louis without arms, and such is the perilous condition of the State, that they ought to be sent with the least possible delay. They are required by no less than three regiments of cavalry and six of infantry, and the enemy having gathered in large force in several places, we have not a man to lose from the want of a gun.
Having said thus much in relation to arms and money for General Fremont as a representative of the people as well as a special friend of the Army in the West, I think it my duty to call your attention in this place to some other matters that have an important bearing upon the prospects of the campaign in Missouri.
A great deal of trouble and confusion is springing up in the Western Military Department from a seeming conflict of authority between General Fremont and the authorized agents of the Government, which I trust a statement of facts may help to remove. He has given commissions to colonels and other staff officers, which I find are not recognized in Saint Louis or Washington. On this subject I herewith submit a statement of facts received this morning from Ool. C. J. Wright, of Cincinnati. If the authority here given, and in numerous like cases, by the general, be not promptly recognized by the Government, the utmost confusion will prevail among the officers and volunteers now in the service in the West. A large number of persons from Ohio have received, and others have been promised, commissions under him; but if his acts in such cases are not respected in Washington, there will be no end to vexation and trouble growing out of these transactions.
The same remark is applicable when applied to the contracts that have been made in Cincinnati, New York, and Boston for cannon, clothing, and arms in general. The contractors are pressing their claims for payment, and it is for the Department here to say whether innocent persons shall suffer from a non-recognition of General Fremont’s authority to make such contracts.
The perilous condition of Missouri seems to require that all trouble of this character should at once be removed by such instructions as the President may be pleased to give; The serious disasters that have befallen our army there; the surrender of Lexington, taken in connection with the battle in which General Lyon lost his life; the scattered condition of a portion of our forces, and other unfortunate circumstances which need not here be mentioned, have filled the Union men with alarm and consternation.
It is believed by our best men that nothing but the most prompt, wise, and powerful action of our forces will save the State from the control of the rebel army. It is generally admitted that its fate depends upon an impending battle at Lexington, and I cannot but ask, Is it wise to hazard everything there as well as in Kentucky ? For if one State is lost, the other probably will be, upon a single battle, with the odds now very much against us.
In connection with others, I have sent at General Frdmontfs request several thousand volunteers into Missouri from Ohio, and I cannot remain indifferent to their wants and dangers. I am fully satisfied that if arms, men, and money are not speedily and liberally supplied, and

a wise direction given them, the secessionists will take possession of Saint Louis.
And now, Mr. President, I most respectfully submit that one of two things ought to be done immediately, viz: Either General Fremont’s military commissions and extracts should be recognized and his drafts for money and arms to carry on the war honored, or some person should take his place whose acts will receive full recognition by the Government.
There is not one hour to lose in sending the means to save Missouri. To all human view no battle can be fought successfully at Lexington without the sending of additional arms and money, and if the Government neglects to supply them on the requisition of General Fremont and he fails, he will place the responsibility of his defeat upon the administration.

Colonel Wright is empowered immediately to proceed to muster and organize said regiment, and is charged with the responsibility of seeing that the various officers pertaining to said command are efficient and satisfactory, appointing such officers as may be efficient.
Colonel Wright is authorized at once to obtain whatever is necessary of arms, equipments, camp equipage, and subsistence to prepare said command for the active field. The officers in the different departments will facilitate the operations of Colonel Wright and those detailed by him.
When the companies are not full, or in case of deficiency of companies, any enlisted men not assigned may at once be transferred to said regiment to make the full complement.

duty. Two full and two half companies were then ready, and six companies were on duty as Home Guards, who were ordered to report as soon as relieved.
Colonel Wright proceeded to organize the regiment, to provide for its equipment, to designate officers, and appointed, August 20, 1861, to the special duty of quartermaster and adjutant and as drill-master Capt. B. T. Wright and First Lieut. W. E. Fay. They have been on duty since. Colonel Wright has during all this interval been daily and actively engaged on duty.
August 25, 1861, Colonel Wright was transferred as colonel to the Ninth Missouri Volunteers.
August 26, was detailed on duty on court-martial, and acted.
On September 3d was retransferred to Thirteenth Missouri Volunteers from Ninth Missouri, and was ordered to Washington, Mo., with his command.
September 20, detailed on special duty to guard bridges.
September 23, returned to Camp Benton, where three companies had assembled.
During all the time from 3d August the colonel has been under orders and performing active duty as such. The officers of the regiment have been acting as such.
That the companies and regiments have not been full has been owing to the duties performed, or Colonel Wright did not assume to form a regiment but only to organize companies formed, and has been on duty.
On the 27th September, 1861, on asking to have a pay-roll made out, Colonel Wright received the answer of which a copy is annexed:
Saint Louis, Mo., September 27, 1861.
My instructions from Washington are to recognize captains when they have companies organized, &c., and over the minimum allowances of privates, &c., and to recognize field officers and staff officers only when their regiments are enrolled and organized—as, for instance, a colonel when he has a fuU regiment. I refer to General Orders of the War Department, No. 36, dated June 24, and General Orders, No. 61, dated August 19, 1861, and the last part of section 2 of the act of 22d July, 1861.
I view the letter of General Fr&nont, annexed, as an authority to Colonel Wright to raise and organize a regiment, which when organized and enrolled would entitle him to be its colonel.
I give this note at the request of Colonel Wright.
T. P. ANDREWS,
Deputy Paymaster-General, U. S. Army.
Note on this.—The State of Missouri and the Western Department are peculiar. The detail of companies and parts of companies postpones and prevents their formation, and the same cause has and does prevent the regimental formation. The duty is performed by regimental and company officers the same as if full.
This is not a letter referred to; it is an appointment, dating from acceptance. It is a detailment of the colonel and his officers on duty performed. It does not look to the formation of the regiment ere the officer is to be recognized and receive the pay of a colonel. The transfer from one regiment to another is a recognition of the position; the detailment on duty as colonel for a court-martial and its performance, another; the detailment on duty as a mustering officer is another ; the meeting of requisitions and obtainment of supplies another, &c.
The paper of August 20,1861, is a direct order to paymasters as well as others. The general orders referred to cannot be had. Parties rely on the general authority of Major-General Fremont in Missouri, and could not controvert it.
The detailment on duty might prevent, as it has, a full regimental

I have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Blunt, in command at Fort Scott, to concentrate his entire force, leaving but a small guard at Fort, Scott and Fort Lincoln, and move northward through Barnesville, Trading Post, and West Point in the direction of Harrisonville, while I will move to-morrow morning, in connection with General Sturgis’ command, southward, through West Point, forming a junction with Lieutenant-Colonel Blunt.
We will do all in our power to annoy the enemy in their flank and rear. General Sturgis will have about 2,000 men. After the junction with Lieutenant-Colonel Blunt I will have ab,out 3,000.

General S. D. Sturgis :
Headquarters Kansas Brigade,
Kansas City, October 3, 1861.
General : In answer to your note of this day* I have this to say, that I don’t care a fig about rank; I have enough of the glittering tinsel to satisfy me. I am here in obedience to an order from Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont to co-operate with you in ferreting out and fighting the enemy. Kindly and promptly do I desire to obey that order. My brigade is not here for the purpose of interfering in anywise with the institution of slavery. They shall not become negro thieves, nor shall they be prostituted into negro catchers. The institution of slavery must take care of itself.
I said in the Senate of the United States, and my experience since only demonstrates its truth, that in my opinion the institution would perish with the march of the Federal armies.
Again I say that the mass of the personal property in Missouri, including slave, is at this moment held by the wives and children, assisted by the Federal Army, while the husband and father are actually in arms against the Government. In my opinion our policy in this regard should be changed.
Confiscation of slaves and other property which can be made useful to the Army should follow treason as the thunder peal follows the lightning flash. Until this change is made you offer premiums for the men to remain away in the army of the enemy. I had a man cowardly shot in the woods to-day within sight of our camp by the very man, I have no doubt, whose property you are so anxious to protect.
I am endeavoring to find what transportation I have to spare, if any, and will report to you accordingly.
Yours,

Lane chased Rains into Osceola, and was compelled to shell the place to dislodge the rebels. In doing so he burned the town and destroyed large stores of the rebels, of which the town was the depot. Killed 50 rebels without losing a man. Lane, not being strong enough to pursue Rains, withdrew to Kansas City and joined Sturgis.

When I first learned that Thompson had broken up his camp, I ordered out a force to Charleston to cut him pff in that direction. I inclose you the report of Colonel Oglesby, who made the detail for the expedition.* Before I assumed command of this military district a steam ferry had been seized on the Mississippi and taken into Government service at Cape Girardeau. I knew nothing of the circumstances until within the last few days. Finding that Government wastusing private property under these conditions, I ordered the commanding officer at Cape Girardeau to require the quartermaster of the post to enter into a contract for the use of the boat. I have just received the report of the quartermaster and the opinion of Colonel Plummer thereon. The owner of the ferry demanded $75 per day. The quartermaster (Lieutenant Shields, of the Twentieth Illinois Volunteers) regards $8 per day as a fair compensation, and Colonel Plummer, on advising with old steamboat men, regards Lieutenant Shields7 estimate as a fair value of the services of the ferry. The Luella will be retained until otherwise directed by higher authority, and no contract be entered into.

Should there be any regular troops at Leavenworth, or immediately expected there, you will effect a junction with them, and proceed by railroad to Chillieothe, and from there move by the Grand River to join General Pope.
You will instantly advise General Lane, who at the last accounts had a successful engagement with the enemy at Papinsville, and was between that place and Warsaw, of all your movements, if practicable, by a verbal message. General Prentiss has been instructed to facilitate your movements, and in concert with Governor Robinson, of Kansas, to use every possible endeavor to hold Fort Leavenworth.

General: I am instructed to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this morning by your aide-de-camp and telegram of this evening relative to the wants of the troops.* Every attention will be given to supply deficiencies at the earliest moment. Some great-coats, it is understood, can be procured in Saint Louis, and will be ordered to be purchased at once. Sabers have been forwarded from Saint Louis, and should have arrived before this time. In reference to transportation, it was not the intention in this movement towards posts of rendezvous to place the whole allowance of wagons with the troops. That could not be accomplished, as there is not a. full supply of wagons provided. The object has been to concentrate the divisions at particular points from which it is expected they will eventually move, but while thus fixed to convey to them all the supplies they need to prepare them for an active campaign against the enemy. The post of your division is Versailles. The divisions of McKinstry and Asboth are in reserve, the former at Syracuse, the latter at Tipton. Portions of your division are in advance, and will soon be recalled to join you.
To-day Colonel Wyman has been ordered to proceed with a full and complete train of wagons from Rolla to Versailles to join you. The general regrets the suffering of the troops, and he cannot understand how, with reports from the director of transportation that baggage and supplies had reached the neighborhood of your camp with but little delay, that the troops should have been without tents or provisions.

Sir: The enemy having evacuated Lexington, and the circumstances of the service having made it unnecessary for yop to come to this place, the major-general commanding the department directs that you move immediately from Rolla direct to Versailles, with full transportation complete. You will direct your line of march to cross the Osage River at Linn Creek, or, if you deem it more convenient and expedient, to march upon Versailles, and cross the Osage by whatever route you think best. Versailles is to be occupied by the division of General Hunter to which you belong, but should he have left that place (which is not likely to be the case), scouts sent about to learn his position will enable you to vary your march to join him accordingly.

Sir: For the last two days I have had no reliable intelligence of the movements of the enemy. The gunboats have been out of order, so as to be unable to make reconnaissances, and one of my spies, from whom I expected a full and accurate report, has not returned. Our scouts report nothing of importance. I have ordered a force of 1,200 men to Charleston. They will leave early in the morning. My own opinion is that the enemy have no present intention of moving on Cape Girardeau.
I think Paducah is more likely the point they design to approach. I have ordered one gunboat to cruise down as far as Norfolk to-night, ' and will send the other gunboat (now at Mound City, repairing) to re-connoiter farther down to-morrow morning. We are very much in need of the new gunboat promised, and I trust she will be here very soon. I expect to go to Cape Girardeau to-morrow night, to inspect the troops there and the condition of the post.
Colonel Cook’s Seventh Illinois Regiment arrived here last evening, and are now stationed at Camp Holt. I had ordered the exchange of Colonel Ross’ and Colonel Cook’s regiments before I received your instructions to that effect.

The troops of the Third Division, now at my disposition, are stationed at Sedalia and Otterville. At Sedalia there are four regiments of infantry, with a total strength of 2,600 men, two batteries of six pieces each, and one company of cavalry. These troops are mostly provided with transportation means. At Otterville there are two regiments of infantry, with a total strength of 1,500 men. These two regiments have no transportation, and can therefore not be moved for the moment, otherwise I would have ordered them to Sedalia.

reliable scouts, to spare the troops for action. Cold Neck Bridge must be occupied by at least four companies, and mounted scouts sent out from there in a northwestern direction to watch any movement made against the bridge.
2.	Two regiments and one battery of the command now at Georgetown will take position in some proper place south of Georgetown, to be in communication with this command, which I will post front southwest on the heights between Georgetown and Sedalia.
3.	The troops at Otterville will proceed to Arater, and advance on the road leading from Arater to Georgetown. They will send one company to the left as far as the railroad track to watch the enemy’s movements from Sedalia. They will also have with them some mounted scouts to bring news to me as often as thought proper, to inform me of all the movements of the enemy. If transported by railroad, the troops from Otterville will not proceed farther than Priceville or Farmer City. From there they will march to the north, to strike the road leading from Arater to Georgetown. Arriving at this road, they will take a position to guard our left flank and rear, and to act, under proper circumstances, as the left wing of the line of battle. They will also send scouts from Otterville to Cold Keck Bridge, to give notice to the detachment stationed there and caution them to be on their post.
4.	Colonel Bissell will occupy with his command the intrenchments before the La Mine Bridge, where he will receive re-enforcements, if necessary, to protect the retreat of the army across the La Mine Fiver, or in case a battle should be fought near Otterville.
5.	The trains will be sent back towards Otterville and Cold Keck. The commissary stores will also be removed, or, if no transportation can be had, destroyed.
6.	The whole material at the railroad depot of Sedalia shall be removed, or, if no time is given, shall be burned or otherwise destroyed.
7.	In case it should be found proper to retreat towards La Mine Fiver, the command of General Davis will take the road to Cold Keck Bridge, while the Third Division and the troops from Otterville will be directed either to Arater and Otterville or to the Booneville road leading to Cold Keck Bridge.
8.	If re-enforcements from behind the La Mine Fiver should be sent forward during the battle, they should advance towards Sedalia, to act against the right flank and rear of the enemy. A special order will define the position of the troops in detail.

small squads towards the south. They said that Price was about to dismount them and use them as infantry, which they would not like. Our forces here are said to be 50,000. Mr. M. adds that the secessionists in Johnson and Henry Counties are in very low spirits, and that the rebels were not very anxious to meet us in equal numbers. There were 500 rebels at Warrensburg when Mr. M. left the place yesterday night.
This morning I sent the detachment of cavalry under Captain Wol-demar to La Monte and Sissonville. They have not returned yet, but will be here to-night. General Lane has, according to my last information, left Henry County and marched back towards the Kansas line. Montgomery was said to be at West Point, northwest of Butler. From the subjoined order you will see what instructions General Lane has received by me.
If the movement of Price is confirmed, I would propose the following course of operations:
1.	All troops this side of the La Mine Kiver (west) being able to move should at once proceed to Warsaw, take possession of the place, and prepare the necessary means of crossing the river by the main corps of the army. For this purpose the corps of Colonel Bissell and a pioneer company should be immediately forwarded to Sedalia to join this command.
2.	The troops behind the La Mine Kiver (at Syracuse, Tipton, Boone-ville, Jefferson, &e.) should advance by Versailles to Warsaw.
3.	The troops at Kolia to Linn Creek.
4.	Lane and Sturgis should unite at Warrensburg, to be directed to Clinton and Warsaw. In case this plan, which is in conformity with your ideas previously expressed, should find your approbation, I will immediately advance to Warsaw. If the enemy should, after being re-enforced at Kose Hill or Papinsville, return towards the north or east, our position on the Osage Kiver would be so that we could act under great advantages.

General : As no train did come up and leave yesterday, I could not send you my report Ko. 5 that day. The 40 men of cavalry, under Captain Woldemar, were within 8 miles of Warrensburg, and report 500 men at that place. Price was yesterday at Kose Hill, and has left the city, moving in a southwestern direction. He must now be between Big Creek and Grand Kiver. Lane was not at Clinton, and did not, therefore, receive my dispatch. He is reported to be at West Point. It may be that Price is marching against Lane and Sturgis for the laurels of another Lexington, but this seems to me rather improbable. One of my scouts returning from Henry County reports that the troops of Price, amongst whom he was, speak about “ reorganizing the army”; “the army would be given over to the Confederate States”; “that Johnston would bring them a great store of new clothing from the South and 25,000 men”; “that he would take the command, and that Price would serve under him.”

If Price is crossing Grand River to march to the south, Lane and Sturgis could advance to Warrensburg to join us. I will send to General Lane to direct him in this way.

Col. J. H. Eaton,
Act. Asst. Adjt. Gen., and Mil. See., Jefferson City, Mo.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that I have left Kelton’s brigade at Booneville collecting means of transportation, to move forward as soon as orders to that effect are received from the general commanding. One steamer was sent up, the other down the river, with detachments, to land at various points and hire or press all the wagons that could be found, whilst detachments for the same purpose were sent out by land from Booneville. None of these had returned on the 6th.
I came to this place yesterday with a small escort, to inspect General Davis’ brigade, and to examine into the condition of affairs and the character of the country as to supplies, &c., in view of a forward movement. Unless I receive orders to the contrary from headquarters, I shall return to Booneville to morrow.
There is no longer a doubt that Price is slowly retreating to the southwest, and my own belief is that he will make an effort, and probably a successful one unless he is intercepted, to take Fort Scott, where I am informed there are considerable stores of ammunition, &c. It seems to be the impression here that want of ammunition, especially of percussion caps, induced him to move south so as to meet supplies sent him by

McCulloch, but my own belief is that if pursued he will not halt this side of the Arkansas line unless forced to do so. If it be the purpose of the general commanding to pursue as rapidly as possible, I would respectfully suggest that a limited supply of transportation and cavalry would enable General SigePs division and my own to move forward immediately. I think our combined force amply sufficient to deal with Price, who from the best information has not over 20,000 men with him. It is believed among people here that he will divide this force in order to subsist it during his retreat south, and General Sigel and myself, if not able utterly to rout him, will at least be able to force a halt until he can be dealt with.
I would suppose that 150 wagons, with what can be collected by pressing, would be sufficient to enable these two divisions to move efficiently.
I shall send this letter if possible by special express, and hope by tomorrow afternoon to know what are the purposes of the general commanding in relation to my division—whether it had not best be concentrated either here or at some point south of this place. I will report to-morrow the exact condition in all respects of Davis’ brigade.
I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Oapt. Chauncey McKeever, Saint Louis, Mo.:
Yesterday I visited Cape Girardeau, and found that Colonel Plummer was working every available man upon the fortifications, and had really accomplished more in one week than would have been done under an inefficient officer in two months. At the same rate Cape Girardeau will be very completely fortified by Saturday; requiring, however, some more heavy ordnance. I am very much in favor, as a general thing, of 24-pounder pieces on siege carriages, instead of ponderous guns, that take so much to mount and are moved from one place to another with so much labor. I never would use them except in permanent positions. Cape Girardeau wants four, can use six, pieces. Colonel Plummer reports the Home Guards as of no use, and not to be found when called upon. I authorized the discontinuance of all recognition of them; also recommended, rather authorized, Captain Powell, an efficient officer of the Twentieth Illinois Volunteers, who has been acting as engineer, to raise a company to manage the siege guns. He reported that the company can be raised in two days at Cape Girardeau. This authority was given subject to the approval of the commander of department. Information here would indicate that troops are assembling ready to attack Paducah. My belief is that the attack will not be made for the present, however, but should it I will give General Smith all the aid prudent. The fact is, when I sent troops to Paducah, I selected the fullest regiments and those best armed and equipped, leaving here the raw, unarmed, and ragged. I would recommend that authority be given the quartermaster here to purchase horses for the use of Captain Houghtaling’s company of light artillery. They can be purchased here as cheaply as at Saint Louis, and on certificate to be paid there.
I would renew my recommendation that huts be put up for winter quarters for such garrison as it may be contemplated will occupy this

place. I would further recommend for the consideration of the commanding general whether it would not be a good plan to purchase a number of coal barges, such as have been used for the Paducah Bridge, and fit them up for winter quarters. They could.be used for transporting troops for a southern expedition with much saving of steam power, and could be made comfortable quarters wherever landed. A full detail of the plan I would submit would take more room than I propose here. In a small way a constant supply of the essentials is being furnished the rebels by steamers plying between here and Saint Louis. I have thought of sending a steamer to Cape Girardeau with a guard aboard to follow each of these steamers, make every landing they do, and pick up all freight landed by them.
I would state again that my information to-day confirms the belief that Cape Girardeau is only threatened by Thompson and Lowe. My correspondence to-day with State authority does not indicate immediate re-enforcements from that quarter. It will be impossible for me to furnish General Smith with a company of artillery.
U. S. GRANT,
Brigadier-General.
Leavenworth City, Kans., October 9,1861. His Excellency A. Lincoln,
President of the United States:
Sir : Since my return from Washington to Kansas I have labored earnestly and incessantly, as commander of the Kansas Brigade, to put down the great insurrection in Missouri. After the State authorities here had failed to collect a force worthy of the name, I, by my own individual efforts and those of my personal friends, despite the opposition of the governor of this State, succeeded in raising and marching against the enemy as gallant and effective an army, in proportion to its numbers, as ever entered the field. Its operations are a part of the history of the country. That brigade to a man are exceedingly desirous of continuing in the service under my command, and I am very anxious to gratify its members in that behalf; but as matters are at present arranged, I feel compelled to abandon the field.
While the Kansas Brigade was being organized, Governor Charles Robinson exerted his utmost endeavor to prevent the enlistment of men. Since its organization lie has constantly, in season and out of season, vilified myself, and abused tlm men under my command as marauders and thieves. For the purpose of gratifying his malice against me, he has conspired with Captain Prince, the commandant at Fort Leavenworth, to dissolve the brigade, and Captain Prince has apparently heartily espoused the cause in that direction. The latter-named person, in his official capacity, has refused to recognize my authority as commander, and wholly declined to respond to my lawful requisitions upon him for articles and supplies necessary to the efficiency and comfort of the brigade.
There being no hope of improvement in this condition of things so long as I am in my present position, in order that I may with my brigade remain in the field, and the Government be sustained in this region, and Kansas be protected from invasion from Missouri, I earnestly request and recommend the establishment of a new military department, to be composed of Kansas, the Indian country, and so much of Arkansas and the Territories as may be thought advisable to include therein.

After much consideration, and consultation with influential and intelligent gentlemen hereabout, I am decidedly of opinion that this at least should be done, and that the commandant thereof should have under him at least 10,000 troops.
If this can be done, and I can have the command of the department, I will cheerfully accept it, resign my seat in the Senate, and devote all my thoughts and energies to the prosecution of the war. But if nothing can be done to remedy the evils complained of, I will, as above intimated, be compelled to leave my command, quit the field, and most reluctantly become an idle spectator of the great struggle, and witness, I have no doubt, the devastation of my adopted State and the destruction of its people.

General : The following movements of the several divisions of the Army of Western Missouri have been decided upon :
Acting Major-General Pope, with the forces under his immediate command, will march by way of Ottervilleto Sedalia, and from there by the most direct route to Leesville.

Acting Brig. Gen. Jeff. O. Davis will start on the 13th of October from Georgetown by Sedalia with the troops belonging to General Pope’s division, and pursue the same direct road to Leesville, reaching his destination on the 15th.
Acting Major-General Sigel will start from Sedalia on the 13th and proceed in three marches, by Spring Rock and Cole Camp, to Warsaw, which place he will occupy, commence preparations immediately to cross the river next day, supported by Acting Major-General McKinstry’s forces, and cross on the 16th at all hazards, if a position can be taken on the right bank, under the protection of which a bridge may be built.
Acting Major-General McKinstry will start on the 13th, and proceed in four marches, by Florence, Haw Creek, and Cole Camp, to Warsaw, where he will co-operate with General Sigel.
Major-General Hunter will also start on the 13th, and proceed in four marches, by way of Versailles and Minerva (Hibernia), to Duroc Ferry.
Acting Major-General Asboth will, start with his division on the 14th, and march in three days to Cole Camp Creek, by way of Wheatland and Hibernia.
Generals Sturgis and Lane are expected to be at the same time in Clinton, on our extreme right. You are, therefore, instructed to commence your march on the day apx>ointed for your troops to move, and proceed according to the directions above laid down.
The state of the roads is such that trains may not be unfrequently delayed, which renders it more than usually necessary that the troops should in all cases have at least one day’s rations in their haversacks. The commanders of divisions will also, in all cases where possible, send forward in advance of the march a company of pioneers, protected by cavalry, to repair the bridges and roads wherever impassable.

Sir : Since my last report I have ascertained that Thompson with his troops has gone west to Bloomfield or farther. There is no force, therefore, threatening Cape Girardeau.
I sent the gunboats Tyler and Lexington down near Columbus to-day, not so much for the purpose of reconnoitering as to protect a steamer sent after wood belonging to Hunter, who is with the Southern Army. About 100 cords were brought up.

pistols, and great-coats, and many of them are greatly in want of clothing.
The men of the Indiana batteries are in want of great-coats, clothing, and ammunition.
Requisitions have been sent in for ambulances, but they have not been furnished. Some of our mules are unshod, and we shall have them lame and unserviceable, unless we can be furnished with portable forges and blacksmith’s tools.
About 50 tents are needed for the division. As we shall have to send our teams back for provisions after four days’ march, we should not leave here with less than 60,000 rations, as we cannot calculate on their return in less than 15 days to our camp, even if we should remain stationary at the end of our four days’ march.
The cavalry regiment has not a wagon ; and Colonel Palmer’s and Colonel Bland’s have neither of them sufficient for their baggage.
To enable us to move efficiently, yve need at least 100 wagons and the ambulances already ordered to be supplied to the division by the general commanding.

It is deemed unnecessary to erect field works around this city, and you will direct their discontinuance $ also those, if any, in course of construction at Jefferson City. In this connection it is seen that a number of commissions have been given by you. No payment will be made to such officers, except to those whose appointments have been approved by the President. This, of course, does not apply to the officers with volunteer commissions. Colonel Andrews has been verbally so instructed by the Secretary; also not to make transfer of funds except for the purpose of paying the troops.
The erection of barracks near your quarters in this city will be at once discontinued.
The Secretary has been informed that the troops of General Lane’s command are committing depredations on our friends in Western Missouri. Your attention is directed to this in the expectation that you will apply the correction.

Adjutant-General of the Army, Washington, I). C,:
Sir: I have the honor to report that, after pushing the works of preparation at Saint Louis, Jefferson City, and Tipton, I left the latter place on the 14th instant, and, having fully matured my plans of operation against the enemy, have now reached this place with the major part of the division of Acting Major-General Asboth, near 5,000 strong, and only need the co-operation of the other divisions, already in march, or about to march, from their several points of departure on the line of the railroad, to move with all possible celerity against the enemy. Part of the division of Acting Major-General Sigel, which marched from Sedalia on the 13th, occupied Warsaw on the afternoon of the 15th, and this morning a detachment of cavalry, with the battalion of four companies of Missouri infantry, crossed the Osage Biver (not yet fordable). The other portions of his force have also been crossing during the day.
On the 14th the position of the enemy was reported as follows:
General Price, northeast of Montevallo, at the Prairie House; Steen’s -command, at Montevallo; Harrison’s troops, at Big Alder Creek, and Bains’ troops, at a place three miles below Montevallo, on the same stream.
After the crossing of the Osage by the cavalry this morning, Sergeant Trautweire reports that on their advance towards the Pomme de Terre Biver Bridge they had an engagement with some rebel cavalry, taking several prisoners. Further reports of my operations will be duly dispatched to the Department.

The effect of the special Washington dispatches to the New York Tribune on Missouri affairs has been to stimulate the rebels to great activity and aggression in the city and State. They are concentrating around Pilot Knob, having burned the bridge on the Iron Mountain road, to stop our re-enforcements. We have sent two regiments, and will whip them. They have cut the northern wires and are active and impudent. Hardee and Johnston have gone to Kentucky. General Fremont is 30 miles south of Tipton, marching fast.

Captain : In pursuance of telegraphic instructions from the commanding general, I sent from here Colonel Marsh’s regiment of Illinois volunteers, three companies of cavalry, and a section of artillery, to be re-enforced by two regiments from Cape Girardeau, to go in pursuit of Thompson and such of the rebel army as have been committing depredations on the Iron Mountain Railroad.
There is a great difficulty in procuring storage here for commissary and quartermaster’s.stores, particularly since the fleet of gunboats have commenced making preparations for fitting out. I have directed the employment of a very large wharf boat, capable of storing 2,500 tons, subject to the approval of the department commander. This accommodation, it now seems, the gunboat fleet wants. I ordered it more particularly for the commissary and ordnance departments. A great, proportion of the rations issued from here going by water to the different posts, an immense labor is saved in hauling by storage upon the water.
Not found, but see next preceding dispatch.

I would ask* if storage for the gunboat fleet is to be furnished by the Quartermaster’s Department, oris Captain Perry, Navy receiving officer here, to furnish this accommodation out of a different appropriation.
It is highly necessary, in view of possible high water, to revet the outer embankments of Fort Prentiss, to prevent them from washing away. There is no money in the engineer department to make the purchase of material with which to do it. Shall I order the quartermaster to purchase the necessary material ? The labor can be furnished by detail.
in the matter of signing discharges on surgeon’s certificates I examined the regulations well, and come fully to the conclusion that now that General Fremont was in the field I might regard myself as commanding an army in the field also, and therefore be entitled to sign such discharges. Then, too, many of the cases coming before me are of such a nature that the applicant should not be detained a single day.
I would ask as to my authority to grant sick leaves ; also if I have authority to send officers or men on recruiting service to fill up companies here.
For the last few days the reports I get from the enemy are so contradictory that I feel but little like reporting. I am satisfied, however, that Hardee, with 5 regiments, has joined Buckner $ also that a large force has crossed to the Missouri shore—this latter chiefly, I think, to gather the large crop of corn now maturing.
There has been added lately to the works at Columbus a casemate battery.
Several days ago I ordered a steamer to Cape Girardeau to follow the first Saint Louis steamer, and make all her landings below that point and seize all goods landed. My orders were exceeded by seizing the steamer also, but she was released promptly on being brought into port. A copy of the report of the officer commanding, marked A,* is inclosed. Are these goods to be retained? I would again suggest that trade with Southeastern Missouri should be cut off. The enemy are enabled to get valuable supplies by that route, and all the information in possession of citizens of Saint Louis. Paper marked B* contains a list of articles seized in the same manner, landed by the steamer Arago.
I would suggest that, if consistent with the views of the commanding general, I would like to visit Saint Louis and Springfield strictly on business for this command. I have frequently reported our deficiency in many of the necessaries to a complete outfit, and want to give my best efforts to remedy the evil.

His Excellency the President:
Deputy Paymaster-General Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews refuses to honor General Fr6mont7s commissions, which have heretofore invariably been accepted by him. Officers of the Army who have sacrificed their all to take up arms for their country are thus left destitute, and their families in want of the most urgent necessities of life. Very many of these officers are now in the field and in face of the enemy. Their efficiency and the spirits of many of the troops serving under them will be most seriously affected by this course. Unless you will provide a remedy to insure these men in their well-deserved remuneration a portion of the army will necessarily disband, as no officers will or can serve without a valid commission.

Sir: I was taken sick the day you left here, and was not able to comply sooner with the instructions given me to furnish you with a copy of General Fremont’s order to print his proclamation of August 30. I herewith inclose a copy of the ol der to publish the President’s letter, together with the order to print 200 copies of the original proclamation.!
The return of troopsf in this department was sent during my illness without a letter of transmittal. The number is apparently large, but it must be borne in mind that about 4,000 cavalry, 10,000 infantry, and one-half the artillery are without arms.

General : I am instructed by the general commanding to invite your attention to certain rumors of a meditated maneuver by the Confederate forces at Columbus and in Southeast Missouri, which, if true, would compromise the safety of Ironton, and possibly of Saint Louis. Should General Johnston or Hardee, or perhaps even Pillow, advance upon either of those places, it would, whether a real or simulated movement, affect the operations here; and he would be glad to have you apprise him at the earliest moment of your views as to the whole service thus likely tc be affected, desiring you on any sudden emergency to act in Kentucky as in your judgment may seem to you best.

genera! to prosecute the war with the utmost vigor against all who are in arms against the Government, it is equally his aim to inspire confidence in the loyal inhabitants of this State, and to assure others of protection and immunity if they return to their allegiance.
When necessaries are taken along the route of the Army, it will be by the proper officers, under orders only from the commanding general or generals of divisions, and will be receipted for and the owners in due time paid. But plundering and marauding, doubly disgraceful in soldiers, whose duty is to protect the persons and property of their countrymen, are declared by the Army Regulations to be crimes of such enormity, as to admit of no remission of the terrible penalty decreed by the military law for offenses of this nature.
It is therefore strictly forbidden to take private property from any person, for any purpose whatever, except by authority of a general officer; to enter any dwelling occupied or unoccupied, unless accompanied by a commissioned officer; to fire a gun or pistol in camp or on the march, or to leave the ranks upon any pretense without the order or permission of the company commander.
This requirement is to be enforced amongst all those who accompany the baggage and field trains,* as well as with those who march in the columns.
II.	As a habitual practice during the campaign, the troops will be required to turn out at the reveille roll-call under arms, and stand to arms fully equipped and ready for service. After roll-call the arms and accouterments will be inspected by a company officer. The cartridges in the boxes will be counted and the men held to answer, and if necessary be punished, for any expenditure of ammunition not properly accounted for.
III.	All commanding officers will be held responsible for the strict execution of this order.
By order of Major-General Frdmont:
J. H. EATOH,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
Washington, D. C., October 21,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the report requested in your letter of the 19th instant.*
We arrived at Saint Louis, as you are aware, at 2.30 a. m. October 11. After breakfast rode to Benton Barracks, above the city. On the street leading to the camp passed a small field work in course of construction. Found the camp of great extent, with extensive quarters, constructed of rough boards. Much has been said of the large sums expended in their erection, but some one mentioned that General McKinstry, principal quartermaster, who made the disbursements, gave the cost at $15,000. If so, it was judicious. The actual cost should be ascertained. General Curtis was in command. Force present, 110 officers, 3,338 men— principally detachments, except the First Iowa Cavalry, 31 officers, 901 men, having horses, but without equipments.
General Curtis said of General Fremont that he found no difficulty in having access to him, and when he presented business connected with his command, it was attended to. General F. never consulted him on
. * Which, with this report, was submitted by the Secretary of War to the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, under date of March 12, 1862.

military matters, nor informed him of liis plans. General Curtis remarked that while he would go with freedom to General Scott and express his opinions, he would not dare do so to General Fremont. He deemed General Fremont unequal to the command of an army, and said that he was no more bound by law than by the winds.
After dinner rode to the arsenal, below the city, Captain Callender in charge. The garrison for its protection is under Major Granger, Third Cavalry. But very few arms on hand; a number of heavy guns, designed for gunboats and mortar boats. The captain is engaged in making ammunition. He said he heard that some person had a contract for making the carriages for these guns; that, if so, he knew nothing of it, and that it was entirely irregular, he being the proper officer to attend to the case. This, in my opinion, requires investigation. He expected soon to receive funds, and desired them for current purposes ; was fearful, however, that they might be diverted for other payments. Yisited a large hospital not distant from the arsenal, in charge of Assistant Surgeon Bailey, U. S. Army. It was filled with patients, mostly doing well; in fine order, and a credit to the service. The doctor had an efficient corps of assistants from the volunteer service, and in addition a number of Sisters of Charity as nurses. God bless these pure and disinterested women!
Colonel Andrews, chief paymaster, called and represented irregularities in the Pay Department, and desired instructions from the Secretary for his government, stating that he was required to make payments and transfers of money contrary to law and regulations. Once, upon objecting to what he conceived an improper payment, he was threatened with confinement by a file of soldiers. He exhibited an order for the transfer of $100,000 to the Quartermaster’s Department, which was irregular. Exhibited abstract of payment by one paymaster (Major Febiger) to 42 persons, appointed by General Fr6mont, viz: 1 colonel, 3 majors, 8 captains, 15 first lieutenants, 11 second lieutenants, 1 surgeon, 3 assistant surgeons; total 42. Nineteen of these have appointments as engineers, and entitled to cavalry pay.
A second abstract of payments was furnished, but not vouched for as reliable, as the paymaster was sick, and is only given to show the excess of officers of rank appointed to the major-general’s body guard of only 300 men; the commander being a colonel, &c. The whole number of irregular appointments made by General Fr6mont was said by Colonel Andrews to be nearly 200.
The following is a copy of one of these appointments:
Headquarters Western Department,
Saint Louis, August 28, *1861.
Sir: Yon are hereby appointed captain of cavalry, to be employed in the land transportation department, and will report for duty at these headquarters.
J. C. FREMONT,
Major-General, Commanding.
To Capt. Felix Vogele, Present.
I also saw a similar appointment given to an individual on General Fremont’s staff, as director of music, with the rank and commission of captain of engineers. This person was a musician in a theater in Saint Louis. Colonel Andrews was verbally instructed by me not to pay him, the person having presented the two papers and demanded pay. Colonel Andrews also stated that these appointments bore one date, but directed payment, in some cases, a month or more anterior thereto. He was then without funds, except a small amount.
The principal commissary, Captain Haines, had no outstanding debts,

and expected funds soon. Major Allen, principal quartermaster, had recently taken charge at Saint Louis, but reported great irregularities in his department, and requested special instructions. These he deemed important, as orders were communicated by a variety of persons, in a very irregular manner, requiring disbursements of money. These orders are often verbally given (see paper So. 4, asking for instructions) [A]. He was sending, under General Fremont’s orders, large amounts of forage from Saint Louis to the army at Tipton, where corn was abundant and very cheap. The distance was 160 miles. He gave the indebtedness of the quartermaster’s department in Saint Louis to be $4,506,309.73.
In regard to contracts, without an examination of the accounts it would be difficult to arrive at the facts. It is the expressed belief of many persons that General Fremont has around him in his staff persons directly and indirectly concerned in furnishing supplies. The following is a copy of a letter signed by Leonidas Haskell, captain and aide-de-camp. He, though on General Fremont’s staff, is said to be a contractor for hay and forage and mules, the person named in his note, Colonel Degraf, being his partner.
Headquarters Western Department,
Camp Lillie, October 2, 1861.
Sir : I am requested by the commanding general to authorize Colonel Degraf to take any hay that has been contracted for by the Government, his receipt for the same being all the voucher you require.
Respectfully, yours,
LEONIDAS HASKELL, ^ Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
What does this mean ? Contractors deliver forage direct to quarter ^ masters, who issue the same; but here another party steps in, and, if a contractor or the partner of one, to fill his own contract. This double transaction it is difficult to suppose is done without a consideration. The accounts should be examined, and the price paid to Degraf compared with that paid to the contractors whose forage was seized.
This same Captain Haskell, aide-de camp, was a contractor for mules. He desired Captain Turnley to receive his animals—good, bad, and indifferent, as Captain Turnley said. This he would not do, and stated his prices for different classes—wheel, lead, &c. Besides, he had more mules than he could possibly send to the army. Notwithstanding all this, he received an order to inspect and receive Mr. Haskell’s mules as rapidly as possible. Captain Turnley very soon received orders from General Fremont to leave Saint Louis and proceed to the interior. (See paper No. 7, showing his great labor and heavy responsibility) [B.]
By direction of General Meigs, advertisements were made to furnish grain and hay, and contracts made for specific sums—28 cents per bushel for corn, 30 cents for oats, and $17.95 per ton for hay. In face of this, another party at Saint Louis—Baird, or Baird & Palmer (Palmer being of the old firm in California of Palmer, Cook & Co.)—were directed to send to Jefferson City (where hay and corn abound) as fast as possible 100,000 bushels of oats, with a corresponding amount of hay, at 33 cents per bushel for grain and $19 per ton for hay. (See paper No. 7, Captain Turnley’s letter.)
Captain Edward M. Davis, a member of his staff, received a contract by the direct order of General Fr&mont for blankets. They were examined by a board of army officers, consisting of Captain Hendershott, Fourth Artillery, Captain Haines, commissary of subsistence, and Cap-

543
tain Turnley, assistant quartermaster. The blankets were found to be made of cotton and to be rotten and worthless. Notwithstanding this decision they were purchased, and given to the sick and wounded soldiers in hospitals. These facts can be ascertained from the report of the board or the officers themselves, and the bill of purchase. Amongst the supplies sent by General Fremont to the army now in the field may be enumerated 500 half barrels, to carry water in a country of abundant supply, and 500 tons of ice.
We examined the barracks in course of construction in Saint Louis, near and around the private house occupied by him as quarters, the Brant House, rented at $6,000 per annum. These barracks have brick foundations and brick outer walls, weather-boarded, and are sufficient as quarters and stables for 1,000 men. Like those of Camp Benton, these barracks were not built by -contract or proposals. They are certainly more expensive and more permanent than the quarters a temporary army would require, and the exact expense, though perhaps difficult to ascertain, should be discovered.
A pontoon bridge has been thrown across the Ohio River at Paducah. A ferry boat, in a region where such boats are readily procured, would be just as efficient and much less expensive.
Contracts, it will be seen, were given to individuals without resorting to advertisements for bids, as required by law and regulations. Having received an intimation from another quarter of an impropriety, I called on Captain McKeever, assistant adjutant-general^ for the facts, which he gave me as follows: One week after the receipt of the President’s order modifying General Fremont’s proclamation relative to emancipation of slaves, General Fremont, by note to Captain McKeever, required him to have 200 copies of the original proclamation and address to the army, of same date, printed and sent immediately to Ironton, for the use of Major Gavitt, Indiana Cavalry, for distribution through the country. Captain McKeever had the copies printed and delivered. The order is as follows:
Adjutant-general will have 200 copies of proclamation of commanding general, dated 30th August, together with address to the army of same date, sent immediately to Ironton, for the use of Major Gavitt, Indiana Cavalry. Major Gavitt will distribute it through the country.
J. C. F.,
Commanding General.
September 23, 1861.
We left Saint Louis October 12 for General Fremont’s headquarters at Tipton, 160 miles distant, passing the night at Jefferson City, the capital of Missouri, 125 miles from Saint Louis. General Price was in command of the place, with a force of 1,200 men. The Eighth Iowa was there, en route for Tipton. At this place there were accumulated a large quantity of forage landed from steamboats, and some wagons and mules, for transportation; also the half barrels for carrying water, and a number of mules, which Captain Turnley said he could not get forward, having no control over the transportation by railroad.
Leaving Jefferson City on the 13th, we arrived at Tipton at 9 o’clock a. m. The Secretary of War was called upon by General Fremont, and, upon the general’s invitation, accompanied him to Syracuse, 5 miles distant, to review the division under General McKinstry, nearly 8,000 strong. This body of troops is said to be the best equipped and best supplied of the whole army. They certainly are, so far as means of transportation are concerned. At Tipton, besides General Fremont and staff, his body guard, Ac., I found a part of General Hunter’s First

Division and General Asboth’s Fourth Division. The force designed to act against Price consists of five divisions, as follows:
First Division, Hunter’s, at Tipton................................... 9,750
Second Division, Pope’s, at Georgetown................................ 9,220
Third Division, Sigel’s, at Sedalia................-.................. 7,980
Fifth Division, Asboth’s, at Tipton................................... 6,451
Sixth Division, McKinstry’s, at Syracuse.............................. 5,388
Total.............................................................. 38,789
As soon as I obtained a view of the several encampments at Tipton, I expressed the opinion that the forces there assembled could not be moved, as scarcely any means of transportation were visible. I saw General Hunter, second in command, and conversed freely with him. He stated that there was great confusion, and that Fremont was utterly incompetent; that his own division was greatly scattered, and the force then present defective in many respects; that he required 100 wagons, yet he was ordered to march that day, and some of his troops were already drawn out on the road. His cavalry regiment (Ellis’) had horses, arms (indifferent), but no equipments; had to carry their cartridges in their pocketsconsequently, on their first day’s march from Jefferson City, in a heavy rain, the cartridges carried about their persons were destroyed. This march to Tipton (35 miles) was made on a miry, heavy earth road parallel to the railroad, and but a little distance from it. The troops were directed by General Fremont to march without provisions, knapsacks, and without transportation. A violent rain storm came up, and the troops were exposed to it all nig;ht, were without food for twenty-four hours, and when food was received the beef was found to be spoiled.
General Hunter stated that he had just received a written report from one of his colonels, informing him that but 20 out of 100 of his guns would go off. These were the guns procured by General Fremont in Europe. I may here state that General Sherman, at Louisville, made a similar complaint of the great inferiority of these European arms. He had given the men orders to file down the nipples. In conversation with Colonel Swords, assistant quartermaster-general, at Louisville,just from California, he stated that Mr. Selover, who was in Europe with General Fremont, wrote to some friend in San Francisco that his share of the profit of the purchase of these arms was $30,000.
When General Hunter, at Jefferson City, received orders to march to Tipton, he was directed to take 41 wagons with him, when he had only 40 mules, which fact had been duly reported to headquarters. At this time Colonel Stevenson’s Seventh Missouri Regiment was, without General Hunter’s knowledge, taken from him, leaving him, when under marching orders, with only one regiment at Jefferson City fit to take the field (see paper No. 9#). General Hunter showed ine the order for marching, dated October 10, which he only received the 12th (see paper No. 10).f (See Hunter’s reply, showing the great wants of his command, marked No. 11).$ The same day the order was changed to one day’s march (see paper No. 12). §
When General Pope, at Georgetown, 25 miles distant, received this order of march, he wrote a private letter to Hunter, which I read. It set forth the utter impossibility of his moving for the want of supplies and transportation, and asked whether General Fremont could mean what he said.
* See Hunter to Eaton, October 4, p. 519. i See Hunter to Eaton, October 12, p. 531. t See Circular, October 11, p. 530.	§ See Eaton to Hunter, October 12, p. 531.

All of the foregoing goes to show the want of military foresight and soldierly judgment on the part of General Fremont in directing the necessary means for putting and maintaining in the field the forces under his command.
General Hunter stated that, though second in command, he never was consulted by General Fr6mont, and knew nothing whatever of his intentions. Such a parallel, I venture to assert, cannot be found in the annals of military warfare. I have also been informed that there is not a Missourian on his staff, not a man acquainted personally with the topography and physical characteristics of the country or its people.
The failure of General Fr6mont to re-enforce General Lyon demands a brief notice. General Fremont arrived at Saint Louis July 26, called thitlier from New York by telegraph stating that General Lyon was threatened by 30,000 rebels. At this time General Pope had nine regiments in North Missouri, where the rebels had no embodied force, the Confederate forces in the State being those under Price and McCulloch, near Springfield, Southwest Missouri, and those under Pillow, Jeff. Thompson, and Hardee, in Southeast Missouri. Two regiments held Eolla, the terminus of the Southwestern Branch of the Pacific Railroad, whilst Jefferson City, Booneville, Lexington, and Kansas City had each a garrison of 300 or 400 men, behind entrenchments. Cairo and Bird’s Point were fortified and defended with heavy artillery. (Pilot Knob and Cape Girardeau were fortified after General FremonUs arrival.) All these places could be re-enforced by railroad and river from Saint Louis and the Northwestern States, and could hold out until re-enforced, even if attacked by superior forces.
On his arrival in Saint Louis, General Fremont was met by Captain Cavender, First Missouri, and Major Farrar, aide-de-camp to General Lyon, with statements from the latter, and asking for re-enforcements. Major Phelps, M. C. from Springfield, Hr. Miller, of Omaha, and many other citizens, having ample means of information, made the same representations, and urged the sending of re-enforcements. To Governor Gamble he said, u General Lyon is as strong as any other officer on this line.77 He failed to strengthen Lyon, and the result, as is well known, was the defeat of that most gallant officer. The two regiments at Rolla should have been pushed forward, and the whole of Pope’s nine regiments brought by rail to Saint Louis and Rolla, and thence sent to Lyon7s force. Any other general, in such an emergency, would have pursued this obvious course.
The battle of Springfield (or, more strictly, Wilson7s Creek)—one of the most desperate ever fought on this continent—took place August 10, when the brave Lyon fell, and the troops, borne down by greatly superior numbers, were obliged to fall back, but unpursued by a badly beaten foe.
General Fremont called four regiments from North Missouri, and went with them to Cairo. It is evident* he had no intention of re-enforcing General Lyon, for the two regiments at Rolla, 125 miles only from Spring-field, received no orders to march, and were not supplied with transportation, and 30 or 40 hired wagons, just returned from Springfield, were discharged at Rolla August 4, seven days before the battle, and returned to Saint Louis.
After the news of the battle reached Saint Louis four other regiments were drawn from Pope in North Missouri and sent to Rolla. Better to have called in these troops before the battle, as after the battle the whole revolutionary elements were called forth. The six regiments accomplished nothing, and were not ordered to advance and cover the 35 r r—VOL III

retreat of Lyon’s army, although it was supposed in Saint Louis that Price and McCulloch were following it, and that Hardee had moved up to cut off its retreat on the Gasconade.
An advance of these regiments would have enabled the army to retrace its steps and to beat the forces of Price and McCulloch so badly, that they would have been unable to follow our forces in their retreat. It is said that every officer in Lyon’s army expected to meet re-enforcements, and to return with them, and drive Price and McCulloch from the southwest.
General Hunter arrived at Saint Louis from Chicago, called thither on a suggestion from Washington, as an adviser. .General Fr6mont submitted to him, for consideration and advice, a paper called “Disposition for retaking Springfield (See Exhibit No. 13, C). It sets out with a statement that Springfield is the strong strategical point of that wide elevation which separates the waters of the Osage from those of the Arkansas, the key to the whole of Southwestern Missouri, commanding an area of nearly 60,000 miles. Why did not this enter the brain of the major-general before the fall of Lyon, and he strain every nerve to hold that important key when in his possession
General Hunter, in answer to the paper, replied, “ Why march on Springfield, where there is no enemy and nothing to take. Let me take the troops and proceed to Lexington,” in which direction Price was marching, and where he expected to be joined by 40,000 rebels. Instead of this, he was sent to Eolla, without instructions, and remained there until ordered to Jefferson City, still without instructions, and thence to Tipton, where we found him.
No steps having been taken by General Fremont to meet Price in the field, he moved forward his line of march, plainly indicating his intention of proceeding to Lexington. When within some 35 miles of the place he remained ten or more days, evidently expecting that some movement would be made against him. None being made, he advanced, and with his much superior force laid siege to Lexington, defended by Mulligan, with 2,700 men, September 12, and captured it the 21st, nine days thereafter.
Now for the facts to show that this catastrophe could have been prevented, and Price’s army destroyed before or after that disastrous affair.
Before Price got to Lexington the forces to resist him were as follows: Jefferson City, 5,500 ; at Eolla, 4,000; along the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Eailroad, about 5,000; western line of Missouri, under Lane, down near Fort Scott, 2,300 ; Mulligan’s force at Lexington, 2,700; a large force in Illinois, along the Mississippi Eiver, and on the Iowa line; outside of Saint Louis, some 17,000; in Saint Louis, 18,000, but say 10,000.
Hunter’s plan, up to Sunday, September 22, was to concentrate from Saint Louis, Jefferson City, and Eolla, also from the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Eailroad, 20,000 men, and relieve Mulligan. He said that if Price was a soldier Lexington had then fallen, but he could with energy be captured, with all his baggage and plunder. The objection that there was no transportation is idle. The railroads and river were at command, and the march from Sedalia was only 45 miles. The force could, General Hunter supposed, be thrown into Lexington by Thursday, as it appears, before it was taken.
General Fremont ordered Sturgis, in North Missouri, to Lexington, and by crossing the river to re-enforce Mulligan. Sturgis had only 1,100 men, and oil reaching the river opposite the town found it com-

manded by Price, and of course was compelled to fall back. Hunter’s plan of moving these troops was to strike the river at a point below Lexington in our control, cross, and march up to the place. In the interview with General Fremont the question was asked whether any orders had been given to re-enforce Mulligan, and the reply being in the negative, General Hunter suggested orders to Sturgis; and had the order then been given by telegraph he would have reached the river before Price had taken possession of the north bank and could have crossed. The order was not given until three days after the interview. This loss of time was fatal.
Mulligan was ordered from Jefferson City, then garrisoned with 5,000 troops, with only one regiment to hold Lexington until he could be relieved. When Lexington fell, Price had 20,000 men, his force receiving daily augmentations from the disaffected in the State. He was permitted to gather much plunder and fall back towards* Arkansas unmolested until we were at Tipton, the 13th October, when the accounts were that he was crossing the Osage. Fr6mont?s order of march was issued to an army of nearly 10,000, many of the regiments badly equipped, with inadequate supplies of ammunition, clothing, and transportation. With what prospect, it must be inquired, can General Fremont, under such circumstances, expect to overtake a retreating army, some 100 miles ahead, with a deep river between ?
General Hunter expressed to the Secretary of War his decided opinion that General Fremont was incompetent and unfit for his extensive and important command. This opinion he gave reluctantly, owing to his position as second in command.
The opinion entertained by gentlemen who have approached and observed him is that he is more fond of the pomp than of the stem realities of war; that his mind is incapable of fixed attention or strong concentration; that by his mismanagement of affairs since his arrival in Missouri the State has almost been lost, and that if he is continued in command, the worst results may be anticipated. This is the concurrent testimony of a very large number of the most intelligent men in Missouri.
Leaving Tipton on the 13th, we arrived at Saint Louis late in the evening, and on the 14th the Secretary of War directed me to issue the following instructions to General Fremont.*
Instructions were previously given (October 12) to the Hon. James Craig to raise a regiment at Saint Joseph, Mo.
We left Saint Louis October 14, and arrived at Indianapolis in the evening. Eemained at Indianapolis October 15, and conversed freely with Governor Morton. We found that the State of Indiana had come nobly up to the work of suppressing the rebellion. Fifty-five regiments, with several batteries of artillery, had been raised and equipped; a larger number of troops in proportion to population than any other State had sent into the field. The best spirit prevailed, and it was manifest that additional troops could readily be raised. The governor had established an arsenal, and furnished all the Indiana troops with full supplies of ammunition, including fixed ammunition for their batteries of artillery. This arsenal was visited, and found to be in full operation. It was under the charge of a competent pyrotechnist. Quite a number of females were employed in making cartridges, and I venture to assert that the ammunition is equal to that which is manufactured anywhere else. Governor Morton stated that his funds for this purpose were exhausted, but the Secretary desired him to continue his operations, informing him

﻿548	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
that the Government would pay for what had been furnished to the troops in the field. It is suggested that an officer of ordnance be sent to Indianapolis to inspect the arsenal and ascertain the amount expended in the manufacture of ammunition, with a view to reimbursing the State.
Left Indianapolis October 16 for Louisville, Ky., where we arrived at 12.30 o’clock p. m., and had an interview with General Sherman, commanding the Department of the Cumberland. He gave a gloomy picture of affairs in Kentucky, stating that the young men were generally secessionists and had joined the Confederates, while the Union men, the aged and conservatives, would not enroll themselves to engage in conflict with their relations on the other side. But few regiments could be raised. He said that Buckner was in advance of Green Biver, with a heavy force, on the road to Louisville, and an attack might be daily expected, which, with his then force, he would not be able to resist, but that he would fight them. He as well as citizens of the State said that the border States of Kentucky must furnish the troops to drive the rebels from the State. His force then consisted of 10,000 troops, in advance of Louisville, in camp at Nolin Biver, and on the Louisville and Nashville Bailroad at various points; at Camp Dick Bobinson, or acting in conjunction with General Thomas, 9,000; and two regiments at Henderson, on the Ohio, at the mouth of Green Biver. (See paper No. 14) D. On being asked the question what force he, deemed necessary, he promptly replied 200,000 men. This conversation occurred in the presence of Mr. Guthrie and General Wood. The Secretary replied that he supposed that the Kentuckians would not in any number take up arms to operate against the rebels, but he thought General Sherman* overestimated the number and power of the rebel forces; that the Government would furnish troops to Kentucky to accomplish the work; that he (the Secretary) was tired of this defensive war, and that the troops must assume the offensive and carry the war to the fire sides of the enenjy; that the season for operations in Western Virginia was about over, and that he would take the troops from there and send them to Kentucky; but he begged of General Sherman to assume the offensive and to keep the rebels hereafter on the defensive. The Secretary desired that the Cumberland Ford and Gap should be seized, and the East Tennessee and Virginia Bailroad taken possession of, and the artery that supplied the rebellion cut.
Complaint was made of the want of arms, and on the question being asked, “What became of the arms we sent to Kentucky?” we were informed by General Sherman that they had passed into the hands of the Home Guards, and could not be recovered; that many were already in the hands of the rebels, and others refused to surrender those in their possession, alleging the desire to use them in defense of their individual homes if invaded. In the hands of individuals and scattered over the State these arms are lost to the army in Kentucky. Having ascertained that 6,200 arms had arrived from Europe at Philadelphia, 3,000 were ordered to Governor Morton, who promised to place them immediately in the hands of troops for Kentucky; the remaining 3,200 were sent to General Sherman at Louisville. Negley’s brigade, at Pittsburgh, 2,800 strong, two companies of the Nineteenth Infantry from Indianapolis, the Eighth Wisconsin' at Saint Louis, the Second Begiment of Minnesota Volunteers, at Pittsburgh, and two regiments from Wisconsin were then ordered to Kentucky, making in all a re-enforcement of about 10,000 men.
We left Louisville at 3 o’clock p. m. for Lexington, accompanied by General Sherman and Mr. Guthrie, remained there a few hours, and

proceeded to Cincinnati ; arriving at 8 o’clock p. m. At Lexington also we found, that the opinion existed that the young men of Kentucky had joined the rebels 5 that no large bodies of troops could be raised in Kentucky, and that the defense of the State must necessarily devolve upon the free States of the West and Northwest.
Having accomplished the object of our visit to the West, we left Cincinnati on the 18th and reached Washington on the 21st, having spent the 19th and 20th at Harrisburg.
Bespectfully submitted.

[Enclosure A.]
Quartermaster’s Office, Saint Louis, Mo., October 11, 1861.
General : I take the occasion of the presence of the honorable Sec* retary of War and yourself to make certain inquiries.
Is it competent for every member of the staff of Maj. Gen. John 0. Fremont to issue orders in the name of the general, directed to me, and involving an expenditure of money ?
Am I bound to recognize any other signature than that of Captain McKeever, the regularly-constituted assistant adjutant-general of the Western Department ?
I desire to be instructed whether the simple approval of an account by the commanding general carries with it the weight of an order.
There are heavy accounts, involving hundreds of thousands of dollars, that have come under my observation, which are approved by Maj. Gen. John 0. Fr6mont, but in direct terms are not ordered. It is doubtless the intention of the general to order the payment. But as I understand the Army Begulations and the laws of Congress, an approval is not an order. If I am mistaken in this, I desire to be corrected.
Great latitude is taken in verbal orders. And the general being in the field, I cannot stop to question the authenticity of these orders, and feel it to be my duty to see them executed, although I have not the authority on paper necessary to carry these expenditures through the Treasury.
Accounts involving hundreds of thousands .of dollars have been presented to me within the few days I have been here, informal, irregular, and not authorized by law or regulations.
No quartermaster who understands his duty can pay this class of accounts without involving himself in irretrievable ruin. I do not mean to say that these accounts are not just or should not be paid ; but as they are outside of the regulations—in other words, extraordinary—they can be adjusted only by extraordinary authority.
Some three days ago I telegraphed the Quartermaster-General, M. C. Meigs, a message; and I give you an extract from memory: u If the reckless expenditures in this department are not arrested by a stronger arm than mine, the Quartermaster’s Department will be wrecked in Missouri alone.”
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BOBT. ALLEN,
Major and Quartermaster.
General L. Thomas, Adjutant-General U. S. Army.

Jefferson City, Mo., October 11,1861.
General: In June, 1855,1 left Saint Louis with seven steamboats, with stores and troops for the Upper Missouri River. I remained there on duty until 1857. I joined General Johnston and went to Utah. I returned from Utah last winter, on the first and only leave of absence I have had in twelve years. While on my way to Washington, in April, I stopped at Harrisburg; and, at the request of Governor Curtin, I remained there to assist in organizing the troops there assembling into camps and to put their commissariat into order. From there I was on duty constantly, day and night, at various posts—York, Cock.eysville, Baltimore, Perry ville, and Annapolis. Finally, about the 20th of July, I was ordered to report to General Fremont. I did so at Yew York. I was ordered tin duty at Saint Louis, where I resumed similar labors to. those I had been at in the East, and have been on my feet night and day since. A few days ago I received orders to report at this place for duty in the field.
I left all my public accounts open, in an incomplete and exposed condition, on my office table in Saint Louis, besides a vast deal of property not turned over. My health is so broken down that I am not able longer to stand up. I desire, as an act of simple justice to me, I be allowed to resume the leave of absence I surrendered in April (it would have expired 15th June), or else that I be ordered permanently to a post where I can get some rest, and be able to make up and forward to the Treasury Department my public accounts.
Your early reply to this is respectfully requested.

Jefferson City, October 13,1861.
General : On the 25th September ultimo I opened the bids, in my office at Saint Louis, made under General Meigs* advertisement for furnishing grain and hay. I made contracts in accordance therewith, and gave a notice to contractors of the amount I supposed would be required weekly. A day or two after, another party (a Mr. Baird or Baird & Palmer) in Saint Louis informed me they had received an order (per telegraph) from Colonel Woods or General McKinstry, then at Jefferson City with headquarters, to forward as fast as possible to Jefferson City 100,000 bushels of oats and a like or corresponding amount of hay. The contractors under advertisement objected to this order, because they said Baird got 33 cents for grain and $19 per ton for hay, while contractors got 28 cents for corn, 30 cents for oats, and $17.95 per ton for hay. I then told contractors they need not send any forage up the river 5 or, if they did, they would be paid the same as Baird was.
About 29th or 30th September, after the headquarters Western Department had left Saint Louis (I being left there highest in rank in my department, but no orders or instructions except the single remark of General Fremont, that he wished no delay or obstacle whatever in the forwarding of supplies, &e.), I was daily and almost hourly called upon by different persons and asked to have their mules inspected.

stated they were turning in mules on Mr. HaskelPs account. I called for the contract or order under which Haskell furnished them, but never received any until I received a line from General McKinstry, quartermaster, stating that General Fremont desired me to inspect and receive Mr. HaskelPs mules as rapidly as possible. I received mules from Mr. Haskell only as they were required to ship off for field service. I received some from other parties in like manner.
I have good grounds for believing that in not receiving all Mr. HaskelPs mules I gave much offense to him and to his friends. But I believed then, and I do yet, that my action was for the best interest of the Government.

Disposition for retalcing Springfield.
Springfield, the strategical point of that wide elevation which separates the waters of the Osage from those of the Arkansas River, is the key to the whole southwestern part of Missouri, commanding an area of nearly 60,000 square miles.
Around it is clustered a true and loyal population, large numbers of whom, driven from their homes and fire-sides, and burning with a desire to revenge their sufferings and recapture their homesteads, are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to join an advancing army.
Sot only, therefore, military strategy, but a wise and humane policy, demands the reoccupation of that place.
To effect this in the shortest and speediest way, a combined movement of our troops should be made from Rolla and Jefferson City.
The column from the latter place, moving first, will cross, after two days’ marching, the Osage River at Tuscumbia. To prevent delay in crossing, anchors, ropes, pulleys, and other portable'necessaries for the construction of raft bridges should be taken along from Jefferson City.
Upon an appointed day after the passage of the river has been accomplished, the column from Rolla will commence its march, and that place and Tuscumbia being each about 10Q miles from Springfield, in six days the two forces will be able to unite at their destination.
As the lines of march converge upon their approach to Springfield, it will be practicable at Lebanon and Cross Plains (10 miles north of Buffalo) to open communication between the columns. Strong scouting parties will best effect this object, and each body will thus support and assist the other.
The Cole County Home Guards should occupy Tuscumbia. After the column from Jefferson City has passed that place, a reserve should be left at Linn Creek to cover the rear provision train, while Warsaw, the most important point on the Osage, should be immediately occupied by the Home Guards of Johnson, Pettis, and Benton County, re-enforced by a volunteer regiment and two pieces of artillery.
Rolla, Waynesville, and Lebanon can be occupied upon the withdrawal of the other troops by regiments of the United States Reserve Corps from Saint Louis, while Jefferson City can be placed in charge of an adequate force of General Sigel’s brigade, now under reorganization.
To co-operate with this combined movement, General Lane will be

directed to march from Fort Scott, in Kansas, to Springfield, by way of Lamar and Greenfield, re-enforced if possible.
The successful execution of this plan puts us in possession of the entire southwestern portion of this State, forces the enemy to retire into Arkansas, and enables us, immediately after the concentration at Spring-field, to assume the offensive against that State.
The exhausted condition of the country through which our troops are to pass renders necessary the most particular attention to the organization and protection of the provision trains; the commencement of cool weather demands additional clothing for the men, and the sad experience of the past warns us to make every necessary preparation to meet their wants.

localities and passing events, it is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment and discretion.
The main rebel army (Price’s) west of the Mississippi is believed to have passed Dade County in full retreat upon Northwestern Arkansas, leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy; excepting in the southeast of the State. Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desirable, as you are not likely to overtake Price, and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and re-enforcements, that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of observation, one occupying Sedalia and the other Rolla, the present termini of railroad; then recruit the condition of both corps by reestablishing and improving their discipline and instructions, perfecting their clothing and equipments, and providing less uncomfortable quarters. Of course both railroads must be guarded and kept open, judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this. From these two points, Sedalia and Rolla, and especially in judicious co-operation with Lane on the Kansas border, it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy returning on Missouri "from the southwest, that it is not probable any such attempt to return will be made before or during the approaching cold weather. Before spring the people of Missouri will probably be in no favorable mood to renew for next year the troubles which have so much afflicted and impoverished them during this. If you adopt this line of policy, and if, as I anticipate, you will see no enemy in great force approaching, you will have a surplus of force, which you can withdraw from these points and direct to others, as may be needed, the railroads furnishing ready means of re-enforcing their main points, if occasion requires. Doubtless local uprisings will for a time continue to occur, but these can be met by detachments and local forces of our own, and will ere long tire out of themselves.
While, as stated in the beginning of the letter, a large discretion must be and is left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of Price or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach Memphis will be exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole force engaged in it.

The road from Pomme de Terre Bridge to Quincy is rough, but generally pretty good. That from Quincy to Cornersville, excellent. Half a mile south of Quincy, on the right of tbe road, a division can encamp, but the water is rather scarce on that place.
The encampment here is very good, as the creek furnishes plenty of water, and as there is no want of forage.

If you should deem it necessary, I shall proceed towards Bolivar tomorrow afternoon or night.

Cairo, III., October 25, 1861. Capt. Chauncey McKeever, Saint Louis, Mo. :
I have the honor to report my return to this .command last evening. You have no doubt received the report of General McClernand as to the result of the flag of truce sent to Columbus during my absence. I have nothing new to add. My mission to Springfield was only partially successful. The governor has neither artillery nor small-arms at his disposal at present, but if my command (or this command) is not supplied when he does receive them, one company will be equipped with a battery of James’ rifled cannon. This cannot be done before the last of November. I think I will send the Second Iowa Regiment to Saint Louis immediately after muster, and hope you will replace them with all the troops disposable.

Cairo, III., October 25,1861. General C. F. Smith, Commanding Paducah, Ky. :
I am just informed by Mr. Casey, of Caseyville, Ky., a strong, unconditional Union man, that a regiment of cavalry is organizing at Princeton, Ky., for the Southern Confederacy. At last accounts they had about 500 men, well mounted, but not yet armed further than they have succeeded in pressing arms from the community around.
Princeton is 12 miles east from Eddyville, on the Cumberland River. The two places are connected by a good macadamized road. Mr. Casey says that the cavalry sent from Paducah by steamers, leaving there at dark, would reach Eddyville by about 12 o’clock at night, and of course make the balance of the march in from two to two and a half hours. I report this to you, so that you may, if you deem it prudent, take steps to secure these fellows. It has been one week since Mr. Casey has heard from these troops, but he does not doubt but they are still there.
U. 8. GRANT,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Cairo, III., October 27,1861. Capt. Chauncey McKeever, Saint Louis, Mo. :
The health of the Second Iowa Regiment is such that I have thought it both prudent and humane to send them to Saint Louis to recruit their health. Colonel Tuttle, the commander, is desirous of returning to this place as soon as it will be prudent to do so, and I have directed him to report to department headquarters when he thinks the health of his regiment sufficiently recovered. As the district is but weakly garrisoned, I would respectfully request that a regiment be sent here to replace the Second Iowa, and all the troops you can send will be gladly received.
Such drafts have been made upon the force at Columbus lately for the Green River country and possibly other parts of Kentucky, that if General Smith’s and my command were prepared it might now be taken. I am not prepared, however, for a forward movement. My cavalry are not armed nor my artillery equipped; the infantry is not well armed, and transportation is entirely inadequate to any forward movement.

Soldiers of the Mississippi Army:
Agreeably to orders this day received I take teave of you. Although our army has been of sudden growth, we have grown up together, and I have become familiar with the brave and generous spirit which you bring to the defense of your country, and which makes me anticipate for you a brilliant career. Continue as you have begun, and give to my successor the same cordial and enthusiastic support with which you have encouraged me. Emulate the splendid example which you have already before you, and let me remain, as I am, proud of the noble army which I had thus far labored to bring together.
Soldiers, I regret to leave you. Most sincerely I thank you for the regard and confidence you have invariably shown to me. I deeply regret that I shall not have the honor to lead you to the victory which you are just about to win, but I shall claim to share with you in the joy of every triumph, and trust always to be fraternally remembered by my companions in arms.

The General-in-Chief directs that you take at once the control of affairs in and around Saint Louis. Look to the safety of the arsenal. Take charge of the telegraph station. Act promptly under these orders till you receive instructions from General Hunter. Report frequently.

Special Orders, i Headquarters Second Division,
No. 10. j	Springfield, November 6, 1861.
The general commanding the division gladly avails himself of the opportunity to express to the officers and men of the Thirty-seventh Illinois Regiment his high appreciation of their prompt and soldierly response to the order for a forced march upon this place. Although they had been many days on the march, and were suffering fatigue and exposure, at the first call to face the enemy they forgot all their weariness, and for two successive days pushed forward to the scene of the expected action with a rapidity unusual amongst the oldest troops, and with an enthusiasm which promised that they would play a brilliant part in the engagement. Much as the general commanding the division regrets that their forced marches were unnecessary, he desires to assure the officers and men of the regiment that their soldierly conduct is not unmarked, and that he feels renewed confidence that when the time for action does come thev will play their part as becomes the State which sent them to the field.

Adjutant-General TJ. 8, Army, Washington, D. C.:
General : Inclosed you will find copies of certain negotiations carried on between Maj. Gen. J. C. Fremont, of the first part, and Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, of the second, having for objects, first, to make arrangements for the exchange of prisoners; second, to prevent arrests or forcible interference in future “ for the mere entertainment or expression of political opinions” 5 third, to insure that “the war now progressing shall be confined exclusively to armies in the field”; and, fourth, the immediate disbandment of “all bodies of armed men acting without the authority or recognition of the major-generals named and not legitimately connected with the armies in the field.”
You will also find inclosed [DJ a copy of my letter of this date, dispatched under a flag of truce to General Price, stating that “ I can in no manner recognize the agreement aforesaid or any of its provisions, whether implied or direct, and that I can neither issue nor allow to be issued the 1 joint proclamation’ purporting to have been signed by Generals Price and Fremont on the 1st day of November, A. D. 1861.”
It would be, in my judgment, impolitic in the highest degree to have ratified General Fremont’s negotiations, for the following, amongst many other, obvious reasons: The second stipulation, if acceded to, would render the enforcement of martial law in Missouri, or in any part of it, impossible, and would give absolute liberty to the propagandists of treason throughout the length and breadth of the State; the third stipulation, confining operations exclusively “ to armies in the field,” would practically annul the confiscation act passed during the last session of Congress, and would furnish perfect immunity to those disbanded sol-36 R r—VOL III

diers of Price’s command who have now returned to their homes, but with the intention and under a pledge of rejoining the‘rebel forces whenever called upon; and, lastly, because the fourth stipulation would blot out of existence the loyal men of the Missouri Home Guard, who have not, it is alleged, been recognized by act of Congress, and who, it would be claimed, are therefore “not legitimately connected with the armies in the field.”
There are many more objections quite as powerful and obvious which might be urged against ratifying this agreement; its address, “ To all peaceably-disposed citizens of the State of Missouri,” fairly allowing the inference to be drawn that citizens of the United States, the loyal and true men of Missouri, are not included within its benefits. In fact, the agreement would seem to me, if ratified, a concession of all the principles for which the rebel leaders are contending, and a practical liberation, for use in other and more immediately important localities, of all their forces now kept employed in this portion of the State.
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

The list, as submitted herewith, the pledge of Colonel Mulligan, as also the approval of General Fremont, and the names, have been sent to Saint Louis, to be carried into effect. I am directed by the general to say that he accepts your proposition for empowering Major Williams and Mr. Barclay to arrange terms of release of citizens arrested and now confined or released on parole and for future exchanges of prisoners, &c.

He now, as heretofore expressed, repeats his desire of avoiding the character of warfare to which you allude, and will agree to take in no more Home Guards, so called, but only such as are of the character of regular troops, enlisted for the war, and who will be subject to orders, and can be restrained from all marauding.

Whereas Maj. Gen.

John 0. Fremont, commanding the forces of the United States, to facilitate the future exchange of prisoners of war released'on parole; also that all persons heretofore arrested for the mbre expression of political opinions may be released from confinement or parole; also that in future the war be confined exclusively to the armies in the field, and has authorized and empowered Maj.

Whereas Maj. Gen. John C. Fremont concurs with Major-General Price:
Now, therefore, it is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between Maj. Gen. John 0. Fremont and Maj. Gen. Sterling Price as follows, to wit:

Therefore be it known to all whom it may concern:

II.	All peaceably-disposed citizens who may have been driven from their homes because of their political opinions, or who may have left thejn from fear of force and violence, are hereby advised and permitted to return, upon the faith of our positive assurances that while so returning they shall receive protection from both the armies in the field wherever it can be given.
III.	All bodies of armed men acting without the authority or recognition of the major-generals before named, and not legitimately connected with the armies in the field, are hereby ordered at once to disband.
IY. Any violation of either of the foregoing articles shall subject the offender to the penalty of military law, according to the nature of the offense.
In testimony whereof the aforesaid Maj. Gen. John Charles Fremont, at Springfield, Mo., on this 1st day of November, A. D. 1861, and Maj. Gen.

Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, D. <7., November 11, 1861. Maj. Gen. H. W. Halleck, U.S. A.,
Commanding Department of Missouri:
General : In assigning you to the command of the Department of the Missouri, it is probably unnecessary for me to state that I have intrusted to you a duty which requires the utmost tact and decision. You have not merely the ordinary duties of a military commander to perform, but the far more difficult task of reducing chaos to order, of changing probably the majority of the personnel of the staff of the department, and of reducing to a point of economy, consistent with the interests and necessities of the State, a system of reckless expenditure and fraud, perhaps unheard-of before in the history of the world.
You will find in your department many general and staff officers holding illegal commissions and appointments not recognized or approved by the President or Secretary of War. You will please at once inform these gentlemen of the nullity of their appointment, and see that no pay or allowances are issued to them until such time as commissions may be authorized by the President or Secretary of War.
If any of them give the slightest trouble you will at once arrest them and send them, under guard, out ot the limits of your department, informing them that if they return they will be placed in close confinement. You will please examine into the legality of the organization of the troops serving in the department. When you find any illegal, unusual, or improper organizations you will give to the officers and men an opportunity to enter the legal military establishment under general laws and orders from the War Department, reporting in full to these headquarters any officer or organization that may decline.
You will please cause competent and reliable staff officers to examine all existing contracts immediately, and suspend all payments upon them until you receive the report in each case. Where there is the slightest doubt as to the propriety of the contract, you will be good enough to refer the matter with full explanation to these headquarters, stating in each case what would be a fair compensation for the services or materials rendered under the contract. Discontinue at once the reception of material or services under any doubtful contract. Arrest and bring to prompt trial all officers who have in any way violated their duty to the Government. In regard to the political conduct of affairs, you will please labor to impress upon the inhabitants of Missouri and the adjacent States that we are fighting solely for the integrity of the Union, to uphold the power of our National Government, and to restore to the nation the blessings of peace and good order.
With respect to military operations, it is probable, from the best information in my possession, that the interests of the Government will be best served by fortifying and holding in considerable strength Rolla, Sedalia, and other interior points, keeping strong patrols constantly moving from the terminal stations, and concentrating the mass of the troops on or near the Mississippi, prepared for such ulterior operations as the public interests may demand.
I would be glad to have you make as soon as possible a personal inspection of all the important points in your department, and report the result to me. I cannot too strongly impress upon you the absolute necessity of keeping me constantly advised of the strength, condition, and location of your troops, together with all facts that will enable me to maintain that general direction of the armies of the United States which

In conformity with a telegraphic dispatch from Major-General McClellan, received yesterday, asking a full number of my command, their condition, wants, position, &c., I have directed a full monthly report made out to be sent to your office. Owing to the activity with which troops under my command have been kept moving since the first of the month, full reports are not yet in. My command extends to Cape Girardeau, Mo., and includes the following posts:
Cape Girardeau, Mo., garrisoned with three regiments of infantry, one company light artillery, one engineer company, one company mounted Home Guards, and one siege company—both the latter anxious to be mustered into the service of the United States. The post commanded by Col. J. B. Plummer, Eleventh Missouri Volunteers.
Bird’s Point, Mo., garrisoned with six regiments of infantry, two companies light artillery, one engineer company, and eleven companies of cavalry. One company of artillery have just received their pieces, but have not yet been supplied with horses or harness. Four companies of the cavalry arrived yesterday.
Fort Holt, Ky., garrisoned with two regiments of infantry, one company each of cavalry and light artillery, the artillery with but four pieces (two of them taken at Belmont) and neither horses nor harness. I was very much opposed to occupying Fort Holt at the beginning, but now a great deal of labor has been expended in fortifying and strengthening the position, and the troops there have partially built huts for winter accommodation.
Mound City, garrisoned with one regiment of infantry.
Cairo, with six regiments of infantry, one company light artillery, and nine companies of cavalry; one regiment of infantry and all the cavalry but one company without arms.
My whole command numbers less than 18,000, of which about 2,200 are sick. But for the measles, however, the health of the command would be comparatively good. We are deficient in land transporta*

tion, arms, and clothing. The latter two are deficient both in quantity and quality. This post has been carried on so long without funds in the quartermaster’s department, that nothing can be procured at current cash rates, and not at all except with difficulty. I would urge the necessity of sending a supply of funds for the use of this post soon. I think also that the interest of the service demands that a regular quartermaster be sent here.
I have under my command two gunboats, one of which remains at Mound City, to guard the new boats being built there, the other here.
I shall hope to have ready by to-morrow a monthly report, showing the ex£et condition of my whole command, and accompanied by reports of the various departments.

I regret this, as one of the most exposed posts in the Army at this time, and would much prefer that the number sent South should be made as limited as possible or be sent by some other route. Although I shall accommodate, whenever it seems to me consistent with the interest of the public service, I shall in future exercise my own judgment about passing persons through my lines, unless the authority comes from a senior, and one who exercises a command over me.

Inclosed herewith I send you a letter just received from Cape Girardeau, which fully explains itself* I have also been called upon to-day by a lady from Bloomfield, who states that the Union people of that district are not only depredated upon, but their lives are constantly in danger. Many have already been murdered for entertaining Union sentiments, and people of this class are not permitted to leave on pain of death. She urges in behalf of the Union people that troops be sent there either to garrison the place permanently or for a stated period, giving the citizens notice of the length of time they, intend remaining, so that they might take advantage of their protection to get away.
Bloomfield is geographically a commanding position, and if troops could be spared, I would earnestly recommend the occupation of it.

Major: Authentic intelligence has reached me that a camp of 500 rebels, mounted, and with one piece of artillery, has been formed near the town of Jonesborough, about 35 miles from this place. You are accordingly instructed to proceed by forced march to-night, so as to surprise their camp by to-morrow morning at daybreak, with five companies of your regiment and a section of horse artillery. You will march from this place at 6 o’clock this afternoon, taking all pnecautions to avoid having your movements made known, and will be careful to throw forward an advance guard and flankers to prevent a surprise.
Should you arrive near Jonesborough before daylight, you will not make an attack until it is light enough to see clearly, that no mistake or confusion arise among your own command. When you have ascertained exactly the position of the enemy’s camp, you will endeavor to make such disposition of your force as to cut off his retreat. Attack vigorously and promptly, and pursue until the rebel force is completely dispersed. Two days’ rations (cooked) will be taken with your command, but no tents nor baggage of any description.
Having executed this duty thoroughly, you will return with all speed to this place.
I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hon. R. W. Johnson :
Dear Johnson : It is absolute certainty that the enemy’s Government will not permit the Indian country west of us to belong to the Confederate States without a severe struggle. I foresaw some time ago that the regular troops would be withdrawn, as too much needed elsewhere to be left there inactive, and that they would be replaced by volunteers, under men actuated by personal hatred of the South. I do not think that more than five or six thousand men will be sent there for a time, but those, I am satisfied, will be there soon.
To occupy that country with safety we ought to have at least an equal force, if we first occupy it, and shall need a much larger one if they establish themselves in it during an inaction. It will hardly be safe to count upon putting in the field more than 3,500 Indians; maybe we may get 5,000. To procure any, or at least any respectable number, we must guarantee them their lands, annuities, and other rights under treaties, furnish them arms, (rifles and revolvers, if the latter can be had), advance them some $25 a head in cash, and send a respectable force there, as evidence that they will be efficiently seconded by us.
I wrote Mr. Toombs that we ought to have three regiments from Arkansas, or Arkansas and Texas, and must have two or three batteries of artillery. Now I am entirely convinced that we ought to have at least five regiments, two of cavalry and three of infantry. When a little while in service we could not calculate on each regiment affording for duty more than 60 men to a company, or 600 to the regiment. Yol-

unteers are more weakened by sickness than regulars, owing to their inexperience and want of seasoning.
We ought to have four batteries of 6-pounders, six guns each, for field service. We can be furnished two of these batteries, perhaps, or twelve guns, here. The Confederate Government should forward us two batteries more, and we shall need also some heavier guns, 18-pounders, say, on carriages, and ammunition, for the posts to be established, and half a dozen howitzers for casting shells. In addition, we shall have to create a reserve, to be stationed in the State, near the northwestern frontier, of three regiments more, to be called into service by the Confederate Government at a moment’s warning.
I am informed by Lieutenant Pearce that all the force needed can be procured in the march West when it reaches the line. Commissary stores to supply them for a limited time would have to be forwarded to this point. You know our condition. We can get from the State, for the purpose of putting the force in the field, a hundred thousand dollars. I think and believe all the rest, except that and the men, must be furnished. We have almost literally no arms. If possible, our regiments ought to be well armed. I fear that, the supx>ly of revolvers being limited, it may not be in the power of the Government to supply them to all the cavalry. If they cannot be furnished, there had better be but one regiment of cavalry.
The arms for the Indians should be forwarded as soon as possible, to be placed in depot on the frontier, and there distributed to organized bodies. Of course ammunition must come with the arms. The river is in tplerable stage now, and if speed is made we may use it to convey everything to the frontier, at Fort Smith or Ozark, and there obtain wagons and mules for transportation.
My plan, if I were put in command, would be to proceed instantly to raise the regiments, rendezvousing them at this point and in Washington or Benton Counties. I should, with as little delay as possible, proceed to the frontier and get the troops in hand, and as soon as we were in sufficient force occupy old Fort Wayne, or a point near it, and also a proper point near the junction of the Arkansas and Grand Fivers, where the great Missouri and Texas road crosses the former. At these points field works ought to be thrown up, so that a part of our force could neutralize or be equal to double their number of any enemy. With our Western frontier for our base of operations, open communications south of the Arkansas with Fort Smith, those communications being properly guarded, and with the power to operate from Fort Wayne on the flank of any force marching south between our frontier and the Neosho Fiver, and to cut its line of communication, we ought not to lose the country. Of course we would need a competent engineer officer and a competent artillery officer. For the latter I hope the Secretary of War will select Oapt. James Totten, lately stationed here, and who desires to serve the Confederate States. If he is placed in command of our artillery force, with the rank of major, we shall soon see it efficient. We must also have several regular officers to command the bodies of Indians enlisted. Among these I hope Captain McIntosh, late of the U. S. Army and now in Georgia, will be included. He desires to go into the service in the Indian country, and 1 should, if I were to command here, much desire to have him.
I have no right to anticipate that the Confederate Government will confer so important a trust on me as the command of the department to be formed of the Indian country. I should not think of seeking it or any other appointment, and have already written Mr. Toombs that I

should prefer the selection of a regular officer of experience and rank. All I can say is, that if it should please the Government to employ me, I will do all and the best I can. If I am employed, I shall wish to indicate one gentleman, eminently qualified, for the appointment of surgeon. Please see to it, if the contingency occurs, that permission to do this be given me.
Arkansas can raise ten regiments. I can raise on shortest notice all that we will need on the frontier. I do not think the troops so raised or called for would be dissatisfied to be placed under my command; but of all this it is more fit you should speak than I. Above all, do not, out of regard for me, in any way embarrass President Davis or the Secretary of War, if other arrangements are thought of. I am nothing, and seek nothing to benefit myself.
Immediate action, speedy raising and arming and forwarding of troops to our frontier, is imperatively demanded. Not a day ought to be lost. I wish to Heaven we were there now. The moment you can say that I am or am not to be commissioned, telegraph me. Moments are worth lives now.
God bless you.
ALBERT PIKE.
War Department, 0. S. Army,
Montgomery, May 13, 1861. Major Douglas H. Cooper, Choctaw Nation:
Sir : The desire of this Government is to cultivate the most friendly relations and the closest alliance with the Choctaw Nation and all the Indian tribes west of Arkansas and south of Kansas. Appreciating your sympathies with these tribes, and their reciprocal regard for you, we have thought it advisable to enlist your services in the line of this desire. From information in possession of the Government it is deemed expedient to take measures to secure the protection of these tribes in their present country from the agrarian rapacity of the North, that, unless opposed, must soon drive them from their homes and supplant them in their possessions, as, indeed, would have been the case with the entire South but for our present efforts at resistance. It is well known that with these unjust designs against the Indian country the Northern movement for several years has had its emissaries scheming among the tribes for their ultimate destruction. Their destiny has thus become our own, and common with that of all the Southern States entering this Confederation.
Entertaining these views and feelings, and with these objects before us, we have commissioned General Ben. McCulloch, with three regiments under his command, from the States of Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana, to take charge of the military district embracing the Indian country, and I now empower you to raise among the Choctaws and Chickasaws a mounted regiment, to be commanded by yourself, in cooperation with General McCulloch. It is designed also to raise two other similar regiments among the Creeks, Cherokees, Seminoles, and other friendly tribes for the same purpose. This combined force of six regiments will be ample to secure the frontiers upon Kansas and the interests of the Indians, while to the south of the Red River three regiments from Texas, under a different command, have been already assigned to the Rio Grande and western border.
It will thus appear, I trust, that the resources of this Government are adequate to its ends, and assured to the friendly Indians, We have

our agents actively engaged in the manufacture of ammunition and in the purchase of arms, and when your regiment has been reported organized in ten companies, ranging from 64 to 100 men each, and enrolled for twelve months, if possible, it will be received into the Confederate service, and supplied with arms and ammunition. Such will be the course pursued also in relation to the two other regiments I have indicated.
The arms we are purchasing for the Indians are rifles, and they will be forwarded to Fort Smith.
Respectfully,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.
Adjutant and Inspector General’s Office,
Montgomery, May 13, 1861.
Brigadier-General McCulloch, Commanding, Montgomery, Ala.:
Sir : The following instructions are communicated by direction of the Secretary of War:
Having been appointed a brigadier-general of volunteers in the service of the Confederate States, you are assigned to the command of the district embracing the Indian Territory lying west of Arkansas and south of Kansas. Your field of operations will be to guard that Territory against invasion from Kansas or elsewhere. For this purpose there will be placed at your disposal three regiments of volunteers, viz: one regiment of mounted men from Texas, to serve for a term of eighteen months $ one of mounted men from Arkansas, to serve for during the war, and one regiment of foot from Louisiana, to serve for twelve months. These several regiments will be organized in conformity to the law relating to volunteer forces, and will rendezvous—that from Texas at Dallas, in that State, and the two others at Fort Smith, Ark.
Independently of this force, it is desirable to en'gage, if possible, the service of any of the Indian tribes occupying the Territory referred to in numbers equal to two regiments. This force, should you be able to obtain it, you are authorized to receive and organize as a part of your command, for such service as your judgment may determine. *
Such supplies of the ordnance, quartermaster’s, and commissary departments in Texas and Arkansas as are under the control of the War Department, and fco such extent as may be needed for your operations, will be subject to your orders.
Besides the duties above referred to, there are others which are deemed highly important, and which demand your earliest attention. It has been represented to the Department that there is at this time a large garrison of U. S. troops at Fort Washita. This force, consisting of six companies of cavalry and five companies of infantry, in all about 800 men, with a battery of field artillery, has been concentrated at Washita, preparatory to a movement thence in a northern direction through the Indian country into Kansas. It is desirable that these troops should be captured with the least practicable delay. You will therefore, in proceeding to Texas, take Arkansas in your route, and after satisfying yourself there of the position and numbers of these troops, organize such force as may be necessary in your opinion to take Fort Washita and capture its garrison, or should the troops have left there, to intercept them on their march. Captain McIntosh, of cavalry, has

been ordered to report to you at Little Rock for such duties as you may assign to him, and such other officers of the 0. S. Army as can be spared from their present duties will be ordered to report to you for similar service. The sum of $25,000 will be placed in your hands for disbursement in the service of your command, and for which you will account to the proper accounting officers of the Treasury Department.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General,
Little Rock, Ark., May 13,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis :
I have the honor to inform you that the convention of Arkansas has created me brigadier-general of Arkansas, to command the Western frontier. I most respectfully request that you inform me of your views, in order that I may carry them out as far as possible in placing that part of the State in the best practicable state of defense. My headquarters for the present will be in Benton County, at Osage Mills post-office, but will be wherever I think my presence most necessary.
We have no tactics in this State. Can you send us 500 copies of u Hardee’s Tactics ” l The Convention will probably order some printed, but we need them at once.
Any suggestions that you may lbe pleased to give me in relation to our frontier will be very acceptable. Capt. A. Pike and myself are anxious that some steps be taken at once to secure the co-operation of the Indians in the West, and especially to prevent any emissaries of the Republicans from poisoning the minds of the full-bloods. Many of the Cherokees are already abolitionists, but the half-breeds and enlightened part of the nation are true to the South in their sympathies.
I have the honor to remain, your most obedient servant,
N. BART.* PEARCE, Brigadier-General, Arkansas.

Montgomery, May A4,1861.
Hon. David Hubbard, Superintendent of Indian Affairs:
Sir : As superintendent of Indian affairs on behalf of this Government, originally appointed because of your well known sympathy for the Indian tribes and the deep concern you have ever manifested in their welfare, you are now specially charged to proceed to the Creek Nation, and make known to them, as well as to the rest of the tribes west of Arkansas and south of Kansas, of all of whom you are constituted the superintendent, and whose interests and feelings you will respect as if they were your children, the earnest desire of the Confederate States to defend and protect them against the rapacious and avaricious designs of their and our enemies at the North yet holding the Government at Washington. You will, in an especial manner, impress upon the Creek Nation and surrounding Indian tribes the imperious fact they will doubtless recognize, that the real design of the North and the Government at Washington in regard to them has been and still is the same-entertained and sought to be enforced against ourselves, and if suffered

to be consummated, will terminate in the emancipation of their slaves and the robbery of their lands. To these nefarious ends all the schemes of the North have tended for many years past, as the Indian nations and tribes well know from the character and conduct of those emissaries who have been in their midst, preaching up abolition sentiments under the disguise of the holy religion of Christ, and denouncing slaveholders as abandoned by God and unfit associates for humanity on earth.
You will be diligent to explain to them, under these circumstances, how their cause has become our cause, and themselves and ourselves stand inseparably associated in respect to national existence and property interests; and in view of this identification of cause and interests between them and ourselves, entailing a common destiny, give to them profound assurances that the Government of the Confederate States oI America, now powerfully constituted through an immense league of sovereign political societies, great forces in the field, and abundant resources, will assume all the expense and responsibility of protecting them against all adversaries, if they will manifest a disposition to cooperate with us in the general struggle occupying the people at the North and those at the South. To do this effectively they must call out their warriors and form them into military organizations, to be received into the service of this Government in the same manner that our present volunteer troops are received, and to be armed and paid accordingly.
Give them to understand, in this connection, that a brigadier-general of character and experience has been assigned to the military district embracing the Indian Territories south of Kansas, with three regiments under his command, while in Texas another military district has been formed under another distinguished and able commander, with three other regiments subject to his orders. With these six regiments from the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas it is desired that three mounted regiments of Indian warriors, in the service and pay of this Government, shall co-operate, thus constituting an irresistible force, capable of guaranteeing the safety of the Indian nations and tribes and the security of their property. Let them know that our agents are now actively employed in procuring rifles and providing ammunition to be immediately forwarded to Fort Smith, for the purpose of supplying these three regiments as soon as they shall have been organized, one of which will be raised among the Choctaws and Chickasaws, another*among the Oherokees, and the third from among the Creeks, Seminoles, and other friendly tribes entertaining the proposition.
In addition to these things, regarded of primary importance, you will, without committing the Government to any especial conduct, express our serious anxiety to establish and enforce the debts and annuities due to them from the Government at Washington, which otherwise they will never obtain, as that* Government would, undoubtedly, sooner rob them of their lands, emancipate their slaves, and utterly exterminate them, than render to them justice. Finally, communicate to them the abiding solicitude of the Confederate States of America to advance their condition in the direction of a proud political society, with a distinctive civilization, and holding lands in severalty under well-defined laws, by forming them into a Territorial government; but you will give no assurance of State organization and independence, as they still require the strong arm of protecting power, and may probably always need our fostering care; and, so far as the agents of the late"Government of the United States may be concerned, you will converse with 37 r R—vol in

War Department, 0. S. A.,
Montgomery, May 17,1861.
Hon. T. 0. Hindman, &c. ;
Sir : In relation to the arming of the regiment tendered by you to this Department and conditionally accepted, it is important the arms should be supplied by the State of Arkansas, not only because it is important to have these troops in the field at the earliest practicable moment for local purposes associated with Arkansas, but because of the heavy demand made upon the Confederate Government for arms by the border States and our very greatly extended lines of operation in every direction. It is apparent the War Department is called upon by the highest public considerations, and in view of the probabilities of a prolonged war, to dispense the arms in its possession only when it becomes absolutely necessary in connection with the most weighty movements.
Respectfully,
L. P. WALKER.
Marysville, Kans., May 20,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of Confederate States of America:
Sir : I addressed you on the 16th instant a brief communication in reference to the propriety and importance of taking possession of the forts and property of the United States Government in the Northwest, and now avail myself of an opportunity of going more fully into detail on the subject. I refer to all that portion of country west of the Mississippi River to the summit of the Rocky Mountains and south of the Platte River, in Nebraska, and northern line of Missouri to the northern line of Arkansas and Texas, almost all of which is rich in agricultural and mineral resources.
The population of Colorado Territory is about 40,000 persons, of whom 30,000 are capable of bearing arms. They are now much displeased and dissatisfied with the course of the Federal Government in removing the U. -S. troops from the Western frontier, whereby great dangers are apprehended from Indians and the serious interruption of their trade and commercial intercourse. One-third of the population sympathizes with your Government, independent of those who may be controlled by other influences, and one-fourth of them would take up arms in its behalf as soon as an opportunity is presented. There are some eight military posts within the district of country referred to, which, in consequence of the withdrawal of U. S. troops, have not more than a skeleton company in each. A large number of the soldiers would immediately enlist in the services of the Confederate States, and the officers are daily resigning to join the Southern Army. These posts are all well supplied with a large amount of commissary stores and munitions of war. The Cherokee and other Indian tribes on the southern border of Kansas are in-

telligent and quite civilized races, and owning, as they do, considerable slave property themselves, their interests and feelings are wholly with the South.
Within the boundaries of this great country are the States of Missouri and Kansas. The former, being surrounded on three sides by free States, although identified in sympathy and interest with the Southern Confederacy, scarcely dare make a move toward secession in the present state of affairs. Kansas is controlled by a majority of poor, worthless, starving abolitionists, who receive their support from donations of provisions from the Northern States, which are transported through Missouri and delivered to them on the banks of the Missouri River. There is still in Kansas a strong pro-slavery element, kept in subjection to this dominant party, that will gladly unite with any movement made by the Confederate States to throw off* the yoke, and will fly to arms at a moment’s warning. The question now presents itself whether all this valuable territory shall go with the North or the South. The answer depends upon the prompt action of your Government. Missouri cannot be secured to the South unless the country west of it is taken possession of and held by the Confederate States. With six regiments of cavalry from Arkansas and Texas and the forces that can be obtained from the Indian Territory, I can seize and hold Forts Laramie and Wise, and Fort Union, if necessary, and take possession of all military stores and munitions of war at the other forts in Kansas and Colorado, and will destroy what will be of no utility, establish headquarters near the Cheyenne Pass, and with the possession of Forts Laramie and Wise, cut off all communication between the Northern States and the Pacific coast ; and at the same time, acting in conjunction with Missouri, can seize Forts Leavenworth and Riley, and expel from Kansas the horde of Northern vandals that now infests it, opposed to your Government, and declare Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado a part of the Confederate States of America. Also seize the daily overland express mail to California, and appropriate it to the transportation of mail and express matter to and from the Southern States only. A majority of the owners of the capital stock of this company entertain warm Southern views, and would willingly acquiesce therein.
Hoping these suggestions will meet with your approbation, I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,
F. J. MARSHALL.
I have carefully read the foregoing, and heartily indorse the suggestions therein politically and in a military point of view.

Sir : I have the honor to make the following statement in reference to military matters in this State for your information:
Since my arrival here I have ascertained that although a large amount of arms and munitions of war was secured by the capture of the arsenal at this place, there is now but a small amount left. At the present time there are only 2,260 flint-lock muskets (new), 60 percussion muskets, and 160 Hall’s rifles. The ammunition tor small-arms consists of 250,000

## p. 580 (#594) ############################################

﻿580	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
musket ball-cartridges, 40,000 Colt’s pistol cartridges, 2,000 Sharp’s carbine cartridges, and 520,000 percussion caps, also 86 barrels of musket and 30 barrels of rifle powder. All the other arms and munitions of war seized here have been scattered over the State in every direction, without any method or accountability, and it is impossible to tell what has become of them. Very few arms suitable for cavalry service were found in the arsenal, and the regiment of mounted men you have authorized me to take from the State will be very destitute of arms suitable for the service. I would therefore respectfully call your attention to the necessity of at once forwarding to Fort Smith a sufficient supply of rifles or carbines, pistols and sabers, to equip a regiment of cavalry. Of course the necessary ammunition would be required at the same time.
As the river is now in fine navigable order, I would suggest the propriety of at once sending to Fort Smith a sufficient supply of rations for six months for the use of my brigade, deducting the amount I may be able to get here, and of which I will inform you by telegraph as soon as the Convention determines to turn it over to me. The navigation of the river is so uncertain, that an opportunity of sending supplies may not again occur for months. Flour can be purchased in the country and supplied by my own quartermaster. I would also call your attention to the fact that I have neither officers of the quartermaster’s nor commissary department, and as it is absolutely necessary for a successful campaign here to secure officers familiar with these duties, I would respectfully urge upon you the necessity of sending them at once. The officer of the subsistence department you determine to send should go directly to New Orleans, purchase supplies for my command, and bring them with him.
I have the honor to be, sir, vour obedient servant,
BEN. MCCULLOCH,

Hon. Egbert Toombs :
Sir : I shall go by steamboat to Fort Smith on the day after to-morrow, and thence immediately to the Cherokee country, where there is more danger of division and disaffection than anywhere else.
It is much to be regretted that arms to the number of 2,000 rifles are not here now on their way to our frontier. Permit me respectfully, but very urgently, to say that it is of vital importance they, or half the number at least, should be forwarded instantly, and the residue as soon as possible. They ought to be on the frontier now for distribution. It is also indispensable (and I use the word with the full knowledge of its meaning)—it is indispensable to have at least $25 in money for each Indian we enlist. That for 2,400 will be only $60,000, which ought to be sent out instantly. It would be better it should be $100,000.
Provisions, commissary stores of all kinds, except flour, will have to be sent on here, and medicines. There is but a limited supply of provisions here of those seized by the State, and it is very doubtful whether the State will not want all these for her own troops now on and going to the frontier. At all events, there will be none for the Indians. The river is falling and will soon be low. Then we will have to haul by wagons at least 200 miles, and much of the provisions 300. You can

plainly see that there is no time to be lost. Delay is denial in this ease, and denial is to insure disaster.
In addition to the regiments of Indians, I earnestly advise the organization of a battalion of about 3p() Delawares, Shawnees, and Kickapoos. I can raise them, and they will be invaluable. One of them will be at least worth any two other Indians. General McCulloch coincides with me in regard to this battalion, and agrees with me that its value can hardly be overestimated. There are no braver and better soldiers in the world, and for outposts and scouts no men are more than their equals.
I very much regret that I have not received distinct authority to give the Indians guarantees of all their legal and just rights under treaties. It cannot be expected they will join us without them, and it would be very-ungenerous, as well as unwise and useless, in me to ask them to do it. Why should they, if we will not bind ourselves to give them what they hazard in giving us their rights under treaties ?
As you have told me to act at my discretion, and as I am not directed not to give the guarantees, I shall give them, formal, full, and ample, by treaty, if the Indians will accept them and make treaties. General McCulloch will join me in this, and so, I hope and suppose, will Mr. Hubbard, and when we shall have done so we shall, I am sure, not look in vain to you, at least, to affirm these guarantees and insist they shall be carried out in good faith.
Once more I earnestly urge the immediate transmission of arms, money, and provisions.
It will be better for you to write to me at Fort Smith. I shall probably be in the Indian country two months, with not very frequent chances to receive letters.
Very respectfully and truly, yours,
ALBERT PIKE.

Little Boclc, Arh :
Colonel Churchill telegraphs that four companies are armed. If so, direct Captain McIntosh to muster them into service, and order them to proceed to Fort Smith, and as other companies are armed they will be mustered into service with like orders. We have no rifles.

Little Book, Ark., May 23,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.:
Sir : I have the honor to state that from the most reliable source I have ascertained that Colonel Emory marched with all the Federal forces in the Indian Nation to Fort Leavenworth. He started near the end of last month, and must have reached his destination before this. I was informed a day or two since that he had been heard of within two or three days’ march of Leavenworth. I have learned that the notorious General Lane is rapidly organizing a force in Kansas to march into the Territory. Montgomery is no doubt hovering near the border. I shall proceed direct to Fort Smith, and organize my force as rapidly as possible and put them at once in the field. I must again call your attention to the condition of arms in this State. The regiment of mounted men from this State will be of very little service unless arms suitable for them are at once sent. There are no arms suitable for the regiments of Indians that I am authorized to muster into the service. Some of them will present themselves with their rifles, but the greater part will be entirely without arms, and it will be necessary to send an immediate supply for their use. Without the Indian regiments I will be able to oppose but an insignificant force to the numbers sent against me. I telegraphed yesterday about a supply of tents. I hope you will be able to send me a supply. There are no tents of any description in the State. The regiment will be entirely without them. The Contention has passed an ordinance sending all the subsistence stores nowin the arsenal.to Fort Smith, where they will be turned over to General Pearce, of the State forces, at the same time authorizing me to draw upon General Pearce for such supplies as I may want, with the understanding that they will be returned by the Confederate States. These subsistence stores, which were seized in going up the river to the Federal troops, would have been sufficient for my whole command for two months, but as I have no certain control of them, and as there is a large force of State troops to draw upon them at the same time, I think it necessary to have supplies sent at once. We may not have another opportunity of getting them for six or eight months, on account of the uncertainty of the river. I will also be much in need of quartermaster’s stores. A brigade quartermaster and commissary should be at once appointed and sent to me, with ample means.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
BEN. McCULLOOH, Brigadier- General, Commanding«

His Excellency 0. F. Jackson,
Governor of Missouri, at Jefferson City .
Sir : In answer to your letter of tlie 5th of May,* it gives me very great pleasure to be enabled to say to your excellency that this department fully appreciates the sentiments of your heart, the embarrassments of your position, and the judgment displayed in view of all the obstacles opposing your policy. That the popular and momentarily suppressed feeling and sympathy of Missouri are with the cause of the Confederate States is not questioned by this Government, but at the same time we are forced to acknowledge the critical nature of her condition, environed as she is on three sides by the enemy. Four years ago I felt satisfied when the present issue came she would be thus circumstanced, and in the administration of this department, recognizing your situation, I have only regretted I have not, for the want of Confederate authority within your limits, been able to extend towards you that measure of relief called for by your necessities. I have, nevertheless, set forward movements which I flatter myself will before very long contribute largely to disrupt the fetters that now shackle the freedom of your own and the popular action. Your excellency may feel assured we have forces in the field and have made preparations for defense sufficient to retard the advance across our lines of the most formidable power, at least until additional supplies of men and arms can be brought not only to the rescue, but to drive back the invaders of our soil, and even to carry the war into the enemy’s country. Our people to the last man have already definitely made up their minds to the final result of a desperate and bloody issue, and there resides with them and our cause a sustaining spirit which can never animate our enemies, and with which the history of the world demonstrates victory invariably reposes.
In this connection, it is to be deeply regretted that two prominent officers, late prisoners of war to our forces, and liberated in the most generous manner, are now to be found with arms in their hands—the one in Missouri and the other in Kentucky—seeking with the sword to requite our humanity: I mean General Harney and Major Anderson.-Such conduct can only serve to exasperate our soldiers on the battlefield to spare this Government all occasion for the display of magnanimity by urging them to yield no quarter to prisoners.
If I do not write more fully and in detail, it is for the reasons expressed by your excellency in regard to the probabilities of interception.
But, with renewed expressions of high regard, personally and politically, I remain, your friend and servant,

Respectfully,	LSP. WALKER.
Secretary of War.
Resolutions of the Senate and House of Representatives of the Ohichasaw
Legislature assembled.
May 25,1861.
Whereas the Government of the United States has been broken up by the secession of a large number of States composing the Federal Union—that the dissolution has been followed by war between the parties ; and whereas the destruction of the Union as it existed by the Federal Constitution is irreparable, and consequently the Government of the United States as it was when the Chickasaw and other Indian nations formed alliances and treaties with it no longer exists; and whereas the Lincoln Government, pretending to represent said Union, has shown by its course towards us, in withdrawing from our country the protection of the Federal troops, and withholding, unjustly and unlawfully, our money placed in the Hands of the Government of the United States as trustee, to be applied for our benefit, a total disregard of treaty obligations toward us; and whereas our geographical position, our social and domestic institutions, our feelings and sympathies, all attach us to our Southern friends, against whom is about to be waged a war of subjugation or extermination, of conquest and confiscation—a war which, if we can judge from the declarations of the political partisans of the Lincoln Government, will surpass the French revolution in scenes of blood and that of San Domingo in atrocious horrors; and whereas it is impossible that the Chickasaws, deprived of their money and destitute of all means of separate self-protection, can maintain neutrality or escape the storm which is about to burst upon the South, but, on the contrary, would be suspected, oppressed, and plundered alternately by armed bands from the North, South, East, and West; and whereas we-have an abiding confidence that all our rights—tribal and individual— secured to us under treaties with the United States, will be fully recognized, guaranteed, and protected by our friends of the Confederate States; and whereas as a Southern people we consider their cause our own: Therefore,
Be it resolved by the Ghichasaw Legislature assembled, 1st. That the dissolution of the Federal Union, under which the Government of the United States existed, has absolved the Chickasaws from allegiance to any foreign government whatever; that the current of the events of the last few months has left the Chickasaw Nation independent, the people thereof free to form such alliances, and take such steps to secure their own safety, happiness, and future welfare as may to them seem best.
2d. Resolved, That our neighboring Indian nations—Choctaws, Chero-kees, Creeks, Seminoles, Osages, Senecas, Quapaws, Comanches, Kio-was, together with the fragmentary bands of Delawares, Kiekapoos, Caddoes, Wiehitas,and others within the Choctaw and Chickasaw country who are similarly situated with ourselves, be invited to co-operate, in order to secure the independence of the Indian nations and the defense of the territory they inhabit from Northern invasion by the Lincoln hordes and Kansas robbers, who have plundered and oppressed our red brethren among them, and who doubtless would extend to-

﻿586	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
wards us the protection which the wolf gives to the lamb should they succeed in overrunning our country; that the Chickasaws pledge themselves to resist by all means and to the death any such invasion of the lands occupied by themselves or by any of,the Indian nations; and that their country shall not be occupied or passed through by the Lincoln forces for the purpose of invading our neighbors, the States of Arkansas and Texas, but, on the contrary, any attempt to do so will be regarded as an act of war against ourselves, and should be resisted by all the Indian nations as insulting to themselves and tending to endanger their Territorial rights.
3d. Resolved, That it is expedient, at the very earliest day possible, that commissioners from other Indian nations for the purpose of forming a league or confederation among them for mutual safety and protection, and also to the Confederate States in order to enter into such alliance and to conclude such treaties as may be necessary to secure the rights, interests, and welfare of the Indian tribes, and that the co-operation of all the Indian nations west of the State of Arkansas and south of Kansas be invited for the attainment of these objects.
4th. Resolved, That the Chickasaws look with confidence especially to the Choctaws (whose interests are so closely interwoven with their own, and who were the first through their national council to declare their sympathy for, and their determination, in case of a permanent dissolution of the Federal Union, to adhere to the Southern States), and hope they will speedily unite with us in such measures as may be necessary for the defense of our common country and a union with our natural allies, the Confederate States of America.
5th. Resolved, That while the Chickasaw people entertain the most sincere friendship for the people of the neighboring States of Texas and Arkansas, and are deeply grateful for the prompt offer from them of assistance in all measures of defense necessary for the protection of our country against hostile invasion, we are desirous to hold undisputed possession of our lands and all forts and other places lately occupied by the Federal troops and other officers and persons acting under the authority of the United States, and that the governor of the Chickasaw Nation be, and he is hereby, instructed to take immediate steps to obtain possession of all such forts, and places within the Choctaw and Chickasaw country, and have the same garrisoned, if possible, by Chickasaw troops, or else by troops acting expressly under and by virtue of the authority of the Chickasaw or Choctaw nations, until such time as said forts, Indian agencies, etc., may be transferred by treaty to the Confederate States.
6th. Resolved, That the governor of the Chickasaw Nation be, and he is hereby, instructed to issue his proclamation to the Chickasaw Nation, declaring their independence, and calling upon the Chickasaw warriors to form themselves into volunteer companies of such strength and with such officers (to be chosen by themselves) as the governor may prescribe, to report themselves by filing their company rolls at the Chickasaw Agency, and to hold themselves, with the best arms and ammunition, together with a reasonable supply of provisions, in readiness at a minute’s warning to turn out, under the orders of the commanding general of the Chickasaws, for the defense of their country or to aid the civil authorities in the enforcement of the laws.
7th. Resolved, That we have full faith and confidence in the justice of the cause in which we are embarked, and that we appeal to the Chickasaw people to be prepared to meet the conflict which will surely, and perhaps speedily, take place, and hereby call upon every man capable

of bearing arms to be ready to defend his home and family, his country and his property, and to render prompt obedience to all orders from the officers set oyer them.
9th. Resolved, That the governor cause these resolutions to be published in the National Begister, at Boggy Depot, and copies thereof sent to the several Indian nations, to the governors of the adjacent States, to the President of the Confederate States, and to Abraham Lincoln, President of the Black Bepublican party.

Fort Smith, Ark., May 28,1861. lion. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have the honor to inform you that I arrived here on the 25th instant. Since my arrival I have endeavored to get all the information I could in reference to the sentiments of the Indian tribes in the Territory. It appears from the best information that the Choctaws and Chickasaws are all anxious to join the Southern Confederacy, and I think that Colonel Cooper will have no difficulty in organizing his regiment. The Creek Nation will also come in, and there will be no difficulty in raising a regiment in the tribe. It appears that there are two parties in the Cherokee Nation—one very much in favor of joining the Southern Confederacy; the other hesitates, and favors the idea of remaining neutral. These two parties are kept apart by bitter feuds of long standing, and it is possible that feelings of animosity may tempt one party to join the North, should their forces march into the Indian Territory. It is therefore necessary to see the chief of the tribe (John Boss), and by enlisting him on our side to get a force into the nation that will prevent any force from the North getting a foothold and enlisting the sympathies of any portion with their party. Captain Pike, commissioner, accompanies me to-day on my mission to the chief.

There are very few arms in the Indian Territory, and I am continually applied to for a supply. I hope a supply will be sent at once. It is absolutely necessary for the success of my mission to have an ample supply to arm the Indian regiments, particularly the Cherokees.
The control of this post is necessary, and if it has been turned over by the State to the Government of the Confederate States, I hope you will at once authorize me to take possession of it and all public property in it.

Ten companies ready on June 1 for McCulloch’s command. Five are lost if ordered elsewhere. Will dismiss them and fill up before June 15 if immediately provided here with money to buy subsistence, and authorized to muster companies in as they arrive, and send them to Virginia with promise of rifles there. I prefer Virginia. If ordered to Fort Smith, must have subsistance and transportation from here. Have no money. Can get it here. If ordered there, can’t you send blankets for men, blue jeans for their shirts and pants, and swords for officers, and stop pay to cover costs ? All much needed. Can’t get them in the Southwest. State authorities refuse arms of any kind, retaining them for militia. Answer.

Dear Sir: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of letter received this morning from Lieutenant-Colonel Hyams, of the Third Regiment Louisiana Volunteers, which left this place on the 20th instant for their destination, Fort Smith. I beg leave to call the attention of your excellency to the matters therein set forth. A deputation from the Creeks passed through this place on the 25th instant en route to Montgomery, and will, I presume, now continue their journey to Richmond.
I must also repeat what I have already telegraphed to the Secretary of War, that our Fourth Regiment has not received marching orders, and the Fifth and Sixth Regiments are and have been awaiting the action of Lieutenant Phifer to receive them into Confederate service, who is without orders for that purpose.
I must also, at the risk of being thought importunate and troublesome, call your excellency’s attention to the necessity of a more complete and extended system of defenses for the coast of this State than has yet been made or commenced.
General Twiggs assumed command of this district this morning, with whom I shall be most happy to co-operate in any measures which the public exigencies may require.

Little Rock, May 28, 1861. Tho. O. Moobe, Governor of Louisiana, New Orleans:
Dear Sib: The regiment arrived here last night and this morning, in good health. We debarked here for two reasons: The water has so much fallen in the Arkansas, as ive were informed, that we could proceed no farther by the steamers we were on, and because the governor of this State and the military board had received certain information that Lane, with a large body of troops, is within the northern boundary of this State at a place called Pocahontas. On this information, authoritatively received, I at once determined to debark and make requisition for ammunition, of which we have received none until the governor of Arkansas gave me an order for its receipt from the State arsenal.
The agent of the Indians called on me this morning, and states that the nations on the borders of this State are anxious and desirous to be armed; that they can and will muster into the service 25,000 men; that they have immense supplies of beeves, sufficient to supply the meat for the whole Confederate service. All they ask is arms and enrollment. If within your power to forward their views with the President, it would be a great step in the right direction, and erect a more effectual barrier against the Kansas marauders than any force that could be sent against them, and thereby protect the northern boundary of both Arkansas and Louisiana. The reasons why every effort should be made to arm these people (now heart and soul with us) to defend themselves and us are so palpable, that I do not attempt to urge them on you, but do solicit your attention, so far as is compatible with your high position, to this matter, to impress its importance on the President, and use your well-known influence to effect this much desirable result. Our colonel is not yet with us. I received a dispatch at Napoleon from Hon. Judge Moise, for which I return my thanks. Please say to my brother that we are all well and preparing for duty.
With highest regard, believe me, sir, your friend sincerely,

Hon. L. P. Walkeb:
Dear Siu : I have been detained by pneumonia, an attack from which kept me ten days in bed. Then low water and the sinking of a steamboat kept me until yesterday. I am not able to report upon the condition of things among the Indians, but hear they are favorable. General McCulloch is about the frontier of Arkansas, northwest of Fort Smith, as I hear. I do not think these matters worth talking about, but my sense of duty requires me to report that with about 25,000 able-bodied brave men Arkansas has less the appearance of a military organization than any people I ever yet knew. The people are nearly all under arms, and daily rumors of invasions calling them from home, and I never yet saw x>eople who appeared to know so little about commanders, or who seemed so utterly devoid of confidence in any one faction or leader of a faction in the State. My belief and conviction is that but little can be done among these factions, and that a military leader from without the State is needed, who when he gets here shall have command of all tho

forces not under McCulloch, and that the. bold and brave men can rally under such without disturbance from leaders of any faction whatever, and that without this Arkansas with her brave and hardy hunters cannot be made available in any other way, unless it will be by waiting for a new man to grow up.
These are my thoughts, freely given. If able, I go up the river to Fort Smith to-morrow.
I have the honor to be, truly, &c., yours,

Will certainly lose five companies if not ordered to McCulloch’s command immediately. Will have more trouble than I supposed in filling up if they leave. Hope you will order me to Fort Smith immediately. Afterward can send me where you please. Have permission from State authorities to stop in arsenal till tents reach here. Must be ordered somewhere at once. Expense is ruinous. Men have no shelter. Defer staff appointments till letter reaches you.

So soon as prepared for mustering in, you will advise Capt. W. S. Walker, C. S. Army, now at Memphis, Tenn., who has been directed to muster in your regiment. You will make requisitions upon the quartermaster’s and subsistence departments for such stores pertaining to each as may be required by your regiment, this being your authority therefor. Governor Eector will furnish the arms and munitions required for the armament. Respecting staff appointments, send in the names of those whom you wish to be appointed as surgeons, assistant surgeon, assistant quartermaster, and assistant commissary of subsistence, and their commissions will be made out and forwarded to you.

Sir : I have the honor to state that I left this post on the 30th of May, with the view of having an interview with the chief of the Cher-okees, and to select some military position in the Indian Territory for my command. I found no point suitable for such a position, except in the Cherokee country, and 1 had determined to take the first opportunity of moving my command to it; but in my interview with John Ross, the chief of the Chevokces, objection was made to my entering his conn-

try, at the same time stating that he wished to maintain a neutral position, and would endeavor to keep his country from being occupied by either party.
v There are two parties in the Cherokee [Nation—one in favor of immediate secession, the other represented by John Ross, and wishing to be neutral. This party is m the majority, and consists of all the full-bloods and a part of the half-breeds. To give offense to this party now by marching into their country would injure our cause, and might unite, the whole nation against us.
This chief has assured me that in the event of an invasion from the [North he will put himself at the head of his people and march to repel it, and he has also assured Captain Pike (commissioner) that he will call his executive council together this month, for the purpose of conferring with them on the subject. Under these circumstances I have deemed it advisable to respect his wishes, and have addressed him a letter, a copy of which is herewith inclosed.
The command at my disposal would not warrant me in advancing at present, especially as most of the supplies are still behind. The Louisiana regiment has arrived, and seven companies of Churchill’s regiment, but the latter are entirely without tents or camp equipage of any kind. The Texas regiment and the expected transportation from that quarter will not be here in less than three weeks. There are a number of State troops (nearly 2,000) in and around this post belonging to the western division of the State. I think it very essential for the success of a command on this frontier that this military division and the Confederate troops here be put under our control. I therefore apply, respectfully, for authority to command it. The State is divided into two military divisions, the eastern and western. This western division should be put under my command, as under the above circumstances I may be obliged to act in the northwestern corner of the State to repel an attack from the North.
From the best authority I can gain I believe all the other Indians in the Territory are with us. They only want arms to be of immediate service to us.

I hope that you, as chief of the Cherokees, will meet me with the same feelings of friendship that actuate me in coming among you, and that I may have your hearty co-operation in one common cause against a people who are endeavoring to deprive us of our rights.

Whereas the general council of the Choctaw Nation, on the 10th day of June, 1861, by resolution declared that in consequence of the dissolution of the United States, by the withdrawal of eleven States formerly comprising a part of said Government, and their formation into a separate government, and the existing war consequent thereon between the States, and the refusal on the part of that portion of the States claiming to be, and exercising the functions of the Government of, the United States to comply with solemn treaty stipulations between the Government of the United States and the Choctaw Nation, said nation was absolved from all obligations under said treaties, and thereby was left independent, and free to enter into alliance with other governments, and to take such other steps as may be necessary to secure the safety and welfare of the nation.
And whereas the general council of the Choctaw Nation did further resolve that the interest and safety of the Choctaw people require that an alliance be made with the Southern Confederacy, and did appoint commissioners to negotiate a treaty of, alliance and amity; and whereas the defense of the nation against invasion, and the preservation of order and the due execution of the laws of the nation, which have been extended over all persons within the limits thereof, require the organization of an efficient military corps, and all of which it is proper should be made known to the Choctaw people and to the world:
Now, therefore, I, George Hudson, principal chief of the Choctaw Nation, do hereby publish and proclaim that the Choctaw Nation is, and of right ought to be, free and independent; that all citizens and residents of said nation between the ages of 18 and 45 years, subject to military duty, are required to enroll, either in the volunteer or the reserve militia, according to law, and to hold themselves in readiness to turn out for the defense of the nation at a minute’s warning, for the preservation of order and the protection of life and property, or in aid of the civil authorities in the general execution of the laws, and (in accordance with a law passed by the general council) that Apuck-shanubbee district shall furnish three volunteer companies, consisting of not less than 64 privates, 4 commissioned officers, 5 non-commis* 38 R R—VOL in

sioned officers, and 1 bugler, nor more than 100 to each company; two companies of like strength from Pushmataha district, and two from Mosholatubbee district; making in all 700 men, as near as possible, will be enrolled, elect their officers, and report themselves ready for immediate service in the mounted regiment of Choctaw and Chickasaw riflemen called for by the Confederate States of America, to be commanded by Col. D. H. Cooper, of C. S. Army; and, further, I require that all free male persons not subject to military duty under the laws of the nation shall forthwith form themselves into squads of patrol, under a headman to be chosen by themselves, in each neighborhood, as “Home Guards,” for the protection of the country and preservation of order, whenever the volunteer and reserve militia of the nation shall have been called into active service. The sheriffs of each county are required by law to enroll and report a list of all those capable of military service, either in the volunteer or reserve militia, to the adjutant-general of the Choctaw Nation. I hereby appeal to all persons in the nation to render prompt obedience to all civil and military officers, and enjoin all civil and military officers to be prompt in the discharge of their duty. Our position now requires that every effort be used to defend the country and repress all disorderly and unlawful acts.
Given under my hand and seal, as principal chief of the Choctaw Nation, at the executive office, in the town of Doaksville, on the 14th day of June, A. D. 1861.

Principal Chief Choctaw Nation.
By the principal chief:
L. P. Pitchlynn, National Secretary.
Headquarters McCulloch’s Brigade,
Fort Smith, Ark., June% 14, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : The bearer of this communication (Captain Green) has been sent by the governor of the State of Missouri" to urge upon me the necessity of advancing a force into the State to give countenance to the secessionists in their attempt to free themselves from the yoke which has been placed upon them. The governor is ready for the crisis, and he only wants the aid of a force from this quarter to put his forces in action. Captain Green will give you all the necessary information in regard to the views and secret movements of the governor of his State.
I think the proposition made by the governor is one of great importance to the Confederate Government, and I hope may meet with your favorable consideration. I will briefly lay before you a plan of operations. As I have before communicated to you, the chief of the Chero-kees is not willing to have a force marched into his country, and he desires to remain neutral. The only way to force his country into the Confederacy is to throw a force into the northeastern portion of this State, take possession of Fort Scott on the Missouri line, and subjugate that portion of Kansas. I am satisfied that Lane has no force yet of any importance, and the occupation of Fort Scott would not only place Kansas in my power, but would give heart and countenance to our friends in Missouri, and accomplish the very object for which I was sent here, preventing a force from the North invading the Indian Territory. All the border counties on the western line of Missouri are

with us. We would therefore be able to draw our supplies from them. After strengthening myself at Fort Scott I could, by co-operating with Missouri, take such a position on the Kansas River as I might desire.
In order to carry out this plan I would again respectfully apply to have the Western Military Division of Arkansas put under my orders, with authority to muster the troops now in it (about 1,600) into the provisional forces, and to accept such other regiments and battalions until my force is at least 7,000 strong. The Indians are much opposed to marching out of their country. They are willing to organize for its defense, but want to remain in it. From what I have seen of them, I do not think it would be prudent to march them into Kansas, for they would be difficult to restrain, and I should much fear the censures that would be heaped on our Government by employing them. If the State of Arkansas is supplied with sufficient arms, I will have no difficulty in getting the requisite force, but as this matter is of the utmost importance, I think if a well-drilled regiment is available it should be at once sent to report to me.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
bek McCulloch,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Little Rock, Ark., June 21,1861.
L. P. Walker :
We have a large armed force in the field, say 8,000 men. Missouri calls for our aid, which cannot, be effectively furnished under State authority. We will turn over this force by their consent to the Confederate Government, including arms, with the provision that the arms are to be so used as to secure ample protection and security to Arkansas in future. In contemplation of this proposition we have called no general officer into the field; making prompt and speedy answer highly important. It is suggested that an active campaign in Missouri would aid Virginia. Please reply promptly.

Sir: .1 have the honor to transmit the inclosed copy of a communication from John Ross, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.
Under all the circumstances of the case I do not think it advisable to march into the Cherokee country at this time unless there is some urgent necessity for it. If the views expressed in my communication to you of the 14th instant are carried out, it will, I am satisfied, force the conviction on the Oherokees that they have but one course to pursue— that is, to join the Confederacy. The Choctaw and Chickasaw regiment will be kept on the south of them; Arkansas will be to the east; and with my force on the western border of Missouri no force will be able to inarch into the Cherokee Nation, and surrounded as they will be by Southern troops, they will have but one alternative at all events. From my position to the north of them, in any event, I will have a controlling

power oyer them. I am satisfied from my interview with John Boss and from his communication that he is only waiting for some favorable opportunity to put himself with the North. His neutrality is only a pretext to await the issue of events.

Executive Department, C. N.,
Park Sill, June 17, 1861.
Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch,
Commanding Troops of Confederate States, Fort Smith, Ark.:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge by the first return mail the receipt of your communication, dated at Fort Smith, Ark., the 12th instant, informing me that you have been sent by the Government of the Confederate States of America to take command of the district embracing the Indian Territory, and to guard it from invasion by the people of the North. -For the expression of your friendship be pleased to accept my heartfelt thank, and the assurance that I cherish none other than a similar sentiment for yourself and people. I am also gratified to be informed that you will not interfere with any of our rights and wishes unless circumstances compel you to do so, nor violate or molest our neutrality without good cause. In regard to the pending conflict between the United States and Confederate States, I have already signified my purpose to take no part in it whatever, and have admonished the Cherokee people to pursue the same course. The determination to adopt that course was the result of considerations of law and policy, and seeing no reasons to doubt its propriety, I shall adhere to it in good faith, and hope that the Cherokee people will not fail to follow my example. I have not been able to see any reason why the Cherokee Nation should take any other course, for it seems to me to be dictated by their treaties and sanctioned by wisdom and humanity. It ought not to give ground for complaint to either side, and should cause our rights to be respected by both. Our country and institutions are our own. However small the one and humble the others, they are as sacred and valuable to us as are those of your own populous and wealthy State to yourself and people. We have done nothing to bring about the conflict in which you are engaged with your own people, and I am unwilling that my people shall become its victims, and I am determined to do no act that shall furnish any pretext to either of the contending parties to overrun our country and destroy our rights. If we are destined to be overwhelmed, it shall not be through any agency of mine. The United States are pledged not to disturb us in our rights, nor can we for a moment suppose that your Government will do it, as the avowed principles upon which it is straggling for an acknowledged existence are the rights of the States and freedom from outside interference. The Cherokee people and Government have given every assurance in their power of their sympathy and friendship for the people of Arkansas and of other Confederate States, unless it be in voluntarily assuming an attitude of hostility towards the Government of the United States, with whom their treaties exist and from whom they are not experiencing any new burdens or exactions. That I cannot advise them to do, and hope that their good faith in adhering to the requirements of their treaties and

of their friendship for all the whites will be manifested by strict observance of the neutrality enjoined.
Your demand that those people of the nation who are in favor of joining the Confederacy be allowed to organize into military companies as Home Guards, for the purpose of defending themselves in case of invasion from the North, is most respectfully declined. I cannot give my consent to any such organization for very obvious reasons: First, it would be a palpable violation of my position as a neutral j second, it would place in our midst organized companies not authorized by our laws but in violation of treaty, and who would soon become efficient instruments in stirring up domestic strife and creating internal difficulties among the Cherokee people. As in this connection you have misapprehended a remark made in conversation at our interview some eight or ten days ago, I hope you will allow me to repeat what I did say. I informed you that I had taken a neutral position, and would maintain it honestly, but that in case of a foreign invasion, old as I am, I would assist in repelling it. I have not signified any purpose as to an invasion of our soil and an interference with our rights from the United or Confederate States, because I have apprehended none, and cannot give my consent to any.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

Principal Chief CheroTcee Nation.

Sir: I have the honor to inform you that in the organization of a Creek regiment there will be some difficulty, as there are two parties, known as the Upper and Lower Creeks. I would therefore respectfully recommend that instead of receiving a regiment, two battalions be received, one from the Upper Creeks and another from the Lower Creeks, allowing them to elect their own officers.
I have heard that Colonel Garrett, formerly the Creek agent, has been recommended to you to command the regiment. I hope the appointment will not be made, for Colonel Garrett is in no way qualified for the position, and from what I know of his habits, I am satisfied that a worse appointment could not be made.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

Sir : Herewith you will receive the appointment of brigadier-general of provisional forces in the service of the Confederate States. Your command will embrace that portion of Arkansas lying west of the White and Black Rivers and north of the Arkansas River to the Missouri line. The general purpose of this assignment is to watch over and protect the country within the limits referred to, and also that part of the State of Missouri contiguous thereto. Besides the regiment from Arkansas under the command of Colonel Hindman, recently ordered there, it is the purpose of the Department to send an additional force of about 3,000 men in that direction. You will establish your headquarters at such point within the district referred to as will best subserve the purpose of your command.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
Pine Bluff, June 25, 1861.
Hon. L. P. Walker :
Before leaving I understood of you that the incumbents of the Indian agencies west of Arkansas would be continued. I believed it wise. I beg of you earnestly to send them their appointments promptly.
The movement of our Indians into our Confederacy will be natural and easy if under the lead of the officers and agents they are accustomed to be led and advised by; but strike them out, put in new men, and then propose to change their allegiance, with war before them, and with doubts as to their annuities and the debts due them, and the nature of their own governments hereafter, and a new and necessarily untrained and ignorant set of agents to explain, to control, or to advise them, and it will all be unfortunate—very, very unfortunate.
My old friend the Hon. D. Hubbard is sick, and stays at Dr. Griffith’s, at Fort Smith. With his good heart it is to be expected he will be desirous to support Dr. Griffith’s wishes, and Dr. Griffith wants to be appointed superintendent in place of E. Rector. Do not allow this to be done. Hold everything as it is until peace and unity are attained, and then make all the changes you think proper; but not now—not now, by all manner of means.
I do earnestly beg you to keep your agencies as they were. They are good and true men, and popular and qualified with the tribes and their business. Restore and commission Elias Rector, superintendent; John Crawford, Cherokee agent; William Quesenbury, Creek agent; Samuel M. Rutherford, Seminole agent; and Matthew Leeper, Wichita agent; and if Cooper has resigned (which I fear is the case), appoint Richard P. Pulliam (who is the next best living man on earth for the place, I believe) as agent of the Choctaws. With this programme you will have peace and success; without it, no one can tell your troubles or our misfortunes on this frontier.
If you raise an Indian regiment, I commend to you J. W. Washburne for quartermaster. He is a favorite with them (particularly with the Creeks), and is a man of talent and capacity.
In conclusion, it is proper, as I am so much of a stranger to you, that

I should apologize for any seeming abruptness of expression in my letter, for in none of it is there aught but the haste of a letter written in the pain and weakness of a sick bed, and dictated by a sentiment of that sincere respect of which it is begged you will be assured by your obedient servant,
R. W. JOHNSON.
Richmond, Va., June 25,1861.
His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Confederate States:
Sir : Permit me respectfully to suggest to you that in the event that the Confederate States forces find it necessary to advance into Missouri, they might find it advantageous to have among both their men and their officers as many Missourians as possible. To that end, if the Hon. E. Carrington Cabell could be attached in some suitable position, as aide-de-camp or otherwise, to the staff of the commanding officer of those forces, and should Mr. Cabell be willing to accept the position, I decidedly advise its being done. His high standing in Missouri, as also elsewhere, his sound judgment, practical common sense, and thorough acquaintance with the condition of affairs in Missouri, would enable him to be of essential service. As an officer of militia cavalry he acquired sufficient knowledge of military affairs to justify such an appointment.
I remain, Mr. President, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
THOS. C. REYNOLDS.

General: In reply to your communication of the 14th instant, addressed to the Secretary of War, I am instructed to say that you are authorized, should you think proper, to take position at Fort Scott, and that you may give such assistance to Missouri as will subserve the main purpose of your command. If an invasion of Kansas is rendered necessary for that purpose, it will be a question for you to determine, after fully considering the consequences as affecting the neutrality of the Cherokees, which should not be disregarded if it is possible by diplomacy to prevent it; the great object of your command being not only to conciliate the Indian nations, but to obtain their active co-operation with us in prosecuting the war. You will perceive that by exciting the hostility of the Cherokee Nation the prospect of a,successful termination of your command will be greatly diminished.

Sir: I have the honor to state to you that I Will leave here to-morrow morning with the regiments of Arkansas and Louisiana volunteers to march to Maysville, on the northwestern frontier of Arkansas. General Pearce is already there with 900 men. Missouri has been crushed, and all of her forces are falling back from the Federal troops in the State. I have authentic information that a force of nearly 3,000 Federal troops are now in Springfield, Mo., and that General Lyon, with 9,000 men, will soon be with them. From reliable information it is the intention to enter this State and the Indian Territory. Under these circumstances I have deemed it necessary to issue a proclamation, calling all the men of Western Arkansas to arms for the emergency, and to rally upon Fayetteville, twenty miles from Maysville. I hope soon to have such a force at my disposal on the northern frontier to drive this force back; at all events to keep them from entering the State. The Texas regiment has orders to join me as soon as possible. It has not yet reported here. My embarrassment here has been very great. Sent here without a force, without transportation, and without arms, I have found myself very much crippled; but by taking the necessary responsibility I have organized a train, the necessary staff department, called for an additional force, and am determined to march against this foree to hold it in check, and, if an opportunity occurs, to strike them a blow in Missouri. I hope that I will be sustained in all the steps that I have deemed it necessary to take.
We are much in need of arms and ammunition. Is it not possible to send me a supply %
From the last accounts such of the State troops of Missouri as are still under the command of the governor and General Rains are falling back from the Federal forces toward the southwestern corner of the State. I have sent reliable men to them, with advice to fall back and form a junction with me.
I have the honor to be, sir,

His Excellency Jefferson Davis:
My Dear Sir : As Governor Reynolds was about leaving Richmond he told me he would make the suggestion which he has made in his letter of the 25th of June, which you inclose to me to-day.
The proposition was new and unexpected, and, at first presentation, I told Governor Reynolds that the position alluded to would not suit me. But further consideration has brought my mind to the conclusion that' I have no right to decline a position which may enable me to render important service to our country. My heart and soul are in this cause, and I have long since resolved to devote myself as far as practicable to its success.
To insure the accession of Missouri to the Confederate States has been the object of mv labors for several months past. This great result may, and I feel confident will, be attained. But it is secondary to the cause of Southern independence, and should it fail, which God forbid,

and which I do not apprehend, I shall be none the less devoted to that cause; for I shall never reside, and I would rather bury my children than have them live in, any State which, willingly or unwillingly, remains under the rule of the men of the Northern portion of the late United States.
The suggestion of Governor Reynolds is certainly a good one, that there would be great advantage (in the presence of Missourians with such forces of the Confederate States as may be required to advance into Missouri; and it is probable that in this connection I may be of .more benefit to our cause than in any other. If so, and I now incline to that opinion, I would prefer the appointment suggested; but I shall be most happy to render service in any position which may be assigned me; only let me go where it is deemed I can be most useful.
I am sincerely obliged to you, my dear sir, for your kind indorsement on the letter of Governor Reynolds, which I return.
With great respect, I am, yours, most cordially,
E. 0. CABELL.
Pocahontas, Ark., July 2,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Confederate States, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I notified you several days ago that a rendezvous had been appointed for the exiled Missourians at this place, and as I am here to organize them, I will notify you of the rumors which the men bring from the different portions of the State, as some of them may occasionally be of importance, and not reach you through the ordinary channels of communication.
Governor Jackson has undoubtedly gone into the southwest corner of the State, probably directly to McCulloch’s camp. A portion of his cabinet are with him. I also hear from tolerably reliably authority that Lieutenant-Governor Reynolds is with him, although I know that he started to Richmond, Va., from Nashville, only about ten days ago. As General Price has been sick, and if now in the field at all his headquarters are unknown to any one in this portion of the country, therefore there is no system or plan of campaign for the people to go by, and the organizations which are now going on may either be broken up or rendered entirely inefficient for want of a leader. The funds of the State of Missouri are locked up in the banks, and every town in the State in which there is a bank is now in the possession of Federal troops. Every railroad, telegraph, and mail is also in their hands, and the only way the fifty to one hundred thousand gallant young soldiers can be made available and the rich prize of this great State secured is by a powerful demonstration from this portion of the country, which will attract the attention of friends and foes alike, giving confidence to one and striking terror to the other.
Missouri has no great leader in whom the people have confidence. Price and Doniphan are neither equal to the occasion, and besides these two there are none with a sufficient reputation to inspire that confidence which is necessary to bring out the people, surrounded as they are by so many enemies. There are men in Missouri who are competent, or rather capable, but they are unknown to the people; therefore please send us a leader and a few arms, and Missouri’s sons can rid her soil of the pollution which now infests her, and rush into line with her Southern sisters in double-quick time.

If Lieutenant-Governor Reynolds has been to see you these remarks are superfluous, but I mention them for fear he may have returned to Missouri without having seen you.
I herewith send you a small map of Missouri, on which I have marked the military districts and the brigadier-generals commanding each district, which may be of use to the War Department; and I would here remark that I am personally acquainted with all the leading men in the State, and probably know the military resources better than any one, and at any time that I can be of service to the cause of the Southern Confederacy, either individually or officially, I am at your command.
I suppose by this time Colonel Bowen’s regiment is full, but if you will receive another Missouri regiment I can have one at your service at any time in a week.
Any communication you may have to send to any one in Missouri by mail this is the most accessible point, as the people here and beyond the line are in constant intercourse.

Dear Sir : Inclosed you will please find copy of a telegram sent you on the 21st ultimo from Little Rock, Ark.# I have never received an answer. I know you are worried to death with letters, importunities, &c., but the fact is, General McCulloch’s command is in a very bad fix as regards arms. His cavalry regiment, commanded by Colonel Churchill, are armed with old muskets, flint-and-steel locks, and bayonets; no cartridge-boxes, bayonet scabbards, or belts, and he is in great want of ammunition. Be pleased to answer the dispatch. I am here in Memphis, having the cartridge-boxes, bayonet scabbards, and belts made. General Hardee is here. He has requested me to say to you that he wishes Mr. John Pope, of Little Rock, Ark., appointed quartermaster for his division. Mr, Pope is the grandson of John Pope, who was formerly governor of Kentucky. He is a gentleman, and is well suited for the position, and would give universal satisfaction to all; can give a bond for any amount, and can give you any recommendation you might wish. General Hardee is very anxious to secure his services^ and has written you on this subject. Should you appoint him, be pleased to let him know it as soon as possible. I succeeded in getting fresh quartermaster provisions to him without any loss, and took a receipt for it in good order. General McCulloch is on his way to the Missouri frontier. I am busy getting subscriptions of cotton and produce for the Confederate States. I write this letter in a great hurry, as the bearer is about to leave.

Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch, Fort Smith, Arh.:
General: Your communication of the 22d June has been received. Your policy in regard to Ross, the principal chief of the Oherokees, has my approbation. It is well to pursue a conciliatory course with this chief, so long as it not only involves no detriment to the cause, but embraces a jirospect of immediate advantage.
Keeping steadily in view the great object of your command, you will avail yourself of any fitting opportunity of co operation with Missouri 5 that is, when it is quite clear that co-operation will be likely to avail, as suggested in previous communications The position of Missouri as a Southern State still in the Union requires, as you will readily perceive, much prudence and circumspection, and it should only be when necessity and propriety unite that active and direct assistance should be afforded by crossing the boundary and entering the State before communicating with this Department.
In the progress of events it might be possible that the most effective co-operation would be for you to penetrate Kansas, whether through the Indian nation or Missouri to be determined by the special facts that may arise or the circumstances which may exist, of which, from the remoteness of the position, it would be impossible for this Department to receive information in time to give you specific and definite instructions. Yery respectfully,
L. P. WALKER,
Secretary of War.
Richmond, Va., July 6, 1861.
His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of Confederate States of America:
Sir : If not inconsistent with your views of constitutional powers, and if you have the troops at your command, I respectfully recommend that at least 10,000 well-appointed troops be concentrated on the northern border of Arkansas at the earliest practicable moment, within the military district of Brigadier-Gen era! Hardee, and a like number, if possible, within the department of Major-General Polk, and that both of these officers be distinctly authorized to enter the State of Missouri, to drive back and to pursue the enemy now threatening the invasion of Arkansas and a descent on Tennessee, as far into Missouri as they deem prudent and advisable. I would also respectfully ask that more specific instructions be given to General McCulloch, authorizing him to enter the State of Missouri with the same object and for the same purpose. None but the enemies of the Confederate States and of Missouri will protest against this—none others will object; but all whose wishes you would respect invite and will cordially welcome your troops in the State. I make this request because I have reason to know that the instructions to these officers are of so guarded a character as to produce doubt as to their authority and embarrassment as to their movements.
I also respectfully recommend that, if practicable, the troops destined to operate in North Arkansas and Missouri be armed with muskets with bayonets, and that an extra amount of field artillery be sent with them. Any army you may send will be immediately re-enforced to any extent you may desire by Missourians, armed with the ordinary guns and rifles of the country, and volunteers from that State will be on the spot to

﻿604	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
serve all tlie field pieces your army may have. There will also be at hand as many cavalry as you may want, but not regularly equipped. The Missourians will furnish promptly men and horses enough to drive every man of the enemy’s forces far from Arkansas and back into Illinois. They want arms and organization, especially muskets with bayonets, and fieid artillery. Under command of the accomplished generals you have sent to Arkansas organization will soon be effected, and the deficiency of small-arms, which you cannot furnish, will be partially, and perhaps effectively, supplied by the private arms of the Missouri volunteers. In this way, I confidently believe, the enemy may be driven out of Missouri, and thus the safety of Arkansas and Tennessee and of the whole valley of the Mississippi be effectually secured; for the troops of Mr. Lincoln will never venture to descend the river with an enemy in their rear so powerful as the State of Missouri in arms against them and threatening Illinois and Iowa. Thus may the military operations be transferred from Arkansas and Tennessee to Missouri, and the battles of those States be fought on Missouri soil, to which the people of Missouri cordially invite you.
The danger of the invasion of Arkansas and the difficulty of driving back the enemy’s forces threatening that State have been greatly increased by the delay, for the most part unavoidable, in sending troops to North Arkansas. Three weeks ago half the number would have accomplished the object, and every day’s delay adds to the difficulties to be overcome. In view of the importance of prompt action, and of the magnitude of the object to be effected, I trust you will pardon me for suggesting that a portion of the troops now organized and ready for the field in North Carolina, or some other of the Confederate States, be dispatched to General Hardee’s command, and that General Polk be instructed to inquire if a portion of his command now in Tennessee could not with advantage to the service be ordered to Northeast Arkansas.
On the approach of any force you may order to the Missouri frontier, the citizens of Missouri will, as I have intimated, flock to your standard. They, as well as the executive of the State, desire that the chief military operations in the State shall be under the direction of your commanding officers when they enter Missouri. 1 would therefore suggest that provision be made for a much larger force than you may send to Arkansas. There are thousands of Missourians willing and anxious to volunteer in the service of the Confederate States, with the expectation of being employed in repelling the threatened invasion of Arkansas, which they know can best, and indeed alone, be effected by driving back the enemy’s forces now in Missouri and approaching the borders of Arkansas. Please inform me if yon will receive volunteers from Missouri in companies or regiments, and how many and on what conditions. Their organization may be effected in Missouri, but if that is deemed unadvisable, they may organize in Arkansas. More troops will certainly be wanted in that quarter, and I suggest that Missouri volunteers be organized and received, whether they can be armed at present or not. We hope that arms may be had soon, and when they come these troops will be on the spot, ready for action. Missouri can supply brave and loyal men, if organized and armed, not only to drive out the invaders of her soil, but enough to furnish 30,000 good soldiers to fight the battles of the Confederate States elsewhere. Colonel Bowen’s regiment at Memphis is by this time full and with but few arms. It seems to me that there can be no more urgent demand for

arms than to complete the arming of this regiment, which I recommend to be sent to General Hardee.
I have felt authorized to make these suggestions and recommendations in consequence of your invitation to do so at our last personal interview. Your consideration of them, and as early a reply as convenient, will greatly oblige me. I hoped before this to have received an answer to my communication of the 22d of June.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[Private.]	Richmond, July 6,1861.
President Jefferson Davis :
My Dear Sir : A few days ago you inclosed to me a note from Governor Reynolds, of Missouri, in which he suggested that I be appointed an aide-de-camp to one of your general officers, who might be required to enter Missouri to repel the threatened invasion of Arkansas. Your indorsement on the letter, asking my “ views and wishes” on the subject, I presume contemplated my appointment to such position if I desired it. In reply I stated that I would accept that or any other place which might be assigned me in which I could benefit my State or serve the cause of Southern independence. It is proper now that I should state to you that on reflection I am unwilling to leave Richmond for the present, and that I feel it my duty to remain here till some definite arrangement can be made with your Government as advantageous as may be to the unfortunate citizens and endangered sovereignty of Missouri. The Congress of the Confederate States, which will meet in two weeks, may, and I trust will, authorize you to do what you do not now consider within the scope of your constitutional powers, notwithstanding your great sympathy for the people of Missouri in their unequal struggle for liberty.
I thought I was justified in assuring my friends in Missouri that the result of ray mission would be very different from what it has proved to be, and I have not the heart to go back to them and witness their sore disappointment at my failure to accomplish what was so confidently expected. When I shall have exhausted every effort to serve the people of Missouri here, whether successful or not, I shall be ready and am resolved to go into any field and to perform any service in which I can best advance the interest of the common cause of our common country.
Believe me, my dear sir, to be, most cordially, your sincere friend and obedient servant,
E. C. CABELL.
P. S.—Let me ask your early attention to an official communication from me to-day.

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge your several letters of June —, 1861,* of July 6,1861, and another of same date, marked private; also a printed copy of the proclamation of the governor of Missouri, bearing date June 12, 1861, which was inclosed in the first-named com-

munication. The last paragraph of the proclamation does not quite accord with the general proposition submitted by you. Accept my thanks for the information furnished by you. Your recommendations, requests, and suggestions have been noted, and your letters referred to the Secretary of War for file and future reference. You have been heretofore advised of the sympathy I feel for the cause of Missouri so graphically and feelingly described. Constant occupation leaves me little time for correspondence; but were it otherwise, you surely would not expect me to reply to your requisitions by stating the force and stores of the Confederate States to show that your large wants could not now be supplied, or by discussing with you questions of the constitutional power of the Executive.
Very respectfully, yours,
JEFFERSON DAYIS.
Headquarters McCulloch’s Brigade,
Gamp Jackson, Arft., July 9, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va. :
Sir : I have the honor to state that I returned to this camp to-day. It is 2 miles from Maysville, Ark., and 7 miles from the northern boundary of the State. I started from this position on the 4th instant with Churchill’s regiment of mounted riflemen and 1,200 men of General Pearce’s brigade, under the command of the general. General Price, of Missouri, had reached a position in the northwestern corner of his State with 1,700 men. The general offered to march with me to the aid of the governor of his State, and joined my command as we passed-his camp on the first day’s march.
From authentic information I had learned that the governor of Missouri had formed a junction with General Rains and was endeavoring to make his way to General Price’s camp, and also that every effort was being made by the Northern troops to cut him off. A force of 2,400 well-drilled troops were marching north towards Carthage against him; a force of 3,600 were marching south, rapidly gaining upon him. Rumors were also afloat that a force was marching from the northeast, under General Lyon, and still another was marching against him from Kansas. Under these circumstances I knew there was no time to be lost, and it* the forces marching against the governor could concentrate upon him, his force of disorganized, undisciplined men would probably be cut to pieces, and Missouri fall entirely under the control of the North. I at once saw Generals Pearce and Price, and concerted a plan of operations.
I had a few days previous issued a proclamation to the people of Western Arkansas calling them to arms, as their State was threatened. The effect of the proclamation had gathered a force of several hundred men at Fayetteville, Ark. I ordered Colonel McRae, of Arkansas, to take command of this force and make a demonstration on Springfield with it. I found out afterwards, through intercepted orders, that the effect of the demonstration was to call back portions of the force which was marching against the governor.
On the 5th instant I found from authentic information that if the governor was to be rescued by my command, it was necessary to move with more celerity than the infantry and artillery could march. I therefore moved on with about 3,000 cavalry, leaving the infantry and

﻿Chap.X.1	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------CONFEDERATE.	607
artillery in camp 28 miles north of this camp. Upon arriving within 12 miles of Neosho I ascertained that the force had already left that place and marched north against the governor, leaving a detachment in Neosho between 100 and 300 men. I immediately sent two columns of cavalry on different roads to capture the detachment—one column of six companies, under Colonel Churchill, and another, under Captain McIntosh, of five companies. The movement was entirely successful, and 137 prisoners fell into my hands, with 150 stand of arms, 1 color, 7 wagons (loaded with subsistence stores), and an ambulance. In the hurry of reporting this affair I made the amount of property and prisoners captured less than it actually was. During the night, having heard that a heavy cannonading had been heard during the day towards the north, and knowing that the governor was fighting his way towards me, I immediately mounted my command, and reached Neosho before morning. After a short rest I started with the entire command, and after a rapid march of 20 miles I formed a junction with the governor, who was at the head of about 7,000 men. He had met about 10 miles north of Carthage the force of Federal troops, 2,000 strong, and had fought them nearly the whole of the preceding day, the Federal troops slowly falling back before him. They had evidently heard of our approach, and as soon as an opportunity occurred they had made a rapid retreat towards Springfield. The Missourians lost about 12 killed and 60 wounded. They think the loss of the enemy was fully equal to theirs.
Having made the movement without authority, and having accomplished my mission, I determined to fall back to this position, and organize a force with a view of future operations.*
The governor has determined to take position about 12 miles from me with his entire force, and effect an entire reorganization of it. He seems confident that if he had the necessary arms he could bring a force at once of 50,000 men into the field. The force that was marching upon the governor’s rear will no doubt move on to Springfield, and I think there will be an urgent necessity in the course of a few days to make an attack upon that place, or we will receive an attack from their concentrated forces. Should I receive no instructions in the mean time, I think that I will, together with Generals Pearce and Price,, make an advance upon it as soon as the different forces are sufficiently organized to take the field.
I would here beg leave to call the attention of the Department to the conduct of the men of my command during a rapid march of several days and nights, and some of the time without any other provision than beef and salt; but, notwithstanding everything, they bore themselves like men, and their only regret seemed to be that they could not prove their strength against their Northern foes. I would take this occasion to call the attention of the Department to the conduct of Captain McIntosh since his appointment on my staff. His services in the camp and in the field have been invaluable, and I hope that other officers of military experience may be sent to my command for duty with it.
I would again beg leave to call your attention to the fact that neither arms nor ammunition have been furnished me, and that the Texas regiment will soon be with me. They only received 1,600 single-barreled pistols and a few sabers from the arsenal at San Antonio. I am also

General : I find it impossible to occupy any point near the State line, owing to the scarcity of water and supplies 5 consequently, I will remain in this neighborhood until I learn more of the movements of the enemy. If I could be informed, at short notice, of the advance of the enemy from Keosho towards you, we could reach you in time to support you, in the event of your checking him on Buffalo Creek. A day or two will develop his plans, and I may return to my former camp or one still nigher to you. If there were supplies to be had, I would at once occupy Pineville. As soon as I hear from you and the enemy, I intend making an examination of the road as far as Cassville in person, so as to be able, if necessary, to take a position near that point.
Please keep me well informed of the movements of the enemy, and oblige your obedient servant,

Benton ville. My force is now Colonel Hebert’s regiment of Louisiana volunteers, aggregate 868; Colonel Churchill’ s regiment of Arkansas mounted riflemen, aggregate 768; Colonel Gratiot’s regiment of State infantry, aggregate 629; one battalion of Arkansas infantry, aggregate 277; two companies of mounted riflemen, aggregate 156; Captain Reid’s State battery of four guns, aggregate 73: making an aggregate of Confederate forces 2,069, and an aggregate of State forces 702. The total aggregate of my command is 2,771.
Since my last communication I have ascertained that General Lyon, who with his force of 3,000 was threatening the rear of the forces of the governor of Missouri, has formed a junction with a Kansas force of
2.000,	and has marched to Springfield, and is no doubt there by this time. This re-enforcement will swell the force at Springfield to 9,000 or
10.000.	* These forces are now busily engaged in fortifying Springfield, and I am of the opinion that all the Federal forces in the southern part of Missouri have concentrated at Springfield, and will bejjusily engaged for some time in strengthening that place. I am anxious to march against them, and if all of the available force now near me could be depended upon I think we could meet with success, or at least cut them off entirely from their supplies and re-enforcements; but upon consulting with General Price, in command of the Missouri forces, I find that his force of 8,000 or 9,000 men is badly organized, badly armed, and now almost entirely out of ammunition. This force was made by the concentration of different commands under their own generals.' The consequence is that there is no concert of action among them, and will not be until a competent military man is put in command of the entire force. Under these circumstances I do not think that there is any disposition on the part of the Missourians to advance until they are better prepared.
General Pearce, commanding the Arkansas State forces of the Western Division, is still at Camp Walker, near Maysville, Ark., with 2,200 men. General McBride, I also learn, is at the head of about 2,000 Missourians to the northeast of my position in Missouri. Were these forces •properly armed, and supplied with the necessary ammunition, I think by rapid concentration we could drive the Federal forces out of Spring-field, release the secession prisoners now there, and give our friends a chance of rallying around us. At present, however, the condition of the Missouri forces will not, warrant me in marching with my sruall command. I have therefore chosen a strong position here, and will probably wait until the Missourians are prepared to act. I am satisfied that I can keep back any force that may be sent in this direction.
In a communication to me you authorized me to receive Colonel Carroll’s regiment, if it was either organized as an infantry or cavalry regiment. This regiment is now in the State forces, under General Pearce, and as there is no disposition to make it an infantry regiment, and knowing how inefficient it will be as cavalry on account of the want of the proper arms, I have directed Captain McIntosh instead of it to muster into service for twelve months one battalion of infantry and one battalion of mounted riflemen. The infantry battalion is already mustered in and two companies of the mounted riflemen are also mustered in. Should other armed infantry companies present themselves I would respectfully request authority to increase the battalion to a regiment.
The regiment of Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians is no doubt now all assembled at Scullyville, about 15 miles from Fort Smith. I will arm them as soon as the arms can be sent, and keep them there as a check

on the Cherokees. The same disposition will be made of the Greek regiment, should one be organized.
I organized the battalion of mounted riflemen because the companies that will compose it are well acquainted with the country about here, and will be of much use as scouts, &c. I hope my action in regard to these matters will meet with your approval.
The cavalry here is very inefficient, and I have sufficient already, and in fact too much, to supply with forage.
I do not think that any force is now threatening the Indian Territory. I have frequent communication from the northern part through trusty men. Should any movement be made in that direction I will have timely notice of it and will be prepared. Should a force be marched into the Indian Territory, it will be necessary to leave a force on this road. I will take occasion to say that the force in my camp are all armed, either with the flint-lock or percussion musket, and that we have sufficient ammunition for the present.
The men are Ml healthy and in good spirits. They are a fine body of men, and through constant drilling are becoming very efficient. I place a great deal of reliance upon them.

Hon. L. P. Walker,
Secretary of War:
The governor of Tennessee is still waiting for information he has been soliciting, as I understand him, from the War Department as to certain details before he transfers his army.
In the mean time he consents to allow that army to be directed by me in certain operations I deem now expedient in Missouri. I have therefore directed General Pillow to detach from the force in the western district of Tennessee a column of 6,000 troops of various arms, and to make a movement on Missouri through New Madrid. He will be joined so soon as he lands by 3,000 Missourians, now posted near that place, and, as he goes forward, with other forces that are prepared to come to him. Governor Jackson arrived here yesterday while my preparations were in progress, and I shall find him willing, I think, instead of proceeding to Richmond, as he was intending, to return to Missouri, to aid in raising and concentrating his people. (Since writing the above

the governor gives his consent to return to Missouri with our troops.)
I am advised by General Hardee that he is at Pocahontas, and will soon have a column of 7,000 men ready to co-operate with Pillow’s column. There are about 2,500 Missourians near him, who will join him. Governor Jackson left McCulloch’s camp, on the Arkansas line, on the 12th. McCulloch’s force consisted of 6,000 men—Louisianians and troops from Arkansas. He was expecting every moment a Texas regiment and an additional Arkansas regiment. His force, I learn, is well distributed as to the different description of arms. Near him is General Price, 12 miles distant, with a force of 12,000 Missourians, ready to co-operate with him. This column of 25,000 men I am in communication with. They will advance on the enemy’s position (Springfield), where I learn General Lyon has concentrated the principal part of his force, say 10,000 or
12.000	men. In the mean time I shall, on Saturday next, direct the column of which 1 have spoken, under General Pillow, to cross the river to New Madrid and take up the line of march into Missouri for Ironton. He will be joined by 3,000 Missourians, now near New Madrid, very fairly armed and equipped, and by the time he is ready to move I shall send him two other regiments (Martin’s and Bowen’s), both of which are nearly ready for the field. With this force of 11,000, having as a part of its appointments three batteries complete, with two extra guns, he will find no difficulty in reaching the point indicated. At that point he will be joined by General Hardee with a s column of 7,000, who will move about the same time from Pocahontas. They are directed to pass in behind Lyon’s force by land, or to proceed to Saint Louis, seize it, and, taking possession of the boats at that point, to proceed up the river Missouri, raising the Missourians as they go, and at such point as may appear most suitable to detach a force to cut off Lyon’s return from the West. Any supporting force that may become necessary I will draw from Arkansas, from whence I am promised
10.000	additional troops at an early day. I shall draw three of the regiments to go with Pillow from Union City, and shall order up the three Mississippi regiments, under General Clark, to replace them. General Clark’s headquarters will be transferred to Union City. General Cheatham will accompany General Pillow.
As to the force on this side the river, Governor Harris is increasing it by fresh accessions, and it will in a few days be as strong as it was before we sent forward the five regiments you called for. I find, too, I could strengthen it very materially by drawing men from Kentucky and organizing them on the border, and I may add that every man we draw out of Kentucky relieves us from drawing by so much on Tennessee and the States south of us. I submit to the Department, therefore, whether facilities—extra facilities—should not be placed at our disposal for drawing a force from Kentucky.
As to Bird’s Point and Cairo, I know the exact force there to be about
5.000	men, divided between the two places. I have also information that they are short of men in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, who could be spared now to give support to Cairo. Besides that, they are without arms. I have no apprehension, therefore, of any strong support being sent to that point while I am operating in Missouri, or that they could send in any force strong enough in my rear to be formidable. Added to that, my forces at Union City and Bandolph will hold them in check. If, as I think, I can drive the enemy from Missouri with the force indicated, I will then enter Illinois and take Cairo in the rear on my return. With the prestige of your great success at Manassas the

Old Choctaw Agency, July 25,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President Confederate States of America, Richmond:
Sir : The organization of the Choctaw and Chickasaw Regiment of Mounted Rifles will be completed this week, but as yet no arms have been furnished at Fort Smith for them.* I hope speedy and effectual measures will be taken to arm the people of this (Indian) Territory— the Creeks, Seminoles, Cherokees. These will be all right now. The Choctaws and Chickasaws can furnish 10,000 warriors if needed. The Choctaws and Chickasaws are extremely anxious to form another regiment.
There seems to be a disposition to keep the Indians at home. This seems to me bad policy. They are unfit for garrison duty, and would - be a terror to the Yankees.
I hope you will excuse the freedom with which I write, but the Fort Smith clique, who oppose me in everything, right or wrong, seem to have obtained a controlling influence on matters at headquarters.
Captain Pike has intimated that the holding of the agency for the Choctaws and Chickasaws and that of colonel of their regiment are u incompatible.” It has been the effort of the set with whom he is identified for years to break me down, and especially to get control of the Choctaw and Chickasaw agency. Pike himself has not entered into this scheme heretofore, but his hint shows that an excuse is only wanted to do so. Now, the Confederate States having adopted the old intercourse law, there is no difficulty in the way. The President, as you know, can assign to any military officer the duties of Indian agent. My own opinion, formed long since, is that military officers should in all cases perform the duties of Indian agents. I have taken the oath of allegiance and the pledge to accept the Indian agency as required by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Mr. Hubbard.
Colonel Greer’s regiment from Texas will arrive near my camp, 10 miles west of this, to-night. I learn it, too, is poorly armed. The Indians have few or no guns. I could not arm over three companies from all the guns in the regiment.

The men are being turned over to the Confederate States. The process so far has been slow.
The troops are much in want of clothing of every description, shoes, shirts, socks, pantaloons, and coats and hats. I hope that this matter may be attended to promptly by the military board. #
I inclose a requisition for camp and garrison equipage and for such other supplies as are absolutely required.
I shall make a requisition on Memphis for 50 additional wagons and harness complete. This was my understanding with the board, and I wish to fulfill fully my part of the agreement.

The extreme necessity of the forces under command of Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, of Missouri, now in the southwest corner of that State, has induced the military board of the State of Arkansas, as a means of temporary relief, to advise to credit of the State $10,000. Supposing that the Confederate States are making common cause with your Southern friends in Missouri, we ask that the Confederate authority approve and assume the payment of the loan we have made.

Maj. Gen. Sterling Price,
Commanding, &c., CowsMn Prairie:
General : I received your communication of the 19th instant, inviting my co-operation in a combined attack of the forces under McCulloch, Pearce, and yourself on the Federal forces at Springfield, Mo. I regret to say that it is impossible for me at this time to move my command. The forces in Arkansas are now being transferred to the Confederate States. Only about 800 men have been so transferred, and I have actually under my command less than 2,300 men. When all the forces in this part of the State are transferred, I shall have less than 5,000 men, badly organized, badly equipped, and wanting in discipline and instruction. One of my batteries has no harness and no horses, and not one of the regiments has transportation enough for active field service. I have not been in command a week. I am doing all in my power to remedy these deficiencies, but it takes time to get harness and transportation. I do not wish to march to your assistance witn less than 5,000 men, well appointed, and a full complement of artillery. With every desire to aid and co-operate with the forces in the West, I am compelled at this time to forego that gratification. I hope at no distant day to be able to lend you efficient aid in overthrowing the Federal domination in Missouri.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Department No. 2,
Memphis, Tennn July 28, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
I had the honor of addressing you a few days ago, informing you of a movement I was contemplating on Missouri. I submitted a statement of what I understood to be the force which had been collected by Generals McCulloch and Pearce, of Arkansas, General Price, of Missouri, and General Hardee. The information submitted was based, as far as the commands of the first three generals are concerned, on information 1 obtained from Governor Jackson, of Missouri, who came directly from their respective camps. The force under General Hardee I obtained from a letter from himself. Upon the supposition that this information was correct it was that my letter containing the plan of campaign I submitted was written. Since dispatching that letter I have directed General Pillow to move a column of 6,000 across the river to New Madrid. The details of the movement have been left to him, and the forces employed were exclusively those hitherto belonging to his command. Part were taken from Randolph and part from Union City. General Cheatham accompanied him, and 1 have ordered General Clark to move up from Corinth to Union City the two Mississippi regiments at that place to replace those withdrawn, and himself to replace General Cheatham in the command of that post. I have not as yet heard from General Pillow the result of the movement beyond Randolph. The boats with troops from that point left there last night.
Since yesterday I have had to arrive at headquarters the gentleman who is the bearer of this, Colonel Little, adjutant-general of the forces of Missouri. He comes directly from General Price’s camp. From him I learn that the force stated to be under the command of the respective generals above, as stated by Governor Jackson, is greatly exaggerated, to the extent, indeed, of one-half. As a military man he would of course be likely to be more accurate than the governor, and his position of adjutant would compel him to know the extent of his own immediate^ force.,, The governor, I do not doubt, was deceived, and withal not perhaps very critical as to details.
This abatement of the force disposable for the invasion of Missouri has caused me to pause in the execution of the plan indicated. I shall proceed to fortify my position at New Madrid, with the view of making it a base of operations, and will move forward as soon as circumstances will allow.
My opinion is, nevertheless, that now is the time to operate in Missouri, if we are to do anything towards setting her on her feet again; and I am also satisfied that the enemy in Virginia will be content for some months to come with their experiences at Manassas, and that they will make no forward movement there very soon. That will set them free to act in the West, and they will most probably commence active operations in Missouri. In that event we must have additional troops, and I submit whether I be not authorized to collect a force in Tennessee and from the States below sufficient to enable us to act vigorously in Missouri, while we maintain a strong position in front of Kentucky, ready for any contingency that may arise in that quarter. 1 shall find no difficulty in getting the force I need around me if I had the requisite authority.* The way to effect it is simply to say to picked men that if they will raise regiments they shall be mustered into the Confederate service. I am taking measures to collect arms dispersed through the

Southern States, and have been surprised to find how large a number there are that are available.
I am in want of a special judge-advocate for my department, and ask for the detail of Lieut. B. L. Hodge, of Dreux’s Louisiana battalion. I desire also to have Lieut. George Williamson, of the same battalion, relieved and sent to me for duty. I wish him to act as one of my aides. I want him as legal counselor. I have asked also for Dr. Anderson as medical director of my department. He has been appointed surgeon, and directed to report to General Anderson. I should like still to have him, and think he can be of more service in this Mississippi bottom region, with the diseases of which he is especially familiar, than in the mountains of East Tennessee. I submit the names of Dr. B. W. Avent and Dr. John D. Winston, who are the other members of the Tennessee military board, either of whom would no doubt be acceptable to General Anderson.
I desire to add that it is agreed by our medical staff that the offices of medical director and medical purveyor for such a department as this cannot be performed by the same person; and if they could they ought not to be, as the one has to pass upon the accounts of the other. I recommend Dr. Potts, now in commission, for medical purveyor, and Dr. Anderson for medical director of this department.
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S.—Eor particulars as to Missouri I refer you to the bearer of this, Colonel Little.
Headquarters, Pocahontas, July 28,1861.
Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk,
Commanding Department Wo. 2, Memphis, Tenn.:
General : The Fifth Begiinent of Arkansas Volunteers, commanded by Colonel Cross, has been removed from the Saint Francis to this place. Chalk Bluff has been considered a point of importance. A force has been stationed there to guard Crowly’s Bridge, by which an advance might be made into Arkansas. If NTew Madrid is occupied, there will be, in my opinion, no necessity of occupying Chalk Bluff; and, indeed, with the force I have at Pitman’s Ferry, I do not believe an invasion can be anticipated in that direction. If it should be attempted, I shall be in position to attack their rear.
I have had a courier from General Price, commanding the Missouri forces, also one from General McCulloch, advising me of their intention to move on Springfield, Mo., and asking my active co-operation. I was compelled to decline. The forces here are just in a transition state; only a portion has been transferred, and to-day I have less than 2,300 men under my command. WThen all are transferred I shall have only about 5,000, and these are badly equipped, and without discipline, without instruction, and without transportation. General McCulloch stated that he contemplated moving on Springfield about the 30th instant, where it is supposed General Lyon has a force of 12,000 men.
I have sent you a requisition for supplies; among other articles mentioned are wagons and harness. Since writing I have directed Captain Crump, one of the officers of my command, who is now at Vicksburg, to buy fifty wagons, with harness and mules, complete, and to call on you

through your quartermaster for funds to make the payment. I learn that transportation, including what is mentioned above, may be had at Vicksburg, Natchez, and New Orleans. I shall send this communication, with others, by express to Memphis, and in a few days I shall make my arrangements for communicatingyith you by express twice a week, and oftener if necessary.

I have much to do to get matters in order to-night, and make you this hurried dispatch simply to announce the result.
GID. J. PILLOW, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Headquarters, Pocahontas, July 29, 1861.
Major General Polk, Commanding, cfc., Memphis, Tenn.:
General: I received last night your dispatch of the 26th. In a communication sent to you by express yesterday, I informed you of the actual condition of my command, that the Arkansas forces had not been entirely turned over to me, and when turned over my entire force would number less than 5,000 men, badly equipped, and without the means of moving.
Since yesterday I have received information, which is thought reliable, that the enemy is moving in two columns from Ironton and Cape Girardeau upon Greenville. I shall at once send out a strong detachment to support General Jeff. Thompson, who says he will fight. My opinion is that General Pillow ought not to move upon Ironton until I am in readiness to support him. It has been my intention from the beginning to attack the force at Ironton, and my plan is to throw a considerable body of cavalry on the railroad between Ironton and Saint Louis, with orders to break up the road and burn the bridges, to prevent any re-enforcements being sent to Ironton, and at the same time to prevent the escape of the force from that place. I am still of opinion that this ought to be the mode in which the attack should be made, and that General Pillow and myself ought to move simultaneously from New Madrid, and Pitman’s Ferry, the distance to Ironton being about the same from either point.
I am organizing my force with the greatest energy. Two regiments now here are ordered above to-day, and I shall strain every nerve to

Pocahontas, Ark., July 30,1861. Major-General Polk, Commanding, Memphis, Tenn.:
My Dear General : It is a matter of the last importance that my command should be furnished without delay with transportation. With this view I have dispatched Colonel Cross to Memphis to consult with you, and procure the fifty teams complete which I had the honor to make a requisition for a few days ago.
I informed you that I had directed Captain Crump to procure the teams in Yicksburg, and when so procured to arrange with you about the payment. If not procurable in Yicksburg, do put Colonel Cross in the way of obtaining them elsewhere. I am more anxious than I can express to unite with General Pillow in the movement on Ironton, but to do so effectively, I must have more transportation, otherwise I shall be able to move only a part of my command.
With best wishes, truly yours,
W. J. HARDEE, Brigadier-General.
Captain Crump is at Yicksburg, and if you have not heard from him, do telegraph him on the subject. I am told mules are procurable in Natchez and New Orleans, also wagons and harness.
New Madrid, Mo., July 30,1861.
Major-General Polk:
Nothing of interest has occurred since my last dispatch. The advance of the Union [City] force has arrived safely. There are yet two regiments to come forward, which will not leave Union City till Thursday, for want of transportation for subsistence. The distance from

## p. 621 (#635) ############################################

﻿Chap. X.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-----CONFEDERATE.	621
Union City to the river is 42 miles. I am using every effort to draw together from the surrounding country all the transportation I can. Don’t know yet how much I can get. The positions in the interior occupied by the enemy are all abandoned, and he is concentrating his forces at Cape Girardeau. Troops faom Illinois and Saint Louis are being gathered in at that point, and we have reports that Fremont is there. The forces at Cairo are said to be crossing at Bird’s Point, and they are working night and day fortifying that place.
I understand that General Hardee will soon commence a forward movement, and that he will probably advance on the military road leading to Jackson, on the road from Cape Girardeau to Ironton. Until I hear from him, however, I cannot know his purpose. Brigadier-General Thompson, who now is in command of Watkins’ force, is at Bloomfield. He has about 2,000 men, badly armed.
I will need more force before I can advance upon Cape Girardeau, unless Hardee unites with me. The enemy will have from 8,000 to 10,000 men there; a force too strong, combined with the Bird’s Point forces, for me to attack alone. If Hardee would advance on the route, at some point between this and Cape Girardeau we would dislodge the enemy. The forces at Bird’s Point and Cape Girardeau will be united when my movements indicate my route. That force is too large to leave in my rear. The route across the country to Ironton does not furnish subsistence. It is important that Martin’s regiment should be sent forward to occupy Fort [Pillow ?], and let Neely’s regiment, now in efficient condition, come to my support. This would give Martin an opportunity to drill his troops, and qualify them for the field.
If another new regiment could take the place of Walker’s, at Randolph, and let that regiment come forward, I could then advance and sweep the enemy from my way. I will keep you advised of everything that will interest you. My work of constructing the battery is going on.
With great- respect, your obedient servant,
GID. J. PILLOW,
General, Commanding.

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk :
In reply to your dispatch of yesterday we have to say, that at the time of the first transfer of volunteers to Brigadier-General Hardee, the additional ten regiments were spoken of as a valuable body of reserve as connected with the forces then turned oVer to him. Our agreement with Colonel Johnson is consistent with this idea, and we decline to change it; we appreciate the fact, however, that the generals in command make such disposition of forces as will best subserve the public good, and expect they will do so.

Camp near Cassville, Mo., July 30, 1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I am now at this place with my command on my way to Springfield. Since my communication of the 18th I have been busily engaged in preparing my force for a forward march, and have also been urging on the commanders of the different forces near me to be ready to co-operate with me.
By furnishing the Missouri force with all the ammunition I could spare, and also what could be spared from General Pearce’s command, I have given them sufficient to warrant them in again taking the field. General Price, with his force of between 9,000 and 10,000 men, is encamped around Cassville. His effective force will hardly reach 7,000, and they are nearly all armed with shot-guns and common rifles. General Pearce, of Arkansas, is within 10 miles of Cassville with his command of 2,500 men. His infantry is well armed. My brigade is also near me, amounting to about 3,200, nearly all well armed. I shall

move towards Springfield as rapidly as possible with the entire force, and hope soon to put the Missourians again in possession of it.
I communicated my plans to General Hardee at Pocahontas, Ark., and suggested the propriety of his making a demonstration at the same time on Eolla, in Missouri, the terminus of the Southwestern Eailroad. I have been compelled to furnish other commands with so much of my ammunition that my supply is now very limited, and if the enemy are re-enforced it may be necessary to have a large supply here to carry on the war. In any event it is necessary to have a supply sent tp Fort Smith for the use of my command, and I hope you will see the necessity of at once sending me a large amount of flint-lock musket cartridges, percussion musket cartridges for percussion and minie muskets, and caps, and such cannon ammunition for field pieces as can be spared.
We are very much in need of caps, both for the musket and the ordinary rifle. 1 am In hopes that you have sent me the cavalry arms that I have applied for in former communications. Major Clark has notified me that the ammunition lately sent for the use of the brigade (seventy boxes of musket cartridges and a quantity of accouterments) were lost with the steamboat William Henry, on the Arkansas Eiver.
I write in haste, as I move early to-morrow morning. I herewith inclose my general order of march, which has been left to me, and which the generals commanding other forces have agreed to observe.

regiment; but when I concluded with them the very important treaty of July 10, instant, they strenuously insisted that the colonel of the regiment to be raised should be elected by the men. As the public interest did not require I should insist on a contrary provision, by which I might have jeoparded the treaty, I yielded, and the consequence is that by the treaty, as signed and ratified by the Creek council, the field officers are all to be elected by the men of the regiment.
This being the case, I have this day written Colonel Garrett, requesting him to inform the Creeks immediately, as I have already done, that notwithstanding his appointment they will elect their colonel. If he should not do so he will cause much mischief, and would deserve severe censure; but I do not doubt he will promptly do it.
I embrace this opportunity to inform you that the organization of eight companies of the Creek regiment has been reported to me, of three of which complete rolls have been furnished, and that I have accepted these three, to be mustered into service by General McCulloch. Have certified rolls in duplicate, and forwarded one copy to the general.
I have, written fully to the Secretary of State in regard to the necessity of at once receiving this regiment and a battalion offered by the Semi-noles, and he will no doubt • confer with you on the subject. Colonel Cooper informs me that the Choctaw and Chickasaw regiment is raised and ready to receive its arms. The Creeks would readily raise and offer another battalion; and in the condition of the Cherokee country, and as an invasion of this region from Kansas is threatened, I think it would be well to accept it. Two thousand Creeks and Seminoles against Lane’s and Montgomery’s marauders will be a force not to be despised.
I take an escort of 56 Creeks and’ Seminoles, organized as a company, as'my escort to the Wichita country, where I am going to treat with the wild Comanches of the prairie; and I consider it no small matter, in the present state of affairs on our border, that we have so dealt, by fairness and frankness, with these brave and honest Indians, so lately at war with us, and whose old homes we possess, that thgy are now with us almost to a man, as zealous as we are for the rights of the South.
I have the honor to be, very truly, your obedient servant,

Adjutant-General’s Office, Choctaw Nation,
Scullyville, August 1,1861.
His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Confederate States: :
Sir : I have the honor to inform you that the regiment of mounted rifles authorized for the service of the Confederate States from among the Choctaws and Chickasaws ha& been raised, and is now fully organized according to law. When supplied with arms, I can justly state no more ardent, efficient, and patriotic body of warriors will be found under the banner of Southern independence.
It is an unkind and certainly an incorrect statement, made by some Southern journals, that the Indian warriors design using the scalping-knife in any conflict in which they may be engaged with the enemy. These warriors are a civilized people, are Christians in principle, observe the Army Regulations, and drill with commendable closeness, and will show, when proper occasion offers, they are worthy the age, the cause, and the brotherhood they share with their white allies.
There are two Choctaw and one Chickasaw companies organized, besides the number authorized, that are very anxious to enter the service. I learn there will shortly be organized one Choctaw and one Chickasaw company more, expecting to be called into the field.
Five additional companies can be raised in the two nations. It is presumed that the failure of the Cherokees to furnish the regiment asked of them will insure the Choctaws and Chickasaws a chance to supply that deficiency to the extent of a battalion of three or five companies, if not an entire regiment. Such an order from the War Department would be eminently just to our Chickasaw brethren, because, ffir good reasons, they have been enabled to furnish only about twenty men to the first regiment. I believe the men who would answer another call would enter the service until the close of the war, and, if necessary, could be armed at home with shot-guns and old-pattern rifles to the number of five hundred. More than half that number have Colt’s six shooters. This portion of our people, being what are termed half-breeds, most all speak the English language, and have better horses and more arms than the full-bloods, who comprise most of those already in the service. I would urge upon your excellency a further call for warriors among the people of the two nations. It would allay a disappointment and rivalry toward the Choctaws, now apparent among the Chickasaws, to allow them to furnish two or three companies to the service, and strengthen the many relations destiny has affixed to the contiguity of soil and the similarity of interests of the Southerners and the Indians of the South.
In view of an anticipated call for warriors, it affords me great pleasure to testify to your excellency the propriety of giving the command of them to Josephus Dotson, esq., of Fort Smith, Ark. His high standing among the leaders of both the Choctaw and Chickasaw people, and his services for seven years as a legal adviser, political sympathizer, and steadfast friend, is fully attested by the recommendations from the principal national authorities of both nations, asking his appointment to the lieutenant-colonelcy of the regiment now in the service, which are now on file in the War Office at Richmond.
I ask the appointment of Mr. Dotson, knowing the brave men among us so eager for the field would rally around him with increased enthusiasm, and believing he would lead them at any hour with credit to the Confederacy. I learn Mr. Dotson designs aiding in the organiza-40 R II—VOL III

Major-General Polk, 0. S. Army:
The enemy are exceedingly active in pushing his works at Bird’s Point. The ninety-days troops all went home from Cairo. They are supplying their place by large additions of troops (I suppose new levies). They are cutting down all the timber around Bird’s Point and pushing their defenses. A large force is concentrating at Cape Girardeau. My information induces the belief that they look for the attack at the Cape, and that is the point, and only one, which I can well advance upon. I have no news from Hardee: my messenger has not returned. It is, as you know, essential that I shall have a stronger force in hand before I advance into the interior. I must have the support of Hardee’s force. There are few now left in this part of the State except the old men; they have gone down to join Bowen’s regiment.
I have a prospect of drawing four companies from Kentucky. I before advised you that Thompson’s brigade (Walker’s) was about 2,000 strong and badly armed. I am pushing up the defenses at this place, having some 160 negroes at work on the wrork. I will be able, I think, to get 100 wagons and teams, but no wagon covers; they should be made with the bows at Memphis and sent forward as early as possible. Cheatham is on the way, having left Union City this morning. I am drilling the troops closely and fitting the command to march as early as possible.
I beg yon to press Hardee to move and join me here. If he should not join me at this place, crossing the swamp on the plank road below here, we cannot unite our forces until I shall have passed Cape Girardeau, a point my force will not be able to move upon without additional force. The swamp is impassable all the way to Jackson, except on the plank road.
If Hardee should not join me, we cannot unite our forces before we reach Jackson. You will therefore see the necessity of giving me the support of Hardee’s forces or supports from below. I have a good deal of sickness among the troops, some measles and diarrhea, and some fever, but not a great deal.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
GID. J. PILLOW, General, Commanding.

I am in receipt of dispatches from General Hardee. He states that he was in receipt of telegraphic dispatches from General McCulloch. Hardee was about to advance with 3,000 men (leaving balance of his force, which he states less than 5,000, for want of transportation). He

marches directly upon Greenville, which you will see by the map is on the direct road to Ironton, and that he leaves me to clear away the forces accumulating on the river, intending to engage my force if I do not dodge them by going out through the mountain, and then these forces may be thrown upon our rear. I must engage the force at Gape Girardeau. I cannot leave it in rear, and were I to do so, if it did not fall upon my rear it would certainly thrgw itself against my base here. I therefore consider it a necessity to engage that force. In doing so, I will have to fight the forces now at Bird’s Point, for it will certainly be thrown up to the Cape when my movements indicate my route. As I cannot have the co-operation of Hardee’s force, I wish you to send me two or three more regiments as promptly as practicable. There is no use in the forces remaining at Randolph and Fort Pillow, while I am in possession of the river above and occupy his entire forces above. He has no preparation for a river movement ; his gunboats cannot get out of the Ohio; he has no fleet of steamboats adequate for the purpose, and he can take no step towards such a movement for want of troops. The force at these points ought to be advanced to my support at once, leaving the artillery companies to take care of the guns. You might, without any sort of risk, send one of the Union City regiments to occupy the position at Fort Pillow or Randolph, if you thought proper. It is certain my five regiments (weakened by sickness to an average of about 700) and battalion of infantry, 395 strong, and my cavalry, is too small a force to advance upon such duty, especially when I leave a sufficient force here to garrison the posts. I do not place much confidence, as you will perceive, on Thompson’s force—less since I know its character and manner in which it is armed than I did before. If you will send me Walker’s and Neely’s regiments I will move in three days after their arrival, and 1 will cut my way through to Ironton, and there form a union with Hardee.
I address this dispatch for the express purpose of getting you to advance these two regiments. They are more efficient than any other regiment remaining below. If we can push the movement forward rapidly now, we can do the work of expelling the enemy promptly and return. The swamp makes it impossible to form a union with Hardee, as he has taken the Greenville route. If you will authorize me to act upon my own judgment I will at once order up these two regiments, and occupy the works below with a battalion in each of Martin’s or a Union City regiment. Give me the force as early as possible. I have the Gheeny in possession; she was captured and brought down last night by four gentlemen from Mobile.
Hardee says in his dispatch that McCulloch was about to advance on Springfield. I have sent back nearly all my transports. The new Falls City, the Winson, the Simons, and others, are below.
Please advise me as early as possible what you determine upon.

Let him come forward as early as possible.

Sir : Your letter of yesterday, to General Thompson, was received to-day at 12 noon.* General Thompson left yesterday morning for New Madrid, and will not probably return until noon to-morrow. Having been left temporarily in command of the forces here, and knowing the character of the business which called him to New Madrid, it would not be prudent, under the circumstances, for me to move these forces, as requested in your letter. I believe that General Thompson will take pleasure in co-operating with you, and that he will avail himself of your invitation for a personal conference at an early day.

Major-General Polk :
The bearer of this, Mr. Townsend, is just from our friends in Saint Louis. He will explain to you fully his mission and will give you information which it is proper you should have in regard to the strength and purposes of the enemy. I will be prepared to throw forward my advance column on Wednesday and to follow up the movement with the entire force at my disposal as rapidly as it can be advanced. My march to Cape Girardeau will be through the river bottom all the way, and there is very serious trouble about getting water for my men and animals. I cannot move with safety to my force and in strength enough to do the work before me without the additional force asked for. It is probable that I will before reaching Cape Girardeau cut the enemy’s line of water communication between the cape and Cairo by seizing Commerce and planting a battery there, and holding that place until I can cut up the force at the Cape. This I will do if I find the enemy have not concentrated before I reach Benton, provided I have force enough to detach a regiment and battery.
The views I expressed, and the necessity which prompted my last dispatch, are greatly strengthened by the information Mr. Townsend brings. He left Saint Louis the day before yesterday morning. My

force ordered to destroy the railroad above have returned, and report that they destroyed one-quarter of a mile, and did it well, by burning up everything. I have made arrangements with Mr. Townsend to return to Saint Louis and with his secret society to destroy large portions of the Iron Mountain Boad. This is essential to be done, and to be done as quickly as possible, as a means of crippling the enemy in the future movements looking to a concentration of forces to meet us. I wish you to advise me as early as possible if you will order up the regiments asked for with Hamilton’s company to work this battery*

Major-General Polk,
Commanding Department No. 2, Memphis, Tenn.:
General : Learning that the enemy, numbering from 800 to 1,500 men, had left Ironton for this place, I immediately advanced with 1,000 infantry, 250 cavalry, and a battery of artillery to meet him. Hearing of our approach, he packed up and retired towards Ironton.
I have sent a party of Missourians to burn the bridges and tear up the railroad between Ironton and Saint Louis. If accomplished, I shall not hesitate to advance upon Ironton. The enemy does not number more than 3,000, and although I have but 1,250,1 can have, if I need them, the aQtive co-operation of 1,000 to 1,500 Missourians. The great point is to cut them off from re-enforcements or from communication with Saint Louis. In any event I shall not send this command back to Pitman’s Ferry. I am anxious to unite with General Pillow in any movement that will free Missouri. He ought to have 10,000 men in his column; 6,000 at least. I shall not be able to advance with more than 4,000. With 10,000 or 14,000 men we ought to move to the attack of any force in Missouri. I would recommend you to look out against an advance into Tennessee. It would strengthen the Federals to make a successful move anywhere at this time, particularly to take a place of such strategic and commercial importance as Memphis. I judge that a brave movement into Missouri would do much to prevent an offensive movement of the enemy into Tennessee. I should be pleased to have your views at all times.
Be pleased to see that my requisition for 90 days’ provisions for 7,000 men are filled; if not sent, my men will be in a starving condition; also that all my requisitions for quartermaster and medical stores are sent without delay.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,

I have just received a dispatch from General Jeff. Thompson’s camp, informing me that the general is absent at New Madrid, and the officer second in command declines to move without the orders of the general. It was from this force that I expected assistance.
I desire you will send me without delay 400 flour sacks and 50 wagon covers. My quartermaster is not with me, or I would have him make out a regular requisition.

Headquarters Army of Liberation,
New Madrid, Jfo., August 5,1861.
Major-General Polk:
Your dispatch of the 30th ultimo is acknowledged. From its contents I infer that you are of the opinion that ‘any movement into the interior should be suspended. If such is your opinion, it occurs to me that it should never have been made. I have never been in favor of occupying this place, except as a base of operations for movements into the interior, looking to substantial relief to Missouri.
As a strategical point, this is not a strong position. If the enemy contemplate an early movement down the river, our position here is not favorable for arresting it. It would have been better, in this view of the case, to have occupied the positions indicated before at Eandolph and Fort Pillow, and not have extended our line of posts so far forward. As we extend our line of posts forward we necessarily weaken our means of protecting them. I would never have consented to occupy and garrison this place. Indeed, I did not understand you as wishing or expecting it. I do not know the information you have from General Hardee, but my information here is, that General Hardee has already advanced with 3,000 men to Greenville, and that he was moving upon Ironton. I do not think there is a doubt about his being there now.
I am satisfied the enemy are not now in condition to advance, neither do I think he will attempt to do so before fall. He is hard at work fortifying his position at Bird’s Point, and alarmed at the prospect of an early attack. I am in receipt of news from his positions almost every day. If we are to move at all, we should do so promptly. If we are to await his pleasure and the accumulation of his forces, then this is not the proper place to meet him. If I am to move forward, my force must be strengthened. If I am not to go forward, it is certainly a very unfortunate movement. If the enemy should determine to make a move down the river in strength, the force here has no advantage of position, whereas at Fort Pillow and Eandolph they could repel three times their number. With additional force and united with Hardee’s command, we could cut our way anywhere; we could certainly expel the enemy from the interior even if we left the river infested with their forces. Destroy the railroad running into the interior, and you at once cripple the enemy’s movements to such an extent that the country could organize and protect itself. I am clearly of the opinion that we should advance promptly or abandon this place.
There is no room here for troops, and miserable water where we are forced to encamp. There is no alternative but to go forward or fall back. If I am to be held in command of this position or to go forward abandoning my base of operations, I would prefer the latter course, though such a measure would be fraught with peril. If this place is to be held, there should be not less than 10,000 men here; our present force held here would invite attack. A small force would be much safer in the interior than it is here. The river furnishes such means of approach, that they can throw upon this place in three hours any amount of force at their disposal, whereas in the interior they would be obliged to resort to our mode of transportation. You promised me the co-operation of Hardee’s force. He is clear out of reach. My views are fully before you, and I shall await your decision.

Maj. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow,
Commanding Army of Liberation,• New Madrid, Mo. .*
Dear Sir: I reached my quarters at 7 o’clock, and found positive orders from General Hardee, dated last Friday, to move to his assistance^ once to Greenville or some point northward. Hardee’s command was at Greenville Saturday night, and probably at this time is at Pilot Knob or Ironton. My men made no move, as they were entirely unable to do so when I was away. I sent 250 dragoons to a point a few miles west of Lakeville at daybreak, and will send 500 infantry to support them, and then await further orders, as I have forwarded your letter, with one from myself, to General Hardee, by Colonel Hoy, with an escort of 5 men, and he will get your letter by 10 o’clock to-morrow. The news that I find from Cape Girardeau in very contradictory. Some say that all the forces have left the Cape, and others deny it. The boats certainly went below, with the men on board, but whether they returned on Saturday night, or landed at Commerce, remains to be seen.
I expect reliable information in the morning, but, after this, will leave.
I will be on the qui vive, although Hardee says I must immediately come to him, and, if I do not receive another dispatch to-morrow, I will go to see him to-morrow night. The position my men will have will place them towards Benton.
Yours, respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
P. S.—Another order from General Hardee has just arrived. He commands my support, and I will march with all my support in the morning, on the line between Ironton and Cape Girardeau. I will leave a guard here to bring up my cannon.
New Madrid, August 6, 1861.
[General Polk :]
General : Governor Jackson returns to Memphis to see you. Hardee is in Greenville with 3,000 men ; he has ordered Thompson from Bloomfield to his support, and he has gone. These facts we learn from a dispatch just received from General Thompson. This leaves me here in an exposed position, without any support from any quarter. There is intelligence from above of the movements of the enemy which we do not understand. If our information is reliable as to his movements (and they came through different channels), it would seem that a movement on this place, in two columns of about 4,000 each by land and a movement by the river, assailing my position in front and rear, are within his plans. My position in the rear does not admit of any defense in the rear, the whole country being an open plain. You must either support me and promptly, or you must order me back. The true policy is to give me the necessary support. While I am supported here the enemy cannot pass down the river. He will not attempt a movement down the river below your batteries without a stronger force than he has, but he can reach my position here in a few hours. If you think, however, that he m%y make the move down the river, it only increases the necessity of your giving such force here as will enable [me] to meet him at this place or to promptly order the force back; otherwise it would appear that my

Your obedient servant,
GIB. J. PILLOW,

New Madrid, Mo., August 6,1861. General R. Y. Richardson, Neve Madrid, Mo. :
Dear Sir: You will, as soon as possible, place the artillery which is in this district, belonging to the State of Missouri, or private property, upon an efficient footing and in good repair; and, as each piece is ready for the field, you will enlist, or I will detail, a sufficient number of men to manage it and put it in service. The State of Missouri is much in need of the guns. You will therefore take the authority that may be necessary to accomplish the object of the foregoing paragraph, and when the organization reaches a sufficient number (as contemplated by the law regulating our army), the men then can hold their elections. You may select such subordinates as will be necessary (until the election above referred to), subject to the approval of the general commanding or the governor. General Pillow will furnish the necessary ammunition and you can have cannon wagons fitted instead of caissons. Time is the most important item now in this war, and you will therefore act as promptly and speedily as possible. Your quartermaster will (under the division quartermaster) purchase or procure the necessary transportation, for teams, outfit, and subsistence. The expense you have therefore been at or incurred will be embodied in a report to the quartermaster up to August 1, and I will have arrangements made for systematic reports hereafter.

I will have to march to Sikeston as fast as possible, and unless the demonstration which I made yesterday on Cape Girardeau with my dragoons may have answered the purpose, and I may meet another order leaving me again to carry out your plans, they will have to be suspended a little while. I have sent couriers after the persons whom I had sent to prepare the way for me to carry out the object by private enterprise, if possible, and report to you immediately if successful.

Commanding Department No. 2, Memphis, Tenn. :
General : 1 have received your comniunication of the 30th ultimo.* I have already informed you of my movement on this place and its object.
I inclose a copy of my communication to General Pillow on 'the subject of meeting with him at Benton, Mo. It contains fully my views on the subject of the military operations in Missouri. It will serve as a reply to that part of your letter relating to the same subject. I believe General Pillow ought not to attack Bird’s Point or Cape Girardeau. I do not believe any object can be attained by it commensurate with the inevitable loss. The enemy, according to General Pillow’s own account, can bring 10,000 men at either point to oppose him, intrenched,. 1 suppose.
I have been waiting further information from Ironton. The order I gave for burning the bridges and tearing up the railroad track has not been executed. I have had no information from Ironton for several days, though I have sought information from every source within my reach.
I inclose also copy of a letter to General Cooper f on the subject of the Arkansas troops which were accepted by Mr. G. P. Johnson on the part of the Confederate States, but which I declined, for reasons stated in that communication, to receive.
I inclose requisition for quartermaster stores, which you will please have forwarded without delay. I mentioned in a previous letter that I had made a requisition on you for 90 days’ provisions for 7,000 men. I mention it again, but hope it has been filled long ago.

This has been my expectation from the beginning, and I thought it probable that we would unite at or near this point. This was the understanding when I last heard from you. It is impossible, for many reasons, to unite with you at Benton. I have, as I stated in a previous dispatch, only a small portion of my force with me. The remainder is at Pitman’s Ferry.

ing my communications by moving in the direction proposed. My base is at Pitman’s Ferry, which I think should be yours. If you base your self on the Mississippi anywhere between New Madrid and Cape Girardeau, even if successful in your operations against, Bird’s Point and Cape Girardeau, your communications would be liable to constant interruptions.
I am reasoning on the supposition that you do not intend at present to cut loose entirely from your sources of supply. Without presuming to enlighten you on your course, I desire you to consider what you will gain by attacking either Cape Girardeau or Bird’s Point. To whip the enemy is certainly important at all times, but one ought always to fight with an object. What do you propose to accomplish by dislodging the enemy from these points? You can pass both places, in my opinion, without molestation. If they follow you, however, you can fight them greatly to your advantage in the field. If you take both places, they can occupy other points on the Mississippi, and your communications would still be open to attack. Your true policy is to unite with me here, take Ironton, march on Bolla; then abandon our base of operations, cut off Lyon from his communications, attack and rout him ; then march with all our forces combined (yours, McCulloch’s, Jackson’s, and mine) on Saint Louis. With Saint Louis in our possession, the points you are going to attack would be turned, and must fall as a necessary consequence.
The occupation of New Madrid is important. It ought to be held with a strong force. It checks the enemy from entering Arkansas either by Chalk Bluff or Pocahontas.
I am waiting for news from the party sent to burn the bridges between Ironton and Saint Louis.
Very respectfully,

Major-General Polk :
I received a dispatch at 3 o’clock this morning. General Hardee is at Greenville. Thompson was ordered back to be within supporting distance of my position, but I doubt if he will return. If the enemy should send down a large force against me I must fight it in the open field, and if surrounded, which can easily be done, you will perceive that my whole force will be in great danger.
If you hold this place, it is certain the enemy can get no lower down the river. If this force should not be able to hold its position, there is no reason for keeping it here when its power for defense would be more than doubled elsewhere. If not supported by a force adequate to the work and the exposed position nor withdrawn, I shall have no alternative left me but to abandon this place and go into the interior, where the force will be less exposed. Your course leaves me no other alternative.
My duty to the troops under my command requires me to adopt all possible expedients to avoid its sacrifice, and in my present position I see no other. If you cannot supply additional force and if you are apprehensive of an attempt to descend the river, why not place this force where its power would make the works at Forts Pillow and Bandolph impregnable ! I am satisfied the enemy will not attempt a descent so

﻿Char X.J	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—CONFEDERATI	635
low down as these works without large force, but he will certainly have a force in hand in a very short time to attack this place, and with my small force will crush me and take the work, and then, if he should go on down, with the small force left to defend the works at Pillow and Randolph, I see no reason why he could not take them also, but if there were troops enough here to protect this place he could not go below. If, however, this force should be cut up, and your whole force thus taken in detail, he will make a success of what otherwise could be successfully resisted. Before I agreed to come on this duty you assured me I should have the support of Hardee’s and Thompson’s forces, and you said you would give me a carte blanche. In all these assurances I am disappointed. It is painful to be under the necessity of thus complaining, but I am left without support, in an exposed condition, and with an inadequate supporting force, and though I have in three several dispatches explained everything to you, you fail to support me and place your disposable force below here, though you are fully advised of the danger of the position of this force, and you must know that if I am sacrificed here the forces below will also be sacrificed and the works all taken, whereas if this force was sustained or withdrawn to the strong position below, the country below would be safe.
I know what I have to do and am fully prepared to make any personal sacrifice, but I owe it to my command to avoid, if possible, so great a disaster to the country as their sacrifice would be. Controlled by these circumstances, my convictions of duty compel me to inform you that, unless assured of support, I shall take my whole force, abandon this place, and strike into the interior as the only course left. If the result should prove disastrous to my command or the country below,, the responsibility will not rest on me.
I am, general, with respect, &c.,

General Polk, Commanding Department No, 2, Memphis, Tenn,: General : When I made out my last requisition for quartermaster stores, I had not with me a copy of the requisition previously made for similar articles. If in that first requisition I called for articles required in the second, you will oblige me by not having them sent. I allude now to hatchets, pickaxes, spades, shovels, and tents. I succeeded, after several days7 delay, in securing the co-operation of General Jeff. Thompson, commanding the Missouri forces, in a movement on Ironton. He left me yesterday to perform his part of the enterprise, but last night received a dispatch from him stating that he had received a peremptory order from Governor Jackson to repair forthwith to Kew Madrid, to assist General Pillow, who was anticipating an attack from General Fremont. The railroad communication between Ironton and Saint Louis being still open, I do not feel authorized, with the small force under my command, to advance any farther. My cavalry are within 20 miles of Ironton, perhaps nearer. I shall fall back with the main force to a point about midway between this place and Pitman’s Ferry. My advance will remain at this point.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. J. HARDEE, Brigadier-General,

Major-General Polk:
My Dear General : I desire to say that I should be glad to have the Arkansas troops, if I had authority to receive them, for twelve months; and if,they were armed, I should be too happy to have you receive them, if you feel authorized to act, and turn them over to me. One regiment (Patterson’s) is now at or near Pocahontas, with orders to report to me. Under no circumstances ought this regiment to be taken from that point. Colonel Johnson mentioned to me your telegraph to the military board asking for troops. You are vested with greater powers than I am and [can] act, which I hope you will do.
If we are to reinstate Missouri, we must have more troops, and move in large columns against the enemy.
Yery truly, your friend,
W. J. HARDEE.

of Arkansas, and which you authorized Mr. G. P. Johnson to turn over to me.
I also inclose a copy of my instructions to Col. T. 0. Hindman, who is directed to proceed to the brigade of General Pearce, and receive from your agent, General Burrow, the troops under the command of General Pearce, in the service of the State of Arkansas. I regret I could not receive these troops sooner, but 1 have already informed you of my reasons for declining to do so.
If General McCulloch intends attacking Springfield, he has already done so.
I regret that I felt constrained to decline to accept the troops you kindly tendered to me. I want these regiments. My force is too small for offensive operations, but I did not have authority to do so.
I came here with about 1,200 men, to punish a party of the enemy numbering, it was estimated, from 800 to 1,500 men, who came from Ironton, it would seem, to plunder. Hearing of our approach, they left for Iron-ton. My advance is within about 18 or 20 miles of that place.
I have endeavored to interrupt communication between Ironton and Saint Louis by tearing up the railroad and burning the bridges, but my efforts thus far have been unsuccessful.
I came here expecting the co operation of 2,000 Missourians, under General Thompson. I placed myself yesterday (after several days’ delay) in communication with that officer, who promised to unite with me in an attack on Ironton. He parted with me anxious to perform his part of the expedition, but last night he sent me a dispatch stating that he had received peremptory orders from Governor Jackson to repair forthwith to New Madrid to assist General Pillow, who was anticipating an attack by General Fremont.
My force is at present too weak to advance on Ironton without his cooperation.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. J. HARDEE, Brigadier-General.

General : I received to-day by the hands of Mr. G. P. Johnson an agreement made by him with the military board of Arkansas, by which the military board has transferred to the Confederate States the troops recently called into the service of the State of Arkansas by proclamation of the governor. These troops Mr. Johnson expected me to receive, but I have declined to accept for the following reasons: From the letter of instructions given him by the Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, I do not believe he had authority to receive those regiments; on the contrary, his authority extended only to receiving the troops and munitions of war tendered to the Confederate States by the Convention. Again, I am satisfied that the Confederate States do not contemplate receiving troops without arms, and I am fully convinced that these regiments are only in part armed, and most of the arms they have unserviceable. I judge this from the domestic arms I have seen

in the hands of the Arkansas troops now in service. Moreover, I do not believe it is the practice or the policy of the Confederate Government to receive fresh troops from any of the States for a less period than three years or the war. The troops in, the condition I should receive them would be useless to me, and although Mr. Johnson thinks it was the intention of the Department that he should accept and that I should receive them, I have felt constrained to decline doing so without instructions.
If the Department will arm the troops and they will agree to serve for three years or the war, I should be happy to have them. My force is now too small for offensive operations.

Greenville, Mo., August 8,1861.
Col. T. C. Hindman, C. S. A.:
Colonel : You will proceed to the brigade of Arkansas troops commanded by Brigadier General Pearce, and, in accordance with the agreement made by the military board and the undersigned, you will muster them into the service of the Confederate States and take command of them.
General Burrow has been appointed by the military board to turn these troops over to the Confederate States, and from him you will receive them. You will receive three regiments only, and no general or staff officers will be received, except one surgeon and one assistant surgeon to each regiment. By law, the Confederate Government appoints all staff officers, including surgeons and assistant surgeons, but as these cannot be dispensed with, you will muster them into the service, to await the approval of the Secretary of War.
You will receive all public property in the hands of said troops and receipt for the same, consisting of quartermaster, commissary, medical, ordnance stores, and ordnance. Invoices will be given you by General Burrow, and when found correct by personal examination you will pass receipts for the same.
To expedite matters, colonels of regiments, or other officers commanding a separate body of troops, should furnish invoices of the public property in their possession.
After receiving the troops herein named you will march them by the shortest route to Pitman’s Ferry, except the cavalry, which you will station at such points on the western frontier of Arkansas as will best give protection to that portion of the State, and where they can be supplied with forage.
Make arrangements, also, by which they can be supplied with subsistence.
You will give Colonel Carroll, of that regiment, such written instructions for his guidance as the nature of the service may demand.
If the squadron of cavalry, under Captain Scott, stationed at or near Fayetteville, is not marching in this direction to join Colonel Borland, you will muster this force also into the service.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. J. HATRDEE, Brigadier- General.
P. S.—Station the cavalry under Captain Scott at such point on your route as will best protect the frontier.

Hon. E. 0. Cabell:
Dear Sir: Your dispatch communicating the welcome intelligence that the Confederate Congress had appropriated $1,000,000 for the defense of Missouri has been received. I hope to hear from you by letter to-day in detail in relation to it, and trust that arrangements will speedily be made by which it will be made available. I desire you to impress upon President Davis and his Cabinet the fact that the present military division of the territory contiguous to Missouri, south and west, is not such as to insure concert of action, nor calculated to fully meet the exigencies that may arise in conducting the campaign in Missouri. General Hardee and General McCulloch have each separate and distinct districts and commands, and Major-General Price has command of the Missouri forces. In carrying out the instructions of the President it may be proper, and indeed we expect and desire, the Confederate generals on our border to come into the State. Circumstances may require that these three distinct commands should be united, or that they should act in concert, though separately, for the accomplishment of a common object. As affairs now stand, though I do not specially apprehend it, it is possible there may be some distraction in counsel, jealousy of command, and consequent inefficiency and inaction. It has occurred to me that if President Davis would appoint a major-general for all that district of country lying west of General Polk’s district, and if he could go into Missouri accompanied by me, I could require and compel by my orders as complete co-operation on the part of the State troops as if they had been transferred to the Confederate service and were under his command. Thus all military operations would be completely under the control of one head.
I issued on the 5th day of August a declaration of independence, a copy of which I inclose.
I trust and feel that you will, as heretofore, use every endeavor for such action on the part of the Confederate States as will render our independence permanent.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
C. P. JACKSON.

[General Polk:]
General : Colonel Johnson, the authorized agent of the Confederate States Government, has received of the military authorities of Arkansas eight or ten regiments of troops. I understand from Colonel Johnson

﻿640	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
that General Hardee does not feel authorized to receive them. I have said to him that I needed and would receive them. I cannot, as you are aware, move without additional force. Hardee himself says that I ought not to attempt an advance with less than 10,000 men. I would be glad to have you at once and promptly order up the Arkansas troops. The position I occupy here protects Arkansas from invasion by the river and through Chalk Bluff. It is therefore but right and proper that those forces should be sent here. The authority of the Confederate Government to Colonel Johnson to receive these troops is full and complete, and being under the absolute necessity of having additional forces for the work before me, I have told Johnson to refer the case to you, and hope you will as promptly as possible order them up.
The Missouri forces are in the most inefficient possible condition. The authorities of the State have no funds, no means of subsisting the forces of the State; they have no regular organization of staff officers; they have no means of subsistence except such as is taken by them from the inhabitants of the country. There is no one authorized to give certificates for these seizures, and if this system of illegal seizures should be kept up, it will turn the feelings of the best friends of the South in the country against our cause. But, independent of this, it will be impossible to keep the Missouri forces in the field; they will disband, and in their present condition I would not blame them for doing so.
To obviate this difficulty, I have determined to accept any of these troops who will accept service in the Confederate Army tor and during the war.
I do not believe the information you received from Columbus is correct, and I have sent up by the river an armed steamer to report me the truth. I saw a man this morning from Wolf Island, which is in sight of Columbus, who says the report is incorrect. The enemy have thrown out a large force to the neighborhood of Charleston, and are repairing my burnt road; they have several thousand men out there, and about 1,500 men at York, 6 miles down the river from Cairo.
I have addressed you several dispatches, to which I invite your attention, so that I may know how to shape my course. If there is no prospect of my going forward I should know it, and cease my efforts to get transportation, and save the expense of subsisting so large a number of animals. This is a very heavy item of expense. I retain the Ingomar here for the present to bring across and up to this place Colonel Smith’s battery, which you advised me you had ordered up here.
GID. J. PILLOW,
General, Commanding.
P. S.—Since writing the above, I have seen a gentleman that left Columbus yesterday, and says there are no troops there and everything is quiet.
Little Rock, August 10, 1861.
Major-General Polk :
We have seven regiments completely organized. They are supplied with the domestic rifle, some of them sufficiently improved to be highly efficient. They are at the following places: Arkadelphia, 250 miles of Pocahontas; Benton, 200 miles of Pocahontas; Pine Bluff, 200 miles of Pocahontas; Springfield, 140 miles of Pocahontas; Yell ville," 120 miles of Pocahontas; Jacksonport, 40 miles of Pocahontas.
The one at Yellville is a local defense, and probably ought not to be moved. To the rest of them we will issue such orders as you suggest.

Camp Sikeston, Mo., August 10,1861. Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, 0. S. A., New Madrid, Mo.:
Dear Sir : Yours of this morning, ordering me to retreat or fall back to Moore’s, has been received, but I have sent to the country for meal, flour, &c., and have the party, mentioned in mine of 11.30 o’clock, and another, which is just starting, to strengthen a picket on the road to Benton to cover some wagons I have there, and watch a force of 500 men, who reached Benton this morning. Therefore I will be in no condition to fall back until morning, and will endeavor to hold my position until then, unless you positively request that I fall back to-night, which I can well do after dark, if necessary. If you will allow me, I would suggest that I think it proper, if possible, to hold this point as the key to Bird’s Point and Cape Girardeau, and, from the strength of picket, the enemy will believe that I have a large force here, and will not dare advance through the swamp, where I can whip him two to one, until convinced of my weakness, by which time you can strengthen me, and I will have 1,000 men more of my own. They are just learning that it is me that is here, as they have believed me at Greenville, and I am perfectly willing to risk holding this point with the two companies of cavalry you have sent me, if you will allow me to. Answer as soon as possible.
Yours, most respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

P. S.—-If I can stay here, please send the baggage of the cavalry companies on up 5 if not, we will all fall back to-night after supper. I prefer remaining.

fully intending to co-operate cordially in my operations and to carry out his part of the programme. The same night he received a peremptory order from Governor Jackson to repair forthwith to New Madrid to assist General Pillow in his operations against General Fremont. As the general felt compelled to obey, and being too weak without his assistance to make the attack, I have been compelled to defer making an advance until I get re-enforcements from below or General Pillow joins me. I have had no information from that officer for several days. 1 feel anxious to know what is going on at New Madrid, and what are his plans. I have ordered the occupation of Fredericktown, 40 miles in advance of this place, with 600 Missourians, under Colonel Lowe, and 250 mounted Arkansians, the whole under command of Colonel Borland. I have directed this officer to seize all the lead at mine a la Matte, to send it to this place for transportation to Pitman’s Ferry. I have also directed the same officer to send out a party of mounted men, and at all hazards to cut the communication between Ironton and Saint Louis. I shall leave to-day for Pitman’s Ferry, via Pocahontas, to look after the troops and supplies in that direction. I am much embarrassed for want of transportation for my command. I hope you are affording Colonel Cross every facility in obtaining the 50 teams I sent him for. As I do not wish to send more letters than absolutely necessary by my courier, I will thank you to send this letter or a copy of it to General S. Cooper, adjutant-general.

[General Polk:]
General : I write on board the steamer Kennett, returning to Madrid, under your orders received last night. I had embarked my whole force and had started down all my boats but three before the dispatch was received. Upon its reception I dropped down to Point Pleasant, and sent down the Mohawk to overtake and order back all my transports; three of my boats were overhauled and are now [on] the return with me; the others were far ahead and may not return before to-morrow.
My object in going to Point Pleasant was to inform myself thoroughly of the condition of that road, and to take my departure as early as possible upon the visit indicated in your dispatch. The road has 6 miles of trestle bridge. The sills are rotten, the plank broken and full of holes, and so rotten that it is impossible to move my trains of wagons and artillery over it. This information I obtained from Colonel Walker, who commands a regiment of Missouri troops, and lay out at the west end of that road three months of the summer. I am satisfied that I cannot pass over that road, and I am also satisfied I can pass Cape Girardeau on my right, and unite my force with Hardee and Thompson by a fine road, affording plenty of well water and of forage for my animals.
Your dispatch directs me to abandon this place as a base and unite with Hardee. That I will do, and avoid the enemy in force on my right. In this I understand myself as complying with your instructions. I want my transports, of which you speak, and my subsistence to come forward to this place. The positions of Pocahontas and Gutman’s [Pitman’s ?] Ferry are too far south for me to reach them with the transportation of

which you speak, viz, 200 covered wagons. I can go forward without difficulty. I am in possession of information that Fremont is much perplexed to know what to do. My position threatens him on the south and on the river, while the advance of McCulloch and Hardee threaten Saint Louis, and he is running his troops up and *down the river. He does not know what to do or which way to turn. Your order to fall back casts a deep gloom over this army, and caused me the most anxious and painful day I ever experienced, but still I promptly complied with it, as you have seen from my movements. I send down Capt. W. H. Jackson, who is a most accomplished officer and full of energy, and wish you to let him bring forward to me as promptly as possible the field battery at Eandolph, with the rifled cannon. It is not needed there) and the company you will send, from the inclosed dispatch from Major Stewart, is without officers. If you could, in addition, spare me one other regiment, Walker’s or Neely’s—the latter preferred, because it is entirely composed of Americans, the former by Irish—I will give you a good account of the campaign. Ho let me have Neely’s. The enemy above will have neither time nor force to think of a descent on the river. We will expel him from and he will contend hard for the prize. If I were not perfectly satisfied you were all safe down south, I could not be induced to ask any force to [be] brought away, for my large interest is all below, as you know. Let me have the regiment, and if I fail anywhere all the responsibility shall rest on myself. I want more ammunition for my 6-pounder guns and the metallic fuse for my 8-inch howitzer. Please have them moved up. I send down six of my 3(hpounder guns to Fort Pillow, as you direct. I will write you again in a few days.

Our united forces offer hopes of accomplishing results of which you may be proud. I shall send forward the remainder of my force with all possible haste. I need the wagons which I am happy to hear that Colonel Cross is bringing forward. I cannot count on more than 4,000 effective men. Do urge the President to send some arms for the new levies in Arkansas. We need reserves here to fall back upon in case of disaster, and particularly to supply the casualties incident to war.

General : My forces are organized for the advance, and I am only detained for want of transportation. Thompson, under my orders, has crossed the country, and to-day reached Sikeston, and I have ordered up to his position and support Colonel Walker’s regiment and Missouri cavalry, and probably a portion of my own cavalry will go up to-morrow. Colonel McCown is placed in command of one of my brigades, and I cannot let him go back. You remember that the want of a competent brigade commander was one of my troubles in accepting the service upon which I am now ordered, and was explained to you as a serious embarrassment j and the matter was settled by the appointment or order to place McCown in the command of one brigade. This is an order that you must not insist upoUf it will break up my organization and cripple me so that I could not go forward at all.
If Bowen’s regiment is not armed it will do me no good, as I am unable to arm it. You ought to give me the strength necessary to make my movement a brilliant success. A vigorous blow now will relieve Missouri and add greatly to the prestige of Southern arms already established.

You know I understand the work before me; my prompt obedience to your order to evacuate was the proof of my submission to orders as a soldier, and my embarkation and equally prompt return leaves you no room to doubt my readiness under all circumstances to comply with your orders. Sustain me, and I will keep Fremont so busy that he will never think for a moment of attempting a descent. A movement down the river with less than 40,000 men will never be attempted.
My boats are all gone below. I do my work so promptly that your orders do not reach me in time. I discharged all my boats last night and early this morning. Send up Bowen at once. I will leave the moment my transportation reaches me.

General: My forces have all returned except the Howard. She will probably be up to-day. One man fell overboard last night and was lost; this is the only accident or loss of any kind incident to the embarkation and return here under the order for evacuation. I have this morning sent my chief of engineers down to the plank road to make a careful examination of the bridges on it, so that I may know its character. It is 132 miles on that route and 70 miles on the route by Benton to Jackson, that being the point of junction with Hardee. On the latter road I can pass Girardeau and all the enemy’s positions, and unite with Hardee. It is important that I have my transports hurried up as rapidly as possible, that I may have the train properly organized for the forward movement. I wish to be ready to move by Saturday. I have to-day forwarded a dispatch to Hardee, for the purpose of fixing place and time of union of our forces. If there are any shoes or clothing in Memphis ready, please have them sent forward. I am much in need of two or three traveling forges and horseshoe iron and large quantity of horseshoe nails. Please order me forward a supply at once. I need Pitts and Flackler with me, and Dr. Newnon, very much. Let them join me. I need one more regiment of infantry very much, and ought to have it. I have so many men sick with measles and other diseases, that when they are all sent back my force is very small for the work to be done. You might bring regiment from Union City to supply place of Neely’s. I could arm a good company of infantry if I had it here. You might send me an unarmed company of Bowen’s regiment and I could arm it, and when the campaign is through I could restore it. I was anxious to have had with me Captain Bethell’s company of Freeman’s regiment. He is my brother’s son-in-law, raised his company to be with me, and at my reguest, and is very anxious to join me temporarily. I will keep you advised of everything until I leave. I shall keep the Grampus here until I leave for duty above, &c.

Commanding the Army of Liberation, New Madrid) Mo.:
Dear Sir : Yours of last evening and note of this morning are at hand. I have sent 150 picked infantry and 100 picked dragoons to drive away the guard and workmen who are repairing the railroad, and, if possible, to destroy the road up to Bird’s Point itself. The infantry are Mississippi County men, and know every path to return by if defeated. The dragoons are all swamp men. I expect them to accomplish something important. You ask me to let you know our condition and wants. The fact is that, although my men are in fine spirits, yet we want everything to make them efficient, shoes especially, tin cups, and canteens. I am short several hundred guns, and any you have to spare, never mind how few or many, would be acceptable. If your quartermaster could let me have an assortment of blank books, they would assist me much. Price’s dragoons have arrived. I have a number of prisoners (some 20), who should be held as hostages, if for no other purpose. Shall I send them to New Madrid, where they can be used, or to Bloomfield, to the jail 1

Dear Sir: We succeeded in entirely destroying the long trestle and pile bridges, 7 miles east of here, last night. We cut the ties, threw off the rails, and fired the whole concern, which is still burning, with a picket stationed to keep it burning. I have a hand car here, and therefore have the use of the 7 miles of road. If I had reached here a few hours earlier yesterday, I would have sent my men beyond Charleston to destroy the piling destroyed by your men, which is now nearly repaired. I will reconnoiter that far to-day, and if any thing can be done I will have it done. Please appoint a parole system of passes, or something of the kind, for the use of our joint forces. Any communications sent to Mr. Harper can be sent me each hour.
Yours, respectfully,

Camp Sikeston, MoAugust 13,1861. Maj. A. Waugh, Commanding Scott County Battalion, Present:
Dear Sir : You will take 50 picked men from your battalion, and go as far northward of this point as may be safe and necessary to guard against the approach of the enemy in that direction. It is reported that 500 men are at Benton. Watch them closely, that they do not cut off your communication and retreat towards me. Your infantry should go about 5 or 6 miles north of this place, but I will send you 50 dragoons, to advance as vedettes and pickets, under your direction, to effectually guard against danger from that direction. Rations will be forwarded to you or can be procured there, as you see fit. Should I not send you a courier or messenger, return to-morrow after sunrise; and should you hear three guns from this point at any time, fall back immediately. I have cautioned the picket towards Bird’s Point that if they hear three guns to fall back, unless fighting themselves, when the signal will be for you to come to their assistance. If you are fighting, the signal will be for them to come to your assistance. Six guns will mean come anyhow. I leave the details of your movement, after you start, to yourself.
Yours, &c.,

Dear Sir: Last night, about 11.30 o’clock, a courier came in from towards Benton, and also from Charleston, reporting both parties approaching the enemy, and the courier from towards Benton reports him advancing. I immediately sent you two cavalry companies, a company of dragoons, and one of infantry, to support the party towards Benton, and the party at Charleston to obey their original orders, as I have no one to send to their support. I have not much faith in the reported advance from Benton, but provided against it anyhow. If Walker’s regiment had been here I would have sent them to Charleston, -and held that place against the enemy until you came to my help, as there is a rich neighborhood there, which could furnish us much transportation and provender. No couriers have come in since the hour named. I will write constantly as news arrives. I ordered Walker up last night, and expect him in a few hours. I send a requisition for ammunition $ please let me have some.

Dear General: The party sent to Charleston has returned, and of course tell many remarkable stories about their adventures. They brought in 2 prisoners, who were privates in the dragoons (who charged through the town this morning, and were thrown from their horses), and they both agree in saying that all of Fremont’s force is at Bird’s Point, and numbers about 13,000. One says he had been sent on picket

on Sunday, and had not been in since. The other says he left yesterday. • Our men agree in saying that several thousand were advancing on Charleston, but a neighbor, who left an hour or more after them, says but 700 had arrived in the town when he left. Captain White had sent to you for re-enforcements, but, as we cannot second any attack from this point, they had better not advance. I will try to hear definitely and truthfully from Bird’s Point to morrow. A spy, just in from Scott County, reports that at noon there were no men in Commerce, but 300 in Hamburg and 300 in Benton. They have six gdns with them. If you would allow me to suggest, I would say that this is not the point for a depot until after Commerce or Cape Girardeau is taken. I shall have sufficient store room for you. Tippen’s regiment and two companies of Mississippians are at Jones7 Ferry, and I have only 20 men towards Charleston. To-morrow I hope there will be one of your officers here to act in conjunction with me, and that the horses of your cavalry will be sufficiently rested to take their turn at picket duty. If the force represented be at Bird’s Point we cannot be too vigilant. I have requested the Tennessee cavalry to start at daybreak towards Charleston, to cover us in that direction.
Yours, most respectfully,

Dear Sir: Yours of this morning is at hand. I will have a ware-room prepared. I had taken the depot myself, but you shall have the largest to be had in the village. I had sent the Mississippi cavalry and Colonel Tippen’s regiment to the point you indicated in your letter before I heard from you. Waugh, with his men and the Tennessee cavalry, has returned. The shots were exchanged by the cavalry pickets, and both parties ran. I will give my men a good lecture. My men are doing finely at Charleston, as you will see by the inclosed note. I am not strong enough to hold Charleston, and therefore will let my men fall back, according to written instructions. If the horses of the Tennesseeans were not tired, I would send over and drive the enemy into Bird’s Point, which we could easily do, as we have them frightened. I will send over some men to cover the retreat.
Yours, respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
P. S.—If you will let me, I will try to take Commerce to-morrow. It is a strong point, and will cut off communication as effectually as Cape Girardeau.

therefore there would be no object accomplished by a fight in that direction. The party from Charleston has returned, and reports 13,000 men at Bird’s Point, getting ready to move here, to cut us off from an approach to the Mississippi River north of them, and they will probably make the attempt within 48 hours. If they do, we will need all our force east of here; but, should enough troops reach here to-morrow to hold Bird’s Point in check, I will send all my dragoons to aid you in taking the points named above. I will send you a 12-pounder early in the morning. If your pickets want to smell powder, let them have a chance. Lieutenant-Colonel Akers will accede to any of your suggestions.

Camp Sikeston, Mo., August 14,1861. Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, C. S. A., New Madrid, Mo. :
Dear General: The enemy, before retiring into Benton, burned Parrott’s Mill, which has been our main reliance, and there is no mill of consequence now in Scott County, except a splendid mill in Commerce. There are high bluffs at Commerce, the river is narrow, and the channel runs near our shore. If we had only guns sufficient to hold it, it should be taken, by all means, before the enemy estimates its value or prepares to hold it. Cape Girardeau will then rely only on Saint Louis for support, and probably can also be taken before Saturday night, The enemy .has no idea of our strength, and we should act while he is in doubt. They knew not what re-enforcements you brought back with you or how many men I have 5 so, if the men’s legs will only carry them fast enough and far enough, we can take everything by storm. I must either threaten the Cape or send a battalion to guard the road from there to Bloomfield.
Yours, respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON,
Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Steamer Mohawk, Mississippi Bivery August 15, 1861.
General Pillow:
General: I have been informed since I left New Madrid that it is the purpose of the enemy to send down to attack your position 10,000 men, of which 5,000 came to-day and 5,000 are to come to-morrow. The 5,000 of to-day will probably stop at Island No. 10, with the view of seizing and occupying it, and making it a base of operations for the whole 10,000 when concentrated. This I think more than probable. In that case I am clearly of the opinion that your duty is to cross the river into Tennessee with your whole command at once. To enable you to do this I send you three steamers, the Falls City, the Kentucky, and the Cheeny, which, together with the Grampus and Equality, should enable you to cross promptly. By this movement you may send forward McOown’s brigade to attack the enemy on the island from the Tennessee side, and if the movement is prompt, he may cut off the retreat [to] his boats, and you will at all events be able to fight him as well from the Tennessee as

from the Missouri shore. In ease you should not be able to check his descent of the river and he should pass you, you will then have an open way to Union City, where, by sending a messenger forward and order- * iug up transportation, you can take the cars and proceed either to my support at Forts Pillow and Randolph, or you may fall back on Memphis for its defense. If on the other hand you remain where you are to await him there and a reverse should befall you, you will have no base to fall back upon, and you will [be] deprived of the ability to aid me either at the forts below or at Memphis.
My opinion therefore is, I repeat, that you cross the river forthwith and malce Union Gity your base.
It has just occurred to me that you might also use the large wharf boat as a transport, having it towed, and it will hold at least 1,000 men. My opinion,is that the men, ammunition, and arms should be transported first.
In case the enemy should (which I by no means anticipate) have disappeared in the morning, my counsel is nevertheless the same. And I hope you will in that case certainly send Colonel MeCown’s brigade to occupy and fortify the island and the shore on the Tennessee side as I have indicated. Captain Gray is sent with this dispatch and is charged with the selection and supervision of the points to be occupied. You should send an express to General Clark, and let me hear from you as promptly and as often as possible.
Very respectfully,
L. POLK, Major-General.
C. S. Steamer Mohawk,
New Madrid Bend, August 15, 1861.
The following are the views of Captain Gray of his examination of Island No. 10 Bend, made August 14, 1861:
That it is a strong position naturally for erecting works to defend the passage of the Mississippi River ; that a series of earthworks would be necessary, and all the material required would be convenient and made available without delay; that there should be a bastion earthwork upon the mainland, and upon Island Ko. 10 a redoubt inclosed to hold 1,000 men; that at a point say three-quarters of a mile above the mainland work, and on the same side of the river, a redan earthwork should be thrown up immediately, and a couple of 12-pounders or two 32-pounders, if at hand, placed in position) also a battery of horse artillery, with a regiment or troop (part horse and part infantry) encamped at the redan fort $ the artillery to be placed in position to operate with the heavier pieces in defending the landing or to be moved along the bank of the river, as might be required. The redan can be thrown up of earth and the guns mounted en barbette in a very little while. This battery would effectually prevent the landing of troops and artillery of the enemy, should they attempt to take possession of the neck of land for the purpose of cutting off communication with New Madrid by water, and also the communication by road to Union City.
An accurate survey should be at once made of Island No. 10 and the mainland on the left bank on Tennessee side, for the purpose of erecting the earthworks referred to.
With these three batteries a most powerful, concentrated, raking as well as plunging fire could be kept up upon boats of any character coming down the river, and at a distance from each battery ranging from

OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., RANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X
500 yards to several miles, if desired. Every portion of a boat attempting to pass would be exposed, even to the rudder, the covering of the deck, broadsides, and stern at the same instant.
The position of these batteries, to be taken by a flank movement, is as strong in favor of the forts as they would be against an enemy on the water, if properly constructed. That with a cordon of stations on the route from the river to Union. City from 25 to 35 miles in length, the whole of Northwestern Tennessee could be easily defended; and no more favorable line could be found to resist the enemy, while being ready at any moment to concentrate rapidly a strong force (without weakening the main defenses) for the purpose of offensive movements northward upon our foes.
If New Madrid was threatened by a land attack, the garrison of New Madrid could be re-enforced from the neck in a few hours. With the forts above placed, one large steamer at least might always be kept in readiness at New Madrid to transport troops either side, as the emergency required.
The situation of Island No. 10, in connection with the mainland defenses, for the purpose of repelling the enemy from the New Madrid side as well as the Tennessee side, and for a protection to the valley of the Mississippi and a magnificent section of the State of Tennessee, has no superior, in my judgment, above Memphis.

Major Gorgas, Chief of Ordnance :
Sir : In a letter from Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch, dated Camp near Cassville, Mo., July 30, occurs the following paragraph:
I have been compelled to furnish other commands with so much of my ammunition that my supply is now very limited, and if the enemy are re-enforced it may be necessary to have a large supply [here to carry on the war. In any event it is necessary to have a supply] sent to Fort Smith for the use of my command, and I hope you will see the necessity of at once sending me a large amount of flint-lock musket cartridges and percussion musket cartridges for percussion and minie muskets, and caps, and such cannon ammunition for field pieces as can be spared. We are very much in need of caps, both for the musket and the ordinary rifle. I am in hopes that you have sent me the cavalry arms that I have applied for in former communications. Major Clark has notified me that ammunition lately sent for the use of the brigade (70 boxes of musket cartridges and a quantity of accouterments) were lost with the steamboat William Henry on the Arkansas River.
Your attention is respectfully directed to the importance of this subject, especially in view of the active operations now commenced in Missouri, and you are instructed to supply Brigadier-General McCulloch’s wants to the extent of your power.
Respectfully,

Secretary of War.

ant-Governor Reynolds from New Madrid, in which he requests me to say to you, “ We need here an able general in’ the field and commanding the whole, valley of the Mississippi.”
It is the wish of Governor Jackson that operations in Missouri shcrod be under control of an experienced or skillful general of the Confederate States, and he will take care that there shall be no conflict between the State and Confederate commanding officers. I am also authorized to say that Major-General Price desires to co-operate with the Confederate Army, and will allow no question of rank to interfere with the control of military movements in Missouri by the general of the Confederate Army whom you may send into the State.
Respectfully submitting this subject to your consideration, I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Fort Pillow, August 16,1861.
General Pillow :
General : You have passed the night, I hope, without an attack, and as the movements of the enemy are not very clear or his purposes plain, I cannot but also hope he may have determined not to occupy the island, and so have left you alone. His movement down to that island last night, and the facility with which he might manifestly take possession of and occupy it, very much strengthens the conclusion I arrived at before leaving Memphis for your camp, and which, as I remarked in the council held at my quarters yesterday, it was the principal object of my visit to state to you, to wit, the paramount importance of our holding it ourselves, and that, too, by a portion of the force under your command. I have to repeat, therefore, the instructions given you last night in the dispatch sent you by the hands of Captain Gray, that you order Colonel McCown’s brigade to advance to Island No. 10 and occupy and fortify it, as well as the main shore on the Tennessee side. I have placed the reconnaissance of the ground for this work, and the construction of the batteries, under my engineer, Captain Gray, who has already, under my instructions, given attention to that subject.
The propriety of further delay in any movement contemplated by you in Missouri, by which you would be removed from Tennessee, is more urgently demanded by the fact that I have this moment received a dispatch from Richmond ordering the immediate removal of the twa

Mississippi regiments, now at Union City, forward to Knoxville to General Zollicoffer, whose command is seriously threatened at that place. If the command of Colonel McCown should be threatened, I shall of cq§fese expect you to proceed to his support, with all your forces, if circumstances should require it.
In my dispatch of last night, already alluded to, I expressed the opinion that if the enemy was coming down in the force reported to me it would be expedient for you to cross the river with the whole of your command into Tennessee.
In regard to compliance with this order, you are left to conform your action to the exigencies of the case. I have to repeat that, so soon as the condition of the force in my hands shall be strong enough, I shall with pleasure furnish you the troops necessary to proceed with your movement on Missouri. In the mean season I suggest whether it might not be well to take measures for having the plank road out from Point Pleasant put into passable condition. In the condition of uncertainty resting on affairs above, I have stopped the Hill at this place and caused her to discharge a lot of mules and other things she had for you, she being wanted for service in another direction. These things shall be sent forwajggj^so soon as you will say you desire them.
I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Oommanding P. A. G. 8.
Hew Madrid, August 16,1861.
[General Polk :]
General : We had no attack last night and nothing occurred after you left. There were two gunboats (nothing else) in the chase of last night 5 they stopped and lay up against the bank below Island Ho. 10 until about 11 o’clock, and then returned. They had no troops except those necessary to man their guns, and it was simply a chase after the Grampus; failing in overhauling her, they returned. At 2 o’clock last night I received the inclosed communication from Thompson, which explains itself; also the inclosed Extra Republican, from which it is now certain that a battle, and bloody one, has been fought between McCulloch’s and Lyon’s forces, in which the latter was defeated and Lyon killed. The reports of this battle before were premature (but like Manassas, which was preceded by similar reports), but now it is certain. You will perceive from the Republican that it has thrown everything into commotion. These things explain the statement made by the captain of the captured steamer last night, viz, that the Uncle Sam moved off with a boat load of troops up the river yesterday morning, and that the forces at Norfolk (6 miles below Cairo) were all removed night before last ; it explains and confirms the report of Mr. Chew, as given me by General Thompson in his dispatch. In fine, it explains everything, and the various reports through different channels all agree and corroborate and confirm the statements in the Saint Louis Republican. The Grampus went above, saw the gunboats last night, lay up and watched them, and has now gone up to Hickman. I now therefore comprehend all the enemy’s movements. His whole force (except 2,000 at Bird’s Point) is drawn up to Saint Louis, to save that city and protect his retreating force, crippled and cut to pieces. You will hence perceive the importance of now pressing him from all points by urging our forces forward. The Island Ho. 10 will do the enemy ic good with-

out troops. The great city of Saint Louis, with its capital, shops, and bank capital, the point from which all his operations must be directed, is in imminent danger, and will fall if we push up our operations, and then he will have received a blow paralyzing him more than if Washington was captured.
If you will only order me up one more regiment, and push up my transportation, and let Oapt. W.H. Jackson come forward with my battery and the additional ordnance and subsistence stores on board the Hill, I will drive everything out of my way, join Hardee in five days, and push on to Saint Louis, destroying the railroad; but for God’s sake don’t hold me back or cripple me for a want which will wait on you until the work of emancipating Missouri is completed.
Your dispatch of last night is received and contents carefully read.
You will perceive that the steps ordered by you, and based entirely on impressions and information of last night, would be modified by the new light we now have. All of our impressions from then existing lights are totally changed by the developments since you left, showing that the enemy at that very moment was hurrying his forces from our front to Saint Louis, and that the movement involved the fall of his cause in the West. Under all these circumstances I will suspend any action in regard to the island movement until I can hear from you. Captain Gray will remain here until we get your answer. I cannot doubt if you were here now your views would correspond with mine as to the eminent importance of pressing forward. I can push forward in two days after you return the Hill.
Don’t lose a moment’s time in answering.
Your obedient servant,
GID. J. PILLOW,

Dear Sir : You will proceed on your march, as ordered last night, although the Tennesseeans have returned) join Lieutenant Dunson, and go as near Bird’s Point as possible, to obtain information of what is going on there. I understand the enemy has called in all his workmen and guards. Be very vigilant, keeping out flankers, so that you may not be cut off. He has two companies of dragoons, but they are not your equal in prowess, if you are not surprised. If you find these reports are true, you must send us some more goods and transportation from the neighborhood of Charleston and the country stores around that point of country. We need clothes, boots, shoes, candles, soap, and many other articles, which your judgment will prompt. Prevent private stealing and personal revenge, but remember we are at war, and must be provided with certain necessaries. Send me a courier each two hours, after you reach Charleston. You will remain until relieved.

to feel the strength of the enemy. I believe he will retire at once, in which case I will drive him out of Scott County. I have sent my First Regiment up to .Jones’ Ford, to relieve the Third. I have sent 80 of my dragoons to Hickory Ridge, to watch Cape Girardeau, and two companies of dragoons to the neighborhood of Bird’^s Point. Some strange commotion is evidently going on among the enemy, and strong vedettes will make him more cautious, if he has any design upon us. If he is going to Saint Louis (which I believe), the sooner we get a point on the river between Cairo and Saint Louis the better. Captain [Neely says the enemy is confined to the limits of his works at Bird’s Point, last night having called in all his workmen and guards from the railroad. I send a requisition for some strapped shot, which you will please send me as speedily as possible.

Dear General : I inclose you another dispatch* from General Pillow. While we are resting on our oars, except the demonstrations I will make at Bird’s Point, and other points around me, our enemy is in the greatest commotion. All the troops at Bird’s Point went up the river yesterday, but how far I have not yet learned. Four gunboats ran down to New Madrid, to keep General Pillow there, but I am satisfied that they had no troops aboard, and only intended to cover some other movement. The enemy will either land in force at Cape Girardeau or concentrate their whole force at Saint Louis, to make a demonstration at you or to cover the retreat of Lyon’s troops, whom I am satisfied have been totally routed, although they are reported as retreating in order by the Saint Louis Democrat. I send 80 dragoons to watch Cape Girardeau, and one of them will bear this to you, and can tell you whether the Cape is the point or not. I have heard that the Iron Mountain Railroad has been crippled. I hope the time to narrow the circle around Saint Louis has come, and that our coils are strong enough to crush the enemy at once.

Cape Girardeau without firing a gun by marching these moonlight nights and taking them by surprise. Every one gives me the credit of having at least 7,000 men, and I have them frightened nearly to death. If you will allow the move, let me know it by one of my couriers tonight, so that I can make my first march in the morning, and appear before the Cape at daybreak on Sunday.

[General Pillow:]
General : In my dispatch of yesterday I gave you instructions to order Colonel McCown’s brigade forward to occupy and fortify Island No. 10 and the main shore on the Tennessee side; and informed you that I had ordered the reconnaissance to be made by Captain Gray, under whose supervision the works would be constructed. The order I hope you executed promptly; if so, they will be prepared for the relief I am now sending them, and the work of seizure which I have deemed of such great importance to the security of my Department will have been effected, and the armament be more or less in place by the time this reaches you. I have, ordered Walker’s regiment forward to their post, and shall to-day send forward Neely’s regiment, with the three artillery companies from Eandolph, under Major Stewart, to relieve Colonel McOown at Island No. 10. Colonel McCown, in the order given Colonel Neely to relieve him, is ordered to report immediately to you for duty. I feel myself able to relieve Colonel McCown from the duty to which he was assigned thus early, because of intelligence I have received from headquarters at Memphis that a liberal response is being made to my call for troops from below, and this notwithstanding the withdrawal of the two Mississippi regiments for service in East Tennessee.
I have ordered Capt. Hamilton Jackson to proceed on the Alonzo Child to you with his company and to report for orders. I have also sent forward on the Child the freight brought up by the Hill, of which I wrote you yesterday. You will find 50 wagons, with mules, on the Ingomar. The wagon-master who put the mules ashore from the Hill wifi report what he has.
You may now proceed with your movement into Missouri as soon as you are ready, and I hope you will proceed cautiously, while you proceed firmly, in making your way out from the swamps into the open country of Missouri. I send forward all the subsistence stores that were on the Hill, which, together with the quartermaster and other stores on the Ingomar and the Child, I hope are all that you need. If you want more, let me know. As to ordnance stores, I take it for granted you have ordered what you require, and that they too may be on the boats going up or are being sent forward from Memphis.
Hoping you may have a prosperous campaign, I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding Second Department.

I shall, as soon as I can, concentrate a large force at No. 10, as well for the purpose of strengthening it as for the purpose of its forming a reserve for operations on Missouri, but I cannot say how soon; you shall be advised when this is done. Let me hear from you often. I shall keep a small steamer to ply between the post at No. 10 and the end of the wires at Eandolph, passing this post. These wires shall be extended to this post as soon as possible; also from Union City to No. 10.

General : I send down the New Palls City to get some supplies for this army. We have only rations of bacon for two or three days. My outposts and scouts report that the enemy have drawn in all the working parties on the railroad and keep out no pickets at Bird’s Point. We have driven the enemy from Benton and Hamburg and into Cape Girardeau. I am ready to advance if I had my transportation. I telegraphed you from Hickman to-day. Let me have the Hill as early as possible. I can pass on the direct route to the" Cape. [Illegible] of Fremont’s have been drawn up to Saint Louis except the garrison, as stated to you yesterday.

Dear Sir: I have Waited anxiously for the order, but as none has arrived, I have acted upon the circumstances which surround me, and have made the following disposition for this day: My First and Third Begiments are ordered to encamp at Jones’ Ford (about 800 men); the Mississippi cavalry, Neely’s Tennesseeans, and two companies of dragoons are at Watkins’ farm (325); the Scott County Battalion are ordered to occupy the church or fort at Hamburg; Brown’s battalion is ordered to Benton (250); Haywood’s rangers and Price’s dragoons (125) will vedette Bird’s Point. Hunter and Jennings, with four full companies, will remain here (300); also Burns’, Flunkies’, and Partizin’s (about 200). In all, 500. If your permission to move comes, I will move my headquarters to Benton. The Cape must be taken by surprise, to prevent the removal of the specie from the banks. If you will send me a few more companies of dragoons I will take it to-morrow, probably by capitulation, and by storm anyhow.

Maj. J. H. Miller,
Commanding Advance, Watkins1 Farm, Mo.:
Dear Major: I have just received a dispatch from Captain [Neely, informing me of the landing of steamboats at Commerce. I believe their stay will be temporary, but it will be well to watch them close, and if you can hit them a rap,, to do so. Pillow’s column will probably move on Monday morning, and I am ordered to remain in statu quo until then. If the disposition of my troops beyond Jones’ Ford does not suit you, you can change them. I had intended to move forward to-night, but I have orders to await the arrival of Pillow’s column.
The distrust and bad feeling at New Madrid is distressing ; General Polk either does not understand the people of Missouri or he belongs to the ox telegraph line. He has again ordered General Pillow to return to Union City, but Pillow refuses to obey. If he takes the troops away, I will call for volunteers, and fight on my own hook. I rely upon your superior judgment and discretion for the safety of my men beyond Jones’ Ford.
Yours, &c.,

Dear Sir : Yours, by Captain White, was received last night.* 1 am astonished that rumors should have reached New Madrid that I had left your stores exposed. I have and will keep at this place, until relieved, four companies infantry (about 300 men) and about 200 dragoons. Neely’s and Haywood’s camps are still here, although they are both out on duty. I herewith send you a requisition for a tent for my own use. I have been sleeping about more like a stray dog than a general, and the State of Missouri has not a yard of material suitable for tents nor money to buy it with. I do not care about a regular marquee, unless you have a surplus, but anything that will answer the purpose. A dispatch from Major Miller this morning reports all safe in Scott County. I will move to Watkins’farm or Benton this morning, and await your orders.

vast importance to us, and the one alluded to in one of my previous letters. I believe myself they will immediately leave. If they do not, I will take a small crack at them, to cover our movements. I continue to fire my morning and evening gun, as if the whole brigade was here. If you wish a legal excuse to advance, withdraw your control over me for a few hours, and then come to my rescue. We must not lose this moon; the weather may change and the swamp become impassable. I will, if necessary, wait patiently your order, but may move my headquarters to Watkins? farm to-morrow.

[General Polk :]	.	,
General : Your dispatch of yesterday is acknowledged. Your order in regard to fortifying Island No. 10 and the adjacent banks on the Tennessee side, to be constructed under directions of Captain Gray, are being carried out. Captain Gray does not want Neely’s regiment, and proposed that I should furnish him with four good companies of Americans, under command of a competent officer. I have at his request made the exchange, and placed the battalion under command of Major Hamilton, a fine officer.
I have driven the enemy from every position he occupied to Cape Gy^rdeau, and I now occupy all those places from which he has been expelled. I advance a brigade forward to-day with field battery. I now see my way clear to Ironton, where I will unite with Hardee. We will then have a column of about 14,000 men, and well equipped in every arm.
It will be proper [for] you to advance one of the field batteries from Union City to the position occupied by Captain Gray. He will fortify the east bank first; he and McCown concur in opinion, after a thorough reconnaissance, that the battery on that bank at the present stage of water commands the entire channel and island; that order should be given for the field batteries to advance at once. Captain Gray says he will have 300 negroes at work to-morrow. I have wheelbarrows enough here, but he will need more spades; there are plenty at Randolph and Fort Pillow. Some of them should be ordered to him by [the] Fairchild, on her return.
I will render you a good account of my command. We will set Missouri upon her feet in less than sixty days.
Fremont is fortifying Saint Louis, showing he gives up the country, but wants to hold the city of mechanics, shops, and money, from which all the railroads, telegraph lines, and river communications diverge over the country. I will try to keep a line of communication by post. I send back the Fairchild for some more harness. Order them to me at once. I expect my whole column will be in motion by Wednesday morning. I need fifty more wagons badly. Peters writes me he has them. Send them with harness.

In accordance with instructions from General Pillow, I made a reconnaissance of Island No. 10 and the left bank of the Mississippi. I have only to reiterate what I formerly said on the subject to Governor Harris and General Pillow, viz: That Island No. 10, as tbe center of the line, the right at Union City and the left near Chalk Bluff, is the strongest position for the defense of the Mississippi Valley. If I had time I would demonstrate this fact.

Sir : I am going to-night, with a gun, to take a position on the Mississippi River and fire into some passing steamboats, to make them believe we are cutting off Cairo. I would like a demonstration made on Bird’s Point or a rumor of one sent in. I would prefer the demonstration ; that is, drive in their pickets and keep them in until the movement of General Pillow up to Sikeston or this point is completely covered. I can make no other suggestions, as I do not know who is in command by this time. If only my own men, have a consultation and show your talent.

Dear General : I will cover your whole plan of operations to-night by making a demonstration on Commerce, and to-morrow by making one on Bird’s Point. The enemy has come to the conclusion that all of our attention has been drawn away from Bird’s Point and Cairo and is being directed upon Cape Girardeau and Saint Louis. I will go tonight with the Mississippi Cavalry and one gun to some favorable hill, near Commerce, and drop a shot into some passing steamboats, and, if you will allow a demonstration to-morrow on Bird’s Point, a new campaign will be opened or the other covered up. I will direct a part of the force I left at Sikeston to move towards Bird’s Point, and if one of your regiments would help them, you might carry the place. After this demonstration to-night, which I hope will cover our whole movement, I will remain quiet until you move up.

Sir : On the arrival of steamboat Hill at this point yesterday morning, I was ordered verbally by General Pillow’s officer to take my command off boat and proceed to the interior with other troops then moving. I did not do so. The officer then made one in writing. I then made my appearance at the general’s quarters, and told him I was under orders to go to Island 10. He replied he understood all, and made other arrangements with you, and issued another more peremptory order. I tnen reported myself to Captain Gray, your topographical engineer, named in your instructions, and he directed me to do as General Pillow ordered; that the general had furnished him all the force he wanted. I then disembarked my troops and left, getting out a few miles, where I now give the facts, hoping that you will approve of my course. Not being near enough or having the means of communicating with you, was at a loss to know what to do. Carroll’s regiment was assigned duty at No. 10, together with an artillery company or two.

Headquarters First Military District, Mo. 8. G.,
Camp Benton, ilfo., August 19,1861.
Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow,
Commanding Army of Liberation, New Madrid, Mo.:
Dear General : I would report to you that last evening, at 7 o’clock, I left this place with two companies of Major Miller’s dragoons, one platoon of Jeffries’ dragoons (Missourians), and one 6-pounder, McDowell’s battery, and went in the direction of Commerce. When we arrived within 1 mile of the place we were informed that the enemy, 700 strong, with one gunboat and one steamboat, were still at the place. To draw the fire of the guard, and startle the men, ordered the squadron and gun to go in a trot, do them what damage they could, and, if necessary, retreat. The order was executed in gallant style, but, as usual, the enemy had flown before our arrival. The whole force was then masked, and, in perfect order and quiet, remained waiting for the return of the male citizens of the place, who have been in the habit of going to Illinois to sleep and returning in the morning. About sunrise a boat, containing six men, was seen crossing above the town, directly upon an ambushed picket of mine. I ordered a squad of Mississippians up to strengthen my picket and capture them, but their spirited horses and anxious riders made too much haste, and alarmed the party in the boat before they landed, and they pulled hurriedly back to the Illinois shore, when they struck on a dry sand bar, about three-fourths of the way across the river. They were joined by four more men, and it was discovered that all were armed. They being out of reach of our small guns, and, as we had been discovered by the people on the Illinois shore, who would warn all steamboats not to come within our reach, I let my artillerist try a round shot at them, which, having fallen short, or rather having been aimed too low, the enemy taunted us, and I gave them three more rounds. The pickets were by this time firing at them, and they scampered away, firing their guns at us, but not taking time to reload. We then displayed our force on the bank of the river and retired. I had the warehouse examined, and procured some bacon, flour, corn, whisky, &e., and also some blankets from a warehouse, which have all been properly turned over to the quartermaster.
The men all behaved with exceedingly good propriety, and no house was opened, except by order of the officers, and no private residence was opened or examined, to my knowledge. I left word with the women to tell the men, on their return home, that they might return home and attend to their* present business without molestation ; and, as they had prepared and expected the town to be burned, I hope they will be agreeably disappointed. I should have held the place, if possible, but as my pickets will cut off communication, the enemy will not occupy it, except in large force, by which time your troops will be up, and we will run him again. I will acknowledge that I did wrong to accompany the expedition (in some respects, dignity, &c.), but I had been directing so many little forays, without going into any myself, that I was fearful I might not be appreciating the fun, and tbe men might get tired of it; and also I wished to make the enemy believe my whole command was in reserve, if necessary, and thus divert his attention from other points.

Unless you really can divert, and really take Bird?s Point, which I believe can be done, please hurry on up to this point, as the enemy may find out my weakness while my men are scattered, and come out to give me a battle. I took Commerce last night, and have stopped the navigation of the Mississippi, by firing three strapped shots and one canister, from an old ircfn 6-pounder, over into Illinois. I left Commerce at 10 o’clock to-day, but no boats have passed since, and when you come up we will close navigation effectually. I will try to make the necessary preparations for you in the way of forage, &c. Hoping to see you shortly, I will conclude by assuring you again of a hearty welcome.

General: I sent Colonel Borland to-day to confer with General Pillow respecting our future operations. In the event of disagreement, I suggested that reference should be had to you. Colonel Borland is in possession of my views and is well acquainted with the resources of this part of Missouri. I wish, indeed, that you could see him. I do not see ‘much prospect at present for striking a blow. The Ironton Bailroad is still intact and Ironton itself largely re-enforced. I apprehend that if Pillow should unite his forces with mine, that we are too weak, combined, to march on Saint Louis. I am ready and anxious to attempt anything which may afford the prospect of success. I learn that one of the boats loaded with provisions has reached Pocahontas. I desire to express my acknowledgment for the cordial assistance you have in all cases extended to my command.

matter being furnished by the Cairo correspondent. One item of importance in the intelligence is the fact that a man named McGuire, a spy, has been sent to Union City and Memphis. I give you the intelligence that you may have him looked after. He might be secured and imprisoned until the end of these troubles. The captain of the Equality is just in from the works at Island Ho. 10, and brought me this letter. He further says that the work is progressing rapidly; that there are 150 negroes at work) that the works will soon be in condition to mount the guns 5 that they are now in position to be used if necessary.
The Missouri pickets are said to have had a fight at Charleston yesterday, in which they were worsted. It is said that 2 were killed and 4 or 5 taken prisoners. They were, from the facts, criminally negligent. They were acting under the orders of General Thompson.
Lieutenant-Colonel McGehee has gone on after Colonel Neely to deliver your order in person. If Neely should return under the order, which I cannot suppose you would have given had you known all the circumstances and the condition of things, it will greatly imperil the forces already 40 miles from me. It will require four days to throw forward other troops for their relief. Reciting in my order the circumstances of the case, I directed Neely to proceed on the march $ but what he will do I cannot tell. I only know that I had no idea you would be offended at my agreeing to what your engineer requested. I was glad to make the exchange, as it gave me more force with which to advance upon a perilous duty. I have no motive to gratify but to serve the country 5 and it seems to me that you ought to be disposed to strengthen the force all you could. If I have not your confidence, and if I am to be tied down and allowed no discretion, I certainly cannot but regard it unfortunate that 1 yielded to your wishes and accepted a command my feelings so strongly prompted me to decline. It is to me strange that my official intercourse with you is rendered both embarrassing and unpleasant when not intended on my part. If I have fitness for command you ought not to incline to cripple" my energies. If I have not, and possess not your confidence, it would be better for the interest of the service that I had not been intrusted with this important command.
I should be glad to hear from you before I leave, but I fear I cannot. If I should shrink from the responsibility of acting upon my own clear convictions in a case involving the safety of the forces under my command, even though in doing so I disobeyed your orders, I would then, indeed, be unworthy your confidence. If I have done right, I should be glad to know that you approve. If wrong, I do not shrink from the responsibility of action which I feel bound by every principle of duty to my command to take.

This* force is in an exposed position. Two dispatches reached me last night from Thompson and McCown,

asking me to immediately strengthen their force. Before orders could reach Neely’s regiment, I think it will have arrived at Sikeston. To order it back now would greatly endanger the force already at Benton. My transportation is so short that I cannot before to-morrow start any other force, unless I were to leave my subsistence and ordnance stores here, which I cannot do. I must therefore move these with the rear of the command. Under these circumstances, I can hardly suppose you would have ordered that regiment back, and I have declined doing so. In my former dispatch I informed you that the exchange of Neely’s regiment for the battalion under command of Major Hamilton was made at the instance and request of your engineer. Captain Gray, to whom you had intrusted the work of fortifying the island and adjacent bank of the river. This I now repeat was the case. The battalion of Major Stewart is not diverted from that work. The three companies you ordered up are all there with him, besides the battalion of infantry, and the work is progressing as you ordered it. But for the fact stated, the condition of my advance at Benton, of Neely’s position, and my shortness of transportation to push up other supporting force, I would have ordered Neely back, but as it is I cannot. To do so might and probably would cost the sacrifice of one-third the force under my command.
Bespectfully,

Dear Sir: Not having heard anything more from Sikeston, I presume the .alarm there this morning was false, and some of my militia ran away from a picket of the enemy. We are apparently perfectly safe here, as the navigation of the Mississippi has been effectually closed. I have a detachment now at Commerce, bringing away the balance of the corn. It will be well to leave your force at Watkins until we are prepared to advance to Abys, as there is no water between the two places sufficient for your uses.

I acknowledge the reception of your dispatch of the 12th instant. In compliance with your directions I inclose a list of the officers of my per-

sonal staff and of Brigadier-General Cheatham’s staff, and of the general staff on duty with me in this army.* I include in this list the quartermaster and commissary on depot duty at Memphis, who are still supplying my wants in their respective arms of the service. I respectfully ask their reappointment in the Confederate States service, and in the order in which their names are mentioned, the list as it is prepared giving correctly their relative rank as given by the governor of Tennessee.
An opportunity being afforded me in this reply to your dispatch, I will advise you of the strength of the forces under my command and of the different arms of the service, supposing that the President would be pleased to have this information. I have of all arms about 10,000 men. Two thousand of these are Missourians, badly armed. The balance of these are Tennesseeans, and about 600 Mississippians. The Tennesseeans and Mississippians are well armed. I have two six-gun, one four-gun, and one five-gun battery and two siege guns with me, together with a good supply of ammunition for all. I have thrown forward my advance to Benton, 40 miles from this place, and within 15 miles of Cape Girardeau, where we expect to engage the enemy. In that section of the country I expect to unite my force with Brigadier-General Hardee, who has only about 4,500 men all told. When we meet, from his rank, he will take command of the whole, unless in courtesy he allows me to command, which is not probable. I have made a great effort to get this force in the field, to arm it, and procure munitions for its use. Indeed, nearly all the arms and munitions of war held by the State were gathered together and procured by myself, at an expense of $200,000 in cash, raised on my private resources, which has not been reimbursed me by Tennessee. With the facts before you, and with my past history and services to the country, with which I presume you to be familiar, you can judge with what reluctance I yield the command to an officer who was a captain under me in the Mexican war while I was a major-general. Why is it that I have been placed in position and ranked by nearly every general officer of the Confederate Army when it is known that I ranked every officer now in that Army in my long term of service in the Mexican war, in which service General Scott’s official reports fully testified that I did my duty and sustained myself in every trial? Why this is I know not, but the facts are as I state them. I do not address you this letter in the way of complaint, but in my present position and rank it is certain that but little can be effected by me. I do not feel that I can render to the country services* at all commensurate with the public expectations. I shall continue to perform my duty as best I can, whatever may be the result.
I expect to engage the enemy at Cape Girardeau. He is therein force, and is fortifying his position day and night. He has removed most of his forces from Cairo and Bird’s Point to Saint Louis and the Cape. My advance upon the Cape is difficult, on account of the forces at Cairo and the point being on my flank. I have, however, no other route upon which I can advance. I am now throwing forward my ordnance and subsistence stores, and will move the rear of the force from this place on the day after to-morrow. I would have been off some time since but for my shortness of transportation and for General Polk’s orders and varying views and countermanding orders, repeatedly made, thus crippling my operations and movements.

Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow,
Commanding Army Corps, Missouri: •
General: The major-general commanding has received your dispatch of yesterday, assigning to him your reasons fpr diverting the Fourth Kegiment, not under your command, from the destination assigned it, and for declining to restore it to its assigned post. In reply thereto the general directs me to say that he disapproves entirely of the course you have thoiight proper to pursue in disposing of a body of troops making no part of your command, having their own special instructions in reference to a particular duty required 6f them, and which the correspondence of their commander with headquarters shows to have been reluctantly complied with, if not protested against.
I am further desired by the commanding general to communicate to you his surprise that a suggestion of a subordinate engineer officer, whose only office was to indicate the point to be fortified and superintend the construction of the works, should be accepted by you as an authority for superseding orders issued from headquarters.
I am directed further to say that you have so arranged matters in connection with the movement and position of this body of troops as possibly to render it by this time (as advised by your dispatch of yesterday) most important he should not disturb your combinations. The regard he entertains for the safety of your command and the advantage of the service admonish him to make no change at this late hour; but, considering you have usurped an authority not properly your own, by which you have thwarted and embarrassed his arrangements and operations for the general defense, he feels it his duty to submit to the War Department the position you have thought proper to assume.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant, '

Major-General Polk :
General : I cannot move on the expedition ordered without more* transportation. T have received only the small lot of wagons and mules that were on the Hill, 43, when you turned them back. Forty of the mules that were on the boat were never brought up at all. You wrote me just before that you would send me 100 more, and I sent a boat for them, and am just advised that there is not a wagon coming or on hand in Memphis to come. I learn, further, Peters is superseded, so that I am now powerless. I have only received in all from Memphis 103 wagons. My ordnance stores alone require 64 wagons, and allowing 2 wagons to the company to move my troops requires 170 wagons, and my subsistence stores, which I am obliged to have, require from 70 to 80, making a total needed to move as light as possible, 314. I have gathered in by seizing country wagons of the most indifferent character about 100, many without harness and all without beds or covers. Peters being superseded, I can now make no order on him, and I am powerless to provide for the case. I am sending forward detachments of troops, and then following with subsistence, turning back the trains, and then trying to get forward, but 1 can effect nothing in

this way, and I [incur] great risk to my supplies and men by this system of business.
My forces are now in three bodies, 20 miles apart, and my subsistence and ordnance stores divided in the same way, and you will perceive at once that my whole movement must break down. I have relied confidently upon getting the wagons from Memphis, or I would not have attempted to move at all. I send down the Cheney again to get some wagons and harness. I will be forced to fall back, or go forward and risk the loss of my stores, if I do not get transportation. My only reliance is in your having me supplied.

Sir : I am rather astonished that you should encourage the idea that the war in which we are engaged is one to revenge private wrongs and reimburse private losses, by giving your sergeant an order for a watch, which he claims because he lost one. If I understand the purpose of the war, it is for the liberty of my State; that she may have the right to regulate her own affairs and control her own citizens and property without the interference of the abolition government of Abraham Lincoln, and not for private aggrandizement, ambition, or revenge. I hope you will impress this upon your men and caution them against violating General Orders, Nos. 17 and 23.

Hon. L. P. Walker :
The Fourteenth Begiment of Arkansas is at Yellville. It is one of the regiments transferred to General Hardee by agreement with Gibson P. Johnson, as agent of the Department. We understand that General Hardee does not wish to receive it. General Polk has dispatched us, requesting the regiment included in the agreement with Mr. Johnson, but the regiment at Yellville is too distant en route to send him with any convenience. General Hardee has ordered the troops first transferred to him from the northwest of the State to headquarters. This leaves McCulloch’s command small, and but a portion of the State most liable to assault not well defended. Will you order to send this regiment to McCulloch ? Beply.

seem to be the only construction to be put upon the course pursued by you in regard to Colonel Keely’s regiment, to wit, a disposition to consult your own convenience, to gratify your own wishes, and to set up your own judgment in opposition to the positive orders of the commanding general.
You spoke, nevertheless, of the inconvenience of being tied down “and allowed no discretion,” and suggest that your “energies should not be crippled .”
I am not aware of the existence of any evidence of a disposition to do anything of that kind at headquarters. On the contrary, I am conscious of the desfre to give to you the largest discretion and the most efficient support inside of the sphere embraced by your command; and I may add, you will never find the exercise of your discretion curtailed, except when there seems to be a disposition manifested to exceed your lawful authority.
But your explanation is satisfactory, and I waived the transmission of the correspondence to Richmond and all further notice or recollection of the matter, and hope you may have a brilliant and successful campaign.
I send you by the Ohio Belle forty mules, the larger part of which were of the lot put on shore there, and allowed to escape on the landing of the Hill.
I send you a copy of an order sent by me to the quartermaster, Anderson, at Memphis, in regard to other transportation. Let me know if you will want what is ordered.
I desire to correct a remark of yours in your dispatch of the 21st, in reference to your lack of facilities since the superseding of Quartermaster Peters. Your facilities should be as great hereafter as they have been heretofore, and you have only to send your requisitions forward, and they shall be promptly responded to.

General Polk :
General : General Hardee has sent Colonel Borland to see me relative to the co-operation of our commands in the work before us. He tells me that Hardee thinks he cannot advance to Jackson, Cape Girardeau, or any other point. In other words, he thinks himself unable to co-operate at all, but proposes that we shall occupy our positions and await the maturity of the growing crop and the arrival of re-enforcements. This is against my judgment. My ^pinion is that we should move promptly on the enemy’s positions, and dislodge him before he has time to gather his forces and send them down upon us. I regard the success of everything as depending upon our immediate advance.
My present position is very unsatisfactory if I do not at once advance. Imust either go forward or fall back. My force is at Sikeston, Benton, and this place. I was in the act of throwing the forces at this place forward, and would have left to-day with everything. Hardee proposes, if I do not concur in his views, that we refer the matter to you. This

is all that I can do. I can see no military purpose to he accomplished by my going forward without the co operation of Hardee$ for I couM not go beyond Cape Girardeau, and that position is within the line of the enemy, and valueless without advancing farther. I have, therefore, placed the Grampus under the orders of Colonel* Borland, to proceed directly to your headquarters, that our policy be at once and as promptly as possible settled by you. I must go forward or fall back. I must better concentrate my forces. In other words, I cannot hold my command in a state of transition. Is it possible for you to come up %

My opinion is that now to fall back is to give up the cause of Missouri and to let the enemy concentrate his forces upon McCulloch to such an extent as to endanger his position and compel him to fall back, and that it will most probably result in an invasion of Arkansas or the West.

The Arkansas troops have all left the service. How only 3,000 troops are here. A large force ought to be organized at once. The artillery and small-arms ought not to be moved from the West. We have arms for 3,000 men. More should be sent us, if it is possible. Men for twelve months can be raised in Arkansas. Texas offers five regiments for the same term. But little can be expected of Missouri. She has no military leader or arms. Answer. Direct to Col. J. Flournoy, Little Rock, Ark.

General Hardee :
General : Yours of August 13 has just reached me. Colonel Hindman left three days since with the Arkansas State troops for Benton-ville. They will all decline to enter the Confederate States service at present,.but can be re-enlisted for twelve months after twenty days’ absence. It would be a suicidal policy to take any arms now in this quarter away, as it would be next to impossible to get them up Red River in the fall, even if they could be obtained in the South or East.
I am in no condition to advance, or even to meet an enemy here, having little ammunition or supplies of any kind. In fact, with the means of transportation now at my disposal I find it impossible to keep my force supplied, and will, in consequence, shorten my line, by falling back to the Arkansas line, near the Indian Territory, and there proceed to drill and organize a force to meet the enemy when they take the field again in this quarter.
We have little to hope or expect from the people of this State. The force now in the field is undisciplined and led by men who are mere politicians; not a soldier among them to control and organize this mass of humanity. The Missouri forces are in no condition to meet an organized army, nor will they ever be whilst under the present leaders. I dare not join them in my present condition, for fear of having my men completely demoralized. We lost at least 300 stand of arms in the battle of the 10th, taken by their straggling camp followers from my killed and wounded, and before the engagement they borrowed of General Pearce 600 more, none of which they would return after the fight was over. They stole the tents my men left at Cassville to facilitate their march, and brought them after us the next day on the same road. In a word, they are not making friends where they go, and from all I can see we had as well be in Boston as far as the friendly feelings of the inhabitants are concerned.
I would be much pleased to have you join me, but can’t see how you can do so if General Pillow falls back. One thing we may rely upon, and that is, in the event of the continuance of the war, for a large force to be sent in this direction this fall. All the arms, and particularly the artillery, will be needed to meet it.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
BEK McCULLOCH, Brigadier^ General, Commanding.
P. S.—I forgot to say General Price marches on Fort Scott in a day or two, and consequently the Federal troops will be in Springfield in a few weeks unless they are pressed too much by yourself and General Pillow, who, to tell you the truth, I fear will meet with a reverse.

Sir : We have the honor to forward you the inclosed copy of the proceedings of a general meeting of the Cherokee people, held at Tahle-quah, C. N., August 21, 1861. From those proceedings you will see that the thanks of the Cherokee people are tendered to you for the respect you have shown to the neutral position they have heretofore occupied, and that we are authorized to form an alliance with the Confederate States, which we are determined to do as early as practicable. This determination may give rise to movements against the Cherokee people upon their northern border. To be prepared for any such emergency, we have deemed it prudent to proceed to organize a regiment of mounted men and tender them for service. They will be raised forthwith by Col. John Drew, and if received by you will require to be armed. Having abandoned our neutrality and espoused the cause of the Confederate States, we are ready and willing to do all in our power to advance and sustain it.

Tahlequahj August 21,1861.
A general meeting of the Cherokee people was held at Tahlequah on Wednesday, the 21st day of August, 1861. It was called by the executive of the Cherokee Nation for the purpose of giving the Cherokee people an opportunity to express their opinions in relation to subjects of deep interest to themsel ves as individuals and as a nation. The number of persons in attendance, almost exclusively adult males, was about 4,000, whose deportment was characterized by good order and propriety, and the expression of whose opinions and feelings was frank, cordial, and of marked unanimity.
At the appointed time the people met around the speakers7 stand in the public square, when John Ross, principal chief, delivered the following address, which was interpreted by Mr. Alexander Foreman: Friends and Fellow-Citizens : It affords me great pleasure to see so many of you on the present occasion. The invitation to you to meet here went from the executive department, in compliance with the wishes of many citizens who desired to make stronger the cords that bind us together and to advance the common welfare. The circumstances under which you have assembled are full of import. You have precious rights at stake, and your posterity, it may be, will be affected by the sentiments you may express. You need not be told that evil times have befallen the great Government with which we have been connected. Rent by dissensions, its component parts stand in hostile array. They have marshaled powerful armies, who have already engaged in deadly conflicts. The United States claim to contend for the integrity of their Govern-43 R R—VOL HI

ment; the Confederates for tlieir independence and a government of their own. Gigantic preparations are made by both sides to carry on the war. The calamities, the length, and the result of that war cannot be foretold. The Cherokees will be "concerned in its jLSSue, which in all probability, it now appears, will be the establishment of the new government. The attention of your authorities was early directed to the subject from their position and by correspondence with officers of the Confederate States, and the delicate and responsible duty devolved upon them of deciding to some extent the course to be pursued by the Cherokee Nation in the conflict between the whites, to whom she was equally bound in peace and friendship by existing treaties. Our situation is peculiar. Our x>olitical relations had long been established with the United States Government, and which embraces the seceding as well as the adhering States. Those relations still exist. The United States have not asked us to engage in the war, and we could not do so without coming into collision with our friends and neighbors, with whom we are identified by location and similar institutions. Nor, on the other hand, had we any cause to take up arms against the United States, and prematurely and wantonly stake our lives and all our rights upon the hazards of the conflict. I felt it to be my duty, therefore, then to advise the Cherokee people to remain neutral, and issued a proclamation to that effect. I am gratified to know that this course has met the approbation of the great jnass of the Cherokee people, and been respected by the officers of both Governments in a manner that commands our highest gratitude. Our soil has not been invaded, our peace has not been molested, nor our rights interfered with by either Government. On the contrary, the people have remained at home, cultivated their farms in security, and are reaping fruitful returns for their labors. But for false fabrications, we should have pursued our ordinary vocations without any excitement at home, or misrepresentations and consequent misapprehensions abroad, as to the real sentiments and purposes of the Cherokee people. Alarming reports, however, have been pertinaciously circulated at home and unjust imputations among the people of the States. The object seems to have been to create strife and conflict, instead of harmony and goodwill, among the people themselves, and to engender prejudice and distrust, instead of kindness and confidence, towards them by the officers and citizens of the Confederate States.
My fellow-citizens, you have now an opportunity to express your views in an authoritative manner upon the policy which has been pursued by your officers in the present juncture of affairs, and upon questions affecting the harmony of the people, and upon the domestic institutions of the country. The people are here. Say whether you are arrayed in classes one against the other—the full-blood against the white and mixed blood citizens; say whether you are faithful to the constitution and laws of your country—whether you abide by all the rights they guarantee, particularly including that of slavery, and whether you have any wish or purpose to abolish or interfere with it in the Cherokee Nation.
The position which I have assumed in regard to all the important questions which affect the Cherokee people has been too often proclaimed to be misunderstood, however much it may be misrepresented. The great object with me has been to have the Cherokee people harmonious and united in the full and free exercise and enjoyment of all their rights of person and property. Union is strength 5 dissension is weakness, misery, ruin. In time of peace, enjoy peace together; in time of war, if war must come, fight together. As brothers Uve, as brothers

die. While ready and willing to defend our firesides from the robber and murderer, let us not make war wantonly against the authority of the United or Confederate States, but avoid conflict with either, and remain strictly on our own soil. We have homes endeared to us by every consideration, laws adapted to our condition of our own choice, and rights and privileges of the highest character. Here they must be enjoyed or nowhere else. When your nationality ceases here, it will live nowhere else. When these homes are lost, you will find no Others like them. Then, my countrymen, as you regard your own rights, as you regard the welfare of your posterity, be prudent how you act. The permanent disruption of the United States is now probable. The State on our border and the Indian nations about us have severed their connection from the United States and joined the Confederate States. Our general interests are inseparable from theirs, and it is not desirable that we should stand alone. The preservation of our rights and of our existence are above every other consideration. And in view of all the circumstances of our situation I do say to you frankly that in my opinion the time has now come when you should signify your consent for the j^ithorities of the nation to adopt preliminary steps for an alliance with the Confederate States upon terms honorable and advantageous to the Cherokee Nation.
After the delivery of the address of the principal chief and a few pertinent and forcible remarks from Colonel Crawford, Cherokee agent, the meeting was organized by electing Joseph Yann, assistant principal chief, president, and William P. Eoss, secretary. A recess was then had until after dinner, when the people again assembled together. Having been called to order, Pickens M. Benge, on behalf of the people, offered the following preamble and resolutions, which were read in the English and Cherokee languages:
Whereas we, the Cherokee people, have been invited by the executive of the Cherokee Nation, in compliance with the request of many citizens, to meet in general meeting, for the purpose of drawing more closely the bonds of friendship and sympathy which should characterize our conduct and mark our feelings towards each other in view of the difficulties and dangers which have arisen from the fearful condition of affairs among the people of the several States, and for the purpose of giving a free and frank expression of the real sentiments we cherish towards each other, and of our true position in regard to questions which affect the general welfare, and particularly on that of the subject of slavery: Therefore be it hereby
Resolved, That we fully approve the neutrality recommended by the * principal chief in the war pending between the United and the Confederate States, and tender to General McCulloch our thanks for the respect he has shown to our position.
Resolved, That we renew the pledges given by the executive of this nation of the friendship of the Cherokees towards the people of all the States, and particularly towards those on our immediate border, with, whom our relations have been harmonious and cordial, and from whom they should not be separated.
Resolved, That we also take occasion to renew to the Creeks, Choctaws, Seminoles, Chickasaws, and Osages, and others, assurances of continued friendship and brotherly feeling.
Resolved, That we hereby disavow any wish or purpose to create or perpetuate any distinctions between the citizens of our country as to the full and mixed blood, but regard each and all as our brothers, and

entitled to equal rights and privileges according to the constitution and laws of the nation.
Resolved, That we proclaim unwavering attachment to the constitution and laws of the Cherokee Nation, and solemnly pledge ourselves to defend and support the same, and as far as in us lies to secure to the citizens of the nation all the rights and privileges which they guarantee to them.
Resblved, That among the rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws we distinctly reeognize that of property in negro slaves, and hereby publicly denounce as calumniators those who represent us to be abolitionists, and as a consequence hostile to the South, which is both the land of our birth and the land of our homes.
Resolved, That the great consideration with the Cherokee people should be a united and harmonious support and defense of their common rights, and we hereby pledge ourselves to mutually sustain our nationality, and to defend our lives and the integrity of our homes and soil whenever the same shall be wantonly assailed by lawless marauders.
Resolved, That, reposing full confidence in the constituted authorities of the Cherokee Nation, we submit to their wisdom the management qf all questions which affect our interests growing out of the exigencies of the relations between the United and Confederate States of America, and which may render an alliance on our part with the latter States expedient and desirable.

[General Polk:]
General: I have reached this place and find matters as I left them. I am now actively engaged preparing everything to leave in the morning. I learn from a dispatch from Thompson that the enemy is increasing his forces very materially at the Cape. The information is not definite, however, and we cannot tell what his forces are. It enters into my , plans, if successful in taking the Cape and I can get across the river with my force, to leave my heavy guns, with a field battery and Thompson’s force, to hold that place, to cut the river line of communication of the enemy, to cross with all the balance of the force over the bridge across the creek 7 miles beyond Cairo and attack that place in reverse, and if I take Cairo, with the guns there drive out the forces in Bird’s Point.
In anticipation of the movement being made and of success, I wish you to give orders to General Clark if I do succeed, and give him intelligence of the fact, immediately to advance all the Union City forces to my position by railroad through Columbus,* and in order that water transportation be at hand I think you had better have three or four large boats within reach of this place.
This may all become impossible by obstacles in my way, but I do not now see them 5 but if I find the w7ork practicable and I can get boats to

cross the river, it will be attempted, and in view of the possibility of it, I deem these steps on your part prudent and precautionary, without waiting until information could reach you and then orders be sent to Clark.	v. .
If I can take Cairo and hold it, it will put an end to the idea of a descent on the river, and of course there will be no use of force at Union City.

Dear General: Yours of yesterday was received at midnight.* I am satisfied that the information which has caused the trouble is false, but I am also satisfied that if we are delayed much longer we might as well “give up the ship,” for the hordes of the North will soon be poured into Missouri, and the spirit of liberty, that has been enlivened by our successes, will be crushed out by overwhelming masses, and the morale and prestige which we now have over them will be lost. I know that the first duty of a soldier is to obey orders, but I will be very loth to turn back again, and, if we have to be deserted by our Southern friends, I will remain and fight them, if it needs be, solitary and alone. Every hour that has been lost, occasioned by the retreat ordered by General Polk, will cost us a hundred lives. I could have taken Cape Girardeau and closed the navigation of the Mississippi four days ago without losing a man. Now it is doubtful if we can take it at all, as they have found out our strength, or rather my weakness. The position I now have I cannot hold much longer. I must either make a demonstration which will make the enemy wait for me or I must get farther out of danger. I hope to hear fully from you by return courier.

After leaving you at Fort Pillow I had much conversation with Colonel Borland in regard to Hardee’s position and ability to advance and join me. He is of opinion that Hardee cannot do so, and that the attempt to do so will endanger the command, and he says that such is Hardee’s opinion. Hardee is an old officer, of large experience, and I have thought That with this positive expression of opinion by him, knowing, as he must, his exact position and resources, it is perhaps

not prudent for us to constrain him by your decision to act against his positively expressed opinion in a matter involving the safety of the force under his command. Anxious as I have been and am still to advance, such is the conclusion at which I .have arrived, after much reflection upon the subject; and on last night I followed Colonel Borland (who had left) with a dispatch to General Hardee, in which I said to him substantially the conclusion at which I had arrived, viz, that he must be the best judge of his ability to advance, and that if his opinion was clear that he could not advance with safety to his command, I was unwilling that he should do so under my advice, and that I felt satisfied you would not have him come forward at the risk of his command and in opposition to his own judgment. This much I felt upon reflection it was my duty to say, and I feel persuaded you will approve. I directed Hardee to advise me at the earliest possible moment of his conclusion. In the mean time I have suspended any advance until I can hear from Hardee, and I have ordered my advance to take position behind a strong point at the causeway across the heads of the swamp, 4 miles this side of Benton, and at Sikeston, as a matter of precaution.
On my return last night I found General Cheatham strongly opposed to moving upon the Cape, and he said the commanders of his regiments were also, believing that the position was one of too great exposure, and that the enemy could too readily throw upon us at that place an overwhelming and crushing force. During my absence down the river Cheatham had received similar letters from Colonels Smith and Wright, who were with Colonel McCown, in the advance. All these considerations induce me to hesitate and to doubt the conclusion to which I had arrived, and to submit the whole matter to you for reconsideration and for your instructions. Without the co-operation of Hardee’s force, my judgment has been all the while against the movement; and I must confess that with Hardee and Borland both expressing the opinion that he cannot advance to join me, and that in doing so he endangers the whole force to be cut up by a flank attack or an attack upon his rear while marching, I think that it is upon the whole best to let Hardee decide what he can do ; and if he says he cannot advance with safety to his command, in that event the movement against the Cape had better be suspended. In that event I think his force should be brought over to the river front and occupy this place and fortify it in conjunction with your works at No. 10, while your own force could be disposed the more effectually to protect the river and interior of Tennessee, and after strongly fortifying Island No. 10 you may see the way open to fortify Columbus.
My opinion is well matured and settled in all I have said above, except that the remarks of the last paragraph are thrown out as suggestions, not as matured opinions, for your consideration.
My opinion is that Hardee will not advance, and therefore I regard this dispatch as presenting for your consideration the question as to what shall be my future position.
Borland said to me distinctly that while he believed Hardee would make the attempt under your decision, yet that he knew it was against his (H.’s) judgment, and that he did not see how he could accomplish the movement.
In regard to the appointments made by Colonel McCown, I would remark that appointments made by him under our law 0% organization I think are valid until the law ceases to be of force. That law is in force until the transfer is completed in all its arms. These appointments were all made before the muster up here was completed. The appointments

I thought good ones. We needed the additional lieutenants of artillery for one large artillery force, and we can get nothing from Eichmond. I therefore, believing the appointments valid, approved them, and I still think we had better let them pass without question. The appointments are all as good as can be had in the Army ; the appointees are young gentlemen of talent and high promise, and taken from the line of lieutenants in the Army, I believe.
I would be glad to have your, conclusion and instructions in regard to this whole dispatch, the length of which I would be glad to curtail, but which, in justice to the whole subject, cannot be done.
I have just received the inclosed dispatch, a copy of which I send you. This looks as if he was going to make the attempt. He will not make the attempt, however, before he receives mine; then I shall have his reply and conclusion. Hardee has no heavy artillery, and if you think he should come over upon the river, he could fall back upon Black Eiver and cross over to the plank road, and bring all light and with but little baggage. That road might be so repaired as to enable him to cross and reach this place. With his left resting at the head of the swamp and where they cross the ridge, where mine now is ordered, and that point fortified, his position could not be turned except by passing over the very country which he finds impracticable. His right on the river here, and that fortified 5 the line crossing the river at Island No. 10, with your works there; your force with its left at those works and your right on Union City. These lines sustained, hold the enemy’s only approach down the river or on either side, and for defensive purppse a line could not be chosen shorter or better capable of defense within so close proximity of the enemy’s front. The road from Benton to Bloomfield crosses the Mgger Wool Swamp, which no well-appointed army can pass over now.
I shall take no action until I hear from you, unless I get intelligence that Hardee is actually on the advance.
Bespectfully, yours,
GID. J. PILLOW,
Brigadier^ General, C. 8. Army.

General Pillow:
My Hear General: I have received another,dispatch from you dated the 20th. I am anxiously awaiting the return of Colonel Borland. Whatever is determined on I shall endeavor to accomplish. I need not again repeat that I have neither transportation nor provisions to enable me to move. I will do all in my power to get up both. Some of my wagons have reached me, others are on the way, and one boat with provisions has reached Pocahontas.
I have been unwell, but am better. I take it for granted that you will not now turn back, and that we will make a junction here or at Fred-ricktown. I have sent another party to break up the Ironton Railroad; but to make sure of it, as soon as you are safe from Cape Girardeau,' I would suggest the propriety of detailing General Jeff. Thompson for that purpose.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,

Dear General: I was sick in bed when your letter of yesterday* was received^ but I was so encouraged by it that I am at my post, in full vigor, this morning. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you to-night, as your presence in the front is necessary to keep your own men in spirits, as well, or more so, than mine. 1 will get my men in handling order to-night, so that any plan which may be determined upon can at once be carried out. I am informed that the men I had with Hardee (from twelve to fifteen hundred), when ordered to return to Greenville, left him, and are .now at Dallas, on the way to join me. I will send out to them, and place them in a position to assist in the attack on the Cape, which will give the impression that Hardee’s whole force is with them.

I hardly know whether to say I am glad to hear it or not, for, although I am very anxious to have you with me, yet I would not have you displease General Hardee or disobey orders. If you are near Dallas, as reported, and have not received some orders from Hardee, you must turn to the left, and go to the point called Gravel Boad, or to where the gravel road crosses Whitewater, and report to me every morning after your picket "comes in. My pickets are within six miles of the Cape all the time, and you can probably keep yours at Jackson. I will make a forward movement to-morrow, and will probably bring my whole force to join you, and make a demonstration from your direction. I have 4,000 Confederate troops with me, and the whole line will be up to-day or to-morrow. Be vigilant; let no man, friend or foe, pass from your lines into or from the Cape, and, when in position, let me hear from you as often as necessary.

I certainly do not intend to keep my men in this dangerous position any longer, when I know there is no occasion for it. We never had any business this^ side of the swamps, and it has only been a Memphis fear that prompted such a move. If not allowed to take Cape Girardeau, to obtain supplies, and then fall back on your line, I must go to you at once, for I may be cut to pieces here any night. Your Arkansas men can live on beef alone, and then live better than they ever lived at home, the same as my Missourians 5 and in a war of liberty coffee, sugar, and rice are not indispensable. Excuse my speaking so bluntly. My heart is in this cause, and I know that every hour is costing lives.

Dear General: Your flattering letter, turning over the job that must be done to me, is at hand.* Had I not been restrained by positive orders from General Pillow I would have had Cape Girardeau before now, and would have been at your service. I see that you expected General Pillow to be at this point. Instead of that he returned from Memphis yesterday, and will start in this direction from New Madrid ^ to-day. I suppose he will be here to-night or to-morrow. Every day " lost since I have been here may cost 100 lives, for the enemy have found by now our numbers, whereas they would have run before without firing a shot. I have heard, by rumors, that Lowe’s command has started to join me. If so, I hope it is by your orders, as I am not disposed to encourage disobedience.

From the facts then before me I thought it best for you to move forward and join General Pillow and command at Benton. I supposed you could do so without danger to your command while in transitu, and when you had made the junction you could then judge whether it might be expedient to move still farther forward, or whether it be better for the whole command—yours and that of General Pillow—to fall back on New Madrid, and take up such positions on the river on both sides, on the line of Island No. 10, as might promise the best for defenses.
Since then I have come to the conclusion that the same object might be accomplished without any risk to your command, by your falling back from Greenville and passing to the river over the plank road to Point Pleasant.
At all events I am satisfied you should not go forward, but retire towards your base until we are all better prepared for a forward movement.
If the working of the saltpeter mines on White River was not an object of the greatest consequence to us, I should repeat the advice given in my dispatch by Colonel Borland to abandon your line altogether. I did not remember those mines when I wrote you, and do not think it would be well to open the line from the interior of Missouri upon them. They are our chief dependence for the material for making powder, and should be protected by an adequate force somewhere in the neighborhood. The object of keeping that force there may not and ought not to be known; acquainted as you are with the country you can judge of the force required for that purpose, and when that is left on that line, my opinion is that the rest of your force should be on or near the river, somewhere in the region of Chalk Bluff and New Madrid. Of this latter disposition we can speak when you are more at ease than at present.
In my last dispatch by Colonel Borland I gave my reasons for the opinion I expressed as to the expediency of your going forward. Of their weight, in view of your knowledge of the strength of your command and the difficulties before you, you were left to judge. If I had possessed the information I now have I should have advised you retiring as I have done above. I hope, therefore, this will reach you before you shall have made a forward movement, and that you will be able to fall back without inconvenience to your command.

Of the expediency of the movement, notwithstanding the diminution of this force and the fact that Island No. 10 had been seized and fortified, I have never been entirely satisfied.

In your dispatch you say that upon reflection, on certain considerations which yon enumerated, u I am induced to hesitate and doubt the conclusion at which I had arrived (as to the expediency of a forward movement), and to submit the whole matter to you for reconsideration and for your instructions.’7
My opinion is that you should abandon for the present this forward movement, and my orders are that you recall your troops as soon as you can with safety to New Madrid, and that the plan submitted by me for the present employment of these troops be carried out, to wit, that a part of the force acting with you, that of General Thompson, with his consent, be posted at the best position that can be found on the Missouri side of the river, and the rest of [the] forces be divided between the fortified position of Island No. 10 and the post at Union City. The details of this distribution will be communicated in a subsequent order.
I have dispatched to General Hardee that my opinion is he should abandon a forward movement and fall back on his base. His further movements will be matter for further consideration.

He is now marchirig with this army towards the Missouri River, in the direction of Lexington, near which place he proposes to concentrate as large a force as possible, with a view to future operations. He cannot, consistently with his present plans, detach any portion of his command for service beyond the river just now, and you will therefore, unless you can raise a sufficient force to maintain your position unaided bring your troops to this side of the river, and effect a junction with this army at its proposed present destination near Lexington. An army can be organized there to operate north of the river.

broken up by the withdrawal of the Missouri forces under the orders of Governor Jackson, and in response to an application from General Pillow they were ordered to New Madrid, since which we learn, but not officially, that General Pillow has abandoned New Madrid. The President has expected daily to receive from you*, as he hopes, satisfactory information in relation to these events.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
Headquarters,
New Madrid, August 28, 1861.
Major-General Polk :
General : I have just received Hardee’s reply to your dispatch and mine in regard to his co-operation with me. He says that he cannot advance, and will not attempt it. That point being settled, it only remains for me, with as good grace as I can,' to turn my face (now ready for the first time since I landed at this place) upon other duty, without an apparent abandonment of a forward movement. I have to-day visited the works being built above this place. To my surprise I found the battery constructed on ground subject to fully 3 feet of overflow, and about a mile above the head of the island, in a muddy, damp, and dark forest of heavy cottonwood. Opposite this battery there is a wide and flat sand bar, over which boats can float in a full river at least 1 mile, and I think 1J miles from the battery. It is built on the very brink of a soft bank already chipping off by the action qf the water. The first full river will sweep away the parapet. In addition to this error in the selection of the site, the engineer is now grading down the original bank within the work fully 2 feet, so that the seep water will drive out the forces in the work before the river gets within 3 or 4 feet of high-water mark. The forest is so damp and the overflow bottom is so wet, that it is impossible for troops to live in the work. They will die like sheep of the rot.
Just at the head of the island, on the Tennessee shore, there is a good position for a battery to command the Tennessee chute, and about half way down the island, on the west side, is a very favorable position for another battery to command the western chute. The Tennessee battery can be turned and taken in reverse, and has but little advantage of position, and when taken, that channel of the river is open, and the other battery will be of no practical value. In addition to these two batteries, both of which must have a strong supporting force, you must have a strong intrenched work at this place, else that work will be liable to be cut off from its river base. My judgment therefore is, that the value of this position is greatly overrated. Less than 5,000 men could not hold this place, and an equal force on the Tennessee shore, and 1,000 on the island, which would make the position a very expensive one. Even then it will not add materially to the safety of the river. You are in possession at Fort Pillow of the only strong strategical position on the river below Columbus. My mind reaches now to that gateway into Tennessee as the only protection against an invading column into the interior as well as descent down the river. That has always been my opinion, and it was to get as far on the way to Columbus as I could go that induced me to establish the force at Union City, looking with certainty to the time that I could occupy Columbus.

686	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X.
That time, I think, has arrived. Kentucky is now a boiling caldron. Lincoln forces are organized and under arms in five counties in the State. They are rapidly aggregating into military organizations and threatening a descent upon Tennessee. General Anderson is in command or on his way to take command of these forces. Every paper we meet is full of accounts of the pouring of arms and munitions of war into the State to make war upon the patriots of that State and Tennessee. Kentucky neutrality is no longer regarded, if indeed it ever was. In addition to this, it is well known that Fr6mont had his boats loaded with troops to take possession of Columbus when he received the news of Lyon’s defeat.
If you do not intend to let the enemy take possession of that gateway, you must take it first. If he gets possession of it once, you can never dislodge him. Its possession is a military necessity, involving the ultimate safety of Tennessee from devastating invasion. My force here being now well organized, equipped, and in hand, give me permission and I will do the work and hold all below protected and safe. With the Union City forces added to mine, I can close the door effectu-ually against invasion of Tennessee or descent of the Mississippi. It will not hasten matters in Kentucky. As rapidly as events can hurry on the conflict it is coming, and as soon as it is possible for Lincoln to raise forces to meet other pressing wants he will take possession of this place, and from it, as a point dhippui, he will direct his column upon Tennessee.
If you approve, send me three boats, one at a time, and make arrangements to have the Union City forces advanced when I notify the commanding officer, and authorize me to use the guns now at the works above, and to take Captain Gray with me. I will draw back my forces so gently to this place and move up there, and have everything secure before the enemy is in condition to move. If you approve, send me up the gunboats. This move will attract so much attention when made that the real object of the move here will not be thought of. It will avoid any discussion, and if any reference is made to it, the failure of Hardee to co-operate will vindicate the movement and commend the discretion of turning the object of the campaign to so good an account. If we do not move now, we never can.
If you can come up and yourself examine the works above as they are being constructed and the site of those proposed, you will see that my judgment is correct. Since I have myself examined these positions, I beg to say that my opinion of their value as a line of defense is greatly modified. This is the only position left us, and that is a paramount military necessity, and is now clearly justified by the attitude of Kentucky and the action of the Federal Government and troops, utterly disregarding her assumed neutrality. If you leave me discretion, I will be there before the object is suspected. I am willing to be saddled with all the responsibility. If I am allowed to make the move, I will send Cheatham to take possession by Union City forces first, and fix some field pieces there before I advance with the forces by water. If you send me the gunboat I may move differently. If you will allow me to make the move, and place the Union City forces, gunboat, steamers, and forces above here at my disposal, I know how to do the work.
Let me hear from you as early as possible. If you do not approve,. don’t hurry me away, as I am trying to effect a move on Cairo. I will be cautious and make no false step. I wish to aid Thompson by placing this portion of Missouri in safe position. We owe the people who have so committed themselves to our policy that much, and while we

I am fully impressed with the value of Columbus as commanding the river and as the gateway to the interior of Tennessee. From information I am satisfied that it is a very strong position. If you should be of opinion that Kentucky's neutrality has been violated by the Federal forces and that the time has arrived for the occupation of Columbus for protection of the people of Kentucky and Tennessee, then I regard it as a military necessity to occupy and fortify that place.

Hon. L. P. Walker :
Sir: The volunteers of Brigadier-General Pearce’s command vrere turned over to the Confederate States by agreement with Brigadier-General Hardee. The exigencies of the Northwest hindered these forces from being placed under the actual control of General Hardee. When now, however, that general has sent his agent to that region to take them in charge, we sent an agent on the part of the military board of Arkansas to see that they were duly turned over to General Hardee. These troops were raised for most part in the region where they now are. They were mustered at first into the service of the State, and their individual consent is necessary to perfect the transfer. This might have been readily obtained before the battle near Springfield. We are advised by our agent that it will now be next to impossible to obtain it without the condition that they have the command of General McCulloch, under whom they fought and passed from the region in which they were situated across to General Hardee, with whom they are unacquainted. We ask that the agreement with General Hardee be so far modified as to enable us to turn these forces over to General McCulloch. Without this they will probably disband. The forces with General Hardee may be immediately recruited by an Arkansas regiment, which is already organized, and is now near him. The matter is important. Reply at once.

well#satisfied from the working of the existing arrangements that a change is necessary. For these operations to be directed wisely, harmoniously, and successfully they should be combined from west to east across the Mississippi Valley, and placed* under the direction of one head, and that head should have large discretionary powers. Such a position is one of very great responsibility, involving and requiring large experience and extensive military knowledge, and I know of no one so well equal to that task as our friend General Albert S. Johnston. Such an appointment would cover all the commands of the generals now operating in fields nearest the enemy in the West and would give universal satisfaction. Indeed, actual experience shows that all the generals now in the Western field, having separate commands, operate to great disadvantage in consequence of the want of a single head. As I am informed our friend General Johnston is daily expected, I beg leave very respectfully but earnestly to urge upon you the expediency of this appointment. The success of our campaign in this valley may depend upon such an arrangement, and I know of no man who has the capacity to fill the position, who could be had, but General Johnston.
Hoping these views may commend themselves acceptably to your consideration, I remain, very truly, your friend,

Gaptain: I came down from the Island No. 10 Bend last night at the request of General Pillow. I go up in an hour, but will go down to Memphis in the first boat after this, say to-morrow, to see the general.
I have six guns in position and an impenetrable parapet, so that the enemy cannot now trouble us while erecting the larger works at Island No. 10.
I wrote a note to General Pillow’s dispatch, at his request, and believe what I said to be the best move. I wish to communicate in person with the general himself upon all our matters here^ and things of importance. I wish the general commanding could let the troops remain as they are now here, until I see him in a day or two.
We are progressing as well as can be expected under the circumstances.

Sir : In the act of transfer, &c., entered into between the governor and military board of the State of Arkansas and Brigadier-General Hardee on the part of this Government, it was stipulated, as your excellency will remember, that the State of Arkansas should furnish field transportation, &c., for the troops so transferred, and that the Confederate Government should repay to the State all her outlay thus expended.

While this Department acknowledges fully the obligation of this stipulation, it is nevertheless of opinion that the existence of two distinct departments, both engaged in the same operations, will lead necessarily to confusion and additional expense, and thus to the injury of the service.
This Department therefore desires that the immediate agents of the Government, in its own Quartermaster Department, shall take charge of all transportation thus provided for, so that there may be henceforth but one organization engaged in this work, and that directly responsible to this Government. The Department assures your excellency of the ability and willingness of the Confederate Government to provide satisfactorily for the Arkansas troops in this respect in such manner that no loss shall accrue to them thereby.
Your excellency is therefore informed that the Quartermaster’s Department of the Confederate Government has been directed to make all necessary arrangements for the transportation of the Arkansas troops, with authority to make such purchases of means of transportation, &c., now in the possession of the State of Arkansas, as may be deemed necessary and expedient. Such expenses as have been actually incurred under the stipulation above referred to by the State of Arkansas will of course be paid for by this Government according to the terms therein agreed.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

The Arkansas troops are all mustered out of service. But 20 men remain. The arms and other stores ought to be turned over to me, and not taken to Pocahontas. Without these arms this country will be in a defenseless condition. Other men should be raised at once and these arms put in their hands, or we will not be ready to meet the enemy. There are 3,000 stand of small-arms and ten pieces of artillery. The Cherokees have joined the South, and offered me a regiment. They and other Indian forces need arms.

Fayetteville, Ark., September 1,1861. John Boss, Principal Chief, and
Executive Council of the Cherokee Nation;
Sirs : 1 am in receipt of your letter of August 24, also a copy of the proceedings of a mass meeting of the Cherokee people.
Permit me to congratulate you upon the course you have thought proper to pursue. The people of the Confederate States and those of the Cherokee Nation must share a common destiny. Their interest and institutions are the same. Then let us as brothers co-operate against a common enemy to us and those institutions, and drive them from our borders whenever they dare approach them. I will most gladly receive the regiment you tender the Confederate States so soon as you conclude a treaty wifch the same. At the same time will take this occasion to inform you of the fact of my having already authorized Col. Stand Watie to raise a force for the protection of your northern border, but at the same time not to interfere with the neutrality of the Nation by pccupying a position within its limits, Your northern border shall be

protected until the proposed treaty shall be ratified between your Nation and the Confederate States. General Pike, who alone is authorized to make treaties with the several Indian nations and tribes on our borders, will meet your chiefs, and conclude a treaty, by which both parties will stand or fall in one common cause.
I shall forward copies of the documents you sent me to my Government.
Hoping a treaty will be made that shall prove advantageous to all concerned, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
BEN. McOULLOCH, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Fayetteville, Ark., September 1,1861. Col. John Drew, Cherohee Nation :
Sir : Yours of the 24th August is now before me. I am, as will be my country, pleased with the course your chiefs and people have pursued. Our interests are the same. Then let us make it a common cause by uniting our forces against a common enemy.
As soon as a treaty can be entered into between your chiefs and General Pike your regiment will be received and mustered into service.
In accordance with the wishes of your principal chief, John Boss, I have not employed any of your people within your limits, but have required all those who wish to join me to do so outside of the Nation. I authorized Col. Stand Watie to raise a force to assist me in protecting your northern border from invasion by meeting the enemy north of your line. This he has done, and with his assistance I shall see that your frontier is well protected until the proper treaty is ratified and your regiment can take the field.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Sir : I arrived here two days since, at which time the State troops were to be mustered into the Confederate service. They have all gone home except some 18 or 20. In a few weeks many of them can be re-enlisted. They do not like the idea of being sent to Pocahontas and leaving their own homes unprotected, The arms turned over by them

to General Hardee are at this place, near 3,000 in number. They ought by all means to be left out here, and placed at the disposal of the officers in charge of this country and the Indian Territory. There is not a single company in my command armed with the minie musket or rifle. There are among these arms 1,000 of these muskets, and other arms far superior to those, in the hands of my men. The artillery ought to be placed in good condition, and also allowed to remain in this section, as we may have to meet the enemy on the prairies or plains this fall. My reason for urging the Department to let these arms remain in this sec-, tion is the fact of its being impossible to get others here this fail, owing to the condition of the Arkansas Biver at this season of the year, whilst they can be conveyed at any time to Pocahontas. All the arms and army stores in this region ought to be under the control of the officer in command of this quarter 5 and at the same time it would be well to attach to his command that portion of Arkansas which includes the road from Springfield to Fort Smith, which is known as the Telegraph road. This country is too far from Pocahontas to be under the charge of the officer in command at that point, and is one of the routes the enemy will attempt to force should they ever attempt an invasion of this State.
I shall immediately have raised two companies of artillery for service during the war in addition to the one from Texas, as we will greatly need them on the prairies this fall. I hope this course will meet your approbation.
I would also ask you to keep in service such men as I have been compelled to employ and muster into the service for twelve months.
You will see by the documents inclosed that the Gherokees have at last joined the South, and offered our Government a regiment. This, no doubt, was brought about by the battle of Oak Hills. I have, previous to this time, employed some of the Cherokees, under Col. Stand Watie, to assist me in protecting the northern borders of the Cherokees from the inroads of the jayhawkers of Kansas. This they have effectually done, and at this time are on the Cherokee neutral lands in Kansas. Col. Stand Watie belongs to the true Southern party, composed mostly of mixed bloods, and opposed to John Boss, and by whose course and influence Boss was induced to join the South. I hope our Government will continue this gallant man and true friend of our country in service, and attach him and his men (some 300) to my command. It might be well to give him a battalion separate from the Cherokee regiment under Colonel Drew. Colonel Drew’s regiment will be mostly composed of full-bloods, whilst those with Col. Stand Watie will be half-breeds, who are educated men, and good soldiers anywhere, in or out of the Nation. Having been left without instructions in many particulars, i have pursued the course I thought most beneficial to my country.
Hoping these acts will meet with your approval, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
BEN. MCCULLOCH,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
P. S.—Colonel Hindman informs me there are not more than 1,500 guns at this point turned over to him. Some of the men hold their arms until the State pays them for their services,

Headquarters First Military District, Mo. S. G.,
Camp Hunter, September 2, 1861.
To all whom it may concern:
Whereas Maj. Gen. John 0. Fremont, commanding the minions of Abraham Lincoln in the State of Missouri, has seen fit to declare martial law throughout the whole State, and has threatened to shoot any citizen soldier found in arms within certain limits; also to confiscate the property and free the negroes belonging to the members of the Missouri State Guard:
Therefore know ye that I, M. Jeff. Thompson, brigadier-general of the First Military District of Missouri, having not only the military authority of brigadier-general, but certain police powers, granted by Acting Gov. Thomas C. Reynolds, and confirmed afterwards by Governor Jackson, do most solemnly promise that for every member of the Missouri State Guard, or soldier of our allies, the armies of the Confederate States, who shall be put to death in pursuance of this said order of General Fr6mont, I will “hang, draw, and quarter” a minion of said Abraham Lincoln.
While I am anxious that this unfortunate war shall be conducted, if possible, upon the most liberal principles of civilized warfare, and every order that I have issued has been with that object, yet, if this rule is to be abandoned (it must first be done by our enemies), I intend to exceed General Fremont in his excesses, and will make all tories that come within my reach rue the day that a different policy was adopted by their leader.
Already mills, barns, warehouses, and other private property has been wastefully destroyed by the enemy in this district, while we have taken nothing except articles strictly contraband, or absolutely necessary. Should these things be repeated, I will retaliate tenfold, so help me God!

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk,
Commanding Department No. 2, Memphis, Tenn.:
General : I received yesterday your letter of the 30th ultimo.* I am much pleased that my views in falling back have finally met your approval. Before your letter was received I informed General Pillow that I could not advance; that I had neither provisions nor transportation, but if both had been at command I could not, against my better judgment, have entered into the arrangement proposed. I hope before this that General Pillow has returned to New Madrid. In all the views expressed by you concerning my movements and operations, you fail, I think, to consider the orders under which I am acting. The Secretary of War, in assigning me to command in Arkansas, directed me to protect the district included in my command and the counties in Missouri contiguous thereto. I beg to call your attention to these instructions, for, with every disposition to co-operate with you, I must not lose sight of my instructions or my duty to Arkansas.
I mentioned in a former communication that I did not believe the enemy would attempt to invade Arkansas from this direction, and gave

my reasons for that opinion. I also expressed my belief that the enemy would make an attempt on Memphis, and suggested that you should get authority from the War Department to order me in that event to your assistance. I stated that I could, if that event happened, fight more effectively for Arkansas east of the Mississippi than anywhere else, for if Memphis fell the mouth of the Arkansas would also fall into the possession of the enemy, and this would be the greatest calamity which could befall the State and the army within its borders. I did not wish to convey the impression that I desired, except under the contingency mentioned, to give up this base. If I should do so, I should be forced to seek another not so good in the western part of the State.
I shall devote all my energies to putting this command in fighting order; it needs instruction, organization, and discipline. The State is making efforts to supply clothing, which is much needed.
With high respect, your obedient servant,
W. J. HARDEE, Brigadier-General.
Humboldt, Midnight, September 3, 1861.
Captain Blake :
We have been here three hours. The enemy are maneuvering with gunboats and 3,000 men near Columbus, on Missouri side. We have ordered Colonel McCown, who is at Union City, to put his whole force aboard the cars and hold himself in readiness to move at a minute’s notice. We start in a few moments for Union City. We are in telegraph office, communicating with Hickman, Columbus, and Union City. Pillow’s command is fast arriving at Hickman. We have 2,500 men there now. Send every available company, with provisions, to Union City, to take the place of the force that is leaving. Send a good officer to command them. Also tell Captain Hunt to send up the rifled 32-pounder, with ammunition for it, to Union City. The enemy are reconnoitering with rockets. We will have a fight to-morrow unless they retreat.
Thrasher’s company has left here. Had you not better court-martial him, unless you ordered him to leave? The commissary and quartermaster must be ready to send supplies to Union City, or to other points via Union City, without one moment’s delay.

seems to be the case. From intelligence received to-day from Fort Smith this has begn induced by the advice of General N. B. Pearce^ whose conduct deserves the severest reprehension. I understand he is an applicant for promotion by Confederate appointment, against which I protest solemnly, until his conduct can be investigated liy the authorities here. All will be done here that is possible to take care of McCulloch. All things look portentous now.
H. M. BEOTOB.
Executive Office,
Little Rode, Arlc., September 4,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : In view of the extensive preparations on foot by the Lincoln Government, I conceive it important that the 3.000 men called for from Arkansas by your requisition of June 24 should be raised and prepared for service with as little delay as possible. Considering that one-third of our men are already under arms, and that recruiting officers are being sent through the State from the respective divisions of the Army, together with the objections generally urged against enlisting for the war, I am confident that several months will elapse before the number called for will be obtained under the present plan. .
I am in receipt of letters daily from parties who signify a willingness to accept the service, but there are difficulties in the way. First, it is impossible to get up a full company in any one county or locality, the men being only procurable in squads of five, ten, or twenty. After being thus obtained they require subsistence, with authority given to mustering officers to swear them in and control them until the whole can be got together. Again, after the company is organized, perhaps remote from the camp of instruction, transportation is necessary to convey them to the proper point.
All these obstacles are retarding progress in furnishing the men you desire, and I am anxious to have them obtained, if possible, that Arkansas may respond promptly to the call made upon her. We have the men, if they can be aggregated.
I beg leave to renew earnestly, therefore, the suggestions contained in the communication directed to be addressed to you from Edmund Burgevin, adjutant-general of this State, and regard the matter of so much importance to the public service as to render it proper that General Burgevin should proceed to Bichmond and ask your attention to the subject at once, hoping that you will either consent to send recruiting officers with proper instructions, or that gentlemen be named in the State authorized to get up the regiments on their own account, with the promise of a command in the organization when complete. If the latter plan is adopted, and I am inclined to think it the best, I know of no man in Arkansas whose qualifications would commend him so highly as colonel of one of the regiments as the gentleman who presents this communication.
The general, until recently, has been actively engaged in State service as adjutant-general, and I hazard nothing in saying he has peculiar adaptation and qualifications for the position to which I recommend him. Besides this, in connection with my own efforts, he rendered valuable services to the Southern cause while Arkansas was wavering in the balance between the old and new Governments. Without the general^ labors and perils, coupled with my own, the forts and arsenal

in Arkansas would now, in all probability, be garrisoned, like those of Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland, with Northern soldiery. To his efforts the Southern cause is much indebted for the stand Arkansas finally assumed beside her Southern sister States. Manfully facing the political storm that raged over the country, he imperiled his life, property, and reputation in the support of Southern independence. I think such men deserve service at the hands of the Confederate Government, when their qualifications justify the bestowal of such confidence.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
H. M. RECTOR, Governor of Arkansas.
Little Rook, Ark., September 4,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : It was my intention to have left this evening for Richmond, but the distressing intelligence of the entire disbandment of our troops on the Western frontier by General Pearce, and the dangerous predicament in which General McCulloch is placed by that most unprecedented act, have induced me to forego my intended visit.
The condition of affairs has materially changed since the writing of the inclosed letter.^ Then McCulloch was at the head of a victorious army, in which the State was well represented. The intelligence of last night has changed the whole aspect of things—the Arkansas troops disbanded, McCulloch in retreat from Springfield, and our wounded at that place left to the tender care of a merciless foe. Who knows what may next occur ? Arkansas may at any moment need her sons to defend her from the insults of the enemy. My services may at any moment be needed at home, and whether colonel, captain, or private, I belong to my country, body and soul.
It is certainly with great regret that I am compelled, under present circumstances, to lose the opportunity of visiting the capital, and the honor of an interview with yourself.
The subject-matter of the inclosed is left to your consideration, and in whatever manner it may be decided, it will, I assure you, be satisfactory to your most obedient servant,

Missouri, it is all important that I should have a full understanding with you before that movement commences. As I am here instead of at Greenville, where you supposed your letters would reach me, I judge it not important that I should meet you at New Madrid. The Point Pleasant plank road can be examined by some one elsd as well or better than by myself. If agreeable to you, I would prefer to confer with you in Memphis, which place I can reach as expeditiously as New Madrid. 9 If this arrangement suits you, inform me be express, and I will come over as soon as possible.
I hope you will not send any troops to this place until I see you. They can be fed more cheaply on the Mississippi, and at present I am not prepared to move. My men are much in want of clothing. I am taking all proper measures to get it, but as I can only get it by making an appeal to the patriotic citizens of Arkansas, some time must necessarily elapse before it can be procured. I am sending one or two influential men to each county where companies have been raised to induce the people to aid me in this matter. I shall send this by express from Pocahontas, and hope to hear from you by the same route in a few days.

Governor of Arkansas, Little Rock, Ark. :
Sir : The following is a copy of a telegram which I sent to you yesterday, and which, in view of its importance, I here copy for fear it may not have reached you:
General McCulloch telegraphed that the Arkansas troops in his command have been mustered out of service and have taken with them their arms and batteries. Unless this is remedied disaster may befall him. All the Arkansas troops not exactly in Hardee’s command should be sent to McCulloch without delay, and the arms and batteries should be returned to him, with which to arm other troops willing to join him.
In view, furthermore, of the great importance of this crisis, I would respectfully suggest to your excellency to induce, by every means in your power, the Arkansas troops of McCulloch’s division to return at once to service under McCulloch if possible, and also to incorporate all the organized companies, regiments, or battalions now in your State, but not yet mustered into service, into McCulloch’s division as soon as

possible. I would also further suggest to your excellency to call at once, by proclamation, for as many more troops, by regiments or companies, as will suffice to insure a total of ten or twelve Arkansas regiments at least under McCulloch’s command, and to master the same as soon as possible into service, and to do all in your power to arm them speedily with the arms of the disbanded regiments, or with any other arms that may be procured. I would also request your excellency to communicate freely with the officers commanding on your frontiers, so that you may have timely knowledge of their wants, and they may know what to expect from you.

Headquarters,
Gamp Jackson, Ark., September 10, 1861. Citizens of Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana:
Every exertion is now being made on the part of our enemies of the North to retrieve their late disastrous defeats on the plains of Manassas and the late battle-field of Oak Hills. It now becomes necessary, in order to maintain the glorious achievements of our arms, that a large force should be thrown into the field on this frontier; and having received instructions from the War Department at Eichmond to increase the force under my command, I will receive and muster into the service of the Confederate States five regiments of infantry from each of the above-named States, by companies, battalions, or regiments, for three years or during the war. Those from Arkansas will rendezvous at Fort Smith and Camp Jackson. I have in my possession arms sufficient to equip two regiments of Arkansas troops. The remaining three are required to equip themselves with the best they can procure. The forces from Texas will rendezvous at Sherman. Those from Louisiana will rendezvous at Little Bock. Both of the above named are expected to equip themselves with the best arms they can procure. An officer will be detailed to muster into the service the forces from each State at their respective places of rendezvous. The commanding officers of companies, battalions, and regiments, as soon as they have been mustered into service, will procure the necessary transportation for their several commands, and march them at once to Camp Jackson, unless otherwise ordered. Each man will be provided with two suits of winter clothes and two blankets, together with tents, if they can be procured. It is desirable that the forces of the several States should be in the field at as early a day as possible. I call upon you, therefore, to rally to the defense of your sister State, Missouri. Her cause is your cause, and the cause of justice and independence. Then rally, my countrymen, and assist your friends in Missouri to drive back the Eepublican myrmidons that still pollute her soil and threaten to invade your own country, confiscate your property, liberate your slaves, and put to the sword every true Southern man who dares to take up arms in defense of his rights.
The principles inaugurated in this war by the proclamation of Major-General Fremont should warn the South of the ultimate intentions of the North, and show them the necessity of rallying to the standard of their country (for the time specified above), prepared to fight in defense of their homes, their altars, and their firesides until our independence shall be recognized and its blessings secured to our posterity.

for three mounted regiments. Sufficient and ample grounds should be chosen for the camp, so as to give full and adequate room for drilling purposes. These regiments will be included under one camp guard, daily detailed from the whole, and it is required that particular attention be paid to guard duties and instructions to sentinels. Every means will be employed to keep the horses of each regiment well shod. Proper and active vigilance will ever be maintained, and the necessary means adopted to prevent an enemy siirprising his camp or destroying property of neighboring citizens. Should deserted farms be found in the vicinity of his encampment, he will take charge of them for the use of his command.

General : I am instructed by Major-General Price to direct you to move your command forward as rapidly as possible, night and day, until you reach these headquarters. To do this the more expeditiously, he instructs you to leave your heavy baggage under a small but sufficient escort, to be brought forward more slowly.
You will communicate this order to all other commanding officers of the State Guard near you, so that they may obey it; but you will not permit this to delay the movement of your division in* the least.

Yours, most respectfully,

Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk,
Commanding Department No. 2, &c. :
General : Your dispatches of the 14th instant came to hand within the last two hours.*
The order from the War Department to which you refer, placing the military operations in Arkansas and Missouri under your control, has not been received. I shall not, however, on that account raise any objection to your authority, but will comply cheerfully with your orders to move my command to the Mississippi Biver.
I have already given Colonel Cleburne orders to move with his regiment as soon as practicable and repair the Point Pleasant plank road. I agree with you that this route, if practicable, which I shall soon ascertain, is the shortest and easiest by which I can place my command in supporting distance of your force.
I am much embarrassed by the number of sick. The morning report shows 900 sick in a command of 4,529 present. This number does not include that part of my command at Pocahontas, numbering about 1,100 men. I take for granted you do not intend that I shall take my entire force from this place, but that I shall leave a force sufficient to protect my hospital and supplies.
As soon as the plank road is repaired, I shall transport my command to Point Pleasant with the least practicable delay. I will write again in time to have supplies sent to meet my command at that point.
With high respect, your obedient servant,
W. J. HABDEE, Brigadier- General.
As your messenger was so long in coming to me, I shall send this by Pocahontas and Memphis, with the hope that it will reach you within three days.

here, and one regiment of infantry, not yet organized, for the protection of the hospital supplies and the inhabitants in this part of the State. Col. Wirt Adams, of Mississippi, wrote me that he had orders to join my command, and as I shall be deficient in cavalry, I wish you would telegraph him to bring forward his regiment without delay and re-enforce me. One of my regiments of infantry has just been organized, the others are improving in their drill, and are able even now to get from one position to another with tolerable facility.

Maj. Gen. A. S. Johnston,
Commanding Department No. 2, &c.:
General : I received information to-day through the papers that you had been assigned to the command of Department No. 2, which I may be permitted to say, without disrespect to your predecessor, gave me great pleasure. I deem it proper to inform you at once, and without waiting for your order assuming command, that I received last night an order from Major-General Polk, directing me to move my command to the Mississippi River. A copy of my reply is herewith inclosed.* The route indicated to me by Major-General Polk is by the way of the Point Pleasant plank road, which is the shortest route for me to take in order to join your command in Kentucky by many miles, but at present this route is impracticable for cannon. I shall start Colonel Cleburne with his regiment in the morning to put the road in thorough repair. In the mean time I shall get my wagons repaired, my mules shod, and everything in readiness for a forward movement. After leaving a sufficient force here and at Pocahontas to guard our hospitals and supplies, I hope to be able to join you with 4,000 effective men.
With high respect, your obedient servant,

* Captain : It becomes my duty to report to you that the progress of our work has been so retarded by circumstances over which I have no control, that in my judgment any further drawback may cause us to lose, should certain contingencies happen, one of the finest strategic positions for the defense of the Mississippi Yalley, The multiplicity of matters surrounding you at Columbus has caused this point, I am afraid, to become of much less consideration than it really deserves.
I am now fully convinced that Island No. 10, with its connections properly fortified, would offer the greatest resistance to a combined water and land attack of the enemy, while at the same moment he

would receive an irreparable injury. A concentrated cross-fire from the three batteries I proposed would be irresistible by the boats of the enemy, and our intrenchments from the river to the lake could not be taken by a force five times superior in numbers. We cannot be outflanked, owing to the proximity of the bayou dud lake to the river, and it would be equally impossible to invest us. The general character of the ground is the most inviting to an attack and certain defeat of the enemy.	;
To an ordinary observer the absence of any impressively strong features in the topography might create an unfavorable opinion as to its strength, but I am satisfied that a close study of the ground by a military man would develop elements of power that to another might seem objects of weakness.
The work I am now constructing is the advanced position on the left bank of the river, 1^ miles above the head of Island No. 10. It was necessary to occupy this site during the season of low water and until the highest spring rise, to prevent the enemy landing and flanking the island battery as well as the mainland battery. It is also our strongest point of defense should the descent of the river be attempted by the enemy in the next eight or nine months and a heavy force be landed for a flank movement. The distance from this point (the redan) to the bayou, which has 5 feet permanent wafer in it and increasing in depth, to the lake, 2 miles farther, is only 1,100 yards. The bayou, with comparatively little labor, can be rendered impassable to an enemy. Upon the highest rise of the river next spring or summer nature will then accomplish for us what we are artificially endeavoring to do, that of forming a barrier over which the enemy cannot pass; for the Mississippi and the lake will then be united, and if a landing is attempted, it must be within short range of our other two batteries.
“Beelsfoot Lake,” as it is called, is some 40 miles long, lying nearly north and south, and making a junction with.the Mississippi at high water above us, and below us also by way of the Obion Branch, renders our position just here, with comparatively little trouble, evidently a very formidable one. The lake is in many places very deep, and the dead cypress timber scattered about it makes it difficult to navigate. Even if boats could be had and a crossing effected by an enemy, a small body of our troops could prevent a landing. It is 11 miles wide in places, and filled with very fine fish and wild game.
We have now only four 32-pounders at this post; we had six pieces in position, but you are aware that the two 24-pounder siege guns were taken to Columbus. Ten heavy pieces could be placed in position at once in the redan if we had them. The redan covers the channel of the river 500 to 1,000 yards off. It is our left flank of the line of intrenchments connecting the river Mississippi and Beelsfoot Lake, and two or three of the barbette guns can be made to rake the entire front of our line to the bayou. Our parapet in the redan is much weakened by embrasures, made necessary by the 32-pounders being mounted upon naval carriages or trucks. I would recommend mounting these guns upon siege carriages similar to the 24-pounders. The weight of the guns is about the same.
Our intrenchments are not completed at this point, and unless we have the assistance I have asked for, and which I supposed could be easily sui>plied from Memphis and Fort Pillow, I fear this all-important work will not be accomplished in time to be of use.
In a very short time now it will be necessary to gather in the crops, and our farmers in the Bend must need their hands. We have not had

over 80 negroes at work, and no similar force and facilities at my command could have done more than they have done; so you will readily perceive the impossibility of finishing the fortifications at an early date unless I could have for 10 or 15 days some 500 h^nds from Fort Pillow, where I learn some 2,000 are at work. I have no boat either, which is essential to a rapid construction of the batteries at Island No. 10. The Mohawk, placed under my orders for topographical service, has been taken ofi* some time ago for otter duty by orders from your department.
Since I have seen Columbus, I have not lessened my opinion, previously given to the commanding general, of its strong natural facilities for defense; but further examinations have strengthened my belief of the great importance of Island No. 10 in connection with a line of defense including New Madrid and Union City, as a powerful base of operations against the enemy.
I have been put to serious inconvenience by an order causing suddenly my assistant, Mr. Bowley, and my clerk, Mr. Miller, who had charge of my commissary stores and papers, to be taken away from this post. The general commanding must have been misled by a misapprehension of facts in some way. Mr. Miller was a civilian, appointed by me as clerk and to attend to my commissary matters, and he was in no way an army officer. I had attentively taught Mr. Bowley and Mr. Miller to assist me in systematically conducting the important duties confided to me, and their sudden withdrawal, without an hour7s notice, has not only inconvenienced me, but been really detrimental to the service. Lieutenant Snowdon is sick, and cannot be exposed to the labors of an assistant probably for some time. He is to-day wholly disabled by fever. I feel sure that had the general known of the circumstances I have related, he would not have ordered them away at so necessary a period in the progress of this work, unless on some imperative occasion.
I will send you, captain, in a day or two, a sketch of this section of country, exhibiting the situation of our works, if I can possibly secure time from my other labors. In the mean time, if you can lay before the commanding general the necessity, in my opinion, of more speedy movement in the works here, I shall be better satisfied that we shall be altogether upon a much safer basis to meet the enemy under any circumstances that may arise. If he will give me an order for 500 negroes from Fort Pillow and send me a small steamer and authority to get the guns from Memphis, I will soon be enabled to say we are prepared.
I remain, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

by which I can reach the Mississippi, and place myself in supporting distance of your force. I have great fears, however, that there is a greater difficulty to overcome than the plank road, and that is the Cache bottom on the other side of the Big Black River. This part of the road is represented to me as impassable for cannon or wagons. I have sent a party, who started the day after your first dispatch was received, to examine the entire route. I shall start Lieutenant Shaaff to-morrow to examine more especially the Cache bottom. I am particularly anxious to join you, and shall do so with all possible haste. I don’t wish to be caught in a bad bottom during the equinox. I judge the route through Bloomfield to Point Pleasant the most practicable, but the farthest.
I have no wish, even if I had time and boats, to transport my command by water. I prefer it should go by land, and if no better route offers I can certainly go by Pocahontas and Gainesville. I hope you will not attempt any forward movement until my arrival.
My wagons are very indifferent, but I have wagons and teams sufficient to take me in either direction.
I am busy getting everything in readiness to move, which I shall commence as soon as the route is open. You may rest assured that I shall lose no timo in joining you.

General A. S. Johnston :
Sir: Some weeks since Col. Wm. M. Cooke and myself were sent by Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, who commands the Missouri Army, to communicate with the Confederate Government at Richmond, and particularly with the President, in relation to our movements, strength, and prospects in Missouri, and to solicit more aid in arms, ammunition, and forces for £b full operation against the enemy, &c. We have been to Richmond, and communicated with the President and authorities.
The President assured us that you had plenary powers, and that you would respond to any request to give us strength and efficiency. Permit me to say that your appointment is hailed with unusual approbation by our entire army. The President in a letter, and since by telegraph, informs us that two batteries were ordered to Missouri under our charge, to be sent from this place. In addition to this, we obtained from the State of Virginia, upon the requisition of the Confederate Government, 2 rifle 6-pounder guns, 1 box of flints, 500 flint-lock muskets in 25 boxes, 2 6-pounder carriages, and about half enough harness for the guns.
Our army is in great extremity, and needs these guns and arms very much indeed. Colonel Cooke goes to see you with a full understanding of our wants and with full power to explain our condition and wants to you. You will please give him an early interview, and make such orders as may be necessary to enable us to reach our army in the shortest possible time with the guns and arms above specified. You may be assured that we are engaged heart and soul in the common cause, willing to shed our blood, and if necessary sacrifice our lives, to achieve our independence and to promote the interest of the Southern Confederacy, of which we hope in a few months at farthest to form a part. I am yet

laboring under the effects of a wound received at the battle of. Oak Hills, and I thought it best to remain here until Colonel Cooke’s return.
Colonel Cooke will also communicate to you the necessity of an order for transportation of medical stores from this6 place, which are much needed at our hospitals at Springfield for both Confederate and Missouri forces.
With my ardent wishes for your success in your new field of labor, and hoping to see you very soon in command in person in Missouri, I am, your obedient servant,

General : The last detachment of my command will start to-morrow for Point Pleasant, on the Mississippi River, which place, I hope, my entire command will reach in nine days from that date.
The road has been found in a desperately bad condition. Indeed Colonel Cleburne, who commands the advance, and who was sent forward with his regiment to repair the road, writes me that in wet weather the road will be found impassable. In addition to this regiment I have sent forward another party of 200 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Marmaduke.
I hope these timely precautions will enable me to work the command through even in bad weather.
When I last heard from Colonel Cleburne he had not reached the plank road; but a special courier who was sent over this road and returned yesterday says it will not be difficult to put it in traveling order. I regret our delay, but it has been unavoidable.
I shall need rations on the 1st proximo; the quantity will depend on our destination.

I desire to say that I have respectfully to request, if the interests of the service will not be compromised by it, that Lieutenant Carter be permitted to remain on duty in this department.
The gunboats the enemy have now in the Mississippi River are giving us most serious annoyance, and I find it indispensable, to check their movements and to protect our transports, to have an armed boat under my command. Without its aid our operations would be very seriously obstructed, if not to an extent paralyzed. As a necessity, therefore, I have purchased a strong river boat, which I have secured

General : From the papers General Johnston has reports of the defeat of Colonel Hunter in Missouri and your call for re-enforcement from the people of the State. Upon this he has telegraphed the governor of Arkansas to push forward to you the troops (10,000) heretofore called for from that State as rapidly as they can be armed. He has not yet heard from the governor in answer .to the call, and cannot advise you of the probable time at which you can count on this force or any part thereof.
In the mean time, he authorizes you to muster into service as many armed regiments of Arkansas or Missouri troops and as many armed companies from either State as may offer for twelve months or the warr reserving to the President the granting of all commissions for the field officers of all troops raised in Missouri. You will give acting appointments to field officers of the Missouri troops, to be effective until the pleasure of the President is made known; and to avoid future trouble inform those gentlemen so appointed by you that the power of appointment is the President’s alone.
The Arkansas regiments are to be mustered into service by you on their arrival, and their time of service will be reckoned on the rolls from the

Sir : You will take from your command 120 men and proceed into the neighborhood of Harrison’s Mills, and burn, cut down, or destroy the bridge on the Cairo and Fulton Bailroad at that point. You wiil also accept as many volunteers as may clfoose to go, and select such men as may be necessary for spies and guides from the commands of Colonel Brown and Captain Price. You will endeavor to find out the exact force that may be at the bridge alluded to, and also the bridge near Charleston; and if you can whip the force that may be at Harrison’s Bridge in an hour’s time, you will not hesitate to attack him. But, if the force be too strong or too well posted to whip in one hour, you had better decline a fight, as the force at Bird’s Point will be too near to waste too much time. Should you fail at Harrison’s and your men are not too much fatigued, you can approach the railroad at the most eastern point that is possible, and, after destroying the track, you can march westward, towards Charleston, and render as many points useless as possible. Much of the detail of an expedition of this kind must be left to the discretion and bravery of the officers in command, and you will therefore understand that my object in sending you is to render the Cairo and Fulton Bailroad useless to our enemies $ and, if you must fight to accomplish our object, you must not hesitate a moment, if there is the slightest possible hope of success.

Executive Office, „ Little Bock, September 30,1861. Hon. Secretary of War of the Confederate States:
Sir : In accordance with suggestions contained in a communication addressed to me by your predecessor, bearing date the 5th instant, I issued a proclamation calling for five regiments of men designed for General McCulloch’s command, and so informed the general, a copy of the letter addressed to him being inclosed to your Department.
On the 10th instant a proclamation was also issued by General McCulloch calling for 15,000 men from the States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas—a printed copy herewith transmitted*—the 5,000 from Louisiana to be rendezvoused at the capital of this government, whether organized or to be assembled here as a mass of individuals I have not been apprised. The authorities of Arkansas were neither consulted as to the propriety of making this call nor advised in any manner that such was the purpose of the general.
To all demands made upon me by the Confederate Government I have heretofore and shall continue to comply with as a constitutional duty, besides the personal gratification it affords of being able to min-4ster something to the great cause in which we are all engaged. To the gallantry and patriotism of General McCulloch none can accord higher admiration than myself; nevertheless, I esteem it to be my duty, as the executive of this State, irrespective of considerations personal to myself, to express my disapproval of the attitude assigned the authorities of this government and that assumed for Confederate officers in the proclamation alluded to. My idea of the rights relatively belonging to the States and to the Confederate Government is that those pertaining to the former were by no means abridged by the withdrawal from the old Confederacy and a union with the new Government, but that all theretofore claimed upon the most liberal construction were conceded, both upon policy and principle.
The history of the United States, I believe, furnishes no precedent for the raising of men by proclamation emanating from generals commanding nor from the President. If such had been law or precedent, the intervention of State authority would doubtless have been dispensed with by Mr. Lincolh in his demand for troops from Arkansas. Such, fortunately, was not the practice or the law; and with all deference I submit that no example by authority ought to mar the text sheet of Confederate history.
I am aware that, by an act of the Provisional Congress, approved 28th February last, the President is authorized to receive into the service of the Government such forces then in the service of the States as might be tendered, uor who may volunteer by consent of their State,” meaning its authorities; but I am unadvised if legislation has trenched so far upon State prerogative as to authorize the calling of troops by any but State authority, and shall, if such is the law, reluctantly yield my assent to so serious an innovation upon State rights.
But, apart from policy and law, the practice is attended with discordant effort, confusion, contrariety of opinion, unsatisfactory results, and great waste and improvidence in expending the resources of the country. For instance, if the men called for by General McCulloch are raised by him, those assembled by my proclamation, after great expense to the State and sacrifice to the citizen, will be useless, and have to be disbanded. Again, if General McCulloch may issue procla-

mation, so may one or a dozen other officers do likewise, destroying all harmony of action, and putting aside State authority entirely. Again, an economy of men henceforth will he as important as that Of money. Illy-advised calls, appealing strenuously to the people of particular sections, operate with severity upon particular localities. There are portions of this State which have sent but few men to the field 5 others, by applying constant stimulants, have already turned out an overdue proportion. Of these facts Confederate generals can know nothing, whilst the right and knowledge for discrimination rest exclusively with the authorities of the States, and cannot be so well lodged anywhere else.
On a former occasion, July —, General McCulloch issued a proclamation calling for the entire military force of the State, evidently with the most laudable purposes, which met with approval from the necessity of the case, not deeming it probable that an isolated act would ripen into settled practice. I thought it unnecessary to call attention to it at Richmond, unless supervenient facts determined that that call was assumed to have been made by an exercise of rightful authority, which now seems to be apparent. There are other persons and officers of the Confederate Government of lesser rank than General McCulloch who, claiming to act by direction of your Government, are issuing addresses and proclamations, calling for troops from Arkansas, all which perplex and distract the minds and loyal purposes of the people, and are highly detrimental to the public service and offensive to the rights and dignity of this Government. In view of all which, I beg leave most sincerely and respectfully to request that henceforward all demands which it may be thought proper to make upon this State for troops for Confederate service may be addressed to the proper authorities thereof, and that the military officers placed upon our frontiers be advised of the propriety in future of addressing themselves to such authorities in the procurement of troops needed for the Confederate Army.

Dear Colonel : Since writing to you yesterday I have received orders to march immediately, and will leave this camp on to-morrow, to take my baggage to New Madrid, and, leaving all the tents and heavy baggage there, I will take my active and efficient force, and immediately march northward. I will endeavor, if I have transportation enough, to send you another lot of shoes, &c., immediately; but, if I cannot raise the wagons, I will have them for you when you join. I wish you to select from your command all who are able to stand a thirty days7 campaign and who are armed, and hold them ready to march with me. You can leave your tents, or rent houses for those who remain, and, by furnishing an abundance of hay and straw, you can probably have blankets enough for those who march with you. I propose to be at Sikeston by Wednesday at noon. I wish you to be ready to march by that time, and move up to Spring Hill. By that time I will have determined whether I will cross over and join you and march direct on Iron-ton, or whether we will (I on one side of the swamp and you on the other) move direct on Cape Girardeau. I will rely on you for 500 efficient men, and more, if you can have them. I propose a thirty days7 active campaign, and hope we will have effected enough in that time to retire on our laurels. Let me know at Sikeston, by special courier, the number and condition of your force, the quantity of ammunition you need, &c., so that I can send over to you all you need at Spring Hill. If we move separately, I will send you a battery of cannon. Write to me by every opportunity that is safe.
Yours, &c.,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.

have made good use of the time m perfecting my arrangements and arranging the establishment of a permanent post at this point, as a depot for my sick and recruits. My scouts report 4,000 of the enemy at Charleston. It seems that an engine was actually on the outer end of the railroad when my men destroyed the bridge, and the only delay the enemy now suffer is a march from Bird’s Point to the bridge. I do not believe there are 1,000 at Charleston, although they may be fortifying, as reported; but, at any rate, it' would be well to bag them; and, as they are evidently there to prevent me from marching out, and as I am already out and behind them, if you will send over a few regiments to cut off their retreat, I will undertake to drive them into your hands. I will, as soon as I hear the truth of the report, send you a courier, and will expect co-operation.
Tours, respectfully,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
New Madrid, Mo., October 3, 1861—7 a. m. Col. Aden Lowe, C. S. A., Spring Hill, Mo. :
Dear Sir : Your courier reached me last night, but I have delayed him until this morning. For want of transportation from Columbus to this place I will be delayed fully forty-eight hours in all my marches. The baggage wagons that should have been here night before last have not yet arrived, but will come to-day. You will therefore remain at Spring Hill until further orders, as you may have to come to Sikeston to my assistance if the enemy is at Charleston, as reported by the scouts this morning. If the report is false, I expect to cross to Spring Hill to you, and we will all move together. I have an abundance of ammunition for muskets and plenty of powder for you, and will send you a load to-day, and we will move together. It will not, however, reach you today, as the rains have made the swamps bad. I hope you have none with you but the able bodied and well-armed, as we have an active campaign before us, and a few well-conditioned men can do more than an army of sick. I will select a post commandant for Bloomfield and New Madrid, where heavy baggage, the sick, recruits, and convalescents will make a small army. If you have transportation enough for your active force you can carry four tents along, although I hope you will not have to pitch them. You can exercise your judgment about your prisoners. The deserters can be released if they will go along—that is, if they are well enough. Hard stories are told about the actions of some of your men on the trip to Jackson. I hope they are not true. I will try to get over to Bloomfield, to see how things are arranged, before we finally leave. Make, if possible, your monthly report.
Yours, &c.,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

opposite Columbus are filled with the enemy’s pickets, and that they are fortifying Charleston. I have written to General Johnston to send over, to drive them westward, when I will catch them, or, if he will hold the bag, I will drive.

New Madrid, Mo., October 3,1861.
Col. J. J. Smith,
Second Regiment Dragoons, Camp near Silceston, Mo.:
Dear Sir : 1 place no faith in the report that as many of the enemy are at Charleston as I hear. There may be some there, and if so we must drive them in. You must keep an active lookout in that direction, and, if possible, find out the number and location of the forces. I will try to have a movement made from Columbus to cut him off, and we will attack him from our side. They have no idea that we are outside of them in force, and their movement there is the one I anticipated, and was intended to cut us off. We are out of the cage in time, and will probably put them in it. The delay in our baggage has occasioned me much trouble, and the troops of the First Begiment have this moment arrived, while their wagons (empty) are coming down by land. This will delay our march forty-eight hours, and we must be as patient as possible. You will, therefore, if you are in a comfortable place, remain there, resting as many horses as you safely can, and await orders. You will hear from me repeatedly during the day.
Yours, &c.,
M. JEFF. THOMPSON, Brigadier-General^ Commanding.
P. S.—As soon as you hear the truth, send a courier, with all the facts,' to General Johnston.
Camp Brown, Mo., October 7, 1861—9 a. m.
Col. James A. Walker, Commanding at New Madrid, Mo.:
Sir : Nearly all the men you sent along have deserted, and those that . are here are very much dissatisfied. It seems, from their reports, that you are furloughing all the men left with you to garrison the post of New Madrid, and it is said you have even furnished them with State transportation to go home in. This is very demoralizing, and must be peremptorily stopped ; and if you have let any go home, it is in express opposition to my orders left with you. I will state here again, plainly, that no man, soldier or officer, shall be furloughed again for more than twenty-four hours, for the reason that it demoralizes the command, by producing dissatisfaction both in camp and at home. You must enforce the strictest military discipline around your post, as by this means only can you give satisfaction to any one. Catch all the deserters you can.
Yours, &c.,

Camp Polk, Island 10, October 9,1861. Col. L. G. De Russy, Chief Engineer, &c.:
Colonel: We are doing well on the end of the* island to-day, the boat getting down in time to take our men over and to co-operate with us.
An opportunity offers for me to send up a line, and I would wish to call your attention to the matter of the negroes I have at work. Lieutenant Moses’ 500, which he was to have here positively last week from his expedition into Dyer County, only numbered some 150, and we have now only 90, as the farmers in the Bend have been obliged to take theirs home for their crops. They have been at work some weeks.
Those we have at present belong in Gibson and Dyer Counties, and if you can get such an order issued as the memorandum inclosed, we can do much. It will be a great loss to have them go off on Saturday.
I wish you could dispatch us an order of the kind desired, if not in-compatibie with the public good.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. B. GRAY.
The commanding officer of Redan Fort, Camp Polk, if the exigencies of the service require it, is directed to retain the negroes for ten days longer, to complete the fortifications upon Island No. 10. If they can be spared without detriment to the public interest, they may be permitted to return to their homes.
Richmond, Va., October 10,1861.
The Hon. Secretary of War:
Sir : I deem it necessary, in order to a proper understanding of the facts in relation to the disorganization of the Arkansas State troops recently under my command, to make the subjoined statements:
The military board of the State of Arkansas issued an order on the 22d of July to me to transfer the troops under my command to General Hardee or his agents, and in doing this I was required to take the vote of each company on the question of willingness to transfer. If a majority of a company voted in favor of transferring them, the company was to retain its organization, and those voting against the transfer to be discharged, and the company to be filled by recruits; in fact, leaving the transfer entirely at the will of the soldier. This order was received two days after the battle of Oak Hills. General Hardee had no agent there, and after consulting with General McCulloch it was thought best that I should fall back with my command to Camp Walker, in Arkansas, report the facts to the military board, and await further instructions. I sent a messenger post haste to the board, informing them that General Hardee had sent no agent to receive the troops; that General McCulloch had declined doing so, not having any authority $ also urging on the board a different policy, as I feared the course they had taken would result in the disorganization of the forces. Two days after, Colonel Hindman overtook me on the march, and reported himself as General Hardee’s agent, and it was decided that we continue on to Arkansas, and there carry out the order of the board, hoping in the mean time that we would hear from the board, and that the troops might be retained.
The board declined making any changes, and ordered me to carry

[Chap. X.
out my former instructions. This was the death-blow to my command. I got Colonel Hindman to address the troops several times, and did myself all I could by orders and appeals to induce the men to enter the Confederate service ; but the course unfortunately adopted by the board placed affairs beyond my control. *1 should have mentioned before that all my troops were mustered into the State service, subject to be transferred to the Confederate service for’ the balance of their unexpired term of enlistment. The troops were all willing to be transferred, and not a dissent would have been made had the transfer been made by order, without referring it to the men. They were already virtually in the Confederate service. They had been in the Army from two to five months, and had never received any pay or clothing, and when the board said they could honorably leave the service, and left it to their choice, being naked and barefooted, the natural impulse to each individual was, “ I must go home.” They said to our appeals: “We are as good Southern men as any persons. We have fought the enemy and driven him away. We are needy and will go home, and when another call is made, we will have clothes and shoes, and will again do battle for the South”; and despite all persuasion and appeals, this unfortunate decision could not be overcome.
On the 2d of September the board issued an order to me to refrain. This order was received by me about the 10th, some forty days after the first order was issued. The troops had all disbanded long before.
These are the facts. I did all in my power to save The troops, but without success.
Respectfully,
Hr. B. PEARCE.
Hdqrs. First Division, Western Department,
Columbus, Ky., October 10, 1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I feel constrained to urge upon you the necessity of at once furnishing me an officer familiar with the subject of submarine batteries and capable of a practicable application of this species of defense to the Mississippi River.
I have had some correspondence with Lieut. M. F. Maury in relation . to this matter, and while it would be personally gratifying to me, I think the public good would be greatly promoted by his being ordered to report for duty to these headquarters.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Columbus, Ky., October 10,1861. Hon. S. R. Mallory, Secretary of the Navy:	,
Under the pressing emergencies of the service on this river I ordered the alteration and arming of a steamer that was built very staunch to serve as a gunboat. This boat, of which I have written you, is being altered and armed under the direction of Lieutenant Carter, who by your order has been allowed to remain with me and complete it. It

will be out next week and ready for its guns, and it is so necessary, that I have resolved to devote certain guns I obtained for land batteries to her use. These she will take on at Memphis, and will be ready in a few days thereafter for service. Two of the enemy’s gpnboats came down to this place two days ago and opened fire on the batteries I was putting into position, shelling and throwing round shot. Their fire was returned with vigor and with such success as to cripple them both. One of them, we are informed, sank about 10 miles above this, and the other was so much injured as to be obliged to be relieved of her armament. Had the boat Lieutenant Carter is now building been on hand, we should have been able to capture or destroy them both.
The expense of the construction of Lieutenant Carter’s boat, I am informed, is moderate, and the work remarkably well done.
It will be necessary to make provision for the payment of the expenditures incurred in the construction, and I write to say that I shall be obliged by your indicating the mode in which these expenditures are to be provided for.
I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : The bearer of this note, Colonel Greer, of Texas, is probably better known to you than myself, but I know him well, and can say of him that he is a gentleman and a soldier worthy of the highest confidence ) that he is familiar with every movement of the Missouri troops since their entrance upon the battle-field, and will give you a faithful history of the condition of affairs in the State. On the 26th ultimo I dispatched a messenger to you (Colonel Snead), clothed with power to conclude a treaty, offensive and defensive, between the Con-

federate States and Missouri, and trust ere this reaches you that the treaty has been made, and that you will feel at liberty to make an appointment at once of a general to command all the forces operating in Missouri. In this connection you will pardon me for suggesting the name of General Sterling Price as the man fit for the place, and under whose lead the troops of Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas will rally as one man. But in this matter I defer to your better judgment, and will be most happy to rally my men under any man you may see fit to appoint.
In a few days I have every reason to hope the legislature will be in session, and as soon as this takes place an ordinance of secession will be passed by an almost unanimous vote, and will be overwhelmingly ratified by the people whenever they can vote upon it.
I have the honor to be, &c.,
C. F. JACKSON.
Bichmond, October 13,1861.
D. W. Davis, Secretary Military Board, Little Bode, Ark.:
Will arm the regiments ordered out from Arkansas as rapidly as possible. The arms now in arsenal are subject to the order of General McCulloch, and he is authorized to put them in hands of such troops as he thinks best. Let the men be mustered into our service, and we will equip and supply them in camp, and furnish arms at the earliest possible moment.
J. P. BENJAMIN,
Acting Secretary of War.
Fort Smith, October 14,1861 (via Little Bock, 19th). Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Secretary of War :
I have this day shipped to Memphis 32,000 pounds of lead sent from the Granby mines, in Missouri. Will continue to forward lead, and I believe can furnish all that is wanted for the Confederate Army.
G. W. CLABK.
Camp Jackson, Ark., October 14,1861. Hon. Secretary of War:
Sir : I am just in receipt of a letter from Governor Jackson, in which he informs me that his force has fallen back from Lexington to the Osage Biver, and that they are in great want of musket caps. I have at this time only 75,000, but will share them with him as far as would be safe for this command. He writes from Carthage, 60 miles north of this, and is on his way south with his family. Colonel Greer, whom I send as bearer of dispatches, says the governor is exceedingly anxious to march back to the Missouri Biver, and there go into winter quarters.
This I think, under the circumstances, to say the least, would be imprudent.
As to my own command, it is badly organized, armed, and equipped, and poorly provided with clothing and blankets for this latitude? besides being only half supplied with caps. Other kinds of ammunition we have in abundance for a campaign, though it would be impossible with my present limited means of transportation to take a sufficient supply of ammunition for the artillery. Taking all things into consideration, I

## p. 719 (#733) ############################################

﻿Ohap. X.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-------CONFEDERATE.	719
shall advise the Missouri forces to go into winter quarters on Spring Eiver, the position now held by my mounted regiments. Then they would be in a country well supplied with grain, and mills to grind it, and could take the field in the spring in good condition, well supplied with everything that could be procured in the South during the winter. In the meantime the force under my command could be increased, so as to enable us to take the field with a respectable army when the winter breaks. At present the half of my command left me by sickness are so •enfeebled as not to be able to stand the cold weather with the light clothing they have.
The sooner the Missouri forces are reorganized and mustered into the Confederate service the better, as they are at present not bound by any tie, and will remain in the field no longer than they think fit, no matter what may result from their withdrawal.
I will march with my whole force to the aid of General Price, and in the event of General Fremont pursuing, will endeavor to form a junction with the former in time to give battle to the latter at such time and place as may be thought most advisable.
In conclusion, I beg leave to suggest the propriety of destroying Kansas as far north as possible. We can never have quiet or safety among the Indians so long as Kansas remains inhabited by its present population, and although I have up to this time declined to march an Indian force into Missouri, yet I will do so in the event of the approach of a large Federal force, or it may be possible that they will be used against Kansas this fall.
Hoping this course will meet the approbation of the Department, I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BEK MCCULLOCH, Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Little Rock, October 14,1861.
Hon. J. P. Benjamin:
I am raising five regiments of men for General McCulloch. They need camp equipage, including tents, which can be procured in Memphis. We have nothing to buy them with except Arkansas war bonds, which are only worth seventy cents in that market. Is it not better that the Confederate Government supply that article, thus preventing so great a sacrifice of our paper $ Again, it is impossible for us to arm these troops, and I have no intelligence from McCulloch as to the number of guns he can supply. The necessities of the service require an immediate answer.

About a week after the surrender of Lexington I learned that General Fremont was concentrating at Georgetown, near the terminus of the North Branch of the Pacific Railroad, a large force, and knowing that the enemy had also some 4,000 men at Kansas City, I deemed it prudent not to risk being hemmed in, but for a time to abandon the Missouri River and fall back south. This I have done by slow and easy marches, and am now within a couple of days’ march of General McCulloch’s advance position ) thus at any time enabled to form a junction with him should the movement of the enemy make it necessary.
My force now consists of from 10,000 to 12,000 men, variously armed, and tolerably well supplied with ammunition. I expect daily accessions to my force from the southwestern part of the State, which is and always has been true to the cause of the South.
General Fremont’s force at Georgetown and vicinity is variously estimated at from 15,000 to 24,000 men. His extensive preparations of land transportation evidently anticipated a move southward, and to-day I am informed that, having been joined by the troops from Kansas, General Fremont is moving south with a well-appointed army of some 24,000.
Should this report be confirmed, I will immediately form a junction with General McCulloch, when, aided by the nature of the country, so well adapted to defensive operations, I trust we will be able to drive the invader from our soil. I learn that most of the enemy’s force has been withdrawn from Saint Louis to strengthen General Fremont, which, if true, leaves that city almost defenseless, and may have an important bearing on your operations. It will afford me much pleasure to co-operate with you or receive suggestions in relation to future movements.* I am, general, with much respect, vour obedient servant,

Camp Polk, Island No. 10,
October 16,1861.
Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk,
Commanding General Department No. 2 :
General : The Mohawk goes back to Columbus to-day. We are working hard towards completing the fortifications at this point or at least putting them in such condition that any body of troops, if ordered here, can by their labor in a few days thereafter finish the works for a strong defense. The lines are laid off complete for the three batteries. One fort (the redan) is ready for its full complement of guns, nine or ten. It has four 32-pounders mounted.
The intrenchments connecting this fort are not complete to the bayou, but the troops, whenever it becomes necessary to occupy them, can finish them. Much timber had to be cleared off the ground on the island and immediately opposite. We have but 60 negroes now at work, the others having gone home. Those now here leave us on Saturday. We shall then be without laborers to put the works in the condition I have stated—that the troops could finish in a few days whenever ordered here.
I have learned from Mr. Griswold, who has been down on duty connected with our work, that they have actually more hands at Fort Pil-
* See Johnston to Price, October 31, post.

low than needed. He learns this from an officer stationed at Fort Pillow. They have about 2,300 now there and more coming in daily. If you could give me an order on the commanding officer at Fort Pillow for 500 hands to work at Island Ho. 10 for ten days, we can be ready for any number of troops and armament when it may be deemed expedient to occupy the forts.
I will now refer to another matter, general. The little boat, called the Gordon Grant, which Colonel He Russy said should be sent to us at Island Ho. 10, and which the quartermaster at Memphis stated was to be sent to us as soon as ready, is now at Fort Pillow. We have a boat sent us for our service at the island which is, I understand, costing $150per day; she is unnecessarily large and expensive.
The Grant, if placed under my charge, will not cost, under any circumstances, including fuel, over $16 per day. This boat will answer all our purposes in completing the fortifications here, and also enable me to finish the topographical reconnaissance of the Mississippi River from Memphis to the Tennessee line, and also to Columbus, showing a correct view of the river, with the situation of the defenses and their approaches.
I send you, general, a rough outline of the river from actual survey made by me. It simply will show what I suppose would be so essential to your department, that of having the correct situation of the important points. This map can now be very shortly completed, and in a few weeks (say two weeks) I wish to be able to report the completion of the forts of Island Ho. 10, and have a complete survey and map at your headquarters of all our work. I beg you will let me have Colonel Tilghinan’s map of Kentucky, to incorporate upon our general map, for a few days. General Cheatham, I learn, has also a copy.
How, general, if you can give me the order for some hands and the order for the Gordon Grant, I can promise you much that will be done; that great expense will be saved the Government, and that I can finish up the works at this point greatly to my own satisfaction as well as to the public benefit.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Missouri State Guard,
Camp at Neosho, October 23, 1861. Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch, Commanding Confederate Forces:
General: I had reliable information yesterday from scouts and travelers that General Fremont has not yet crossed the Osage. General Sigel has crossed it, and has been at Warsaw. There has been a party of several hundred Home Guards at Osceola and Bolivar, and they have as usual been engaged in a wholesale destruction of property. I place confidence in this information. I can see no reason to resist its truthfulness. I can further say that I am fully convinced that General Fremont does not intend to advance upon me here. When I receive my artillery from the South (which cannot fail to reach me, under the charge and escort of General John B. Clark, within ten days, or two weeks at furthest), it is my deliberate conviction, from a careful survey of the whole ground, that duty, as well as the best military calculation, rqguires me to return at once, and rapidly, to the Missouri River.
Allow me, general, to state some of these reasons. I think that Kansas’ power to depredate upon us and assist the enemy should be broken, but I would not now, in this section, destroy that which is absolutely necessary for the subsistence—I may almost say the existence—of the surrounding inhabitants. Let the policy be to commence these offensive demonstrations on the Missouri River. First, we should destroy the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad, thus crippling if not almost depriving the enemy of the ways and means of re-enforcing their allies, in that section too weak at that time to make a substantial resistance to us. Kansas’ power to injure us is located near the Missouri River. It is there that abolitionism reigns; it is there her wealth is held; it is there her fighting men are raised; in short, it is the center from which all her depredations upon Southern rights and Southern property radiate. Should we commence there, after first destroying the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad, they cannot re-enforce from the great points of their strength—I mean the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois—for all these forces must come that way, if they are designed at all to check or prevent the operations we will have in view; whereas if we commence on the southern border of Kansas these vast re-enforcements will be collected, with all the necessary machinery of war, on the Missouri River by the time we reach there, giving us much to fear, if they did not seriously jeopardize the full success of the whole movement. Pursuing the course suggested I think will certainly guarantee us the prize. Let us then move, as indicated, upon the Missouri River, where I shall have abundant supplies of every kind’ and any number of men and the hearty sympathy and co-operation of the people. Your march in that direction with your force would inspire confidence and arouse enthusiasm. What, then, can prevent your going to a section where the people would hail your coming with the greatest joy’ and where your name and fame and that of your gallant men would bring to our standard an army of full 50,000 men, in fact all the many thousands needed for the most energetic and offensive operations, and I believe the thorough establishment of Southern independence in the Mississippi Valley, if it were not more comprehensive in its results even than that. Let us, then, by all means move to the Missouri River.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General Johnston, Bowling Green, Ky.:
General : I have sent to McCulloch two Parrott guns and two smoothbore iron guns. They were asked for and forwarded through Broad-well, the Missouri agent. I have also sent two Parrott guns to Zollicoffer, to be added to a battery of one brass and threeiron 6-pounders which were in the Cumberland Gap in charge of ChurchilPs regiment. The order to send them was accompanied with an order to send caissons also and harness for the whole battery, and to send the w7hole by the hands of a special agent. I think it right to say, as some of these guns have been sent also to General Buckner, that we had one of them to burst yesterday while firing, wounding slightly 1 or 2 men and so fracturing the arm of another as to make it necessary to have it amputated. I believe they were exploded by the free use of rifle powder instead of cannon. The charges put up were in powder of that description. The tests were made * in Memphis and the guns seemed to stand well. I send you letters from Thompson$ he seems to have had some successes, but he is reported, since these letters left him, to have had a reverse, in which he lost 800 men as prisoners and several pieces of cannon. This last intelligence was given us by the flag of truce sent me yesterday in answer to one from me some days before, proposing an exchange of prisoners. Th.e flag was borne by Buford (N. B.), whom you recollect as my classmate at West Point from Kentucky. He is colonel of the Twenty-seventh Illinois Begiment. He was very cordial, and talked freely of the war in general. They released all they had left, having released others before receiving my proposal, and I returned him those in my camp. I do not credit the story in regard to Thompson, as I have been informed since hearing it he was advised of the approach of the Iprce which was said to have defeated him.
I am afraid you will have to change your place of rendezvous established at Benton. It proves too wet, and I have directed Col. C. H. Williams to make an examination of the country on the railroad farther south, say in the neighborhood of Jackson, for a better place. You shall know of his report. WTe are occasionally getting an accession of powder to our stores.

day, is to fall back on Pitman’s Perry, if lie thinks that the better line for the security of his command and of the interests of the campaign, and unite with the forces left there by General Hardee. If he cannot accomplish that from the point at which he is (Bloomfield), then he must pass out to the plank road, and if he is pursued’ and cannot make successful resistance, to cross the river and join his forces to those at Island No. 10 until we can get aid from below. That is the best disposition he can make of his force, should he be pursued by the enemy, as he may be. So long as we hold this point the enemy is powerless to do mischief by attempting to cross troops below this point without boats. I am hurrying the regiments from Arkansas now in and near Memphis to get them ready for the field, but the reparation of arms goes on slowly.
I will keep you advised of the progress of events.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hdqrs. First Division, Western Department,
Columbus, Ky.9 October 25,1861.
Col. Solon Borland:
Sir: A dispatch from General Thompson of 23d informs me that the enemy in force, as he is informed, to the number of 5,000, were following him in his retreat to Pitman’s Ferry from Greenville. I inferred from his letter that he did not intend faliing back on Pitman’s Ferry, but would pass across the swamp to Bloomfield, and then to the river by way of the plank road. He will no doubt have informed you of his and the enemy’s movements.
My object in this note is to say that I think you should remove the stores you have at your command down the river and beyond the reach of the enemy, as far as you have the means of doing so. The powder and other ammunition especially you will take care to have removed. My advice is that you send all not necessary for your wants and that of any command likely to operate with you there round by water to Memphis. The same with the other stores.
You have no doubt considered all the contingencies that might happen and have discussed them with General Hardee, and are prepared to make such dispositions as he may have advised and as you shall think expedient, but I have thought it best to send to you a courier stating such facts as I have mentioned above of the enemy and to advise as to the safety of the stores under your charge.
I have thought it best and safest to send two small steamers from Memphis up to you at Pitman’s Ferry for those stores, and have issued the order by telegraph to-day to start them immediately. I am informed they amount to half a million in value.
You will exercise your own judgment as to how many you think under all the circumstances it would be safe to retain in that part of the State; the rest send to Memphis. If you have boats in the river, take possession of them for the service of the Government for the purposes above stated.
1 do not know the amount of force you have at your disposal or can command, but take it for granted you have not enough to enable you to resist for any long time the amount of force General Thompson says was in motion.
I am mainly concerned for the stores that are with you, and have no

idea that the enemy in that force will think of pressing far into the State.
Not doubting you will act wisely in the whole matter, I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,
Major-General, Commanding.
Hdqrs. First Division, Western Department,
Columbus, Ky., October 25, 1861.
Brigadier-General Thompson,
Commanding Missouri State Troops:
Sir : I am in receipt of your letters of the 18th, 20th, 22d, and 23d.* The reports of your operations are highly interesting, and we have been pleased to know that you have so completely accomplished the main object of your expedition—that relating to the destruction of the bridges. I am glad to know that you can speak so satisfactorily of the behavior of your troops at Fredericktown, but regret to hear you should have sustained a loss of the valuable men whose names you mention. I note what you say of sending you regiments to support you from my command. I regret to say that the information we have of the position and purposes of the enemy in our immediate front makes it impossible for me to detach any portion of my force for service remote from my position. I have not the force to spare.
My opinion is that you should do one of two things, either fall back into Arkansas to Pitman’s Ferry, or fall back on to the plank road and come out at Point Pleasant. If you conclude to do the former, you can cross the river at the Ferry, and take all the boats at the western side, and make your stand on the opposite side, where you can make successful resistance.
If you conclude to take the latter course, which, considering you are at Bloomfield, I think the most probable, then you must make your way to the river by the plank road, and if you cannot maintain your position on the other side, you must cross over and take up your position on the bank at Island No. 10.
Your force can be usefully employed there until we can obtain reenforcements from the South and be prepared to move on Southeastern Missouri. I am making that position one of strength, and it is as important to Missouri as to any other State. I shall have a boat always at Island No. 10, where you might be crossed over, or, if you think to go below, wherever you want her. I hope you will keep me well advised of your movements. I send by one of your messengers a dispatch to Colonel Borland, to advise him of the course and purposes of the enemy. You will have no doubt given him warning yourself, but I have certain suggestions to make to him which I hope will be in time. Respectfully, your obedient servant,
L. POLK,

join McCulloch at or near Arkansas line. Nothing has been communicated by General McCulloch to the authorities upon this subject, but no doubt is entertained of the correctness of the above statement.

Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch,
Commanding Confederate Forces:
General : I have just received from General Fremont a proposition for a general exchange of prisoners. This clearly indicates a change of policy on the part of the Federal Government', and is a virtual recognition of our rights as belligerents. From the members of the deputation and my scouts I learn that Fremont with the advance of his army is waiting at Warsaw the arrival of the remainder of his forces, which were delayed for the want of the necessary means of transportation. His exact force I am unable to ascertain, but that it is large I entertain no doubt. He moves with much caution, but his intention is undoubtedly to follow us down here. Since my last interview with you I have received the re-enforcements I expected from Lebanon, which increase my force several thousands; and in three or four days I expect General Clark with the two new batteries, which will be a valuable addition to my artillery. I would, general, respectfully suggest that you concentrate all the force you can, and with the co-operation I hope you will afford me I feel confident that, aided by the defensive nature of the country, we will meet with success.
I send this by Colonel Wood, one of my staff, who will give you all the information you require. I also send you a late Saint Louis paper, by which you will see that the Federal authorities place great reliance

Camp Walls, Mo., October 26, 1861—7 p. m. Col. Solon Borland, C. S. A., Pitman's Ferry, Mo.:
Dear Sir : We have been at this point since yesterday morning, watching the enemy’s motions, and I am satisfied that they have withdrawn their forces to Ironton and Cape Girardeau, to await the results of the contest between Fremont and Price. I will place my men as follows, to await the events: White’s battalion of dragoons at Saint Francisville, to picket the roads on the Saint Francis; Smith’s regiment of dragoons at Castorville, and Lewis’ regiment of dragoons at Spring Hill (or Piketon, as it is marked on the map). Although these dragoons amount in the aggregate to but 800 men present and fit for duty, yet they will make a complete cordon from the Saint Francis to the White-water. Tfye bulk of the infantry will be posted midway between Saint Francisville and Bloomfield, and in a few days, as soon as my horses are shod, I will advance to the line between Ironton and Cape Girardeau again, to keep their forces marching on that line. Should any march be made from Ironton southward, I expect to be apprised of it; and I will either intercept or cut off the baggage from any such force as the enemy can bring into the field until after the conflict in the southwest. I regret exceedingly that I did not have your two regiments at Greenville, as I could have easily drawn the enemy away from their baggage and whipped them in detail among the hills. My men are in splendid spirits, and I hope to open another short campaign in. a few days. I suppose you are aware that I have had in the field but 2,000 men, and at the fight at Fredericktown I had but 1,500 present. The enemy had 6,000 at Fredericktown, and I killed five to one. I go to New Madrid in the morning, and may probably go to Memphis before I return. I hope you will write often, as I can well move to act in conjunction with either yourself or General Pillow in forty-eight hours.
Yours, respectfully,

General : I received with great satisfaction your letter of the 16th instant.
In replying I embrace the opportunity of congratulating you upon your brilliant success at Lexington, and also of expressing my admiration of the very skillful manner in which you have conducted your operations since.
Although persons professing to know much of affairs in Missouri predicted disaster to your army from Fremont, yet I could not be induced to share such an apprehension.
The course you have adopted is precisely what I expected you would. By it you may draw the enemy so far that he will be compelled to divide his force, in which event you may be able to seize any favorable opportunity of attacking him in detail.
For your offer of co-operation I am sincerely thankful, although at this moment I know of :\o way in which I can avail myself of it. If, however, in the course of the war I shall find an opportunity of doing so, let me assure you in advance that there is no one upon whose courage, energy, and skill I will more confidently rely.
Of my own plan of operations I can of course say nothing in a letter, for fear it may fall into improper hands.
Herewith I forward you a copy of letter to my quartermaster, giving him instructions to furnish you with artillery, &c., at the request of General Clark and Colonel Cooke. I hope you have received them.

That there are 60 regiments in and around Springfield; that they have 120 pieces of artillery, many of them rifled; that they are pressing transportation and grain, and preparing for an immediate forward movement; that Fremont has probably been recalled within the last two days, and that General Hunter has assumed command of the forces; that the regiments are quite large, and Major Ross, the officer commanding the advance, thinks that there are 48,000 or 50,000 men,* and others arriving.
I have ordered Colonel McIntosh to send his train to the rear and make a scout forward, and then fall back to his trains. If you have any arms that are not in use I would be glad to have them, as I have several companies mustered in and yet unarmed.

HENRY LITTLE,
Adjutant- General.
Headquarters Missouri State Guard,
Camp on Indian Greek, McDonald Go., Mo., November 7, 1861 General A. S. Johnston, Commanding Confederate Forces:
General : It is with pleasure I avail myself of another opportunity presented to communicate with you in relation to military movements in this State. In my last letter I informed you that I was slowly falling back towards the Arkansas line before a large force of the enemy, under command of Major-General Fremont. Since that time Fremont has reached Springfield and halted, apparently for the purpose of resting his army after a fatiguing march, and also to await the arrival of the remainder of his forces. From the best information I can obtain the Federal force amounts to from 35,000 to 40,000 men, with more than 100 pieces of artillery. The withdrawal of this large force from Saint Louis and the Missouri River leaves the former point almost defenseless. To an officer, general, of your age, large experience, and well-known military sagacity, the bare suggestion of this fact reveals its great importance to an army with the relations and occupying the position ours does. Is it not the day and the hour to hasten a movement on Saint Louis, the possession of which is of such vast importance to the South ? The distance between Rolla and Spring-field, the terminus of the South Branch of the Pacific Railroad, is 127 miles, and should you inform me that you will advance on Saint Louis,

## p. 732 (#746) ############################################

﻿732	OPERATIONS IN MO., ARK., KANS., AND IND. T. [Chap. X. .
I will, m conjunction with General McCulloch, at once march on Spring’ field. Our combined forces amount to about 25,000 men. Your move-ment threatening Saint Louis will of course compel the Federal commander to hasten to that point. Should his force be too large for us to risk a general engagement, we can with our mounted men follow him, harassing him, and impeding his movement by firing the prairies and attacking him from every skirt of timber and every hill until you reach Saint Louis, when, having him between us, his capture will be certain.
I am now falling back on Pineville, where General McCulloch and myself have concluded to make a stand. Should the Federal forces advance from Springfield for the purpose of attacking us, we will act on the defensive, depending on the rugged nature of the country to compensate for any inequality in numbers. Our position will be so chosen that we will be able to make our artillery effective, while the enemy, embarrassed by the broken ground and the timber, will be unable to use this important arm with effect. Then, should we succeed in repulsing them, the nature of the country is such that a successful retreat would be next to impossible.
A report has reached here that General Fremont has been superseded by General Hunter, and I place every reliance in it. Our legislature has been in session for the last two weeks, and has passed an ordinance of secession, besides electing delegates to the Confederate Congress.
Sincerely hoping the suggestions of this letter may meet with your approval and secure your co-operation,
I am, general, with the highest respect, your obedient servant,
STEELING PEICE, Major-General, Commanding Mo. $. G.
Camp on Indian Creek, McDonald County, Mo.,
November 7,1861.
His Excellency Henry M. Eector, Governor of Arkansas :
Sir : I have the honor of calling your attention to the late military movement in the southwestern part of this State. You are doubtless aware that the Federal army is in Springfield. Their numbers are estimated at from 35,000 to 40,000 men. Before so large an army I was compelled to act prudently, and therefore fell back with my forces, in order to form a junction with General McCulloch. That junction has been made. But even now our combined forces cannot cope with them in numbers. Men, men are now what we want, and I would most respectfully suggest that you call upon the patriotic citizens of your State to rally, and at once, to the defense of their frontier.
Should your relations with the Confederate Government prevent you from receiving men into the State or Confederate service for a less period than twelve months, I have the authority of the governor of the State of Missouri for saying that they will be received into the service of this State for any period you may designate or the people themselves may desire. I need not, governor, enter upon any argument with you to convince you of the absolute necessity of hearty co-operation with xis at this time. The moment is very precious; no time is to be lost, and the stake is a large one. Success with us now over the large and well-appointed army of the Federals will be to us incalculable for good. Defeat may throw us back months, at immense loss. Arkansas7 necessity for defense assuredly speaks to you itself.
In averting any disaster to our cause, whether, immediately affecting

the people of Arkansas alone or whether affecting only the interests of this State, still Missourians desire to reciprocate the generous aid advanced them during the past summer, and I trust our joint efforts will enable us to drive back every invader of our soil anti rights. Any troops coming as above indicated to join us will bring with them such arms as they have. I will be able to furnish some, and these arms furnished us by the people can always be turned to use.
I am, governor, with the highest respect, your obedient servant,

General : Judge Milligan has just come into my camp, and confirms the report I sent by Major Milburn of the advance of a column from Paducah in the direction of Columbus, or rather southeasterly from Paducah.
If deemed proper by you to order me to Columbus, I will cheerfully receive such order.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
C. WICKLIFFE, Colonel, Commanding Regiment.
Headquarters,
Camp Harbin, Mo., November 8,1861. Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Acting Secretary of War :
Sir : My forces are at present near the main road from Springfield to Fort Smith, the infantry and artillery in Arkansas, and three regiments of mounted men in this State. General Price has fallen back to Pineville, some 25 miles west of this, where he will await the movements of the enemy, being able from that position to co-operate with me should the enemy advance.
My scouts have been near and around Springfield for the last eight or ten days, and report the arrival of troops continually. They estimate their present strength at near 50,000, and 120 pieces of artillery. It may not be so great, but is evidently large. They speak confidently of marching into the Southern Confederacy. I have but a small force to oppose them, but hope, by resorting to the partisan mode of warfare, to make them withdraw ere they reach Fort Smith.
The Missouri force is getting weaker daily by men leaving for their homes. The time for which many of them enlisted will expire in a few days. Nothing but a battle within the next ten days will keep together over 4,000 or 5,000 out of the 13,000 they now have. This battle cannot be fought without the enemy should advance. For us to attack them in their present position would be to lose a battle. Our troops, being mostly mounted men, are unfit to attack a strong position or to be of great use in a general engagement with heavy forces.
The Missouri Army is composed of some 5,000 infantry and artillery, 8,000 horsemen, with all sorts of arms, and without discipline. This force, if possible, should be taken into the Confederate service and reorganized this winter. It is now under the control of politicians, who know not the value of discipline, and consequently can never maxe an

army that would be but little better than a city mob. There is excellent material out of which to make an army in Missouri. They only want a military man for a general. One should be sent that does not belong to the State, or that has not been mixed up with their quarrels and campaigns heretofore. I suggested the name of General Bragg to the governor, who seemed pleased with the idea, in the event of Missouri becoming a member of the Confederacy. General Bragg could reorganize their army, make it efficient, and at the same time would rank me, thereby making one head to both armies. As for myself, it would never do to place me in command of them. I have made myself very unpopular by speaking to them frequently about the necessity of order and discipline in their organizations. There is unfortunately but little cordiality of feeling between the two armies; hence it would not answer a good purpose to place any man now in either army in command of both. I speak plainly on this subject, so that you may fully understand the condition of things out here.
The moment I know the enemy intends seriously to advance for the purpose of invasion, I will send express to General A. S. Johnston.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
BEK McCGLLOCH.

H. A. MONTGOMERY.
Headquarters Missouri State Guard,
Camp near Pineville, Mo., November 10,1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis,
President of the Confederate States:
Sir : Surrounded by circumstances of a critical and trying character, and profoundly impressed that now is indeed a crisis in the fate of my State and the cause of our emancipation from the oppressions of an unbearable and cruel despotism, I have determined to claim a moment of your overemployed time, to the intent that you may comprehend with some degree of accuracy the actual state of things in Missouri. You will excuse, I am sure, the greatest plainness and brevity compatible with an intelligible expression of my ideas.
Missouri has been embarrassed in this struggle by almost every condition that could militate against her public weal, except only the unconquerable determination of her people to be free. To a certain extent divided in opinion; deluded and misled by a venal and treacherous public press as to the possibility of compromise and reconstruction; betrayed by a majority of the State Convention; imposed upon and deceived in every instance by the agents and officers of the Federal Government ; without any military organization and but few military men;

without arms and without an army 5 overrun by Federal armies before a blow on our part could be stricken; pursued as fugitives from the State capital at the moment when the governor called our people to arms; fleeing with a handful of men to the extreme southwestern corner of the State before three columns of well-appointed Federal soldiers; having to fight for the arms we have and to capture nearly all the appliances of war with which we are now supplied ; with a powerful foe extending his lines across the State, so as effectually to cut off our succor and recruits from the north side of the Missouri River, our metropolis all the while in the hands of the enemy, thus giving him control of the railroads and rivers as well as the banks and channels of commerce and centers of intelligence, the war being waged as well upon the people of the country and private property as upon the army, we have had to oppose our little force to the haughty oppressor, hoping almost against hope. Under all these discouraging circumstances we have won five successful engagements, and now have an army of Missouri forces of 12,000 men, all armed, and as brave a set of men as ever went to battle. These men have continued through evil and through good report ; through suffering and destitution; half fed, half clothed, half supplied with the necessary means of subsistence and comfort to sustain with their labors and their lives the cause of Missouri and the cause of the Confederate States. These men have been caught up from the woods and the fields—from highways and by ways, by night and by day—without an hour’s or a day’s preparation, and have continued many months in the field.
I beg to assure you without misgivings, without hazarding anything, speaking what I know to be true, that out of the entire male population of the State twenty to one are from principle and from unalterable conviction, for weal or woe, with life, fortune, and honor, with the South and for the South forever. Nevermore, I beg and beseech you, let a doubt of the soundness of Missouri arise to disturb your faith or embarrass the action of the Confederate States.
After the capture of Lexington I found it necessary to fall back to this point, partly to procure ammunition and supplies and partly to avail myself of the support of the Confederate forces under General McCulloch. This movement has drawn the Federal force from Saint Louis, Jefferson City, Booneville, and other points, and we have now within two days’ march nearly 40,000 men. This leaves Saint Louis exposed to capture, which might now be taken almost without a battle. Of this I have more than once advised General Johnston. If this line of policy should be adopted, it would place the Federal force between two Confederate armies, in which case their capture would be only a question of time. Apart from this suggestion, I beg from the Confederate Government a force sufficient to enable us to cut our way to the Missouri River. If this be practicable, if this be granted, I will pledge Missouri, after sixty days on the Missouri River, to defend the northern and western lines of her territory. More than 20,000 men can be made available to our defense. I was compelled to leave from 5,000 to 10,000 recruits on and near the river, who were moving to join me, for want of time. Missouri can in general terms take care of herself, once the Confederate Government renders us such assistance as to make our force available. We can have under the authority of our Government 50,000 or 100,000 men as soon as we can be placed in such position as to make our strength available. Allow me, therefore, as one who, at the age of fifty-one years, has placed home and comfort and property and family and life on the altar of my country’s safety and well-being, to

implore that such immediate and efficient steps be taken by your Government to supply what is required for Missouri to wprk oat, under the protection and blessing of almighty Providence, her own redemption. Missouri stretches her hands to her kindred blood of the South as an infant child turns its imploring eyes to a mother. Give us a chance to show our fidelity. I inclose some correspondence, which will inform yon officially of the relations between the Federal Army and that of Missouri. Our people at their own homes and firesides are suifering all the horrors of civil war. Shall they be driven to choose between domestic dissolution and submission to the dictates of a tyrant?

General : I have the honor to announce my arrival at this place. My march from Lexington, although looked upon in the light of a retreat, was made deliberately and with a due regard to the health and comfort of my troops. My present force consists of from 10,000 to 12,000 men, and yesterday I received an ample supply of percussion caps, so much needed, and the want of which was one of the principal causes, of my falling back from the Missouri River. I shall be compelled to remain in this neighborhood for several days to await the arrival of the clothing for my almost naked men, and other supplies stored at Bentonville. I shall immediately dispatch 100 wagons to bring them up, and I hope, general, that you will render my officers charged with this duty any assistance they may require. It is reported that General Fremont is making extensive preparations at Georgetown for a movement south, and since writing I received the herein inclosed dispatch.* I am disposed to credit the report, but will make no important move until I hear further, when I will immediately inform you. At Kansas City and Wyandotte, under the command of Generals Lane and Sturgis, there were said to be some 4,000 men, and FremonPs force is said to be (variously estimated) from 15,000 to 24,000 men. I would like much to have a personal interview, and will meet you at any point you may designate.

bers at over 40,000 men and 120 pieces of artillery. In my opinion it will not be prudent to risk a battle with our present force, and that we had better fall back to the Boston Mountain, in the direction of Fort Smith; you on the line road by the way of Camp Walker, and I by the Fayetteville road. The roads being so crowded with travelers will compel me to move my artillery and infantry in a day or two. I shall commence to-morrow to obstruct the roads in every manner possible so as to delay them, and give Arkansas as much time as can be gained by this means and a judicious use of my mounted force, to come to our aid. If the enemy advance into Arkansas, I shall destroy all the mills and grain that I have to leave in my rear, having already do.ue so on the roads towards Springfield, and hope you will pursue the same course. I find upon examination that my position on this road can be turned to the east, and knowing yours can be to the west, my opinion is that we had better draw the enemy farther from his resources and nigher to where we can hope for re-enforcements.
Hoping my views may meet with your approbation, and that we may be able to check the enemy and soon to regain all that we are now compelled to abandon, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Headquarters Missouri State Guard,
Gamp near Pineville, November 10,1861; Brig. Gen. Ben. McCulloch, Commanding Confederate Forces :
General : Yours of this date (the 10th) has just been received. With the most earnest desire on my part to co-operate with you and the Confederate forces under your command to subserve the great cause in which we have a common interest, I am constrained to differ from the line of action indicated in your letter. We have already fallen back to the extreme boundary of the State, for the sake of getting such a position and such assistance as would enable us to meet and vanquish the oppressor. Combining our forces and choosing our ground for the conflict, I have an abiding confidence that we can meet the enemy and end the strife with one glorious and decisive victory. The south part of our State is exhausted with the presence and subsistence of friendly and hostile armaments. At every hazard I think we should give battle, and if compelled to fall back still farther, let us have a reason with which to satisfy our country that it was a necessity. Above all alloV me to suggest that burning the mills and laying waste the country is an infliction as grievous as any that could be inflicted by the enemy, and our people could have little choice between being shot and starved to death, involving men, women, and children. If, as our gallant ally, upon more mature reflection you should determine to aid me with your brave troops, we will adopt such line of action as will compel the enemy to attack us in a short time. We can in that event, with the success I confidently anticipate, have all the troops in Missouri required for our defense.
May I beg the pleasure of a conference with you on the premises f Our men are all having their homes exposed to the desolating hand of the destroyer, and it will require something more than ordinary courage and self-sacrifice on their part to carry them willingly out of the State under these circumstances. All they have to fight for is at stake, and they would prefer the risk of death on the battle-field to abandon.

On Bentonville Road, November 11,1861.
Maj. Gen. Sterling Price,
Commanding Missouri State Guard, Pineville, Mo.:
General : Yours of yesterday is before me. I am to-day obstructing the road, and will cripple the enemy badly should he attack my position. This I proposed doing before falling back; yet I am still of the opinion that it would have been better for us to have drawn the enemy to a point where defeat would have been total ruin and destruction to his whole force. If we drive him back, in the event of an attack, he will withdraw to Springfield without the loss of a single piece of artillery, and in such condition as not to allow us to follow him. Such success (as far as Missouri is concerned) would be but little better than defeat.
As for starving people by destroying the mills and grain that would be used by the enemy, I have to say, as far as your State is concerned, that I deplore much, very much, the necessity for pursuing such a course, but can think there is little danger of any one starving in a country where full crops have been made and only have the population left to consume it. As for Arkansas, every man who is a patriot and sound Southern man will be the first to put the torch to his own grain or mill rather than have them left to aid the enemy. If he is not a true Southern man, it will only be treating him right to destroy that which he would rather let the enemy have than ourselves.
I am exceedingly busy in preparing for an attack, which may never be made only by turning my flank, but will be pleased to meet you on the Bentonville road, some 10 to 12 miles from Pineville, at 12 o’clock to-morrow.
I have the honor to be, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Richmond, November 13,1861. John D. Kimball, Secretary Senate, Little Bock, Ark.:
Your dispatch received. I understand that General Johnston has only disbanded unarmed troops that have not^ enlisted for the war. The Government cannot give arms to volunteers* for twelve months as long as it has troops offered for the war to a number greater than can now be armed. If Arkansas will imitate her sister States in tendering volunteers for the war, this Government will supply them with arms in equal proportion with the other States.

Columbus, Ky., November 13,1861.
President Davis :
Since the battle of Belmont and the inglorious defeat of the enemy’s picked troops he seems to be driven almost to madness. He is now making preparations upon a gigantic scale to invest this place. He is drawing his forces from every available point of the Northwest, and will be able to bring a force of 30,000 men to invest. Our great want is armed boats. With these to meet and hold in check the enemy’s gunboats, we can successfully meet his forces. The attack, we are assured, will be made in the course of eight days. If it be possible, let us have the New Orleans fleet of armed vessels. The battle of Belmont was a hard-fought conflict of four hours. Twenty-five hundred men fought 7,500. When our ammunition was exhausted we drove his line back in three different charges; but, supported by his immense reserve, we were at last forced to fall back to the bank of the river, from which place, by a rapid flank movement under the bank of the river, myself, with two fresh regiments, turned his left and attacked him in the rear. The victory was complete. Our total loss was 632; theirs about 2,000. Please answer about fleet. General Polk’s injuries were more serious than was at first supposed. He found it necessary to turn over the command for the present to,

I have made every effort to keep my quartermaster and commissary reports in such a condition that there will be no confusion and difficulty in making the settlement; and I flatter myself that you will be pleased with the system I have adopted and followed, although it has not been strictly in accordance with the law. I am sorry to state that my command is in a rather demoralized state, and I cannot rely upon them now for the cheerful service they rendered during the fall. I will probably be able to re-enlist 2,000 men for the war, and I will be able to arm and equip that number with the remnants of stores in good order, and, if necessary, keep them in the field all winter. Please let me know if it has been decided if the present service terminates at six months from the governor’s call, at six months from the time each individual entered the field, or whether there is any termination at all $ I have been notified, unofficially, that the Confederate States pay all expenses after November 1, and I will have my pay-rolls made up to that time. I have been keeping up my monthly reports of property, &c., and will be prepared for inspection at the shortest notice.

son, at Lexington, Mo., who made known to some extent the wants of the army, but referred me for more precise information to General Price, the chief officer in command. The latter gentleman represented his army numbering more than 20,000, composed of the best men in the Sta te, and rapidly increasing. The country furnished an abundance of provisions, but they were in pressing want of clothing, blankets, shoes, camp and garrison equipage, and some descriptions of ammunition, particularly caps. Through the liberality of General Polk a good supply of ammunition was promptly furnished from Memphis, as also some artillery, and a heavy requisition for other supplies was approved by General Price, which I have been endeavoring to meet by purchases in New Orleans and Memphis, and made arrangements for securing everything, but received advice from the Quartermaster-General to postpone the shipment of further supplies until the position of the army became more definite. Supplies for General Jeff. Thompson’s men have been furnished in a similar manner. A statement of my account, filed with the bills, vouchers, requisitions, and receipts, will indicate more particularly the character of this disbursement, already in excess of $300,000.

General : I have the honor to report that on the night of the 15th instant I received information at my headquarters, 72 miles from here, that the Federal troops had started back toward Saint Louis from this place. On the 16th I started with all my available mounted troops, without wagons, and after a rapid march arrived near here last night. I was in hopes before arriving that I might be able to overtake some of the trains of the enemy, but on my arrival I found that they were too far to attempt even a pursuit, they being at least 100 miles ahead.
From all the information I can obtain the enemy’s strength was at least 30,000, with an abundance of artillery. There was evidently considerable disaffection in their ranks, and on leaving here Lane, with his Kansas troops, carried off 500 or 600 negroes, belonging to Union men

as well as secessionists. From what I can learn they intend to fortify Eolla, Sedalia, and Jefferson City, and to garrison each of those places.
The Union men have nearly all fled with the Federal troops, leaving this place almost deserted.
From all the information I can get of General Price’s movements he seems to be making his way in the direction of the Missouri Eiver. An attempt of that kind, in my opinion, can only terminate as did his previous expedition to that country. Considering it inexpedient to attempt a winter campaign in this country, I shall return to the borders of Arkansas, and put my command in winter quarters by the 15th of December. As there will be much to do to make the many arrangements necessary for an early spring campaign, I respectfully request the authority of the Department. for me to visit Eichmond for that purpose. As soon as the troops are in winter quarters my presence here could be dispensed with for a few weeks.

I must beg your indulgence and ask your permission to go somewhat into detail as to what occurred whilst I had any connection with the Missouri forces under General Price.
About the latter part of June General Price arrived near the southwestern corner of Missouri, with about 1,700 mounted men, a part of whom were armed. At or near the same time I reached General Pearce’s headquarters in the northwestern corner of Arkansas, my whole force being en route from Fort Smith, consisting of Churchill’s regiment, from Arkansas, and Hubert’s, from Louisiana, which did not reach that point until some days afterwards. In the mean time I learned that General Price had arrived in the neighborhood, being some 12 miles distant. I immediately rode over to see if I could serve him or Missouri. In a few

days General Pearce and myself received a letter from General Price, written by Brigadier-General Parsons, from near the Osage River, to the effect that he was trying to form a junction with the other brigadier-generals, Slack and Rains; that the governor of the State was with them; that they were endeavoring to march towards the southwest part of the State, and were pursued by General Lyon in the rear, whilst Colonel Sigel was in front. I at once rode over to General Pearce’s headquarters, and we agreed to march into Missouri, to aid the governor in cutting his way through his enemies, whilst Colonel McRae, of Arkansas, was ordered to go at once to Fayetteville, raise all the men possible in that neighborhood, and make a demonstration on Springfield by the Telegraph road. This maneuver was well executed, and had the effect of causing General Sweeny, then in camp at Springfield, to recall that portion of his force on its march to join Colonel Sigel.
It would be well to mention here that the military board of Arkansas had instructed General Pearce to co-operate with the forces under my command. At this time we loaned G eneral Price some 615 muskets, with ammunition for the same. On the next morning my mounted men, under Colonel Churchill, reached us by a forced march, and we entered the State of Missouri for the first time, and formed a junction with General Price, it being the 4th of July.
My command consisted of Colonel Churchill’s regiment of mounted riflemen, and General Pearce’s of Colonel Gratiot’s regiment of infantry, Colonel Carroll’s regiment of mounted men, and a battery under the command of Captain Woodruff. We marched as rapidly as possible, expecting to attack the forces under Colonel Sigel at Neosho, but learned before reaching that point that he had marched north to meet the forces with the governor of the State, leaving over 100 men at Neosho, who were captured by the regiment under command of Colonel Churchill, aided by Captain McIntosh, my adjutant-general. That night our whole mounted force reached that point, and after halting an hour or two resumed our march, and met Governor Jackson before 12 m., at the distance of 20 miles.
After a conference, the Missouri generals concluded not to pursue the enemy, but to repair to the southwest corner of the State and organize their forces, as many of them were not formed into companies or regiments.
Having accomplished the object for which we entered Missouri—viz, to assist the governor in cutting his way through the enemy—General Pearce and myself repaired to our camps and went to work to organize and drill our forces, advising General Price to the same course. Yery soon we. learned that General Lyon had arrived in Springfield with some 10,000 men, and at the same time were well aware of the scarcity of supplies among the Missouri forces and of the disposition of some to leave General Price in consequence. In a word, the country he occupied was too poor to sustain him, and he was compelled to advance or disband his forces. After a conference with General Pearce, I went to General Price’s headquarters, and offered to aid him in every possible way, even to marching on Springfield, which was agreed upon.
I am particular in giving these details, hoping they will counteract the effect of the report so often circulated to my injury that I was not willing to assist Missouri.
It will be borne in mind that I was assigned to the Indian Territory, with instructions to defend it from invasion from any quarter, and up to and long after this had no other instructions. Consequently I did what was done at my own risk, not knowing that my Government would approve my conduct.

A part of the agreement between General Price and myself was that all his unarmed men and camp followers were to be left at his camp, and under no circumstances permitted to march with the army. When we formed a junction at Cassville, some 50 miles distant, I learned, to my great regret, that the whole crowd of camp followers had arrived also. I remonstrated with General Price on the violation of the agreement. He said they should be left where we then were, and that I might draw up the plan detailing the order of march upon Springfield, which I did, and particularly said that the unarmed men were to be left at that point. This order was submitted to Generals Price and Pearce and met their approbation, and not until my division, being the advance, had marched did I learn that General Clark, of Missouri, had refused to obey the order to leave his unarmed men. I called on him at once and urged him in vain not to set such an example, stating the scarcity of supplies and the danger of a panic as a reason why they should be left. Knowing the danger of a divided command when brought in contact with one well united, well drilled, and under one efficient leader, I considered it of vital importance to rid the army of these men until after the battle was fought, but failed to accomplish it, as they all came with General Price to where I halted, some 30 miles from Springfield, the enemy being a short distance in advance. It was at this point I first saw the total inefficiency of the Missouri mounted men under Brigadier-General Rains. A thousand, more or less, of them composed the advance guard, and whilst reconnoitering the enemy’s position, some 8 miles distant from our camp, were put to flight by a single cannon-shot, running in the greatest confusion, without the loss of a single man except one, who died of overheat or sun stroke, and bringing no reliable information as to the position or force of the enemy,* nor were they of the slightest service as scouts or spies afterwards. As evidence of this, I will mention here the fact of the enemy being allowed to leave his position, 6 miles distant from us, 20 hours before we knew it, thus causing us to make a night march to surprise an enemy who was at the time entirely out of our reach. A day or two previous to this march the generals of the Missouri forces, by common consent on their part and unasked on mine, tendered me the command of their troops, which I at first declined, saying to them it was done to throw the responsibility of ordering a retreat upon me if one had to be ordered for the want of supplies, which seemed likely to be the case, their breadstuff's giving out about this time $ and, in truth, we would have been in a starving condition had it not been for the young corn, which was just in condition to be used. My troops and those under General Pearce were in a little better condition, though by no means burdened with commissary stores.
At this juncture Major Dorn, of Missouri, arrived, bringing a letter from General Polk, saying General Pillow was advancing into Missouri from Kew Madrid with 12,000 men. After further reflection upon our condition I consented to take the command and to march upon the enemy. Preparatory to doing so, however, I asked of the Missourians, owing to their knowledge of the country, some reliable information of the strength and position of the enemy. This they repeatedly promised, but totally failed to furnish, though to urge them to it I then and at subsequent periods declared I would order the whole army back to Cassville rather than bring on an engagement with an unknown enemy. Jt had no effect, as we remained 4 days within 10 miles of Spring-field, and never learned whether the streets were barricaded or if any kind of works of defense had been erected by the enemy. There was left only the choice at this time of a disastrous retreat or a blind attack

upon Springfield. The latter was preferred, and orders issued on the evening of the 9th August to be ready for the march at 9 o’clock p. m., so as to bring on the attack at daylight on the 10th. At the hour named for the march there fell a little rain, with strong indications of more, which caused the order to march to be countermanded after a conference with General Price. That was thought to be prudent, as we had an average of only 25 rounds of ammunition to the man, and no more to be had short of Fort Smith or Baton Rouge. Not more than one man in four was furnished with anything better than bags made of cotton cloth in which to carry their cartridges. The slightest rain or wet would have almost disarmed us, as many of the men had nothing hue the common shot-gun and rifle of the country, without bayonets. However, the enemy unwisely concluded to attack us in our position, which was well selected for the kind of arms we had to use against their long-range rifled muskets. On the morning of the 10th information of the approach of the enemy’s advance down the creek was soon followed by a precipitate retreat of a> portion cf General Rains’ mounted men, mixed up with camp followers to the number of probably several thousand, and this, too, before the firing had begun. I mention these facts to show the unorganized condition of the Missouri forces, and what great risk w© ran of a panic being communicated to the fighting men of the army by having such material among them. Yery nearly at the same time the enemy opened upon us both above and below on the creek, the two extremes of our camp being composed of mounted men from Missouri, whose duty it was to have kept pickets on the roads, both above and below, on which the enemy advanced. I have never been able to learn who ordered these pickets to leave their posts, or if they left them without orders when the time arrived to march the night before at 9 o’clock. Be that as it may, the fault was theirs, and not mine, that the enemy was allowed to approach so near before we were notified of it. However, I never considered anything lost by their manner of attack, as we never were in a better condition to make battle, every man being ready with gun in hand to receive the enemy, when at other times thousands of our men would be miles from camp hunting something to eat for themselves and horses.
In thus going into details on this subject I wish to show how unreliable were a portion of the troops under General Price, but by no means do I wish to reflect upon the bravery of General Price himself, or his infantry and artillery, who fought heroically at the battle of Oak Hills.
The battle over, it was ascertained that the camp followers, whose presence I had so strongly objected to, had robbed our dead and wounded on the battle-field of their arms, and at the same time had taken those left by the enemy. I tried to recover the arms thus lost by my men, and also a portion of those taken from the enemy, but in vain. General Pearce made an effort to get back those muskets loaned to General Price before we entered Missouri the first time. I was informed he recovered only 10 out of the 615. I then asked that the battery be given me which was won by the Louisiana regiment at the point of the bayonet. The guns were turned over, by order of General Price, minus the horses and most of the harness. I would not have demanded these guns had General Price done the Louisiana regiment justice in his official report. The language used by him was calculated to make the impression that the battery was captured by his men instead of that regiment. My official report was written after General Price’s was printed in Springfield. Let them both be read, and let unprejudiced men say which was best calculated to keep up a feeling

﻿Chap. X.J	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------CONFEDERATE.	747
of friendship between the two armies. It was with this purpose I refrained from mentioning facts in my official report which are mentioned now in this communication. I always endeavored to prevent ill feeling between our forces, because it was to the interest of both to have them co-operate fully against a common foe.
A few days after the battle of Oak Hills General Price wrote me a note, and then called on me in person, requesting me to march with him to the Missouri River. I declined to do so, first, because my whole force fit for duty were required for the protection of the upper portion of Arkansas, and to keep the Federals in Kansas from gaining access to the Cherokee Eat ion, which still occupied a neutral position; secondly, because I had very little ammunition, some of my officers having informed me, when ordered to be ready to pursue the enemy on the 10th of August, that some of their men had fired their last cartridge in the battle of that date; and, thirdly, because we could expect no co-operation on the part of Colonel Hardee or General Pillow, I having just received a letter from Colonel (now General) Hardee, informing me that General Pillow had fallen back, and that in consequence he would be compelled to retire to his former position near the Arkansas line. This information I imparted to General Price in this interview.
On this day the Arkansas State troops marched for home, leaving me with about 2,500 men fit for duty, 2,000 of whom were required to defend the northwest part of Arkansas and the Indian Territory.
Whilst General Price and myself have ever been on the most friendly terms personally, yet we never could agree as to the proper time of marching to the Missouri River. Had he thought proper to listen to my suggestions on the subject he would have been advised to fortify Springfield and hold it with his infantry and artillery and post his mounted men so as to give protection against the jayhawkers from Kansas. The legislature could then have been called together by the governor at Springfield, the State have seceded from the Union, and her army been turned over to the Confederacy at the time she was admitted as a member. A commander over the State forces and those under me could have been appointed by the President, which would have secured co-operation in all their movements. Then, if possible, a considerable number of extra arms to give to those who joined us, and at the same time a force to have menaced Saint Louis from below, would have been the time to march to the Missouri River, raise the strong secession element on both sides of the river, and march down upon Saint Louis. At all events, it could have been mustered into the Confederate service and brought off to the interior of the State, and not abandoned, after being raised, to be stripped of its arms and put in such condition by the Federal Government as to be of no sort of use in the future struggles in the State for independence.
Soon after the battle was fought and won at Oak Hills the forces engaged in its glorious achievement separated—those under General Price for the Missouri River; those under General Pearce left for home, whilst those under my command moved off towards the Cherokee Nation. I immediately used every exertion to increase my force, for the purpose of attacking Forts Scott and Lincoln, in Kansas, and just at the time I was concentrating my whole force near the Kansas border General Price came down upon me, bringing the intelligence of the approach of General Fremont upon Springfield with 30,000 or 40,000 men. This forced me to abandon my contemplated campaign and repair at once to the Telegraph road which leads from Springfield to Fayetteville, in Arkansas, where most of my supplies were kept at the timer and were liable to be destroyed by a few bold horsemen,

Before separating from General Price I called on him twice, for the purpose of forming some plan upon which to meet the enemy. It was thought best for me to occupy some position between Pineville, which he was to fall back to if the enemy advanced, ami the Telegraph road. This I did, and at the same time sent two regiments, under Colonel McIntosh, one from Texas and one from Arkansas, to a point some 30 miles in advance of my position, From these regiments scouts were thrown forward to and beyond Springfield, keeping me informed of the movements and strength of the enemy’s forces as they arrived at that point. In the mean time General Price came again into the center of my column without giving me the least notice of his intention. I rode in the direction of his headquarters and met Governor Jackson, and suggested the propriety of a conference with General Price. We met next day at a point between the two armies, where it was agreed upon by all the Missouri generals that we should await an attack from the enemy, the ground to be selected by General Price and myself. The day after I went to see General Price,'and we arranged a plan to co-operate in the event either was attacked. Soon my scouts brought the information of the advance of the enemy, 12,000 strong, under General Sigel, some 10 miles on the Telegraph road. I ordered back the two regiments under Colonel McIntosh, with directions to destroy the forage near the road, having previously destroyed that around- Spring-field, also some mills that were useful to the enemy ; in the mean time preparing to give the enemy a warm reception notwithstanding the disparity in our numbers, his being over 30,000, mine about 5,000, and General Price’s about 12,000.
At this time General Price had fallen back to Pineville, in accordance with our agreement. I wrote him, proposing to draw the enemy, if he did advance and follow us, into Arkansas, to what is called the Boston Mountain. If we could have effected this it would have doubled my force, by calling in my two regiments from Texas, then in the Indian Nation, and the Indian regiments also. This he objected to, saying his men would not consent to go out of the State of Missouri, at the same time expressing a desire to see me. I again met him, and told him if we fought the enemy where we were it would amount to nothing but a repulse of his infantry, as he would never bring his baggage wagons and artillery into so rough a country; whereas if he could be got down to the Boston Mountain, some 60 miles, we would get all his cannon, 120, and most of his army, with their arms. He said again his men would not leave the State; whereupon I agreed to fight them in our present position, though I believed it would result in little good to Missouri.
In a day or two my scouts brought me the news of the retreat of the enemy from Springfield; General Hunter towards Sedalia, with over 15,000 men; General Lane towards Kansas, with 4,000 men; and General Sigel towards Bolla, with 12,000 men. Whilst I was making ready to make a forced march with my best-shod horses to overtake the rear of General Sigel’s column, who was three days behind the others in leaving Springfield, a note was handed me from General Price, asking me to join him in pursuing General Lane, who had carried off some 600 negroes belonging to the people of Missouri. I declined to join in the pursuit, on the ground that ne could not be overtaken, he having some seven days and 100 miles the start of us. I informed General Price of my intention to make a forced march after General Sigel, but received no reply, nor did I hear anything more of his movements, except such as was brought by travelers, who are seldom to be relied upon. It has

﻿Chap. X.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.------CONFEDERATE.	749
been asked why I did not pursue the enemy. In answering this question I will merely state facts, and let my superiors say if it would have been advisable to advance under the circumstances.
In the first place, my force was entirely inadequate for such an enterprise, it being about 5,000 men, including fourteen pieces of artillery. Five hundred of these men had been too much enfeebled by sickness to be able to take the field, though they would have fought the enemy*had he marched upon us. This would have reduced my force to 4,500; 2,000 of which it would have been indispensably necessary, as recent events have shown, to have left for the protection of that portion of Arkansas and the Indian Territory. This would have further reduced my command to the small number of 2,500. Would it have been prudent, with this force, to follow General Sigel, who had 12,000 men, to Eolla, where General Phelps was already witli 2,000 more, or would it have been better to follow General Hunter to Sedalia, who had over 15,000 men ? At the same time it will be remembered that both Eolla and Sedalia are the termini of railroads leading from Saint Louis; that supplies without limit could be had, and any number of men thrown to these points long before I could have reached them; and this, too, when I had made half the distance before they knew of my approach. Again, it will be remembered that these points—Eolla and Sedalia—are about the distance of 200 miles from the position held by me at the time the enemy retreated from Springfield. I had not exceeding three days’ rations for my men to start with, and not a single extra mule or horse shoe to replace those lost on the march, and this, too, at the season of the year when the ground, being frozen, would render it impossible for our mules or horses to travel without being shod.
It may be asked also why I did not join my forces to those under General Price. In answer to this question it will only be necessary to say that it was impossible for us to march together, owing to the great-number of animals in our commands, being not much short of 15,000, all of which had to be fed, as well as our men, on what could be gathered on the march through a country already laid waste by the armies of both sides having repeatedly passed over it. Besides, it was always clear to my mind that we could never maintain a position on the Missouri Eiver for any length of time, owing to the great distance we would be from our resources and the close proximity of those of the enemy, we having to haul in wagons 300 or 400 miles supplies which he could obtain by railroads or steamboats in a few hours; thus putting it in the power of the enemy to do as much in twenty-four hours as we could in as many days to supply a want of men or means to make war.
It has been said, both by individuals and newspapers, that I was un-' willing to assist Missouri. Do the many efforts on my part recited above to aid her go to prove it? or can the accusation be proved by the fact of my having called on her general-in-chief three times at his headquarters and met him at two other points for the purpose of bringing about concert of action against the large force under General Fremont ? Truth constrains me to say that neither he nor any officer under him ever visited my camp, though some of his generals were known to have passed in a few yards of my headquarters at the time.
In conclusion, permit me to say I have endeavored to give a plain statement of matters and things as they occurred. The dates and precise language of the notes and letters referred to cannot now be given, as they are at this time at my headquarters.
J have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENT. McOULLOOH,
Brigadier- General.
