Hon. S. Cameron :
Sir : Since I saw you in Washington last I have been in Baltimore City laboring, in conjunction with the mayor of that city, to preserve peace and order, but I regret to say with little success. IJp to yesterday there appeared promise, but the outbreak came; the turbulent passions of the riotous element prevailed ; fear for safety became reality ; what they had endeavored to conceal, but what was known to us, was no longer concealed, but made manifest; the rebellious element had the control of things. We were arranging and organizing forces to protect the city and preserve order, but want of organization and of arms prevented success. They had arms; they had the principal part of the organized military forces with them, and for us to have made the effort, under the circumstances, would have had the effect to aid the disorderly element. They took possession of the armories, have the arms and ammunition, and I therefore think it prudent to decline (for the present) responding affirmatively to the requisition made by President Lincoln for four regiments of infantry.
With great respect, I am, your obedient servant,
THOS. H. HICKS.

Philadelphia, Pa., April 20,1801. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War ;
Will you give order to dispatch troops via Annapolis to-day from here to Havre de Grace by rail, thence by large non ferry-boat ? The Baltimore and Ohio Road decline to transport any more troops from the North. We think this decidedly best, and are joined in this opinion by General Patterson, General Cadwalader, and Governor Curtin.

[General Scott :]
My Dear General: There has been no arrival from the North. Some one or more bridges have been destroyed; where it is not known; telegraph interrupted. Warford has sent by horses along the road to find where the trouble is; will send me and General Keim with his staff through by an express train, if locomotives are on the north side of the track.
This road must be under military control at once, and in charge of the Government. So must the road between here and Washington. This is absolutely indispensable. Our rapid communication with the North is otherwise cut off. Troops coming on your road could leave it about three miles from Baltimore, and by a march of five miles reach the Washington road some two and a half miles from the city on the Washington road. This would avoid the city. But the city must be under the Government control. You should not rely upon any sending dispatches. Trusty agents should keep you informed, and carry your directions. Depend upon it, a vigorous and efficient plan of action must be decided on and carried out, or we will have to give up the capital.
The communication with the South is perfect both by railroad and telegraph, and we must have the same, or we are gone. No arrivals from Philadelphia or New York, and no information. Rumor says the bridge across the Gunpowder is destroyed, and also a bridge some six or eight miles out of the city. The Northern Central should be the base of operations, and the communications by water be kept open. Havre

de Grace, it seems to me, is a point at which our Pennsylvania troops might concentrate with advantage, as from there they could reach here by water or Annapolis by rail. We could keep the railroad open easy from the east bank of the Susquehanna.
Let there be prompt action. Let the Government as soon as possible take possession of the railroad necessary to keep open communication with Washington. Take, if necessary, tow steamers here for transporting troops by water. A few thousand men with artillery on the high grounds about this city would secure it to us.
Yours, truly,
D. WILMOT.
Saturday, April 20,1861—11 o’clock.
Have just heard that the bridges between Ashland and Cockeysville and two or three nearer towns are burned. Will advise the forces in Philadelphia and such as may be at Harrisburg to come upon this road as far as they can and protect the balance of the road, and protect while temporarily repairing the bridges, or so much as is necessary—the balance to come in force and well armed to within three miles of Baltimore and cross over to Washington, and if in our possession, as it should be, to proceed by rail to Washington 5 if not, to march by forced marches to Washington. Am about starting in carriages, and hope to get through without interruption to York, and there take express train to Harrisburg.
Yours,
D. WILMOT.
Navy Department, April 20, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War :
Sir : I respectfully suggest that a military force be established at Annapolis to protect the frigate Constitution and Government property there, which is now much exposed. Could not a portion of one of the regiments expected to land there to-day be detailed for that duty % The withdrawal of a considerable portion of the marines from this station for other duty leaves the navy-yard and Government property much exposed. I would therefore respectfully request that a military force be detailed to aid in guarding that point.

To the Officer [in command]:
War Department, April 21,1861.
The President, with a desire to gratify the mayor of Baltimore, who fears that bloodshed would unnecessarily result from the passage through that city of the troops from Pennsylvania at this moment on the way, directs that they shall return to York, in Pennsylvania. This order refers to the troops now said to be at Cockeysville, Md., en route for this city. It will be obeyed by the officer in command, who will take care to leave force sufficient along the road to keep it safe from depredation of every kind and within his entire control.
SIMON CAMEKON,
Secretary of War.
Orders:]	Headquarters of the army,
Washington, April 21, 1861.
It is understood that a body of volunteers approaching this city has reached Cockeysville or other points within seventeen or twenty miles by rail of Baltimore.
The obstructions in the railroad within Baltimore and its neighborhood, and still more the unhappy excitement temporarily existing in that city, have induced the President to direct that those volunteers return to Harrisburg, and take the route via Philadelphia and Wilmington to Perryville, on the Susquehanna: thence to embark in steamers for Annapolis, or to proceed down the Delaware and through the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal in sufficient tugs or other crafts to Annapolis, as Major-General Patterson may direct.
Major Belger, assistant quartermaster, will convey this written order to the commanders of the volunteers in question, and, if necessary, accompany them to Philadelphia and beyond, in order to facilitate the movement. He will also leave directions at Harrisburg to prevent other volunteers from approaching Washington through Baltimore until further orders.

on board men, munitions of war, or supplies of provisions; and, if so, keep them under the guns of your fort and prevent their proceeding until further orders. This of course does not apply to the troops or supplies of the United States, but does to steamer Monticello, as before ordered.

Washington, April 21,1861.
Maj. Gen. B. Patterson:
Sir : The direct communication by rail and telegraph between us is interrupted by many breaks between the Susquehanna and the Belay House, this side of Baltimore. Bor the present Northern re-enforcements can only reach us by, 1st, the ocean and the Potomac; 2d, by the Susquehanna steamboats and Annapolis $ and 3d, by Harrisburg, York, and a point on that railroad nearest to the Belay House, some six miles to be marched over.
Please give your attention to the road up to the Susquehanna, and station a strong force at a point for the protection of transport steamers, if any besides the Maryland, and the embarkations. It was reported yesterday that this steamer had taken on board at that point two regiments of volunteers—the Seventh, of New York, and another, of Massachusetts—and I immediately dispatched a quartermaster to receive and assist them in reaching Washington. We have not heard of their arrival at Annapolis. But the route via Harrisburg is to us, perhaps, still more important.
Major Porter, assistant adjutant-general, was sent several days ago to Governor Curtin to muster in volunteers, and to string them along the railroad in Maryland, leading from Harrisburg toward Baltimore. Please give your attention in part to this line of communication. Communicate frequently the arrival and departure of troops, numbers, and the routes. Employ express when necessary.
I do not know that we can hire a steamer at Baltimore for Annapolis in addition to the Maryland, and perhaps a war steamer may be necessary to escort transports from the Susquehanna to Annapolis.
With the greatest respect, yours, truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.

regiment at Annapolis and the others at the junction; to hold both positions, guard the road, and report to Lieutenant-General Scott for instructions.
I venture respectfully to suggest, for the consideration of the General-in-Chief, that inasmuch as the force at my disposal is entirely inadequate to open the way and guard the railroad from Gunpowder to Baltimore— and as I learn that all the regiments from the North and East are going by sea from Eastern ports I can hope for no substantial re-enforcements from that quarter—it will be best to adopt as our line of communication the Baltimore Bailroadfrom here to Havre de Grace, the new boat of the rail company, with propellers and Government steamers, well armed, to serve as escorts from here to Annapolis. The road from Annapolis to Washington can be protected without great difficulty, as there are no bridges, and a few small war steamers can keep the Susquehanna and Chesapeake clear, and, if need be, aid Fort McHenry and threaten Baltimore, also blockade it 5 the road from here to Havre de Grace occupied and protected; a battery erected or war vessel (steamer, if it can 1ie spared) to command the Susquehanna and cover Cecil and Havre de Grace. All available steam vessels and other craft to be concentrated at Cecil or Perryville, the railroad terminus at the Susquehanna.
The garrison at Fort McHenry should prevent any steamboat, steam vessel, or any other craft hostile (or that the commander has reason to suppose hostile), from leaving Baltimore.
The Government forthwith to take possession of the railway line from Washington to Annapolis.
When we have sufficient troops and provisions, they shall be concentrated at Washington by means of the Annapolis route. The Government can take possession of the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad and the railway lines from Baltimore to Harrisburg, and thereby secure a safe and speedy means of‘communicating with Washington.
These suggestions are with diffidence submitted to the better judgment of the General-in-Chief, who will at once see whether they are judicious or otherwise.
I have also to suggest that in my opinion it is expedient to declare or put the entire line, and ten, twenty, or thirty miles on each side, or the entire department under my command, under martial law; and if the General concurs, I ask his approval, or rather that he will give the order.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
THOS. H. HICKS,
Governor of Maryland.
Washington, April 22,1861. Major General Patterson, Commanding, &c.:
Sir: Your letter to the Adjutant-General of yesterday, brought by Mr. Hill, came to me this night.
In my letter to you yesterday I intended that the railroad via Harrisburg and York towards Baltimore was more important, perhaps, for re-enforcing Washington than that from Philadelphia to Perryville, &c. That supposition was founded on the Secretary’s belief that the distance from a certain point on the Harrisburg Eailroad to the Kelay House, eight miles this side of Baltimore, was but some seven miles by a good wagon road, whereas there is no good common road between the two railroads of less than thirty miles. This fact renders the railroad from Harrisburg to Baltimore of no value to us here without a force of, perhaps, ten thousand men to hold Baltimore—to protect the rails and bridges near it. This shall be done as soon as we shall have a surplus force over and above what is necessary for the security of Washington. With this information the line for troops coming from the North to this place via Perry-ville, thence by steamboats to Annapolis, and wagon roads, seems greatly preferable} but, besides the want of railroad transportation this side of Annapolis, we have no war steamer, and may not have one in ten days to convoy the transports from Perryville to Annapolis. The embarkations at Perryville you may be able to protect by a strong guard at that place.
The Massachusetts and Yew York volunteers which arrived at Annapolis yesterday debarked, it is believed, to-day, and have commenced their march upon this place. Up to this moment we do not know that the march has commenced. The difficulty is probably the want of cars or common wagons, leaving perhaps a guard of some three companies at the Naval School, Annapolis. The route for Northern troops coming here from Gettysburg by common roads to Frederick, Md., may be worth attention. Besides the troops supposed to have landed at Annapolis, we greatly need ten or twelve additional regiments for this place, now partially besieged, threatened, and in danger of being attacked on all sides in a day or two or three.
With the greatest respect, yours, truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—Camp equipage is much wanted here, the preparation of which is pushed at Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. The same remark is applicable to accouterments.
The public buildings here have already as many troops as they can receive.
Communicate often by express, if necessary.

I also recommend that two companies of infantry and one field piece be established at once at the Georgetown end of the Aqueduct, to hold it as above.
Vedettes should be thrown out from there just as far as practicable on the Virginia side.
As soon as practicable I will send an Engineer officer to make defensive arrangements at these two places.
I have not been informed what arrangements are in effect to watch the Potomac, but think that armed steamers should be kept in motion, and that to one should be assigned the especial duty of watching the movements on the river between here and Alexandria.

In reply to the communication from you on the 21st I had the honor to inform you of the necessities of my command which drew me into the harbor of Annapolis.* My circumstances have not changed. To that communication I have received no reply. I cannot return, if I desire so to do, without being furnished with some necessary supplies, for all which the money will be paid. I desire of your excellency an immediate reply whether I have the permission of the State authorities of Maryland to land the men under my command, and of passing quickly through the State on my way to Washington, respecting private property, and paying for what I receive, and outraging the rights of none— a duty which I am bound to do in obedience to the requisitions of the President of the United States.
I have received some copies of an informal correspondence between the mayor of Baltimore and the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and a copy of a note from your excellency, inclosing the same to Captain Blake, commandant of the Naval School.
These purport to show that instructions have been issued by the War Department as to the disposition of the U. S. militia, differing from what I had supposed to be my duty. If these instructions have been in fact issued, it would give me great pleasure to obey them. Have I your excellency’s permission, in consideration of these exigencies of the case, to land my men, to supply their wants, and to relieve them from the extreme and unhealthy confinement of a transport vessel not fitted to receive them ? To convince your excellency of the good faith towards the authorities of the State of Maryland with which I am acting—and I am armed only against the disturbers of her peace and of the United States—I inclose a copy of an order issued to my command before I had the honor of receiving the copy of your communication through Captain Blake.
I trust your excellency will appreciate the necessities of my position, and give me an immediate reply, which I await with anxiety.
I would do myself the honor to have a personal interview with your excellency if you so desire.
