No. 33.
f	Harper1 s Ferry, Va., July 25, 1861.
The term for which the troops from Pennsylvania were called into service having expired, and nearly all of them having returned to their homes, the commanding general, by direction of the War Department, relinquishes the command of this department on the expiration of his term of service.
The commanding general regrets to leave you. It is with satisfaction that he recalls to you that you have steadily advanced in the face of the enemy, greatly superior in numbers and artillery, and offered battle, which they refused until protected by their strong intrenchments at Winchester.
You have done all that was possible and more than could have been expected or demanded, and if advantage has not been taken of your sacrifices, and if the fruits of your campaign have been lost, the fault cannot be imputed to you.
To the members of the department staff he tenders his thanks for their efficient aid and devotion to dutv.
R. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
