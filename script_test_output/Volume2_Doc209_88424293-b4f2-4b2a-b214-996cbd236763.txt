Reports of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, TJ’. 8. Army, of preliminary operations, with orders and proclamations, from June 22 to July 5.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Parkersburg, Va., June 22, 1861.
Colonel : I reached here yesterday morning, hoping to move forward during the day, but was delayed by want of wagons and the disorganization to be expected on the part of new troops moving for the first time into the field. In a few minutes (near 7 a. m.) I shall move with the advance to Clarksburg, taking one regiment of infantry, two detached companies (one of regulars), one battery, and a company of cavalry. Two Indiana regiments will follow during the morning, two Ohio regimen ts to-morrow. No other Ohio regiments will reach Grafton, via Bellaire, to-day. Reports from the front are somewhat contradictory, but agree in representing the enemy in strong force near Piedmont and Beverly. Notwithstanding that General Morris and others seem sure that we have a large force to contend with, I now am inclined to doubt it. I will, without delay, beat them up in their quarters and endeavor to put an end to their attempts in this direction. I have, I think, force enough to fight them wherever I find them.
General McCall telegraphs that Cumberland will be re-enforced on Monday. If that is accomplished, we should be able to cut off the force near Piedmont. As I cannot learn yet the quality of their troops (there are reports that there are some regiments of the regular Confederate troops) I shall be cautious in my movements. I feel very much the absolute necessity of more commissary and quartermaster officers, also of cavalry. I hope the Lieutenant-General will find it in his power to let me have the companies of First Cavalry, now at Leavenworth.
I received on the 18th instant the order adding Missouri to my department. My arrangements for coming here to take command are so far advanced that it was not possible for me to go to Missouri. I shall go there immediately on my return from this State.
I move hence on Clarksburg, and will act there according to the information I receive—either move in force on the rear of the enemy at Beverly or go on to Piedmont.
Excuse, colonel, the hurried nature of this.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General, TJ. 8. Army. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Headquarters Department op the Ohio,
Grafton, Va., June 23, 1861.
Colonel : Having completed as far as possible the necessary arrange ments for transportation, &c., I left Parkersburg' yesterday about 1 p. in. with the Ninth Ohio Regiment; Company I, Fourth Artillery, and the company of Chicago Rifles. I reached here about 2 a. m., having left the Ninth Regiment at Webster. The Eighth and Tenth Indiana, Loomis’ Michigan Battery, and Captain Barker’s company of Illinois cavalry reached Clarksburg to-day. The Third and Fourth Ohio also reached Fetterman to-day. The Seventeenth and Nineteenth Ohio and Howe’s battery will be up to-morrow.
From information I have received I think it more than probable that there are from fifteen hundred to three thousand rebels at Romney, intrenched with a few guns. I think their object is to cover the approaches to Winchester from an apprehended attack in this direction, as well as to cover the operations of guerrilla parties now acting towards Piedmont. It will probably be necessary to break up their establishment when I get through with other more important matters. If General Patterson could furnish the force to do it in the mean time, I think it would be advantageous. Their presence tends to alarm Union men even this far away. I did not find my orders intelligently carried out for the defense of Cheat River, and will go there mysgjf to-morrow to see it properly attended to. It is very important to secure that line.
There is certainly a force of some kind near Huttonsville, with a strong advanced party intrenched near the Laurel Mountain, between Philippi and Beverly. I think that the chief object of this party is to protect and furnish guerrilla parties, which are doing much damage in this region. I am of the opinion that the apprehensions of an attack in force, so constantly and so seriously reported to me that I felt it impossible to disregard them, are not well founded. It is confidently asserted that Georgia and Tennessee troops are among those at the Laurel Hill, but I do not feel certain of it. It seems to be a peculiar characteristic of the information obtained here that it is exceedingly vague and unreliable. I hope to inaugurate a better system.
My presence here was very necessary to reassure the Union men, and even if I find no force able to oppose us, I shall still be certain that it was very necessary for me to be here. As soon as I can get my command well in hand and obtain more reliable information—and I hope this will not occupy more than one or at most two days—I propose moving with all my available force from Clarksburg on Buckhannon, then on Beverly, to turn entirely the detachment at the Laurel Mountain. The troops at Philippi will advance in time to follow up the retreat of the rebels in their front. After occupying Beverly I shall move on Huttonsville, and endeavor to drive them into the mountains, whither I do not propose to follow them, unless under such circumstances as to make success certain. Having driven out the mass of their troops, and having occupied the pass by which they might return, I propose moving small columns through the country to reassure the Union men and break up any scattered parties of armed rebels. As soon as practicable, I intend to clean out the valley of the Kanawha.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
geo. b. McClellan,
Major- General,
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,

﻿196	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., YA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
Headquarters Department of tiie Ohio,
Grafton, Va.y June 23, 1861.
To the Inhabitants of Western Virginia:
The army of this department, headed by Virginia troops, is rapidly occupying all Western Virginia. This is done in co operation with, and in support of, such civil authorities of the State as are faithful to the Constitution and laws of the United States. The proclamation issued by me under date of May 26, 1861, will be strictly maintained. Your houses, families, property, and all your rights will be religiously respected ; we are enemies to none but armed rebels and those voluntarily giving them aid. All officers of this army will be held responsible for the most prompt and vigorous action in repressing disorder and punishing aggression by those under their command.
To my great regret I find that enemies of the United States continue to carry on a system of hostilities prohibited by the laws of war among belligerent nations, and of course far more wicked and intolerable when directed against loyal citizens engaged in the defense of the common Government of all. Individuals and marauding parties are pursuing a guerrilla warfare, firing upon sentinels and pickets, burning bridges, insulting, injuring, and even killing citizens because of their Union sentiments, and committing many kindred acts.
I do now, th^efore, make proclamation, and warn all persons that individuals or parties engaged in this species of warfare—irregular in every view which can be taken of it—thus attacking sentries, pickets, or other soldiers, destroying public or private property, or committing injuries against any of the inhabitants because of Union sentiments or conduct, will be dealt with in their persons and property according to the severest rules of military law.
All persons giving information or aid to the public enemies will be arrested and kept in close custody, and all persons found bearing arms, unless of known loyalty, will be arrested and held for examination.
GEO. B. McGLELLAH,
Major-General, TJ. 8. Army, Commanding Department.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Grafton, Va.} June 25, 1861.
To the Soldiers of the Army of the West:
You are here to support the Government of your country, and to protect the lives and liberties of your brethren, threatened by a rebellious and traitorous foe. Ho higher and nobler duty could devolve upon you, and I expect you to bring to its perfor mance the highest and noblest qualities of soldiers—discipline, courage, and mercy. I call upon the officers of every grade to enforce the strictest discipline, and I know that those of all grades, privates and officers, will display in battle cool, heroic courage, and will know how to show mercy to a disarmed enemy.
Bear in mind that you are in the country of friends, not of enemies; that you are here to protect, not to destroy. Take nothing, destroy nothing, unless you are ordered to do so by your general officers. Be-meinber that I have pledged my word to the people of Western Virginia that their rights in person and property shall be respected. I ask every one of you to make good this promise in its broadest sense. We come here to save, not to upturn. I do not appeal to the fear of punishment, but to your appreciation of the sacredness of the cause in which we are engaged. Garry with you into battle the conviction that you are right, and that God is on your side.

Your enemies have violated every moral law; neither God nor man can sustain them. They have, without cause, rebelled against a mild and paternal Government; they have seized upon public and private property; they have outraged the persons of Northern men merely because they came from the North, and of Southern Union men merely because they loved the Union; they have placed themselves beneath contempt, unless they can retrieve some honor on the field of battle. You will pursue a different course. You will be honest, brave, and merciful 5 you will respect the right of private opinion; you will punish no man for opinion’s sake. Show to the world that you differ from our enemies in the points of honor, honesty, and respect for private opinion, and that we inaugurate no reign of terror where we go.
Soldiers! I have heard that there was danger here. I have come to place myself at your head and to share it with you. I fear now but one thing—that you will not find foemen worthy of your steel. I know that I can rely upon you.
geo. b. McClellan,
Major- General, Commanding.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Buclchannon, Va., July 2,1861. Brig. Gen. J. D. Cox, Camp Dennison, Ohio :
General : On receipt of this you will at once assume command of the First and Second Kentucky Begiments and the Twelfth Ohio. Call upon Governor Dennison to supply you with one company of cavalry and six guns. Captain Kingsbury probably has State guns enough to give you.
You will expedite the equipment of those regiments, and move them at once to Gallipolis, via Hamden and Portland, hiring teams for the supplies of the troops between Portland and Gallipolis, sending to the quartermaster in advance to have teams ready. With the regiment first ready to move proceed to Gallipolis and assume command of the Twenty-first. Cross the river and occupy Point Pleasant. With the regiment that next arrives occupy Letart’s Falls, and then move the other two regiments to the mouth of Ten-mile Creek, or the point near there where the road from Letart’s Falls intersects the Kanawha Biver. Place the last regiment in reserve at Point Pleasant, or any proper point in rear of your line of defense. Intrench two guns at Letart’s and four at your advanced position on the Kanawha. Bemain on the defensive, and endeavor to keep the rebels near Charleston until I can cut off their retreat by movement from Beverly. Should you receive certain intelligence that I am hard pressed, seek to relieve me by a rapid advance on Charleston, but place no credit in rumors, for I shall be successful. Use your cavalry as pickets, not exposing them. Punish Bipley, if you can. Bepress any outbreaks that may occur at Guyandotte or Barboursville.
Bemember, my plan is to cut them off, and do all you can to assist that object. Always keep two or three boats on hand. Call on Capt. W. J. Kountz, at Marietta or Bipley, to supply boats from his fleet. If the two companies of Seventeenth Ohio are still at Bavenswood when you reach Gallipolis, order them to rejoin their regiment, via Parkersburg or Webster. Communicate frequently. A telegraph line follows me out.
Yery respectfully, yours,
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General, Commanding.

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA,
Headquarters Department op the Ohio,
Buckliannon, Va^July 5,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel : Yon will probably feel as much regret as I do in finding that I am still here. The cause is the difficulty of getting up supplies and arranging transportation. I hope that to-day’s arrivals will enable me to move in the morning. While waiting here I have endeavored to employ our time to advantage.
You will observe that this is the important strategical position in this region. From it I can cover our base of operations and supplies, and move readily by good roads in any desired direction. I have directed the positions on Cheat Eiver at Grafton, Webster, Clarksburg, and Parkersburg to be intrenched, that the necessary garrisons may be reduced as much as possible. The bridges, tunnels, &c., on the two branches of the railroad are' now well guarded. The Cheat Eiver, covering the left of our base, is guarded by eleven companies 5 Grafton, by a regiment; Clarksburg, some eight companies, besides Virginia recruits; Parkersburg, six companies, two regiments of Indiana troops to arrive there to-day, and to be disposable as a reserve where needed. Two other Indiana three-years’ regiments are en route to Bellaire, to be sent wherever needed. Six companies occupy Wirt County Court-House, where Union men have suffered much. Four companies at Eavenswood repulsed O. J. Wise night before last. I hope that he determined to renew the attempt, as in that case he will have been cut off by a column of twelve hundred men under Colonel Norton, that were to reach Eipley from Letart’s at 2 p. m. yesterday. I shall not be surprised to learn before this letter is closed that he is captured. In consequence of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Great Kanawha Valley I have ordered four regiments there, as explained in my instructions to General J. D. Cox, a copy of which has been forwarded to you.
Of the troops composing the active army fifty one companies and one battery are at Philippi, amusing the enemy, who is strongly intrenched with artillery on the Laurel Mountain between that place and Beverly. I have with me here six entire regiments of infantry, six detached companies, two batteries, two companies of cavalry; two more regiments, and some five or six detached companies of infantry will reach here by to-morrow night. The Seventh Ohio occupied Weston some three days since, and four companies of the Seventeenth reached Glenville from Parkersburg yesterday. I ordered strong detachments from these commands to move last night on Bulltown, and break up a large force of armed rebels congregating there. I can, if necessary, have them all back with me by to-morrow night.
I have sent out frequent small parties to break up the collections of rebels. We have them pretty well under now. One of our parties of forty last night broke up two hundred. The morale of our men is excellent—could not be better. It is difficult to get perfectly accurate information, but we are improving in that respect every day. The feeling of the people here is most excellent. We are welcomed wherever our men go. It is wonderful to see how rapidly the minds of many of these people become enlightened when they find we can protect them.
Fear and ignorance combined have made most of the converts to secession; the reverse process is now going on with great rapidity.
I expect to find the enemy in position on Eicli Mountain, just this side of Beverly. I shall, if possible, turn the position to the south, and thus occupy the Beverly road in his rear. If possible I will repeat the maneuver of Cerro Gordo.

CAMPAIGN IN WEST VIRGINIA.
199
Assure the General that no prospect of a brilliant victory shall induce me to depart from my intention of gaining success by maneuvering rather than by fighting. I will not throw these raw men of mine into the teeth of artillery and intrenchments if it is possible to avoid it. Say to the General, too, that I am trying to follow a lesson long ago learned from him; i. e., not to move until I know that everything is ready, and then to move with the utmost rapidity and energy. The delays that I have met with have been irksome to me in the extreme, but I felt that it would be exceedingly foolish to give way to impatience, and advance before everything was prepared. I think the troops are improving decidedly in their performance of guard and outpost duty, and that we are losing nothing in efficiency by the halt at this place.
From all that I learn the enemy is still uncertain as to where the main attack is to be made, and is committing the error of dividing his army in the face of superior forces. If he abandons the position on Laurel Mountain, the troops at Philippi will press him closely. I sholl know to-night with certainty what he has in the pass at Huttonsville. I am told that he has moved all his troops thence towards Beverly. By our present positions we have cut off all his supplies of provisions from this region, so that he must depend almost entirely upon Staunton— a long haul, over a rough mountain road.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General, TJ. 8. Army, Commanding Department.
Buckhannon, Va.3 July 6,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend :
A well-concerted movement to catch O. J. Wise, with his eight hundred men, at Ripley, on the 4th, failed in consequence of the rapidity with which the rebels fled at the first notice of the approach of danger.

Major- General.
