Report of Maj. John B. Hood, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters Cavalry Camp,
Near Bethel, Va., July 12,1801.
Sir : I have the honor to inform you that I left my camp on yesterday afternoon, at 7 o’clock, with a small force of cavalry, consisting of detachments from Capts. Thos. F. Goode’s, J. C. Phillips’, W. H. Easley’s, R. Douthatt’s, W. Adams’, and W. Johnson’s companies, commanded, respectively, by Captains Goode, Phillips, and Easley, and Lieuts. S. Wilcox, E. O. Fitzgerald, and B. J. Allen, and proceeded to within three miles of Newport News, and went into camp.
About 10 o’clock this morning one of my vedettes reported to me that the enemy were advancing on the Warwick road, and were from seventy-five to one hundred strong. I immediately marched up the road in their rear, and discovered that they were in ambush, ready to receive me, about four miles from Newport News. At that time they opened fire upon my advance, when I ordered Captain Goode’s detachment to dismount, leaving one-fourth of his men with his horses. Captain Phillips, being already on foot, I dismounted myself, and, with the

Sharp’s carbines in the hands of Captain Goode’s men, and a few shotguns in those of Captain Phillips’, together with Colonel Sandidge, of Louisiana, and Mr. Christian, of Alabama, in all not exceeding thirty men, threw a portion as skirmishers in the thick bushes near the road, and drove them from their ambuscade, which occupied some three-fourths of an hour, a brisk lire being kept up all the time.
The enemy having been driven from cover in a very rapid and disorderly flight in the direction of Captain Smith’s house, on the banks of James River, I then ordered a charge, and the detachments of Captain Easley, Lieutenants Wilcox, Fitzgerald, and Allen, together with Mr. Sandidge, jr., and Mr. Terrett, of Louisiana, dashed gallantly down upon them, taking the flying enemy prisoners. Lieutenant Wilcox had his horse shot under him.
During the engagement, which lasted about one hour and a quarter, First Lieut. Oscar V. Heringen, Second Lieut. Frederick Mosebach, and ten privates of the Seventh New York Regiment Qf Volunteers (one of the privates being wounded), surrendered themselves up as prisoners of war, the first lieutenant handing his sword to Captain Phillips. The horse and equipments of the commanding officer were captured by Private Joseph Phillips, of the Old Dominion Dragoons, who was among the first in the charge. A fine mule and cart were also taken. The muskets taken, fourteen in number, are here and ready for use. I had two of the enemy, who were lying near the road, buried, and then returned to my camp. Owing to the dense thicket in which I had the engagement, I am not able to state how strong the enemy were, nor can I tell how many were killed and wounded. I am happy to state, however, that my loss was only one horse.
I cannot mention in too high terms the coolness and true courage of one and all engaged on this occasion.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOHN B. HOOD,
Major, Commanding Cavalry.
Maj. G. B. Cosby,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of YorTctown, Ya.
P. S.—Since writing the above, two deserters from Fort Monroe have been brought in by my vedettes. I send them to you, in charge of an officer and ten men.
Respectfully,	J. B. H.
