No. 3.
)	Clarksburg, Va., July 28, 1861.
Numerous instances of plunder by teamsters in the employment of the TJ. S. Quartermaster’s Department, and others, of citizens along the train routes, having been reported or discovered, it is hereby ordered—
1.	No officer nor soldier, nor person employed in the service of the United States, shall enter the houses or inclosures of inhabitants of Western Virginia without permission from the owners thereof, except in cases of absolute necessity, nor shall they use threats or intimidation to obtain such consent. It is also forbidden to take food, or other property, without absolute necessity, nor then without providing full compensation therefor. Persons violating these prohibitions will be regarded as trespassers and plunderers, and most severely punished.
2.	Commanders of trains, escorts, and troops moving will be held responsible for the observance of these prohibitions by those under their command, and a failure therein, or to report offenders for punishment, will expose them to be tried as participators in the crime. It is earnestly enjoined on all officers to do their utmost to ferret out the perpetrators of outrages on the rights of citizens by persons apparently in Government employ, in order that thieves and plunderers, who follow the Army or attach themselves to it may be prevented from disgracing our arms.
By order of Brigadier-General Rosecrans:

Acting Assistant Adjutant- General.
Adjutant-General’s Office,
Wheeling, Va., July 29, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington :
Sir: I write under the instructions of the governor. During the recent operations of the U. S. troops in Western Virginia quantities of arms, ammunition, and other munitions of war have been captured from the rebels, the greater part of which is the property of this State.
Our people, who are loyal and true to the Government of the Union, are clamorous for the means of defending themselves and vindicating their loyalty. We are unable to comply with their requests, and the governor directs me to ask that the captured arms, ammunition, and camp equipment to which I have referred, if consistent with the paramount interests of the National Government, may be delivered to the authorities of this State.
I am, with respect, your very obedient servant, &e.,
JAMES S. WHEAT,
Adjutant- General.

Leave Cox on the Kanawha for the present if he will consent to stay. Fortify the Gauley as heretofore proposed; also Cheat Mountain, Hut-tonsville, and the West Union road. Bring up to Grafton the stores left by the Pennsylvanians (ordered to Harper’s Ferry), or send a detachment to Cumberland or Piedmont.

Sandy Hook, July 29,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Two Pennsylvania regiments and one Indiana arrived, making nine war regiments now here. In view of our reduced force and the probabilities of attack, which, however uncertain, can not be disregarded, I have placed our force chiefly on the Maryland side. We are too weak to defend, yet so strong as to make retreat across the ford impossible if necessary. Commanding officers unanimous in recommending this movement. We occupy the town and the heights commanding it absolutely, and with our increasing forces and the immediate erection of a temporary bridge we shall be ready for any movement you may order.

Department of the Shenandoah,
HarperJs Ferry, Va., July 29, 1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General, &c.:
Sir: I telegraphed you this morning the position we had taken. Our force was reduced, with the exception of the battery of Major Doubleday, to five or six thousand men. Reports were received constantly of advancing forces of the rebels, and, although proving in the end to be unfounded, we could not disregard them. So strongly did these rumors come to us, that one of the officers on Saturday evening, at 5.30 o’clock, believed that he saw several regiments crossing the Shenandoah above Keys’ Ford. In momentary expectation of attack, with a force wholly incompetent to defend against any considerable number, we were also compelled to recognize the fact that, with our force of six thousand, and the volunteers whose terms were daily expiring, and more than three hundred baggage-wagons, it would be utterly impossible to cross by the ferry without destruction. The ferry was likely to be made impassable by threatened rains. We sent our disposable baggage-wagons across on Saturday. Yesterday we moved the chief part of our troops across, taking a very strong position in Pleasant Valley, a little below Sandy Hook. Our troops still occupy the town, and we planted batteries on the plateau opposite the town, and another on the summit of the Maryland Heights, to which there are good mountain roads. These will make the town of Harper’s Ferry and the Loudoun Heights, on the south of the Shenandoah, absolutely untenable to the enemy, whether in large or small force. We are so placed that we can attack the enemy if he advances, support our batteries if assailed, prevent the occupation of the town by the rebels, and secure against all chances our communication with our lines.

commanding officer agreed in the necessity of this movement. We here have also good opportunity to organize and discipline our forces.
I have thus stated our position fully, that you may be enabled to change it as the public interests may require. With our increasing forces we shall be able to execute any orders that the Commander-in-Ohief may desire at once. I do not apprehend attack immediately, but we are in readiness.
Captain Reynolds, of the Rhode Island Battery, reached us this morning with his men. Captain Tompkins will be at once relieved. We need very much another rifled gun for Major Doubleday’s battery, in return for which we can send, if necessary, one of the 24-pounder guns.
We have no reliable news of the advance of the rebels. There are some five thousand militia at Winchester, with the sick left by Johnston. Indications of movements in the direction of Leesburg seem more important, but yet not decided.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
NATH. P. BANKS, Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, July 29, 1861.
Capt, G. Stoneman:
Sir : In conformity with your request, I transmit an informal statement of the present condition of the artillery south of the Potomac.
Fort Corcoran, above Arlington, with its two redoubts, has an armament of twelve 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, seven 24-pounder barbette guns, two 12-pounder field guns, and two 24-pounder howitzers. About two hundred light artillerists, under Captains Carlisle and Ayres, are at these works; also the German regiment (De Kalb), which has in its ranks many artillerists.
Fort Albany, on the Fairfax road, has eighteen guns, of various caliber (twelve being 24-pounders), Griffin’s and Edwards’ companies light artillery, and a Massachusetts regiment.
Fort Runyon, at the forks of the Alexandria and Fairfax roads (end of Long Bridge), one 30-pounder Parrott rifled gun, eight 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, ten 32-pounders, and four 6-pounder field guns. Garrison—Colonel Rogers’ Twenty-fifth New York: artillery officer in charge—Captain Seymour, Fifth Artillery.
Fort Ellsworth, Alexandria, two 30-pounder and two 10-pounder Parrott rifles, twelve 8-inch sea-coast howitzers, four 24-pounder siege guns, one 24-pounder field howitzer, three 6-pounder guns. Garrison—Captain Arnold’s light company, one hundred and twenty men, and Seventeenth New York, Colonel Lansing.
The supply of ammunition for these forts, although not complete, is sufficient for an emergency, averaging about one hundred rounds per gun, and the amount is being increased as rapidly as possible.
The field batteries are in a very unsatisfactory condition, many of them, but as fast as the materials can be procured they are refitting.
Platt has four light 12-pounders, 107 men, in good condition; Tidball has two 6-pounders, two 12-pounder howitzers, 127 men, in good condition 5 Greene has four Parrott 10-pounders, rifled, 130 men, in good condition ) Carlisle has 100 men, no guns; Arnold has 120 men, no guns; Ayres has two 6-pounders, two 12-pounder howitzers, 120 men $ Ed-

wards has two 10-pounder Parrott guns, 75 men $ Griffin has one 10-pounder, rifled, 120 men.
Platt and Griffin are to have two additional light 12-pounders each. They will soon be ready for issue from the arsenal. There are five 10-pounder rifles now preparing. Three will be given to Griffin and two to Tidball, and others are being prepared for issue. When the guns, howitzers, &c., are received, the batteries will be composed as follows: Platt, six light 12-pounders; Tidball, Greene, and Ayres, four 10-pounder Parrotts and two 12-pounder howitzers each; Carlisle and Edwards, two 20-pounder Parrotts and two 24-pounder howitzers each; Griffin, four 10-pounder Parrotts and two light 12-pounders; Arnold, four 6-pounder guns and two 12-pounder howitzers.
I further propose to equip Captain Bookwood’s company, of Yon Stein wehr’s German regiment, with four 6-pounder guns and two 12-pounder howitzers. Captain Bookwood brought off the Yarian battery from the field—that is, the guns and one caisson—when that battery was abandoned by its company. His company has a number of German artillerists, and he can easily fill up with instructed men from the brigade of German regiments (Blenker’s) to which I propose the battery be attached.
The German regiments contain a number of artillery officers and soldiers. I suggested the propriety of placing, for the present at least, those regiments in the forts, that the guns may be served by drafts from the instructed men. One company, Captain Morozowicz’s, of the De Kalb regiment, is composed almost exclusively of old German artillery soldiers, and should there be a lack of field artillery, could readily be made available.
Respectfully, &c.,
HEKRY J. HUNT, Brevet Major, and Chief of Artillery.
General Orders, ) Hdqrs. Division of the Potomac,
Ko. 2.	)	Washington, July 30,1861.
The general commanding the division has, with much regret, observed that large numbers of officers and men stationed in the vicinity of Washington are in the habit of frequenting the streets and hotels of the city.
This practice is eminently prejudicial to good order and military discipline, and must at once be discontinued.
The time and services of all persons connected with this division should be devoted to their appropriate duties with their respective commands. It is therefore directed that hereafter no officer or soldier be allowed to absent himself from his camp and visit Washington, except for the performance of some public duty, or for the transaction of important private business, for which purposes written permits will be given by the commanders of brigades. The permit will state the object of the visit.
Brigade commanders will be held responsible for the strict execution of this order.
Col. Andrew Porter, Sixteenth IT. S. Infantry, is detailed for temporary duty as provost-marshal in Washington, and will be obeyed and respected accordingly.
Colonel Porter will report in person at these headquarters for instructions.

Col. E. D. Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen., Washington, D. C. :
Dear Sir : It becomes necessary, with the increase of our stores at this post and the probabilities of the removal of supplies from Hagerstown, to obtain a secure position for a general depot for the army supplies and for hospital uses. I believe, from careful inquiry and examination, that the city of Frederick offers more advantages than any other point. It is equally central for all points (Baltimore or Harper’s Ferry); is sufficiently removed from the river to be safe from marauding parties, and has the best railroad facilities in every direction. The presence of a regiment there would have a most excellent effect.
At Sandy Hook there are not buildings sufficient, and the strip of land between the heights and river has not capacity, being in part occupied by canal, railroad, and highway, to admit of the erection of proper structures. It is also greatly exposed from the heights on the Virginia side.
At Frederick there are sufficient room, buildings, protection, &c. As it has recently been embraced in the Department of Washington, it becomes necessary that we should obtain consent of the Department for the transfer.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
NATH. P. BANKS, Major-General, Commanding, &c.
Headquarters Department of Maryland,
Fort McHenry, July 31,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War :
Sir : Mr. John T. Sangston, of Caroline County, is desirous that a company of Union men in that county, who have been drilling for several months, should be armed. Governor Hicks thinks it important, and I concur with him. If I had the authority to arm eight or ten companies on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, I believe they could take care of themselves and do much to keep the secessionists in order. I think it proper to add that an active trade with the rebels in Virginia is kept up from Salisbury, the southern terminus of the Delaware Bailroad. As soon as there is a disposable force, it would be well to place a regiment there.
There is a camp of secessionists, variously estimated from one thousand to three thousand men, at Eastville, in Northampton, the lower county on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. This is not in my department, but I would suggest that three or four regiments should be sent there as soon as we can spare them and break up this camp. The exhibition of such a force and the destruction of the secession camp would have a salutary effect throughout the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia.
I have the honor to be, respectfully, yours,
JOHN A. DIX,

Division Headquarters, jHarper’s Ferry, Va., April 21, 1861. General Wm, H. Richardson, Adjutant-General:
Dear Sir : My present force here is about two thousand. I have endeavored to-day to get up a consolidated report of the strength and condition of my command, but defer it on account of imperfectness in the returns.
I have effected an understanding with the Maryland authorities. They are pledged to report to me any hostile approach through their territory, and consent to the occupancy of the heights commanding my position whenever necessity requires it. I have guarded all the approaches east and west, and established telegraphic communications, to guard against surprise.
The work of forwarding to Winchester uncompleted arms and machinery progresses rapidly. The arrangements for this branch of my duties are so nearly completed, that I hope to give more of my attention to the military command. From necessity I have had to devolve many of the details upon General Carson. I have had to assume heavy responsibilities, and felt some embarrassment in the absence of all written instructions. The troops assembled without ammunition, generally, and, there being little here, I have had to send abroad for it.
Not being informed of the troops ordered into service, I have, so far, received all which were presented. General Meem, of the Seventh Brigade, reports for duty, as he states, upon verbal orders, received through Colonel Crump, from the governor. This presents some difficulty. I see no reason for the employment of three brigadier-generals for such a force ; but, not being informed of the number of troops ordered to this point, I of course recognize him. General Carson’s brigade has reported to-day ,• numbers six hundred and fifty-five. General

About one hundred and fifty, however, of the troops included in General Harman’s command belong properly to that of General Meem’s. The times are exciting) but, if possible, I would be glad to receive some written instructions from you. I expect, from news just received, an additional force to-morrow of five hundred men. If needed, I could have thousands. Not knowing, however, the extent of your orders, I have concluded to u trust in God and keep my powder dry.”

We are the bearers of a letter to you from General Steuart, of Maryland, and we regret, on arriving here, to find you absent. The letter referred to we forward to you in a separate inclosure, to the care of the governor of the State of Virginia. We left Baltimore by way of Ellicott’s Mills, the cars having been stopped, on yesterday at 3 p. m., and reached Washington at 2 a. m. The people of Baltimore, and, indeed, the citizens of Maryland generally, are united in one thing at least, viz, that troops volunteering for Federal service against Virginia and other sister Southern States shall not, if they can help it, pass over the soil of Maryland. We have desired to have an interview with the colonel in command at this point, but find him too unwell to be seen. General Steuart will be most anxious to hear from you immediately.
Respectfully,

P. S.—I am authorized to say to you by Maj. Montgomery D. Corse, commander of the Alexandria battalion, that if you or the governor desire to communicate with General Steuart or the authorities of Maryland, any dispatch directed to them, to his care, at this point, will be forwarded by horse express across the country immediately.

to secure all the efficient arms here, and remove the machinery in such a manner as that it may be readily put together again, as well as all the unfinished guns, but to have an inventory made of the public propel, so that the officers charged with the details may be held to proper account. Of course I could do no more than adopt such general directions of military affairs as were important for the security of my position—the details being left to the ranking brigadier-general (Carson). I am now though this terrible pressure, however, in regard to the public property, and intend to assume at once the active military command. I have now about twenty-four hundred men here. Not knowing what troops you ordered, I have received all which offered. The hourly telegraphic dispatches sent in are exciting; but I feel calm, as I have taken adequate measures to guard against surprise. Some here, who do not know, no doubt think I am rather incredulous as regards their information. But trust me; I am well posted, and shall be found ready. The responsibilities assumed by me, under the circumstances in which I was placed, have been heavy; but the exigencies were pressing, and I rest with confidence on the record of my proceedings for full vindication of all my acts. If man could have effected more, then I am willing to be condemned.
From the information I have of the condition of the guns in progress of manufacture, there are components to fit up readily for use from seven to ten thousand stand of arms, exclusive of those rescued uninjured from the flames. I have employed artificers to put these together, and am turning out daily several hundred minnie muskets. You must sustain me. I am wholly unprovided with funds. I can get them from the Winchester banks, if you will give authority. You may judge of the state of things here when I say even Virginia money will procure nothing, but at an enormous discount, in the stores of the place.
With sincere regard, yours,
