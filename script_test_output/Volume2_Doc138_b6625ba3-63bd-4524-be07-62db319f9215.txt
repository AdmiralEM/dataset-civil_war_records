Instructions to Col. John II. Kenly, First Maryland Infantry..
Headquarters Department op Annapolis,
June 27,1861.
Sir : My attention has been called to a resolution purporting to have been this day passed by the late board of police commissioners, expressing the opinion that u the suspension of their functions suspended at the same time the operations of the police law, and puts the officers and men off duty for the present.”
You will take special notice, sir, that by my proclamation of this day neither the law, nor the officers appointed to execute the laws, are affected in any manner whatever, except as it operates upon the members of the board of commissioners and chief of police, whose functions were and are suspended. Every part of the police law is to be enforced by you, except that which refers to the authority of the commissioners and chief of police 5 and every officer and man, with the exception of those persons above named, will be continued in service by you, and in the positions they now occupy, and with the advantages they now receive, unless one or more shall refuse to discharge their duties.
If any police officer declines to perform his duty, in order to avoid the anarchy which it was the purpose of the commissioners to bring upon the city by incorrectly stating that it had been by my act deprived of its police protection, you will select, in conference with such of the public authorities as will aid you, good men and true to fill their places and discharge their duties.
You will also take especial notice that no opinion, resolution, or other act of the late board of commissioners can operate to limit the effective

force of the police law, or to discharge any officer engaged in its execution. If any provision of the law fails to be executed, it will be from the choice of the city$ and if any officer, except such as are herein named, leave the service, it will be upon his own decision.
You will cause these views to be made known as the rule of your conduct.	»
I repeat my declaration and my purpose: No intervention with the laws or government of the city whatever is intended, except to prevent secret, violent, and treasonable combinations of disloyal men against the Government of the United States.
I am, sir, truly, yours, &c.,
HATH. P. BANKS.
Colonel Kenly, Provost-Marshal.

MEETING- OF THE POLICE BOARD.
Matters being thus arranged, the board of police commissioners went into secret session. The result of their deliberation was embodied in the following preamble and resolutions:
Whereas the laws of the State of Maryland give the whole and exclusive control of the police force of the city to the hoard of police, organized and appointed by the general assembly, and not only are said board bound to exercise the powers in and to discharge the duties imposed upon them, but all other persons are positively prohibited, under heavy penalties, from interfering with them in so doing; and
Whereas there is no power given to the board to transfer the control of any portion of the police force to any person or persons whomsoever other than the officers of police appointed by them, in pursuance of the express provisions of the law, and under their orders; and
Whereas, by order of Major-General Banks, an officer of the IJ. S. Army, commanding in this city, the marshal of police has been arrested, the board of police superseded, and an officer of the Army has been appointed provost-marshal, and directed to assume the command and control of the police force of this city: Therefore, be it
Resolved, That this board do solemnly protest against the orders and proceedings above referred to of Major-General Banks as an arbitrary exercise of military power, not warranted by any provision of the Constitution or laws of the United States or of the State of Maryland, but in derogation of all of them.
Resolved, That whilst the board, yielding to the force of circumstances, will do nothing to increase the present excitement or obstruct the execution of such measures as Major-General Banks may deem jnoper to take on his own responsibility for the preservation of the peace of "the city and of public order, they cannot consistently with their views of official duty and of obligation to their oaths of office recognize the right of any of the officers and men of the police force as such to receive orders or directions from any other authority than from this board.
Resolved, That, in the opinion of the board, the forcible suspension of their functions suspends at the same time the active operation of the police law, and puts the officers and men off duty for the present; leaving them subject, however, to the rules and regulations of the service as to their personal conduct and deportment, and to the orders which this board may see fit hereafter to issue when the present illegal suspension of their functions shall be removed.
[Signed by all the board.]
In conformity with these resolves, the board summoned the different police captains, and informed them that they had concluded to disband the police force, and through the captains the men were informed of this intention. They accordingly vacated the station-houses, and divested themselves of the insignia of office.

Report of the Board of Police Commissioners.
Fort McHenry, July 29,1861. To the honorable the General Assembly of Maryland:
The undersigned, commissioners of police of the city of Baltimore, have the honor respectfully to report: That from the date of their report made to your honorable body in May last they continued faithfully to discharge the duties imposed on them by the laws of the State until Thursday morning, the 27th of June. At an early hour on that day Col. George P. Kane, the marshal of police, was arrested at his residence by a body of military, acting under the orders of Major-General Banks, in the service of the United States, and was taken to Fort McHenry, where he is still confined. A few hours afterwards the board were called upon by Colonel Kenly, who read to them an order of General Banks, appointing him provost-marshal, and a proclamation by the same officer, announcing to the citizens of Baltimore that the marshal of police had been arrested and that the official authority of the board of police was u superseded.”
The commissioners of police, having maturely considered their duties and obligations under the law by which they held their appointments, could not avoid the conclusion that such action on the part of an officer of the General Government, who, in point of fact, held at the time military possession of the city of Baltimore, at once suspended the active operation of the police law, and put for the time off duty albthe officers and men who could not, without directly violating both the letter and spirit of the law, recognize the authority or be subject to the control of any other head than the board of police.
Accordingly the board unanimously adopted a resolution to that effect.
On the following Monday morning, the 1st of July, about the hour of 3 o’clock, all the members of the board, with the exception of the mayor, were arrested in like manner by order of General Banks, at their respective residences, and taken to Fort McHenry. One of them, Mr. 0. D. Hinks, was, after a fewT days’ confinement, allowed to return to his own house on parole, upon the representations of his physicians that owing to his state of ill health his life would be seriously endangered by a continuance of his imprisonment. The other commissioners, Messrs. Howard, Gatchell, and Davis, constituting a majority of the whole board, have ever since been confined in Fort McHenry; but they have this morning been officially notified that they are to be removed on the steamer Adelaide to some other place at 6 o’clock this evening.
The undersigned, Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, and John W. Davis, further respectfully report that, being deprived of their liberty without legal process, and the courts of justice, as v^ell of the United States as of the State of Maryland, being prevented by the military power of the former from affording them any relief, they addressed to the Congress of the United States a memorial asking that any charges made against them might be speedily investigated, and that the grievances of which they complain might be properly redressed.
To that memorial were appended copies of the twro proclamations issued by General Banks in reference to the board of police, and of the preamble and resolutions adopted by the board in reference to the first of said proclamations.
The undersigned respectfully ask leave to submit herewith, as a part of this report, copies of the above-mentioned memorial to Congress
