Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Entered and passed through this place to-day in hot pursuit of the enemy. The Army was welcomed with enthusiasm by the mass of the population, gratified by the protection promised and now given by the Government. The force we scattered yesterday was thirty-five hundred strong, and their loss about sixty killed. It rallied, and presented front to-day, but again retreated to a point seven miles from here, where they have been re-enforced by a party under Colonel Bee, claimed in all to be thirty thousand; in reality, thirteen thousand.
I have ordered the Bhode Island Battery to come up from Williamsport with a provision train on the 5th. Humor indicates Colonel Stone as approaching by way of Harper’s Ferry. My post-office is Hagerstown, unless the Government re-establishes the mail route.
B. PATTEBSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Martinsburg, Ya., July 4, 1861.
Sir : I avail myself of a favorable opportunity hastily to mlorm you of my arrival at this place, with no opposition of any character since the 2d instant, but with a warm welcome from the populace. The rebel cavalry retired from the town as the command entered, and scattered in several directions. The infantry and artillery retired towards Winchester.
I have halted temporarily to bring up supplies, which will be here to morrow, having to-day returned all my wagons for the purpose. Pro-

visions in this part of the country are limited, and consequently with my present transportation I can advance but a short distance before I am compelled to halt. As soon as provisions arrive I shall advance to Winchester to drive the enemy from that place, if any remain. I then design to move towards Charlestown, to which point I believe Colonel Stone is advancing, and, if I find it not hazardous, to continue to Leesburg. I must do this or abandon the country, by retiring the way I ■ came, in consequence of the term of the three months’ volunteers being I'about to expire. They will not, in any number, renew their service, f though I think the offer should be made.
The Union sentiment here is apparently very strong, but many fear a reverse, and that this force will retire, either voluntarily or forcibly. The people cannot be made use of to raise a force for self-defense unless supported by a strong force of U. S. troops.
I desire to be informed of the wish of the General-in-Chief in regard to the continued occupation of this region. I have ordered up all force in the rear, except the Connecticut regiment, five companies of which are stationed at each of the depots, Williamsport and Hagerstown. The Ehode Island Battery and the Thirteenth Pennsylvania Volunteers join me to-night.

You will have to provide transportation for them thence to the post you may order them to. If any three-monthsr men will re-engage for the long term, designate a Regular officer of your command to muster them, provided a sufficient number to form a regiment can be obtained. Having defeated the enemy, if you can continue the pursuit without too great hazard, advance via Leesburg (or Strasburg} towards Alexandria; but consider the dangerous defiles, especially via Strasburg, and move with great caution, halting at Winchester and threatening a movement by Strasburg; or the passage of the Potomae twice, and coming down by Leesburg, may be the more advantageous-movement.

I know you will appreciate the motive which prompts me to urge this request, and pardon my importunity. The insurgents have unquestionably received large re-enforcements, and are said to have twenty-six thousand, with twenty-four guns, many rifled, and some of very large caliber.

(Similar dispatch to McClellan.)
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Martinsburg, Yan July 6, 1861.
Sir : I telegraphed my intention to cross the Potomac on the 1st instant. I now have the honor to report my movements since that date.
I left Hagerstown on the afternoon of the 30th ultimo, the earliest day my command could take the field in a proper condition for active service, intending the following morning to enter Virginia with two columns at Darn No. 4 and Williamsport, to be united the same day at Hainesville, the known location of the rebels. Owing to the danger and difficulty attending the fording at Dam No. 4,1 placed all the force at Williamsport. My order of march for the 2d instant is given in the accompanying circular.
The advance crossed the Potomac at 4 a. m., all taking the main road to Martinsburg, with the exception of Negley’s brigade, which, about one mile from the ford, diverged to the right, to meet the enemy should he come from Hedgesville, to guard our right, and to rejoin at Hainesville. About five miles from the ford the skirmishers in front and on the flank suddenly became engaged with the enemy, posted in a clump of trees. At the same time their main force appeared in front, sheltered by fences, timber and houses. Abercrombie immediately deployed his regiments (First Wisconsin and Eleventh Pennsylvania) on each side of the road, placed Hudson’s section, supported by the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry, in the road, and advanced to the attack against a warm fire before him. The enemy, being supported by artillery, resisted for twenty-five minutes with much determination. Lieutenant Hudson after getting into position soon silenced their guns.
In the mean time Thomas’ brigade rapidly advanced, and deployed to the left to turn the right flank of the enemy. The enemy, seeing this movement, and being pressed by Abercrombie, retired, hotly pursued for four miles by artillery and infantry. The cavalry could not be employed, on account of numerous fences and walls crossing the country.
In the enemy’s camp were found camp equipage, provisions, grain, &c. This brush was highly creditable to our arms, winning as we did the day against a foe superior in number to those engaged on our side. They were well posted, sheltered by timber, and sustained by artillery and cavalry. Our men advanced over open ground against a warm fire of artillery and infantry. I present the reports of Colonels Abercrombie and Thomas and Lieutenants Perkins and Hudson, and take much pleasure in bearing testimony as an eye-witness to the admirable manner in which their commands were handled and their commendations earned.
I also bear testimony to efficient service in posting portions of the troops and conducting them to the front and into action rendered by the members of my staff present on the field of battle—Col. F. J. Porter, Capt. John Newton, and Lieutenant Babcock, and Majors Price and Biddle—who were employed conveying orders) also Surgeon Tripler in attention to the wounded.

Sir: Besides Colonel Wallace’s regiment, and Colonel Stone’s three regiments and a half, there are now en route) or under orders to join you as soon as practicable, two regiments from Madison, Wis., one regiment (to start to-morrow) from Boston, and four New York regiments from this city; two of the latter went by rail yesterday, and two go to-day. All these regiments are directed to Williamsport, that being the most convenient point in regard to transportation of supplies, &c. General Sandford (a major-general of twenty-five years’ standing), in tho best possible spirit, volunteered to go, with two of his most efficient regiments, to assist you. The General-in-Chief desires you to make up for him a suitable command, and to employ him as he desires, for the good of the service. You will find him worthy of your best respect and attentions.
As you were informed by telegraph this morning, Governor Curtin has been requested, with the sanction of the Secretary of War, to order two regiments of State troops to hold Cumberland for the present; which regiments are instructed to obey you or (in an extreme case) any orders they may receive from General McClellan.
The General desires me to add that, waiting for horses, we cannot yet say on what day we shall be able to attack the enemy in the direction of Manassas Junction. We hope, however, to be ready before the end of this week.

Your two Pennsylvania regiments have been ordered to Cumberland, and placed under the orders of General Patterson, who directs you to hold that place and protect the people of the country, but unless threatened, to make no aggressive movement into Virginia without strong inducements and certainty of success.
If your judgment approves, occupy Piedmont, and be governed in your policy by instructions given Colonel Wallace, a copy of which will go to vou.
F. J. PORTER,
Assistant Adjutant- General.
Martinsburg, Va., July 9,1861.
Colonel : I have received the telegrams of the General-in-Chief, notifying me of the additional regiments sent me. Colonel Stone and the Nineteenth and Twenty-eighth New York Regiments arrived yesterday. General Sandford, with the Fifth and Twelfth New York Regiments, will join to-morrow. Since I last addressed you I have made no movements—in fact, have been prevented by the necessity of sending all my wagons to the rear to obtain provisions for a few days in advance and to bring up troops. The commissary has supplies (with those in hands of troops) for about ten days. Though the quartermaster has spared no exertion, and his agents have been very active, he has not as yet been able to provide a supply train for the command. I am therefore much restricted in my movements, being compelled, after three days* advance, to send back for provisions. The difficulty will increase as I advance; indeed, I am now almost at a stand. Instead of receiving aid from the inhabitants, I find myself in an enemy’s country, where our opponents can procure supplies and we nothing, except by seizure. Even information is studiously kept from us. Supplies, especially provisions, are very scarce, and not even one day’s rations can be relied upon. The supply of grain also is very limited. Under these circumstances I respectfully present to the General-in-Chief the following plan, which, with my present views, I desire to carry into operation so soon as I can do so with safety and the necessity of following Johnston ceases:
I propose to move this force to Charlestown, from which point I can move easily, strike at Winchester, march to Leesburg when necessary,

and open communication to a depot to be established at Harper’s Ferry, and occupy the main avenue of supply to the enemy. My base will then be some seven miles nearer, more easily reached by road, and my lino of communication rendered more secure than at present. I can establish communication with the Maryland shore by a bridge of boats. In this way I can more easily approach you, and the movement, I think, will tend to relieve Leesburg and vicinity of some of its oppressors. My present location is a very bad one in a military point of view, and from it I cannot move a portion of the force without exposing that of what remains to be cut off.
General Sandford informs me by letter that he has for me a letter from you. I hope it will inform me when you will put your column in motion against Manassas and when you wish me to strike. The enemy retired in succession from Darkesville and Bunker Hill to Stephenson’s Station, a few miles from Winchester. There he has halted, and report says is intrenching. His design evidently is to draw this force on as far as possible from the base, and then to cut my line or to attack with large re-enforcements from Manassas.
As I have already stated, I cannot advance far, and if I could I think the movement very imprudent. When you make your attack I expect to advance and offer battle. If the enemy retires I shall not pursue. I am very desirous to know when the General-in-Chief wishes me to approach Leesburg. If the notice does not come in any other way, I wish you would indicate the day by telegraph, thus: “Let me hear of you on-----.”
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Martinsburg, July 9,1861.
Colonel Crosman, quartermaster, thought 900 wagons would be sufficient to furnish subsistence and to transport ammunition to our present force. Tlie calculation for the original column was 700 wagons, of which 500 were on hand and 200 expected. The great difficulty will be toj obtain forage for the animals, the present consumption being twenty-six* tons daily.
Captain Beckwith, commissary: The question of subsistence is here a question of transportation. Thus far no reliance has been placed on the adjacent country. A day’s march ahead would compel a resort to it. As far as known, those supplies would be quite inadequate.

Captain Simpson, Topographical Engineers: The difficulty of our present position arises from the great facility the enemy has to concentrate troops at Winchester from Manassas Junction. By the railroad 12,000 men could he sent there in a day, and again sent back to Manassas. Our forces should combine with the forces at Washington.
Captain Newton, Engineers: Our present position is a very exposed one. General Johnston can keep us where we are as long as he pleases, and at any time make a demonstration on our rear. Our whole line is a false one. We have no business here except for the purpose of making a demonstration. He threatens us now. We should be in a position to threaten him. We should go to Charlestown, Harper’s Ferry, Shepherdstown, and flank him.
Colonel Stone : It is mainly a question for the staff. Our enemy has great facility of movement, and to extend our line would be accompanied with great danger. Johnston should be threatened from some other point. We might leave two regiments here, two guns at Shep-JUerdstown, and proceed to Charlestown, and threaten from that point. /General Negeey: Ditto to Captain Newton.
Colonel Thomas : Approves of a flank movement to Charlestown.

Washington, July 11,1861. Maj. Gen. Patterson, Martinsburg, Va.:
The author of the following is known, and he believes it authentic:
Washington, July 9,1861.
The plan of operations of the secession army in Virginia contemplates the reverse of the proceedings and movements announced in the Express of yesterday and Saturday. A schedule that has come to light meditates a stand and an engagement by Johnston when he shall have drawn Patterson sufficiently far hack from the river to render impossible his retreat across it on being vanquished, and an advance then by Johnston and Wise conjointly upon McClellan, and after the conquest of him, a march in this direction, to unite in one attack upon the Federal forces across the Potomac with the army under Beauregard at Manassas Junction and the wing of that army, the South Carolina regiments chiefly, now nine miles from Alexandria. Success in each of these three several movements is anticipated, and thereby not only the possession of the capital is thought to he assured, hut an advance of the Federal troops upon Richmond prevented.
The plan supposes that this success will give the Confederate cause such prestige and inspire in it such faith as will insure the recognition of its Government abroad, and at the same time so impair confidence in the Federal Government as to render it impossible for it to procure loans abroad, and very difficult for it to raise means at home.
Real retreats, which have been anticipated, it will be seen, are by this plan altogether ignored. According to it, fighting and conquest are the orders.
W. SCOTT.

Dispatch of 11th received and confirms my impression expressed on 9th instant.

through Charlestown, over a good road. My depot will be better secured, more convenient, nearer, and line better'protected. I cannot now bring from Hagerstown, with present means of transportation, an ample supply of provisions for active operations. I can from Harper’s Ferry. I send to Hagerstown an officer to commence to-day the transfer, if assent be given, and I wish an answer to-day. Defeat here is ruin everywhere. I consider a regiment of regulars, and more, if possible, essential to give steadiness to my column and to carry on active operations against a determined opposition, and I urge that my three-months’ volunteers be replaced by three-years’ men. Many of them are barefooted and cannot be employed for active service. They can be made useful until their term expires for this transfer of depot. Many three-months’ men refuse to renew their service. The enemy have retired beyond Winchester, and are said to be fortifying.
R. PATTERSON,
Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, July 12,1861—1.30 p. m.
Major-General Patterson :
Go where you propose in your letter of the 9th instant. Should that movement cause the enemy to retreat upon Manassas via Strasburg, to follow him would seem at this distance hazardous, whereas the route from Charlestown, via Key’s Ferry, Hillsborough, and Leesburg, towards Alexandria, with the use of the canal on the other side of the river for heavy transportation, may be practicable. Consider this suggestion well, and, except in an extreme case, do not recross the Potomac with more than a sufficient detachment for your supplies on the canal.
Let me hear of you on Tuesday. Write often when en route.

Martinsburg, July 13,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General :
McClellan’s victory received here with great joy; received without comment from the General-in-Chief. I have given and now give mine. My column must be preserved to insure to the country the fruits of this and other victories, which we hope will follow. My determination is not changed by this news. I would rather lose the chance of accomplishing something brilliant than, by hazarding this column, to destroy the fruits of the campaign to the country by defeat. If wrong, let me be instructed.

Received the announcement of McClellan’s victory with great gratification. His success, however, makes no change in my plans. This force is the keystone of the combined movements, and injury to it would counteract the good effects of all victories elsewhere. Johnston is in position beyond Winchester, to be re-enforced, and his strength doubled just as I would reach him. My position is a strong one, but I must act cautiously whilst preparing to strike.

To-morrow I advance to Bunker Hill, preparatory to the other movement. If an opportunity offers, I shall attack; but unless I can rout, shall be careful not to set him in full retreat upon Strasburg. I have arranged for the occupation of Harper’s Ferry, opposite which point I have directed provisions to be sent.
Many of the three months’ volunteers are very restless at the prospect of being retained over their time. This fact will cause you to hear from me in the direction of Charlestown. Want of ample transportation for supplies and baggage has prevented my moving earlier in the direction I desired.

I send you a sketch,* prepared by Captain Simpson, of the works said to have been erected in the vicinity of Winchester.
I shall (preparations already commenced) hold and occupy Harper’s Ferry with the three years’ troops. If the General-in-Chief desires to retain that place (and I advise it never to be evacuated), I desire to be informed at once by telegraph.
I have to report that the term of service of a very large portion of this force will expire in a few days. From an undercurrent expression of feeling I am confident that many will be inclined to lay down their arms the day the term expires. With such a feeling existing any active operations towards Winchester cannot be thought of until they are replaced by three years’ men. Those whose terms will expire this week I shall arrange to send off by Harper’s Ferry—those for Philadelphia via Baltimore and those for Harrisburg via Hagerstown.
If Harper’s Ferry is to be held, after securing that I shall, if the General-in-Chief desires, advance with the remainder of the troops via Leesburg, provided the force under Johnston does not remain at Winchester, after the success which I anticipate from General McDowell. I wish to be advised if these propositions meet with the approval of the General-in-Chief.
The Wisconsin regiments are without arms and accouterments, which I have directed the commander of Frankford Arsenal to provide. Telegrams will reach me via Hagerstown and also via Point of Rocks.

Telegraph of to day received. The enemy has stolen no march upon me. I have kept him actively employed, and by threats and reconnaissances in force caused him to be re-enforced. I have accomplished in this respect more than the General-in-Chief asked or could well be expected, in face of an enemy far superior in numbers, with no line of communication to protect. Our future post-office, Sandy Hook.

I have succeeded, in accordance with the wishes of the General-in-Chief, in keeping General Johnston’s force at Winchester. A reconnaissance in force on Tuesday caused him to be largely re-enforced from Strasburg.
With the existing feeling and determination of the three months’ men to return home, it would be ruinous to advance, or even to stay here,

without immediate increase of force to replace them. They will not remain.
I have ordered the brigades to assemble this afternoon, and shall make a personal appeal to the troops to stay a few days until I can be re-enforced. Many of the regiments are without shoes) the Government refuses to furnish them; the men have received no pay, and neither officers nor soldiers have money to purchase with. Under these circumstances, I cannot ask or expect the three months’ volunteers to stay longer than one week. Two companies of Pennsylvania volunteers were discharged to day and ordered home. I to-day place additional force at Harper’s Ferry, and establish communication with Maryland.
I send Captain Newton to prepare for its defense.
E. PATTEESON, Major-General, Commanding.
(Eepeated same day.)
Charlestown, Ya., July 18, 1861.
Colonel: I arrived at this place on the 17th instant. Nothing of importance occurred on the march. The principal inhabitants left some ten days since, anticipating its occupation by the Federal troops. It was till our arrival the location of a band of secession militia, engaged in pressing into service the young men of the country.
I have to acknowledge the receipt of two telegrams from the General-in-Chief of the 17th and 18th instants, both looking to a movement and attack upon Winchester. A state of affairs existed which the General-in-Chief is not aware of, though in some respects anticipated by his instructions that if I found the enemy too strong to attack, to threaten and make demonstrations to retain him at Winchester. I more than carried out the wishes of the General-in-Chief in this respect.
Before I left Martinsburg I was informed of a large increase to Johnston’s command, and the visit to Winchester of the leading members of the Confederate Army. Just before General McDowell was to strike I advanced to Bunker Hill, causing surprise, and, I have since learned, an additional increase of force.
On Tuesday I sent out a reconnoitering party toward Winchester. It drove in the enemy’s pickets, and caused the army to be formed in line of battle, anticipating an attack from my main force. This party found the road barricaded and blocked by fallen trees. The following day I left for this place.
Before marching from Martinsburg I heard of the mutterings of many of the volunteer regiments, and their expressed determination not to serve one hour after their term of service should expire. I anticipated a better expression of opinion as we approached the enemy, and hoped to hear of a willingness to remain a week or ten days. I was disappointed, and when I prepared for a movement to the front, by an order for the men to carry two days’ provisions in their haversacks, I was assailed by earnest remonstrances against being detained over their time—complaints from officers of want of shoes and other clothing—all throwing obstacles in the way of active operations. Indeed, I found I should, if I took Winchester, be without men, and be forced to retreat, and thus lose the fruits of victory. Under the circumstances neither I nor those on whom I could rely could advance with any confidence. I am, therefore, now here with a force which will be dwindling away very rapidly. I to-day appealed almost in vain to the regiments

to stand by the country for a week or ten days. The men are longing for their homes, and nothing can detain them.
I sent Captain Newton to-day to Harper’s Ferry to arrange for defense and re-establish communication with Maryland; also, the Massachusetts regiment. The Third Wisconsin will soon be there. Lieutenant Babcock has been at Sandy Hook several days, trying to get the canal in operation, preparing the entrance to ford, putting in operation a ferry, and reconstructing the bridge. Depots for all supplies will soon be established, and then I shall cause to be turned in the camp equipage, &c., of the regiments, and to that place I shall withdraw if I find my force so small as to render my present position unsafe. I cannot intrench sufficiently to defend this place against a large force.
I shall direct the regiments to be sent to Harrisburg and Philadelphia to be mustered out by Captain Hastings, Major Ruff, and Captain Wharton.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON', Major-General, Commanding.
Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Z7. 8. Army, Washington City.
Charlestown, Ya., July 19,1861. Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington City:
Almost all the three-months’ volunteers refuse to serve an hour over their term, and except three regiments which will stay ten days the most of them are without shoes and without pants. I am compelled to send them home, many of them at once. Some go to Harrisburg, some to Philadelphia, one to Indiana, and if not otherwise directed by telegraph, I shall send them to the place of muster, to which I request rolls may be sent, and Captain Hastings, Major Ruff, and Captain Wharton ordered to muster them out. They cannot march, and unless a paymaster goes to them, they will be indecently clad and have just cause of complaint.

Major- General, Commanding.
Charlestown, July 19,1861. Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, Commanding:
General : The delay incident even to telegraphic communication, and to the importance of retaining this line, induces me to dispatch my aide-de-camp, Major Russell, who will inform you fully as to my position, and take your directions.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, vour obedient servant,

home to-morrow; others follow Immediately. The enemy, from last information, are still at Winchester, and being re-enforced every night. I have asked Postmaster-General to establish post-office at Harper’s Ferrv. There is none at Sandy Hook.
B. PATTEBSON,
Major- General.
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Charlestown, Va., July 19, 1861.
Colonel: In reply to your communication of yesterday* the commanding general directs me to say that there is no intention or desire to retain the regiment beyond their term of service against the will of the members. He, however, earnestly desires and appeals to the regiment to remain a short time over its term, to enable him to relieve it without the great injury to the service resulting from the loss of a large and valuable portion of this command. The sudden depletion of this force jeopardizes its safety and the interest of the country, which your regiment came out to defend, and have nobly sustained. In his appeal now to the brave he feels that sacrifices will be made till this place can be safely held and this force not be compelled to retire. Be-enforcements are promised and daily expected, and as rapidly as he can relieve every regiment which desires to go he will do so. He knows, too, that as long as danger threatens the regiment will not leave. Can you give him assurances they will remain till he can safely relieve them, which he thinks cannot exceed ten days, and may be much less ?
I am, sir, very respectfullv, vour obedient servant,
F. J. POBTEB, Assistant Adjutant-General.
