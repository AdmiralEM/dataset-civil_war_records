No. 2.
Report of Lieut Charles IL Tompkins, Second TJ. S. Cavalry.
Camp Union, Va., June 1,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report, pursuant to verbal instructions received from the colonel commanding, that I left this camp on the evening of the 31st May in command of a detachment of Company B Second Cavalry, consisting of fifty men, with Second Lieut. David S. Gordon, Second Dragoons, temporarily attached, for the purpose of reconnoiter-ing the country in the vicinity of Fairfax Court-House. Upon approaching the town the picket guard was surprised and captured. Several documents were found on their persons, which I herewith inclose. On entering the town of Fairfax my command was fired upon by the rebel troops from the windows and house-tops. Charged on a company of mounted rifles, and succeeded in driving them from the town. Immediately two or three additional companies came up to their relief, who immediately commenced firing upon us, which fire I again returned. Perceiving that I was largely outnumbered, I deemed it advisable to retreat, which I did in good order, taking five prisoners, fully armed and equipped, and two horses. Nine horses were lost during the engagement and four wounded. The force actually engaged at the commencement of the engagement were two companies of cavalry and one rifle company, but re-enforcements coming in from camps adjacent to the court-house, which I have from reliable authority, increased their force to upwards of 1,000 men. Twenty-five of the enemy were killed and wounded. Captains Cary, Fearing, and Adjutant Frank, of the Fifth N. Y. S. M., accompanied the command as volunteers, and did very effective service. I regret to state that Captain Cary was wounded in the foot.
Lieut. D. S. Gordon, of the Second Dragoons, temporarily attached to Company B, Second Cavalry, accompanied me, and rendered me valuable services. The prisoners, horses, arms, and equipments taken have been this day turned over to the proper authority.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
CHARLES H. TOMPKINS,
First Lieutenant, Second Cavalry, Commanding Company B.
Col. D. Hunter, Third Cavalry, Commanding Brigade.
