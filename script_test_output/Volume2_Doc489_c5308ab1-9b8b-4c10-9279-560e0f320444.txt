The copy of the power to suspend the writ of habeas corpus had been previously received with your letter of the 16th instant.
I have had such constant claims upon my time here in seizing arms and ammunition, and in arranging the details with the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company of the understanding in regard to goods passing over their railroad, that I have not been able to accomplish more than to keep up the necessary correspondence with the officers commanding posts, and to give the necessary attention to the troops here preparatory to a visit to the different posts of the department, with a view to possess myself of its affairs, and to communicate such suggestions as may occur to me as proper in regard to the withdrawal of small outposts near Annapolis. There is a large quantity of powder of which I have information stored near this city, which I was about to seize to-day, but I am at a loss to know where to place it. The magazine at Fort McHenry is full, and I do not like to move it until it is decided where it is to go. I should like to have instructions upon this subject. There is a magazine belonging to the city in the northern part of the town where it could be stored, but it would require a strong guard, as it is so far from the other positions occupied by the troops.
I inclose a copy of instructions given by me to Colonel Jones, commanding officer at the Belay House, in relation to goods passing over the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad. On my return from Annapolis to the Belay House, if the General-in-Chief desires a personal interview, I c«uld go over to Washington and return the same day j otherwise, I would communicate in writing what I may have to say.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, yours,
GEO. CAHWALADEB, Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Massachusetts Sixth BegH and Post at Belay House: Colonel : Until further orders you will pass over the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad groceries, such as tea, sugar, coffee, spices, and dry goods, &c., except uniform clothing, and such goods, in quantities as could be used as clothing for troops. Goods in your judgment designated Iona fide for country stores in the territory upon the lines of the road and its branches may be passed at your discretion.

Sir : The unquiet state of the country and the point you now occupy in the vicinity of Baltimore and the road to Frederick, Md., makes your position of the highest importance in a civil as well as military point of view. The proper execution of your duties calls for great activity on your part, and watchfulness on the part of your command, that no aid or comfort goes to Harper’s Ferry, or those arrayed in arms against the

United States, and also requires of you the exercise of sound judgment, that while securing the interests of the United States and the safety of your command, you do not unnecessarily trench upon the right of citizens.
The safety of the Northern Central Railroad is intrusted to you, but that is not all; you are to see to the quietude of the country adjacent your stations, and if at any time you know of armed bodies of men outside of Baltimore collected with hostile intent, and the force be not too strong to overcome and overawe with that at your disposal, you will arrest them, by surprise, if possible, and hold them subject to future orders. Men not known to be friendly, drilling at night, or secretly, must be looked upon with suspicion of hostile intent and treated accordingly ; and also wagons with supplies of large amount leaving Baltimore at night, munitions, arms, &c., not designed for the United States, should be seized and held till properly accounted for.
Over the road to Frederick a surveillance must be exercised, and so soon as there is ample force at your disposal it should be stationed on that road within your reach.
The city of Baltimore is within the command of Bvt. Major-General George Cadwalader, and you must be careful to avoid interfering with his prerogatives; but if through force of circumstances you should be forced suddenly to act within his limits, you will report your act to him and the reason therefor. Where time will permit, you will report irregularities to General Cadwalader for his action.
In addition to the above the commanding general desires me to say he wishes to hear from you from time to time, as occasion may offer, in relation to the feeling of the people in your vicinity; the discipline of your command, and other matters you deem of interest and importance. The fact that everything is quiet is of importance to report.
You are also desired to maintain strict discipline, and to drill continuously; also to instruct your sentinels to permit no gatherings around them; to walk their post; talk to no one unnecessarily, and to be vigilant at all times. Tents for your regiment will soon be sent to you. In the mean time you will protect them from the weather by hiring such proper houses as may be in the immediate vicinity of the road.
I am, sir, verv respectfully, your obedient servant,
F. J. PORTER, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—General Keim is ordered to relieve by others the companies of your regiment north of Gunpowder Bridge. You will then collect them and distribute them so as to re-enforce your post and have a disposable force.

Maj. F. J. Porter,
Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:
Sir: This morning in Philadelphia MajQr-General Patterson insisted on my delivering to the troops mustered into the service of the United States the accouterments I have had made for the militia of this State. I partly agreed to do so, but on my arrival here I find a letter from the Secretary of War, saying that arrangements had been made to supply from the U. S. arsenals all the accouterments necessary for the troops mustered into the service of the United States.

Under these circumstances, what can I do? The United States has not got the accouterments ready, as General Patterson informed me, and the United States seems to be unwilling to take what I have on hand. If the United States want these now they can have them, and let our Pennsylvania reserve troops receive a like number from the United States as soon as they can get them ready. I inclose copy of letter from Secretary of War.
Yery respectfully,
E. C. HALE,
Quartermaster- General, Pennsylvania Militia.
P. S.—Please let me hear from you by telegraph to-morrow whether I shall deliver accouterments or not.

War Department, May 20, 1861.
E. C. Hale, Esq.,
Quartermaster-General, Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pa. :
Dear Sir: Your letter of the 14th instant, relative to infantry accouterments, was received and its suggestions taken into consideration. Arrangements have been made for procuring and issuing from the U. S. arsenals accouterments in ample quantities to supply all the troops mustered into the U. S. service, and it would be unadvisable, in my opinion, to provide them otherwise.
Eespectfully, yours,
SIMONT CAMEEON,
Secretary of War.

Col. E. D. Townsend,
A. A. <?., Headquarters of the Army, Washington City:
Sir: In compliance with verbal intimation from the General-in-Chief I present for his information in tabular form the locations of the regiments nowin this department; the condition of their equipment, accouterments, clothing, &c., and the probable time they can be put in motion, fully equipped. The probable time is based on the accompanying statement from the commander of Frankford Arsenal, to which I respectfully refer. I also call attention to the offer herewith of the quartermaster-general of this State.* With his aid six regiments can be thrown into the field as rapidly as the accouterments can be distributed, say Monday. Without his assistance (accepted by telegraph through me) the term of service of some of the regiments will expire before they are equipped, or they will be provided at so distant a day that new shoes and other clothing will have to be issued, unless accouterments are provided outside of this department. Colonel Hale offers some four thousand sets. I am anxious to forward the views of the General-in-Chief and to execute his designs, and will be much gratified to have the means of putting in the field regiments well drilled and desirous of seeing service. If desirable, they can be sent forward without accouterments,

but without them the men lack confidence in each other and inflict severe injuries.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. PATTERSON,
Major-General, Commanding.
P. S.—If Colonel Hale’s offer be accepted I shall at once equip the Twelfth and Thirteenth Regiments, at York; Eighth and Tenth, at Chambersburg; Fourteenth and Fifteenth, at Lancaster; and Twentieth and Twenty-first, at Philadelphia, from those accouterments, to be supplied the first of next week by Lieutenant Treadwell.
[Inclosures.]

Frankford Arsenal, May 23, 1861.
Maj. F. J. Porter,
A. A. G., PLdqrs. DepH of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pa.:
Sir : In answer to your letter of to-day I have the honor to state, for the information of the general commanding, that only two thousand two hundred and ninety-nine sets of round-ball accouterments are to be received from the Philadelphia manufacturers. I will be able to equip the Seventh Regiment, at Chambersburg, to-morrow, and the Eighth and Tenth Regiments probably early next week.
As I have no further orders for accouterments to give out, my further supply will be derived from Newark, from a contract recently made to deliver twenty thousand sets at this arsenal, dated May 15, at the rate of eight hundred or more sets per week, the first delivery to be made in ten days from date of contract. I will also receive from the Philadelphia makers eight thousand five hundred sets of elongated-ball accouterments, and will be able to equip regiments requiring these at the rate of about three thousand sets per week. I have communicated with the Newark contractor for twenty thousand, requiring him to deliver first five thousand sets of round-ball accouterments, and requesting him to send here as soon as possible any of this or any other kind he may have ready. Three thousand sets of round ball accouterments, ordered to Washington Arsenal, have delayed the supplying of the Pennsylvania
