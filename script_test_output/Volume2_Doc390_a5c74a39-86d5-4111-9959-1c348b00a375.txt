No. 22.
f	Centreville, July 20,1861.
The enemy has planted a battery on the Warrenton turnpike to defend the passage of Bull Run, has mined the stone bridge, and made a heavy abatis on the right bank to oppose our advance in that direction. The ford above the bridge is also guarded, whether with artillery or not is not positively known, but every indication favors the belief that he purposes defending the passage of the stream.
It is intended to turn the position, force the enemy from the road, that it may be reopened, and, if possible, destroy the railroad leading from Manassas to the valley of Virginia, where the enemy has a large force. As this may be resisted by all the force of the enemy, the troops will be disposed of as follows:
The First Division (General Tyler’s), with the exception of Richardson’s brigade, will move at 2.30 a. m. precisely, on the Warrenton turnpike, to threaten the passage of the bridge, but will not open fire until full daybreak.
The Second Division (Hunter’s) will move from its camp at 2 a. m. precisely, and, led by Captain Woodbury, of the Engineers, will, after passing Cub Run, turn to the right and pass the Bull Run stream above the lower ford at Sudley Springs, and then, turning down to the left, descend the stream and clear away the enemy who may be guarding the lower ford and bridge. It will then bear off to the right, to make room for the succeeding division.
The Third Division (Heintzelman’s) will march at 2.30 a. m. and follow the road taken by the Second Division (Hunter’s), but will cross at the lower ford after it has been turned as above, and then, going to the left, take place between the stream and Second Division.
The Fifth Division (Miles’) will take position on the Centreville heights. (Richardson’s brigade will for the time form part of his division, and will continue in its present position.) One brigade will be in the village and one near the present station of Richardson’s brigade. This division will threaten Blackburn’s Ford and remain in reserve at Centreville.
The commander will open fire with artillery only, and will bear in mind that it is a demonstration only he is to make. He will cause such defensive works, abatis, earthworks, &c., to be thrown up as will strengthen his position. Lieutenant Prime, of the Engineers, will be charged with this duty.
These movements may lead to the gravest results, and commanders of divisions and brigades should bear in mind the immense consequences involved. There must be no failure, and every effort must be made to

Colonel : My attention has been called by those interested to two omissions in my report of the battle of the 21st ultimo near Manassas, and I ask leave to make the following corrections, wishing that they be made part of my original report:
1.	In speaking of the retreat, I mentioned that it was covered by Colonel Blenker’s brigade. I should have said Colonel Bichardson’s and Colonel Blenker’s brigades. The former was on the left of the Centreville ridge, and the latter in front of it, on the Warrenton road. Each covered the retreat of those on the respective roads to the common point—Centreville} from there to the rear Colonel Bichardson was behind, and covered the main body.
2.	In speaking of the action on the left at Blackburn’s Ford, I mentioned Colonel Bichardson’s and Major Hunt’s reports as giving the account of what transpired in that direction. In this connection I omitted to mention Col. T. A. Davies’ report, and now beg to refer to it as necessary to a full account of this part of the battle. He was engaged to the left of Bichardson, and repulsed an attempt of the enemy to turn our left.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
IBVIN MCDOWELL, Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters of the Army.
