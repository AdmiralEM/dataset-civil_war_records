Reports of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris, Indiana Militia, ofsTcirmishes at Bel ington and Laurel Hill, pursuit of Garnett7s forces, and action at Carriers Ford.
Hdqrs. near Belington, Va., July 9,1861.
Sir: Since my report of the 7th instant, I have the honor to inform the commanding general that we now occupy the Elliott farm. Our advanced position is behind Belington, some two hundred yards. The cleared grounds extend some two hundred yards beyond Belington. A heavy body of timber then commences, which is now occupied by the enemy in large force. Skirmishing has been going on since the occupation of our position. Yesterday they appeared in such force that we threw several shells into the wood, and attempted to occupy it with our pickets; but we were driven in, with the loss of two killed and three wounded. Our total loss up to this time, in killed, is 45 wounded, 6 •, missing, 1.
I feel sure we could hold this side of the wood, did it not extend our lines too much beyond the point we are instructed to retain. Captain

Hines, my aide-de-camp, was on a hill in view of part of their camp the entire day yesterday. He saw forty to sixty large tents, capable of accommodating twenty to twenty-five men each, and saw the ends of rows of tents extending back, and which to him appeared as a large camp. The enemy were in motion several times during yesterday, and their columns were seen marching in our direction. We are sure they were last night in the rear of a round hill in front of Belington, and within three-fourths of a mile, and in numbers at least two or three thousand. Scouts on the hill this morning report their tents in the same position as yesterday.
The instructions of the commanding general will be carried out, although it is difficult to restrain our men from advancing. I hardly know in what terms to convey to you their enthusiasm. Their coolness under such fire as we have been subjected to (incessant since our arrival) is very creditable to them, and establishes beyond all question, if proof were needed, that they can be relied upon in any emergency.
The regiments in advance are Milroy’s Mnth Indiana, Barnett’s artillery, Steedman’s Fourteenth Ohio, and Dumont’s Seventh Indiana, which regiments deserve special mention.
Bumors from several sources reached us yesterday of re-enforcements to the enemy from the direction of Beverly, but they are not of a character to be reported to the commanding general under the instructions I have received.
Owing to the rapid march from Philippi, made necessary by the instructions of the commanding general of July —, it was impossible to bring much baggage or provisions. Our men are very short of the latter, and we have only seven wagons to the regiment and such scanty assistance as we hire to keep us supplied.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A. MORRIS, Brigadier- General.
Maj. S. Williams, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—Information just in reports the enemy as having retired from the wood in front of Belington. Reconnoitering parties are out in several directions, and the movements of the enemy will be closely watched.
July 13,1861.
Sir : After resting two hours near Leadsville our advanced column, Steedman, Dumont, and Milroy, moved on this morning at 3 o’clock in pursuit of the enemy. I am now advancing, at 5 o’clock, with the balance of my force to support them. We left Belington in pursuit yesterday with four wagons of hard bread and pork, which were all the available wagons, the balance having been sent to Philippi to bring up supplies from there. As I have before reported, we have but seven wagons to the regiment. Our men have necessarily been restricted in their rations, and must be more so as we advance. I shall pursue just as long as it is possible with the means of transportation at my command. If you could send us provisions, it would greatly assist us in the advance.
Inclosed I send you a dispatch, this moment received from Captain Benham, who is with the advance.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A. MORRIS, Brigadier- General.
Maj. S. Williams, Assistant Adjutant-General.

1J Miles East of New Interest—6.10 a. m.
General : I have just started, after having halted the column for half an hour. There is no doubt they have passed up on Pleasant Run, opposite me, and I follow them, though with much doubt. It is said they are now about six miles ahead, having traveled on last night.
H. W. BENHAM, Captain.
Brigade Headquarters,
CarricWs Ford, Fa., July 14, 1861.
Sir : I reported yesterday, at about 6 a. m., the progress of the forces of my command in pursuit of the enemy retreating from Laurel Hill. The pursuit was continued through the day in the same order as stated in my report of yesterday morning, viz: Steedman’s Fourteenth Ohio in advance, with two sections of Barnett’s artillery, next Dumont’s Seventh Indiana and Milroy’s Ninth Indiana. These regiments, as I reported, started in pursuit from our resting place near Leadsville at about 4 o’clock in the morning, under the immediate command of Captain Ben-ham. The remainder of the column were on the march by 5 o’clock a. m. A drizzling rain commenced about 6 o’clock, which by 9 became quite heavy. The enemy left the main turnpike and turned towards Cheat River, crossing two branches of the Laurel Mountain over a narrow and difficult road. Owing to the heavy rain, the roads were rendered very difficult for the men and the few wagons of ammunition and provisions. By 11 o’clock the rain became a drenching storm, and continued for several hours, the roads in the mountains becoming nearly impassable. At 2 o’clock the whole command were up to the position which we now occupy.
For details of the operations of the advance column I refer you to the report of Captain Benham.
The attention of the commanding general is particularly called to the gallant bearing of the regiments which led the advance. I would also call attention to the fact that the entire command commenced the pursuit) on a few minutes’ notice, without time to prepare even a day’s rations for the haversacks. I ordered four wagons to be loaded with hard bread and pork to follow the command. These four wagons, with the little additional rations put in with the ammunition, are all the provisions the command has had since leaving Belington, except some beeves procured in this vicinity.
The march of yesterday was from eighteen to twenty miles. When it is considered that we have put to flight a force equal to our own, and have pursued him night and day for thirty hours, almost without provisions, over a mountainous and difficult road, and part of the time through a drenching storm, we may feel sure that our cause must be successfully maintained by men who show such gallant bearing and soldierly endurance.
Justice to a gallant soldier compels me to say that, from the commencement of our march from Philippi to the routing of the enemy at this place, too much praise cannot be bestowed on Captain Benham, and I take this occasion to thank him for the invaluable service he has rendered me. I must also call attention to the services of Maj. J. W. Gordon, now of the Eleventh Regiment of Infantry, U. S. Army. Major Gordon volunteered a private in the Ninth Indiana Regiment, was promoted sergeant-major in the same regiment, and two weeks since re-

ceived the appointment of major in the Regular Army. Owing to the position of the enemy in front of the brigade in which he was serving as sergeant-major, he requested to be retained until the issue should be settled. Acting yesterday as my volunteer aide with the advance column, Captain Benham testifies to his gallantry and invaluable services during the entire day, and more especially in the face of the enemy.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A, MORRIS, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Maj. Seth Williams,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Ohio.
Brigade Headquarters, Elliott’s Farm,
Near Belington, Fa., July 16, 1861.
Sir : On the morning of the 14th instant I reported to you the operations of the brigade up to the routing of the Confederate forces at Car-rick’s Ford at about 2 p. m. of the previous day, and I have to state that while our troops were halting for rest our scouts followed close upon the route of the enemy for from four to six miles farther, and on the morning of the 14th we learned that they were fully fifteen miles in advance of us. At about noon of the same day we started for Saint George, in pursuance of orders, which place we reached at night. Without provisions, other than the beeves sent by General McClellan, and in the exhausted state of the command, it was impossible to pursue farther. At Saint George we heard the report that General Hill, agreeably to an order sent by General McClellan, had met the flying enemy, and captured or dispersed the remnant. Twelve wagons, most of them loaded with new clothing, were discovered four miles to the right of our route by our scouts, and were taken possession of. Yesterday morning we left Saint George to return to this place, in order to get proper provisions and shelter for the troops.
After a fatiguing march of twenty-three miles, we reached here at about 9 o’clock last night. The command were getting sick from the use of fresh beef only, and many of them preferred doing without beef rather than increase the disease (diarrhea) brought on by its use without bread or salt.
When the reports of the different colonels engaged at Carrick’s Ford shall be handed me I will complete my report of that engagement, in order that individual cases (if such there should be) of special service and gallantry may be made. I am now gathering up all the captured property and having it properly cared for. The limited transportation with this column (which has been before reported) will take three or four days to gather up the property strewed from here towards Saint George. A large number of tents have been taken. An inventory of all property will be made as soon as it can possibiy be done.
Your letter of the 15th did not reach me till this morning. I shall, therefore, gather the captured property, recruit my command, and, as soon as it is accomplished, proceed to Philippi. I would respectfully state that I have reported to the commanding general as often as it was possible under the circumstances which have surrounded me.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. A. MORRIS,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Maj. S. Williams,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Euttonsville, Va.
