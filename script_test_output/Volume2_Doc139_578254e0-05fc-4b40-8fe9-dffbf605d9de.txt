No. 5.
Memorial of the Board of Police Commissioners.
To the honorable the Senate and Mouse of Representatives of the United
States:
The memorial of Chas. Howard, Wm. H. Gatchell, and Jno. W. Davis, citizens of Baltimore, in the State ot Maryland, respectfully represents:
That between 2 and 3 o’clock on the morning of the 1st of July instant, they were severally aroused from sleep at their respective dwellings by large bodies of soldiers of the Army of the United States, quartered in or about this city, and were removed by force and against their will from their homes and families to Fort McHenry, where they have ever since been confined as prisoners, and now are.
Your memorialists at the time received no information as to the cause of their arrest than that the same was made by order of Major* General Banks, commanding this military department, nor have they since been informed of any charges whatever against them further than those contained in a proclamation of General Banks issued later in the same day, a copy of which, taken from one of the newspapers of the city, they append hereto.*
By reference to the said proclamation your honorable bodies will perceive that the arrest of your memorialists is alleged to have been made u in pursuance of orders issued from the headquarters of the Army at Washington, for the preservation of the public peace in this department,” and is attempted to be justified by the refusal of your memorialists, as members of the board of police of Baltimore, to acquiesce in the legality and effect of a previous proclamation of General Banks declaring their official authority superseded. The proclamation in question goes on to charge that your memorialists, after such attempted suspension of their functions, had continued to hold sessions daily ; u that upon a forced and unwarrantable construction” of the previous proclamation referred to they had declared the police law to be suspended, and their police force to be off of duty, 66 intending to leave the city without any police protection whatever”; and that they had moreover refused to recognize as policemen certain persons selected by a provost-marshal, under General Banks, to act in that capacity. There is a further allegation that the u headquarters under the charge of the board, when abandoned by the officers, resembled in some respects a concealed arsenal.”
Your memorialists respectfully represent that together with their colleague, Charles D. Hinks, esq., who was arrested with them (but has since been discharged upon his parole because of ill health), and the

mayor of the city, who has not been arrested, they constitute the board of police, a quasi corporation created by the legislature of Maryland, and having exclusive police jurisdiction in the city of Baltimore. The nature and extent of their functions and duties will be made known to your honorable bodies by an examination of the code of Public Local Laws of the State of Maryland (art. iv, secs. 806 to 822, and secs. 199 to 228 inclusive). It will there be seen that their powers are of the amplest character, and that they not only have control of the whole police department of the State within the city limits, but are likewise charged with the appointment of all judges of election, and the conduct of all elections, whether Federal, State, or municipal, to be held in the city; so that every such election is, by special enactment, declared invalid and of no effect unless held by the board and under its control and supervision.
It will further appear by the explicit terms of the law that no police force can lawfully exist in Baltimore unless appointed and governed by the police board, and that neither officers nor men, when appointed, have any official authority or jurisdiction independently of or apart from the board; but that all of them are merely employed, in pursuance of the express provisions of the law, “to enable the board to discharge the duties imposed upon them.” By section 819 of the article of the code already referred to, heavy pecuniary penalties are imposed upon any person who shall forcibly resist or obstruct the execution or enforcement of any of the provisions of the law, in the premises, or disburse any money in violation thereof; and it is made the duty of the board to enforce such penalties by civil action, leaving the parties who may have violated the law still subject to indictment for any criminal offense committed by them in the course of such violation.
Your memorialists, with their colleague, Mr. Hinks, were duly appointed by the legislature of Maryland, at its January session, 1860, to carry out the provisions of the police system of which they have thus indicated the leading features, and they duly took the oath to do so, which is prescribed by the law. The term of office of Messrs. Howard and Davis does not expire until the 10th of March, 1862, and that [of] Messrs. Gatchell and Hinks extends for still two years longer. None of them are subject to removal except by the legislature of Maryland, from which they derive their authority and functions. All the provisions of the police law were fully tested by legal proceedings instituted in the superior court of Baltimore City shortly after its enactment, and carried on appeal to the court of last resort in the State. The result was an unqualified recognition by all the judges of tbe conformity of the law in all particulars with the constitution of Maryland and that of the United States.
Such being the official tenure and lawful and constitutional powers and duties of your memorialists, they were astonished, on the 27th of June last, to be visited, without previous notice, by Colonel Kenly, of the Maryland Volunteers, then encamped near Baltimore, and to be informed by that officer that he was instructed by Major-General Banks to read them a proclamation declaring their official authority superseded, and appointing Colonel Kenly provost-marshal to administer the police law of the State in their stead. Of that proclamation a copy is appended to this memorial,* by which it will be seen that although various causes are alleged for the arrest of Col. George P. Kane, marshal of police, and for superseding his official authority likewise, no ground of complaint whatever is pretended to exist against the board of police, and no excuse

is vouchsafed for the overthrow of the constitutional authority of the State of Maryland vested in your memorialists, and, of course, incapable of being constitutionally or lawfully divested bv any Federal authority, civil or military.
The city of Baltimore being entirely commanded by large bodies of Federal troops stationed around it, and it being wholly impossible for your memorialists to offer any effective resistance to the illegal proceedings of General Banks, they had no alternative but to submit to force, and to vindicate, as far as practicable, the authority of the State or Maryland, and their own personal and official rights and self-respect, by protesting against such proceeding as an arbitrary and unconstitutional exercise of military power. They accordingly adopted the preamble and resolutions likewise hereto appended.* It is in this act, and in their continuing their sessions under and in pursuance, that General Banks, in his proclamation issued on the day of their arrest, professes to find justification for his unwarrantable and unlawful violation of their personal liberty. It is no part of the intention of your memorialists to enter into any discussion of the allegations of that proclamation further than to say that it is wholly untrue, as therein alleged, that they continued to hold the police force of the State of Maryland, in the city of Baltimore, subject to their orders, for any purpose inconsistent with the peace or security of the Government. They declared the active operation of the police law to be suspended for the obvious and unanswerable reason that the forcible suspension of the functions of the board which alone had authority to administer the law necessarily paralyzed the law also. They declared the police force appointed by them to be still an existent body, because the law creating the force forbids the dismissal of the men, except for cause, and then by the board of police alone, after trial had. They declared it to be still subject to their orders,, for so long as the force exists it cannot be subject under the law to any other. They refused, as a matter of obvious duty, to recognize as policemen the parties named by Colonel Kenly to act as such, for they assumed it, as they still consider it to be beyond dispute, that Colonel Kenly could have no lawful right to appoint policemen, under the laws of Maryland, whatever his authority may have been as a military officer (which they do not propose to consider) to appoint military subordinates in the stead of policemen outside of those laws or in derogation of them.
The attempt by Colonel Kenly to enforce such police appointments, and all efforts of his nominees to act thereunder were moreover punishable offenses under the police law, the penalties of which it was the sworn duty of your memorialists to enforce, and in the violation of which it was impossible they could acquiesce. But your memorialists distinctly and emphatically deny that they had any other purpose in their official protest and action than to fulfill their manifest and sworn obligations, and to maintain the dignity and assert the authority of the* laws of Maryland which were intrusted to their hands for execution, but which they were precluded by force from executing. They solemnly declare that if they had been permitted to continue in the exercise of their functions, after the arrest and imprisonment of the marshal of police on the 27th of June, they would have continued to discharge their duties, as they had discharged them theretofore, in all respects faithfully, impartially, and that to the best of their ability, in obedience to the laws and the constitution, and they asseverate, and will maintain, that the imputation of any other intention or purpose on their part is wholly destitute of foundation in fact. The statement in regard to the

aconcealed arsenal” at the marshals office, they do not deem it necessary to allude to, further than to say that it is perfectly notorious, and has been fully shown by the message of the mayor to the city council of Baltimore,* that the arms in question were the lawful property of the city; that they were insignificant in quantity, constituting but little * more than the customary armament of the force for its public duties, and were lawfully concealed to prevent unlawful seizure. Your memorialists therefore respectfully represent that the grounds set up by General Banks, in his proclamation, give to their arrest and imprisonment no color of justification or necessity.
And as to the proclamation of General Banks issued on the 27th of June, announcing the arrest of the marshal of police, and declaring his official authority to have been superseded, these memorialists respectfully say that the charges against that officer contained therein are equally without foundation, so far as they believe or have any reason to suspect. They have personal knowledge of the fact, which is equally well known to all impartial citizens of Baltimore, that the official duties of Colonel Kane have been discharged throughout with singular ability, integrity, and courage, and never more conspicuously, or in better faith, or at more imminent risk of his own life, than in the protection of the troops of the Federal Government on the 19th of April. Of the police force placed under his command by these memorialists, and selected wholly without reference to their political opinions (as the law and the official oath of your memorialists require), your memorialists can say without exaggeration that they do not believe a body of men can be found anywhere more entirely devoted to the conscientious discharge of official duty, or less justly liable to the accusation of entering into unlawful combinations themselves, or encouraging such combinations in others. Down to the moment of the suspension of the active duties of the force by General Banks, these memorialists have pride in asserting that no community ever acknowledged more universally than the citizens of Baltimore, and none ever had better reason to acknowledge, the successful operation of a police system, in securing the strictest enforcement of the laws, the amplest protection of private rights, and the most rigid maintenance of public order.
Your memorialists further say that with every opportunity afforded by their official position, and every energy stimulated by their sense of duty to ascertain the existence of all unlawful combinations or associations within their jurisdiction, they have no reason whatever to suspect that any such combinations did, in fact, exist, as alleged by General Banks in his proclamation of June 27, and they confidently assert their conviction that his allegation to the contrary was founded upon false information, communicated to him by designing persons, and cannot be sustained or countenanced by credible evidence of any sort. But even if your memorialists were and are altogether mistaken in these particulars ; if the marshal of police had been faithless to his obligations, as ^charged, and had been willing or able to seduce the men under his command from theirs also, it was still only necessary for General Banks to furnish the board of police with the slightest evidence to that effect, and your memorialists would have given to his suggestions the most prompt and respectful consideration. They would have suspended or removed the marshal, if such action had been proper, and would have placed beyond question their own disposition and ability to discharge the whole of their duty in the premises. If General Banks, even without advising them, had seen fit to arrest the marshal of police, upon any charge

which might have been deemed sufficient to justify such a step, your memorialists would have taken care to govern the police force efficiently and properly during bis confinement. The legality of such arrest would have been a question for Colonel Kane, and not your memorialists, to consider ; but either of the courses suggested wTould have fulfilled the purposes, and have met the exigency announced in the proclamation. General Banks, acting doubtless in conformity with his orders, adopted neither the one course nor the other, but assuming jurisdiction not only over the person of an alleged offender, but over his official functions, likewise saw fit not only to arrest and imprison him, but to dismiss him from his place as a public officer of this State (which only your memorialists could lawfully do), and to supersede the lawful authority of your memorialists besides. Knowing that such a proceeding could not by possibility be justified by anything in the laws or constitution of Maryland or the United States, your memorialists were compelled by every consideration of sworn duty to treat the same as an arbitrary act of force and usurpation, no matter by whose orders it might have been committed, or under what pretexts it was sought to be excused. Ko construction which it was possible for them to give to the proclamation of the 27th of June could have brought them to any other conclusion than that it was their bounden duty to enter their protest against it.
They therefore deny that the construction which they adopted was either “forced” or “unwarrantable,” as charged in the proclamation of July 1; and they emphatically protest against the truth of the further allegation contained in the latter document to the effect that their official course upon the occasion was dictated by a purpose to “ leave the city without any police protection whatever.” If, indeed, they had entertained such a purpose, they respectfully suggest that it was not a matter with which any officer of the Federal Government had any rightful concern, howmuchsoever it would have furnished their fellow-citizens with just cause of complaint. But they entertained no such purpose. On the contrary, they aver and are prepared to show that when General Banks, by his proclamation of June 27, interrupted the exercise of their lawful authority, the city was thoroughly protected, in all particulars, by your memorialists and the force under their command; that its tranquillity was perfect; its peace neither disturbed nor threatened; the rights of person and property of all men were inviolate; the civil authorities of the State and city were in the beneficial and effective exercise of all their functions, and the laws were supreme, except in so far as interfered with by the military power. If, therefore, the city was left without protection on the 27th of June, it was the fault and upon the responsibility not of your memorialists but altogether of that department of the General Government by which the constituted authorities of the State were superseded and the protective provisions of its laws deprived of their vitality.
If General Banks himself were unlawfully superseded by force, he surely would not regard it as just in his captors to accuse him of leaving Ins department without protection, because he refused, as a man of courage and honor, to acquiesce in their violent suspension and assumption of his functions.
Your memorialists claim to be judged, officially and personally, by no lower standard of dignity, responsibility, or honor. As public officers and men of ordinary integrity, it must be obvious to your honorable bodies that they could not lend themselves in any way to what they know to be a palpable violation of the law they had sworn to support.
They could not transfer or acquiesce in the transfer to General Banks

or Colonel Kenly of an authority which the law commanded them to exercise exclusively themselves. They could not authorize their police force to serve under any command or control but their own in the face of the express provisions of the law to the contrary. They could not expose their officers and men to civil and criminal responsibility by leaving them on duty under unlawful orders which could afford them no protection before the tribunals of justice. Your memorialists had no choice therefore but to protest as they did) to declare their force off duty, and to leave the military authority to deal, on its own responsibility, with the exigency it had seen fit to create.
In entering thus at large into a discussion of the grounds set up by General Banks in justification of their arrest, your memorialists have been governed altogether by a desire to vindicate their personal and official character and conduct from unfounded and disparaging imputations, and to demonstrate the gratuitous character of the injustice against Which they appeal to Congress for relief. They are in no wise to be considered as thereby recognizing for an instant the right of the War Department, or of any officer acting thereunder, to proceed against them in the mode adopted, even if the accusations which they have repelled were perfectly well founded. The State of Maryland is one of the States of the Union. She is at peace with the Government. Her people are disarmed, and her territory is occupied by an overwhelming military force. Martial law has not been proclaimed among her people, but, on the contrary, all intention to set it up or enforce it is disavowed in the most explicit way in the proclamation of June 27. The Federal courts and those of the State are in full and undisturbed operation so far as citizens not belonging to the military force are concerned, and process is served without obstruction, and is obeyed without resistance by all except those in military authority. If, therefore, your memorialists were charged with any offense known to the law there was and is nothing to prevent their arrest and detention by the civil arm, in due course, and upon proper and lawful warrant supported by oath, as prescribed and required by the Constitution.
But they respectfully submit that in the proclamation by which their arrest is sought to be justified, there is no allegation of any matter or thing which, if sworn to in proper form of law, would authorize the issuing of process against them by any judicial tribunal.
If they were so unfortunate as to place an erroneous construction upon / the first proclamation of General Banks, as he alleges, they are not aware of any statute of the United States which renders such a mistake a penal offense.
If it be a crime on their part to regard as illegal and wholly null the attempted suspension by a Federal officer of their functions as constituted authorities of the State of Maryland, they have been unable to learn by what provisions of the Constitution and laws such an offense is created or defined.
If they are lawfully punishable for holding subject to their orders a police force which the laws of Maryland made it their duty so to hold, and for refusing to recognize as public officers of Maryland the appointees of General Banks, whom they are bound under the laws of Maryland to prosecute as offenders for attempting to exercise police functions, they are at a loss to conceive under what head of the penal law such criminality on their part exists. They mean no improper reflection when they assert their belief that no law officer of the Government would venture to ask for a warrant upon an affidavit of the facts recited in the proclamation of July 1, and that no competent tribunal

would liesitate to quasli such a warrant if issued. They know no principle of criminal jurisprudence, under free institutions, which would authorize even the courts of recognized jurisdiction to sanction the arrest and confinement of a citizen upon the indefinite allegation of his entertaining 44 some purpose, not known to the Government,” but still alleged to be u inconsistent with its peace or security.”
But be this as it roay, these memorialists respectfully? insist that if they are charged with any offense which is known to the laws, it is their constitutional right, as citizens of the United States, to be dealt with according to law. If they are charged with no offense, it is equally their constitutional right to have the fact recognized, and to enjoy their personal liberty.
They have, through their counsel, respectfully asked of General Banks a statement of the grounds of their imprisonment, and have challenged an investigation of any and all charges affecting either their personal or official integrity or their fidelity to the laws and the Constitution.
No such statement has been made to them, no such investigation has been granted, and no hope has been held out to them of any speedy relief from the unjust and unlawful imprisonment under which they are suffering. In the mean time they are withdrawn from their homes and separated from their families; their public duties are unlawfully committed to other hands; their private interests are exposed to detriment and perhaps ruin, and they themselves held as malefactors before the country, and are compelled by force to endure mortification and obloquy. The arbitrary suspension of the writ of habeas corpus has of course deprived them of the means provided by law for their deliverance, and unless your honorable bodies should see fit to relieve them, they are wholly without means of present redress. They therefore most respectfully and earnestly invoke the immediate interposition of Congress in their behalf.
They repeat that they have administered their public trust faithfully, impartially, and to the best of their ability, and have not used the police force under their control, nor have they permitted it, nor contemplated permitting it, to be used for any other purpose than the legitimate and faithful discharge of its duties as prescribed by law. As private citizens they invite scrutiny likewise into their conduct in every respect in which it may be lawfully impugned, and they assert their readiness to meet, without a moment’s delay, any charge which may be responsibly laid against their individual or official proceedings.
As citizens of the United States they therefore appeal to your honorable bodies for relief from oppression and unconstitutional wrong. As public officers of the State of Maryland they protest against the usurpation of their official authority by an officer of the United States Army, and they protest the more strongly because the usurpation against which they remonstrate is not an irresponsible proceeding of the officer in question, but the advised and deliberate act of the War Department itself. They are aware that the President of the United States has called upon Congress to sanction the suspension of the habeas corpus and other acts which have been done by the Executive Department, upon its responsibility, without previous sanction of law. But the President has not asserted in his message any right on the part of the Federal Government to depose and appoint State officers, or annul laws of the States constitutionally enacted, nor has he suggested any power in Congress to clothe him with any such authority. He has asserted no right to do wrong to individuals, nor has he asked the interposition of Congress to any such end. But whatever may be the claims of the

Executive, your memorialists respectfully insist that the demands of the Constitution and of individual right and public liberty are very far above them, and they throw themselves therefore for redress and deliverance upon the justice and authority of the representatives of the people. They have no other recourse against arbitrary power and military force, and they demand as matter .of right th at their case be investigated by Congress or remitted to the tribunals of justice to be lawfully heard and determined.
