By order of Major-General Patterson:
P. J. POSTER,
Assistant Adjutant General.
Washington, May 14, 1861.
General Patterson, Philadelphia:
Your telegram of this date is received. It is not known what reason you can have had for sending more troops to Fort McHenry. The garrison is supposed to be amply sufficient, and no more can be accommodated. Let the troops come as at first ordered. Baltimore is within General Butler’s department.
By command of Lieutenant-General Scott:
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant- General.
Philadelphia, Pa., May 14, 1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington City:
Sir: This instant (4.30 p. m.) 1 received your telegram of this date stating the General-in-Chief knows no cause for sending as I did troops to Fort McHenry, &c. Explanation, additional to that of this morning (copy herewith), is now respectfully presented.
In the absence of more direct information, the call of General Butler direct upon Major-General Keim, at York, appeared so urgent that I should have been derelict in duty if I had failed to respond in the most effective manner, i. eby sending direct from here, thus re-enforcing the troops on Federal Hill eight hours earlier than by Harrisburg. On Lieutenant-Colonel Porter’s telegram, then just received, that the road was insecure and should be guarded by two regiments before other troops were sent over it, I ordered from York troops (for the first time telegraphed as equipped) to seize and secure the road for future use. Only one regiment was available. I feared if the road was passed over by a portion of the command (insufficient to re-enforce and to guard) it might be rendered impracticable before the passage of troops from here. It is too late to turn General Cadwalader’s command from the direct route.
Your telegram apprises me for the first time that Baltimore is embraced within the limits of General Butler’s department. I was making preparations to advance and take up, temporarily, my headquarters in that city.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. PATTERSON,
Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, May 15, 1861.
Maj. Gen. E. Patterson, Commanding, &cn Philadelphia, Pa. ;
When I telegraphed you about the sufficiency of the garrison at Fort McHenry 1 did not know that General Butler had called for Pennsyl-

WINFIELD SCOTT.
Washington, May 15, 1861. John Tucker, General Agent of Transportation:
Sir: Your communication of the 13th is received, and its recommendations generally approved.
The importance of keeping the line of transportation open via Perry-ville and Annapolis, in case of emergency, is fully recognized and admitted by the Department. At the same time, it is thought best to recommend that the number of propellers on that route be reduced to the lowest number warranted by the circumstances. It is not probable that the route will be employed for transportation of Government stores at present. In view of this you are directed to employ the Central Bail-road of New Jersey and the Camden and Amboy routes in forwarding stores, munitions, &c., to this point and intermediate points from New York. The capacity of those routes will doubtless prove equal to the ordinary demands, should the route via Baltimore remain unobstructed. The work will also be accomplished with greater dispatch, as well as with a great reduction of expense to the Government, as you suggest.
Thanking you for the promptness and conciseness of your report, very trulv vours,
SIMON CAMEBON,
Secretary of War.
Washington, May 15, 1861. Brevet Brigadier-General Cadv7Alader:
Sir : This department is much in want of more troops for defensive purposes. After retaining a reasonable force for the occupation of Baltimore (independent of Fort McHenry), the Belay House, the Junction, and Annapolis, as also for holding and protecting the railroads between those points and Bladensburg, you will send the whole surplus within your command to this place. It is supposed that four regiments will amply suffice in the Department of Annapolis for the foregoing objects.
The headquarters of the Department of Annapolis may be, upon notice, changed by the commander from and to the principal points therein, who will report on the sufficiency of the number of troops suggested above.
I write by command of Lieutenant-General Scott.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND,
Assistant Adjutant- General.
Washington, D. 0., May 15,1861.
To Brevet Major-General Cadwalader,
Or Commanding General of Baltimore:
If Brevet Major-General Cadwalader be in Baltimore with regiments of Pennsylvanians, let him halt there with them and relieve Brigadier-
