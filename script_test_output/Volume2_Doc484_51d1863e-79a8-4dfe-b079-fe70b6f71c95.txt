Grace or Elkton, with Sherman’s battery of horse artillery, as you may direct.
My wish is that these regulars shall head any movement that may be made, by land or water, from your side upon Baltimore.
The temper of Maryland, which a few days ago seemed to have undergone a very favorable change, is now believed to have suffered a relapse, that makes the movement of the six regular companies alone, by the old mail road from the Susquehanna to Baltimore, as was at first intended, hazardous, if not entirely unsafe, without a large addition of volunteers.
You will therefore hold the battalion of regulars, with the necessary addition of volunteers, ready for the combined movement from the other points (heretofore indicated), which I shall order in a few days upon Baltimore, if the route through the city be not sooner voluntarily opened.
On your/part, I give you the choice to move by land or water; in the latter case, letting Brigadier General Butler, who has his water craft ready, know the day on which your commander will be ready to meet and consult him in Patapsco Bay.
You will also let Lieutenant Colonel Porter, on the York road, know the probable time your commander may be expected to approach the eastern side of the city, leaving the western for General Butler’s approach. Let Brigadier-General Butler and Lieutenant Colonel Porter, as well as myself, know the morning you may appoint for the movement from your side.
I have just ordered Brigadier-General Butler to occupy and support a strong post at the Relay House, on the Patapsco, beginning with a regiment of volunteers. That regiment shall be instructed to take a part in the combined movement.
Exact time must be observed on all sides, to be regulated by prompt intercommunications.
Send the New Jersey regiments here, and we shall want for the capital seven more.
With high respect, yours, truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—Again, another change of temper on the part of Maryland in favor of the Union and a corresponding one in these instructions.
A member of the Cabinet, present at the interview of commissioners (sent by the legislature at Frederick) with the President this morning, reports that the commissioners declare Maryland ready to return to her duty towards the Union; consequently, I ask you to add Pratt’s company, from Mackinac, to the six other companies of regulars, mentioned above, and hold them ready to move through Baltimore on the shortest notice.

I designed to have this matter examined into and the arms inspected by Captain Neill, but his own constant occupation and his now necessary absence have prevented. I now respectfully forward this, to add to my reasons given to-day and previously against moving this force till better equipped for the field. If empowered to draw arms, &c., from the arsenal no moment shall be lost. The officers and men are anxious to move, but the former see and feel the responsibility, and know they should not move in their present condition.
Hon. John Sherman has been made acquainted with the wants and the feeling of a portion of the command, and I desire he may have a patient hearing. I was not aware till to-day that several of the regiments of this city are without arms. I ask and urge that this force be not moved till I put it in motion by my own orders, which will be at the earliest moment.

Maj. Gen. Georoe Oadwalader :
Dear Sir : An examination of the muskets furnished to my command by gunsmiths and machinists has demonstrated that a great proportion of them are defective and wholly unfit for use. In tapping the nipples in they have not been inserted straight, and the iron forced around them split. They will not bear a pressure of air, which escapes around the nipple. Numbers of the locks are insecurely fastened, and many of the barrels have flaws and holes in them one-sixteenth of an inch deep. They are also filled in around the nipple with some soft metal. The number thus defective and useless are two hundred and forty-six. The balance are reported to be only in tolerable condition, and if taken apart and critically examined would no doubt be found to be unsafe and useless.

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt this day, from the General-in-Chief, of his communication of the 4th instant, relating to the advance on Baltimore. My communication of yesterday, by Major Belger, and of the 3d instant, by mail,* will show that no portion of this command is in a proper condition to take the field. Unless there is greater activity in the Quartermaster’s and Ordnance Departments, I fear it can be moved only by consigning the cartridges to the pockets of the men and without cooking utensils. I cannot, at present, designate a day when the command can probably move, but I will inform you in time to prevent delaying the other columns.
I am informed that the portion of the Second Cavalry, which was to have marched ere this, under Major Thomas, is not to be put in motion till the other four companies are equipped and mounted. If such be the case, I request permission to use such portion as may be prepared to advance with the column from York.
I understand that the Northern Central Bailroad have repaired a large portion of the road without interruption. It may be the design of the people of Maryland to offer no resistance in future, but, if peaceable, the command at Yorkshould not advance till better provided. I deeply regret the troops cannot advance as early as the General-in-Chief would desire and the interests of the country appear to demand.

Lieutenant-General Scott, Commander-in- Chief ’, U.. 8. Army:
Dear Sir: I deem it important that our railway from Washington to the Eelay House (within nine miles of Baltimore) should be well guarded by the military department.
The Annapolis Branch is now protected. Colonel Scott, in charge of the railway and telegraph departments, recommends that a regiment (if possible to spare it) be stationed along the line as a permanent guard, say one company each four miles, with tents and equipments complete. This would require eight companies, the two remaining companies to encamp at or near Bladensburg, which it is believed is not a loyal district. With our railway and telegraph protected, we could move this regiment for you at any time on short notice to Annapolis, Eelay House, or Washington.
Our telegraph has been destroyed twice since yesterday morning. We much fear that evil-disposed persons may interfere with tracks and cause serious accidents and delay in many of our movements.
Eespectfully, yours,

I have placed two howitzers to command the viaduct, also a sufficient guard to prevent its destruction, and have occupied the station house at the railroad Relay Station.
An officer has been detailed to examine the trains and stop all armed men, arms, and munitions of war. Before, however, we established a full surveillance of the trains, a squad of some ten or twelve men from Baltimore passed up the road to join the traitors at Harper’s Ferry. These men, before I had heard of it, had put the freight train of this morning under contribution, and passed some eight miles along the road plundering the country people. All such irregularities hereafter will be promptly suppressed.
A matter of some doubt has arisen in this connection. A burden train passed up toward Harper’s Ferry, laden with wheat, whisky (a great quantity of it), spades, picks, and shovels) all these were marked for Virginia. In the doubt, the officer in charge allowed the train to pass until further orders. What shall be done with such freight ?
I learn that I am in the immediate neighborhood of the residence of Major-General Carroll, a gentleman who is most bitter in his hostility to the Government, who ordered out the troops under his command to oppose the passage of the U. S. troops across Baltimore. Two companies of cavalry alone responded to the call from this vicinity. They were commanded by Capt. William H. Horsey and Capt. George R. Gaither, both violent rebels, who have more than once put themselves in a hostile attitude to the U. S. Government. They have conducted themselves with great violence, and in fact are now in arms against the Union, although nominally holding commissions from the governor of Maryland. Can anything be done with them ? Might they not be arrested and at least restrained until we are certain what will be the disposition of Maryland But this is a matter for your better judgment.
I find the people here exceedingly friendly, and I have no doubt that with my present force I could march through Baltimore. I am the more convinced of this, because I learn that for several days many of the armed secessionists have left for Harper’s Ferry or have gone forth plundering the country.
I trust my acts may meet your approbation, whatever you may think of my suggestions.
Most truly, your obedient servant,

Colonel: I received last evening a telegram from the honorable Secretary of War, directing me to send immediately to Washington, via York, six regiments of volunteers, but at so late an hour I could acknowledge its receipt only by a postscript to a letter then about to be dispatched to you. I, however, ordered the six best regiments in the department to be prepared for immediate call.
I have now to present, through the General-in-Chief, for the consideration of the honorable Secretary of War, a renewal of my reasons why these regiments should not be passed, without urgent necessity, through the city of Baltimore. I premise my reasons by the statement

## p. 625 (#641) ############################################

﻿Chap. IX.]
CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.-----UNION.	625
that no delay will result from awaiting a reply to the communication of yesterday, borne by Capt. T. H. Neill, Fifth Infantry. I have been given to understand that it is desirable regular troops should precede the volunteers through Baltimore. If so, the five companies of the Third Infantry should be here. This will not be before to-morrow, night.
Only three of the sixteen regiments (there are more, but mot reported) in this department are supplied with cooking utensils, and only one with tents, and almost all of them rely from necessity upon rations supplied to them cooked at their present location. If withdrawn from those camps without further preparation, they will be thrown for a time upon a community where such resources cannot be relied upon, and the public interests perhaps suffer in many ways.
The troops have but very little ammunition; some of them none; some of the cartridges do not fit their arms, and no boxes are on hand to secure them against wear and weather. Much ammunition has already been destroyed. To supply the troops in advance supplies here have been nearly exhausted.
The bridges on the Northern Central Railroad will all be repaired and protected at the time the combined movement can be made, and all the forces be before Baltimore at the same time.
I have arranged to gather transportation at Perryville on Wednesday. I design that night or Thursday morning to throw ample force into Havre de Grace (which I occupy to-morrow) to be at once thrown forward to Bush River, leaving companies to secure the road. To Bush River and the Gunpowder boats bearing companies will be sent to hold and secure the bridges over those streams, and to Canton, in the vicinity of Baltimore, will be sent vessels to land Sherman’s battery, the five companies of the Third Infantry, and two regiments of volunteers from this city. These regiments will send back on the road to Havre de Grace companies to protect it.
I have given the commanding officer at York his instructions, and a telegram will put him in motion. General Butler will also be notified of my intended movements. The command hence to Baltimore will be under Brevet Major-General Cadwalader ; that from York under Major-General Keirn, having the aid of Lieutenant-Colonel Porter. The movement shall be made without waiting for any more cooking utensils and ammunition than can be procured by Wednesday from such resources as are at hand. The ordnance depot having been closed to me, and the clothing bureau having but a scant supply, and no requisition from Washington (except that one regiment had been ordered to be supplied from Frankford) having been acted upon, I must rely upon what can be procured in open market.
I judge from the telegrams of the Secretary of War that he is desirous to have opened these routes through Baltimore, and, presuming he must be aware of the unprepared condition of the troops in this department, I shall, although advising against it, make this movement, unless instructed by the General-in-Chief to delay, relying upon the Quartermaster’s and Ordnance Departments to supply deficiencies as soon as practicable.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON,

P. S.—Since writing the above I have been notified that the clothing bureau will provide the necessary cooking utensils and canteens.

Maj. F. J. Porter,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., IIdqrs. DepH of Pennsylvania ;
Major : I bare to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters of yesterday’s date,* received at a late hour last niglit, in one of which I am informed that the Commanding General directs you (me) to hold your (my) command in readiness to move at an early call from him.
It becomes my duty again to call your attention to the fact that three of the regiments of this division are not only without clothing, but also without arms or cartridge-boxes, camp equipage or cooking utensils of any description, and that there has not been a single cartridge-box issued to any one of the eight regiments of this division. Moreover, I yesterday made a more particular report that the muskets issued some days ago to the other regiments of the division are entirely unfit for service. Most of the springs of the locks are broken, and those that are not will not explode a cap. Some of the barrels are not in a condition to resist a discharge, and the alterations of some of them are so imperfect as to render them dangerous to those who use them, and it is the opinion of a gunsmith employed in one of the regiments, to endeavor to put them in order at their own expense, that a discharge of them would do more harm to those who attempted to fire them than they could do to an enemy in their front.
Under these circumstances, I protest against these men being sent into service with such arms and without the means of protecting their ammunition from the weather. My great reliance upon these men is their confidence in each other. Place them in front of an enemy without arms or ammunition upon which they can depend, and that confidence is gone. I would consider the responsibility which would rest upon me a heavy one wrere I not urgently to call the attention of the Government to this fact. The character of this city, of the State, and of the country, to say nothing of the officers and men connected with the command, requires me officially, as I now do, to place this statement upon record, and to ask for a board of survey to examine and report upon the condition of these arms.
In my former communication I omitted to state that some of the plugs in the vents were easily driven out, and holes in the sides of the nipples had been filled with putty. Many of the threads of the screws were imperfect, and many of the locks are so wood-bound that it is with difficulty they can be cocked.
I sent to you in my report, on the 4th instant, letters reporting these defects from the commanding officers of three regiments of this division —Colonel Patterson, Colonel Lewis, and Colonel Lyle—and I now inclose reports from Colonel Dare and from Colonel Gray upon the same subject. I repeat, that to send these regiments into service with such arms would be to discourage the command, and to give them a want of confidence in their superiors and in their Government.
I am, major, very respectfully, yours,
GEO. CADWALADEE,

I now say wThat I cannot officially, that General Cadwalader says if this force is moved without being better equipped the officers will resign. The guns are horrible, *and if a collision should arise the responsibility is fearful. The officers will not take it. I beg and implore that the order to advance on Baltimore will be suspended till General Patterson says move. We must be trusted and relied upon, and God knows neither of us will delay or hesitate to do what is right. The move towards Baltimore should not be made now; but if it be found that it can be done, at however much risk, it will be made.
Yours, truly,

Philadelphia—10 p. m.
Since the packages w^ere closed to you I have telegraphed for two* Ohio regiments to come here, and shall send them with the force to move on Baltimore. I called them in the hope of striking and stirring up Pennsylvania pride. They (the Ohioans), under McCook, will go forward at all risks. When I wrote the letter of General Patterson to-day I was not aware of any hesitating disposition on the part of any one. I then spoke for him of the impropriety of moving unorganized troops. I forced the plan, and am resolved to carry it out if it be possible, and if General Cadwalader won’t go, will try to push the affair through with those who are not so squirmish. It is true the arms are in a lamentable condition, and I fear to-day’s rain will ruin the ammunition and drive out more patriotism.
If you will authorize General Patterson to exercise his discretion about moving the Pennsylvania troops, 1 think I can push the matter through anyhow. At all events, unless you get notice by to morrow night’s train from here that the movement should not take place, you may consider it going on, and that the command will be before Baltimore on Thursday afternoon. The great uncertainty attending these movements must not discourage you and the General. Volunteers have elements of great inconsistency "to work upon, and I can say I never

[Secretary of War:]
Sir: I have given orders to detain all provisions and munitions of war that are attempted to be passed westward. I have given special directions for careful examinations of the express companies, to prevent them from carrying caps, of which the rebels are in great need. I have not as yet examined passengers’ baggage, although large quantities of caps might be easily forwarded under such designation. 1 await your directions upon this subject.
At first I was inclined to permit, and did permit, provisions to pass into Western Virginia, but I am not convinced of the good faith of those consignments, and I have, therefore, ordered all provisions to be stopped, revising my original order. I have permitted groceries (proper) to be forwarded, sucli as coffee, sugar, spices, fruits, &c. Since I have ;given the order, I have had a very full conversation with the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Mr. Garrett, who expressed doubts as to the policy we are pursuing. He avers that we are receiving much larger supplies of provisions from the West than we can by any possibility cut off, and that Governor Dennison, of Ohio, is most anxious to reopen communications through for the purpose of sending forward live-stock ; that no portion of the trains has been stopped at Harper’s Ferry, and that there may be hereafter no retaliation, and that it becomes important that the miners of Cumberland and Western Virginia should receive supplies from Baltimore, from whence he avers that they receive the most of their cured provisions. Although they have not stopped provisions on the trains at Harper’s Ferry, they have stopped live stock and the sheep, about which I wrote in my former dispatch, had gone from our reach before I received the orders from the Department. At present I am returning these provisions and stores to the consignees at Baltimore, although they would be of great use to the troops at Washington. Sending them back will save complications, but will probably result in their being sent forward by a more circuitous route.
Companies of volunteer troops are passing within about six miles of me daily. I have been in doubt whether or not to stop them. The principal question being, not of our ability so to do, but what we should do with them after we have detained them. I await instructions upon this point also.
Being in doubt as to which office I should apply for instructions, I have forwarded this in duplicate to the Commanding General and to the W ar Department.
I have been called upon by an association of butchers and provision dealers from Baltimore, who desire that an order shall be transmitted from the Commanding General allowing certain cattle, now stopped at Bellaire, to be transported, via Harrisburg, to Baltimore. I see no ob-

’ BENJ. F. BUTLEB, Brigadier- General, Commanding„
Grafton, Va., Ray 8,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington :
Dear Sir : You will see by Governor Letcher's late proclamation that Grafton is made a point for the concentration of the State volunteers. This has been arranged by the secession leaders in order to intimidate us, as this is one of the strongest Union towns in this section of the State. There is no avowed secessionist in our town, and our people are* very indignant at the proclamation of the governor, and are rapidly preparing to resist the entrance of troops unloyal to the Star-Spangled Banner into our town. I saw Mr. Carlile on Monday evening, and he informed me that there would be five thousand stand of arms at or opposite Wheeling in a few days, but unless some arrangement can be made with the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company, it will be very inconvenient for us to get them from there, a distance of one hundred miles. Can anything be done for us ? We are now enrolling men and drilling every day, collecting such arms as may be had, and manufacturing cartridges, &c., and preparing for a fight if Governor Letcher’s troops attempt to occupy our town.
Mr. Carlile opposes our being mustered into the United States service for home protection, but I cannot see why, and I do decidedly favor that plan, and can make a good company here for that purpose if thought advisable.
The Union men of Northwestern Virginia are becoming more firm every day. They want to see secession put down and the leaders hung, and I think, with a very little help and a good marshal, we are now about ready to take those among us. As an evidence of this, Judge Camden, who has been appointed to the Montgomery Congress, is not allowed to speak in his own town—Clarksburg, Harrison County—and in Morgantown, at a general muster on last Saturday, the regiment drove the colonel and brigadier-general (secessionists) from the field.

Sir : Tlie letter of General Cadwalader, dated May 1, with inelosurer on the subject of defective arms and deficient equipments, has been referred to the Colonel of Ordnance. Premising that circumstances entirely beyond the control of the existing government conspired to produce the unfortunate state of affairs represented, I will now communicate to you the remarks of the present Chief of the Ordnance Bureau, for the purpose of showing that it was beyond his power to avoid the. inconvenience referred to by General Cadwalader.
Ordnance Office, May 8, 1831.
Tlie arms within referred to were issued in compliance with an order of 19th April,, 1861, to the commanding officer of Frankford Arsenal by telegraph, per the Ordnance Office, to issue to General Patterson 5,000 smooth-bore muskets. The number of these arms at the arsenal was just 5,000, and no more or no other arms could possibly be issued. When, as in this case, and probably in many others, under the present excitement and pressure, the very best is done that the utmost industry and energy of officers can accomplish with the available means of the Government, such charges as the within are cruel and unjust. This department, and every officer in it, is just as anxious to supply the best arms to all the troops as they are to get them, but it is simply impossible to do so now.
Respectfully returned.

Lieutenant-Colonel Oi‘dnance.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Mr. William Prescott Smith,
Master of Transportation, Baltimore, Md.:
A telegram from General Patterson last evening says Colonel Patterson’s regiment, seven hundred and seventy-five aggregate and Sherman and Shepherd will be in Perryville to-night and off in the morning.
Another telegram just received from Sherman at Perryville says the vdioie force leaves for Washington this moment. Sherman’s command is a light battery with, say, seventy horse and six guns, besides six ammunition carriages, and his and Shepherd’s command have a little less than six hundred men, say, in all, thirteen hundred and fifty men. If all cannot be accommodated in one trip, the surplus may either encamp, near Fort McHenry or come by the Washington depot.

Major : I inclose report from Capt. T. H. Neill, U. S. Army, that Colonel Lyle’s muskets are entirely unserviceable. Captain Neill is now inspecting the arms of Colonel Lewis’ regiment, and will then in-

sped tlie muskets issued to the regiments under Colonel Morehead and Colonel Gray. I am under tlie impression that it will be found that the muskets issued to Colonel Morehead’s regiment are better than the others. Those of Colonel Lewis’ and Colonel Gray’s command are, I think, defective, I would respectfully suggest that other arms should be issued forthwith to the two companies of Colonel Gray’s regiment, under orders for Forts Mifflin and Delaware. Knapsacks and cartridge-boxes are very much wanted.
I have to report that there seems to be no prospect of obtaining clothing for the three regiments which have last been mustered into the service, commanded by Colonel Ballier, Colonel Gray, and Colonel Owen, unless it can be procured from the United States and charged to the State of Pennsylvania. No arms have been issued to the regiments of Colonel Ballier and Colonel Owen. It appears that the regiments here are now entirely neglected by the State authorities, wdio are sending everything to the regiments in the interior. This could readily be corrected by public opinion if it was generally known, but it is inexpedient to have such information communicated to our enemies. The present condition of these regiments is very unsatisfactory and demoralizing to their command.
I am, major, very respectfully, yours,
GEO. CADWALADER,
Brevet Major- General Commanding.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the Colonel of Ordnance. The arms replaced in my orders of to-day are of the third class, mentioned in the accompanying memorandum, and replaced by arms which have been sent here to Major Ruff and myself to arm these troops.

Philadelphia, Pa., May 9,1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington City :
Sir : I have the honor to report for the information of the General-in-Chief the departure at 10 a. m. to day from Perryville for Washington, via Baltimore, in compliance with instructions, Sherman’s battery, five companies Third Infantry, and Colonel Patterson’s regiment of artillery, armed as infantry. The General-in-Chief may rest assured that other regiments will be sent forward as rapidly as they are equipped, and no time will be lost in getting them out. Two Ohio regiments are within four miles of this city not equipped.
The railroad company hence to Baltimore will attempt, with our protection, to repair their bridges. If molested I shall throw the first force available forward on the road.
The failure of contractors to fulfill their engagements causes delay at
