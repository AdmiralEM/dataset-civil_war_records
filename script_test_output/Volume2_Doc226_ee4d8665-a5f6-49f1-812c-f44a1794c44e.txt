Congratulatory address from General McClellan.
Army of Occupation, Western Virginia,
Beverly, Va., July 16,1861.
Soldiers of the Army of the West!
I am more than satisfied with you.
You have annihilated two armies, commanded by educated and experienced soldiers, intrenched in mountain fastnesses fortified at their leisure. You have taken five guns, twelve colors, fifteen hundred stand of arms, one thousand prisoners, including more than forty officers— one of the two commanders of the rebels is a prisoner, the other lost his life on the field of battle. You have killed more than two hundred and fifty of the enemy, who has lost all his baggage and camp equipage. All this has been accomplished with the loss of twenty brave men killed and sixty wounded on your part.
You have proved that Union men, fighting for the preservation of our Government, are more than a match for our misguided and erring brethren; more than this, you have shown mercy to the vanquished. You have made long and arduous marches, often with insufficient food, frequently exposed to the inclemency of the weather. I have not hesitated to demand this of you, feeling that I could rely on your endurance, patriotism, and courage.
In the future I may have still greater demands to make upon you, still greater sacrifices for you to offer. It shall be my care to provide for you to the extent of my ability; but I know now that by your valor and endurance you will accomplish all that is asked.
Soldiers! I have confidence in you, and I trust you have learned to confide in me. Remember that discipline and subordination are qualities of equal value with courage.
I am proud to say that you have gained the highest reward that American troops can receive—the thanks of Congress and the applause of your fellow-citizens.

Reports of Brig. Gen. R. S. Garnett, C. S. Army, of preliminary operations , with correspondence, from June 25 to July 6.
Hdqrs. Department of Northwestern Virginia,
Camp at Laurel Hill, Va., June 25, 1861.
Sir: I reached Huttonsville on the 14th instant. I found there twenty-three companies of infantry, mostly mustered into service, but in a miserable condition as to arms, clothing, equipments, instruction, and discipline. Twenty of these companies were organized into two regiments, the one under Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson and the other under Lieutenant-Colonel Heck. Though wholly incapable, in my judgment, of rendering anything like efficient service, I deemed it of such importance to possess myself of the two turnpike passes over the Rich and Laurel Mountains, before they should be seized by the enemy, that I left Huttonsville on the evening of the 15th with these two regiments

and Captain Rice’s battery, and, by marching them a greater portion of the night, reached the two passes early in the afternoon of the following day, Colonel neck’s regiment and a section of artillery occupying the Buckhannon Pass, and Colonel Jackson, with the remaining section, taking up their position here.
I regard these two passes as the gates to the northwestern country, and, had they been occupied by the enemy, my command would have been effectually paralyzed or shut up in the Cheat River Valley. I think it was a great mistake on the part of the enemy not to have remained here after driving Colonel Porterfield’s command over it. I have caused all the country roads leading from the northwestern country, which cross this range of mountains between the foot of Cheat Mountain and Saint George, the county seat of Tucker County, to be blocked up by cutting large trees across them. I have done this to prevent the enemy from getting into my rear and cutting off my supplies, which, so far, I have been obliged to obtain chiefly from Staunton.
By sending out heavy escorts I am now endeavoring to collect grain and cattle, both from the direction of Philippi and Buckhannon. I have made Beverly for the present my principal depot. I propose in a few days to send the three small companies left at Huttonsville, six miles farther south, to the foot of Cheat Mountain, where, in a strong position, which I shall improve, I shall establish them, and deposit two days’ supplies for my entire command.
The road from Saint George to Cheat River Bridge, on the railroad, is a country road, and scarcely practicable for wheels. My last information, which is, of course, not very reliable, is that the enemy have blocked up this road from the Cheat Bridge to where it is crossed by the Northwestern turnpike, which leads by Evansville to Grafton. If this proves to be true, it will increase my difficulties in getting on this railroad very much. Should they have done the same thing on all the roads crossing the railroad from the south, they will have put the railroad, I fear, beyond the reach of my present force. This force I consider more than sufficient to hold these two passes, but not sufficient to hold the railroad, if I should get an opportunity of seizing it at any particular point; for I must have an adequate force in each of the passes to secure them for our use. My best chance of getting at the railroad seems at present to be by the Morgantown road, a road which leads from Yeager’s (see map) to Evansville. When once at Evansville, which is on the Northwestern turnpike, I should threaten equally Grafton (twelve miles distant) and Cheat Bridge (fourteen miles distant), at both of which points they now have a force which they would be compelled to keep in this position, and thus enable me to get at the road at Independence, five miles from Evansville, destroy it there, and then fall upon the force at Cheat Bridge (by marching on the railroad) before it could be re-enforced from Grafton. The objection to this operation is that it enables the enemy at Philippi to throw himself upon my rear. If, however, I had sufficient force to hold this post securely, my remaining force could regain it from Cheat Bridge, by way of Saint George, with a little work on that road; the roads from Philippi leading over the Laurel Mountain into that road, four in number, having, as I have already stated, been blocked up by me. My moving force (say three thousand), however, will not be sufficient, I fear, for this operation.
The various accounts which I get of the enemy’s strength (none positive or even reliable) represent him as having from four to seven thousand at Philippi, with from six to ten pieces of artillery, and that he is intrenched on the hill behind the town, about three thousand at Graf-

ton, three or four thousand at Clarksburg, and about two thousand at Cheat Bridge. I have been, so far, wholly unable to get anything like accurate or reliable information as to the numbers, movements, or intentions of the enemy, and begin to believe it almost an impossible thing. The Union men are greatly in the ascendency here, and are much more zealous and active in their cause than the secessionists. The enemy are kept fully advised of our movements, even to the strength of our scouts and pickets, by the country people, while we are compelled to grope in the dark as much as if we were invading a foreign and hostile country.
The Georgia regiment reached me yesterday. I hear nothing definite about the two remaining companies of the Twentieth Begiment, and the four remaining companies of Colonel Fulkerson’s. There has elapsed scarcely time for me to hear of the result of my application for two additional companies of cavalry. They are greatly needed here. The maps give very incorrect impressions as to the number of roads in this region of country.
I have heard nothing of the medical stores for my command, nor of other requisitions made on the Ordnance and Quartermaster’s Departments. I hope that they may be urged to fill them as speedily as possible. Many of my men are without blankets or tents*. The nights are frequently cold and we have frequent rains.
I shall have the defenses of this place complete in a week. The Buck-hannon Pass is naturally much stronger, and the regiment there will be able to hold five times their number in check for a sufficient time to admit of being re-enforced, if they will stand to their work.
At Philippi the enemy occupy the heights beyond the town, in the direction of Grafton. They have mined the bridge and thrown abatis in the ford. It is further said that they have blocked up the road on this side of Philippi. Until I can get some additional cavalry I shall not have adequate means of determining to what extent these reports are true.
This communication is rather lengthy, I fear, for the general to read, but, as I do not propose to trouble him often, I have deemed it best to report fully the condition of things under my command.
Two companies of infantry are being organized in Beverly, under Colonel Porterfield, whom I have assigned temporarily to the command of that place. Captain Bice’s company is also ordered to form part of his command, after turning over his battery to Captain Anderson. Accessions to my command come in very slowly.
No periodical muster rolls for June 30 have yet arrived, nor any other blank forms. The general’s order, in relation to the court of inquiry, had already been anticipated. The proceedings will be forwarded in a day or two. I was aware of the road by Stribling Springs, but it is impossible to cut off all communication with the enemy. The mass of the country people is against us.
I have already addressed several communications to General Cooper, and asked for instructions as to the proper person to address. Be pleased to inform me on this point.
At the end of this month I shall send a return of my force. I am pushing the instruction of the men with all possible activity.

Headquarters, Richmond, Va., July 1,1861. Gen. R. S. Garnett, Commanding Northwestern Army:
General : I have received your letter of the 25th instant [tilt.], reporting the condition and distribution of your force and your projected plan of operations. I have taken great pleasure in submitting it to the President, and trust you will be able to accomplish your purposes. The rupture of the railroad at Cheat River would be worth to us an army. The companies of the Twentieth and Thirty-seventh Regiments have been forwarded to you; also two companies of cavalry. Another squadron will be furnished if desired. I have ordered Capt. G. Jackson to report to you for duty with the cavalry. His commission will entitle him to precedence over officers of the same grade in the volunteer service. He is a cavalry officer of some experience. Everything that you have required has been sent as far as practicable. The remainder will be forwarded as fast as available. Muster rolls were sent some time since. Your correspondence can be addressed to this office as usual.
Yery respectfully,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.

Lieut. Col. George Deas,
Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : It is with great reluctance that I feel constrained to call for an addition to my present force, for I know that these calls are coming in upon the Government from all quarters of the State, and from some, perhaps, more immediately threatened than I am, as far as I know; but, with the railroad running across my entire front, I have become satisfied that I cannot operate beyond my present position with any reasonable expectation of substantial success, with the present force under my command, and I deem it my duty to state the fact. My hope of increasing my force in this region has, so far, been sadly disappointed. Only eight men have joined me here, and fifteen at Colonel Heck’s camp, not sufficient to make up my losses by discharges, &c. These people are thoroughly imbued with an ignorant and bigoted Union sentiment. Unless success was reduced to a certainty, it would be imprudent to abandon the passes I now hold, yet they cannot be held securely with less than two thousand men, which would reduce my movable force to twenty-five hundred. If the necessities of the Government could afford it, I should be glad to have three or four thousand more men; but I must content myself with asking for as many only as can be spared, in the judgment of the Government.
We hear, though with what truth it is impossible to say, that the enemy is receiving accessions to his force. Twenty-two car loads are reported to have re-enforced the force at Cheat Bridge. This and some other movements of the enemy seem to indicate an intention of getting in my rear from that point by the Saint George road, and this will require another division of my force, or compel me to fall back to Leadsville, where that road comes into this $ but this operation would lose this position to us. I shall transfer to-day Colonel Heck’s regiment to that road, and send five companies, under Colonel Hansborough, to relieve him in his present position, which is a strong one. If necessary, I shall send a regiment from this place to join Colonel Heck. The iron

guns will be very acceptable for this or the Buckhannon Pass. If I could get two others, it would give me the bronze batteries for service with my movable force.
I have been waiting anxiously for a quartermaster of experience, but none has yet appeared. It would relieve me of much labor and anxiety if I had a competent officer to take these duties off my shoulders. The muster rolls have not yet arrived.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. S. GABNETT, Brigadier- General.
P. S.—Unless I have been misinformed as to the state of feeling among the people and the condition of things in the Kanawha Valley, it is my opinion that General Wise’s command could be of more service to the cause by operating in the direction of Parkersburg and the Northwestern Bailroad. It would produce a very effective diversion in favor of the operations from this point.
B. S. GABNETT, Brigadier- General.
Headquarters, Richmond, Va., July 5,1861.
General B. S. Garnett, Laurel Hill, Va.:
General : In answer to your letter of the 1st instant, just received, I have the honor to state that the Forty-fourth regiment, Col. W. O. Scott, left here on the 2d instant for your command. There has been some delay in preparing the Georgia regiment for the field, but I hope to get it off to-morrow. It consists of over one thousand men, commanded by Col. Edward Johnson, an officer of experience. On the following day I will dispatch a North Carolina regiment, commanded by Col. Stephen Lee, twelve hundred strong. I will endeavor to send you two other field pieces. I will again apply to Colonel Myers for a quartermaster of experience for your command.

Lieut. Col. George Leas,
Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General:
Colonel: In the postscript to a communication which I had the honor to address to you a few days ago, I ventured to suggest the expediency of giving a more northerly direction to General Wise’s column, in order to threaten the railroad and country east of Parkersburg, now in possession of the enemy. Some subsequent information has confirmed me in my convictions as to the propriety of such a movement. I learned a day or two since, from sources in my front, that twenty-eight hundred men, who had been put upon light-draught steamers in Pittsburgh to operate in the Kanawha Valley, were diverted from that purpose and landed at Parkersburg, from which place they came to Clarksburg and thence to Buckhannon, where, with others from Philippi, to the number, it is said, of three or four thousand, they have now taken up their position, with a supporting force at Weston and at Clarksburg—numbers unknown. This latter point, it is said, they are forti-

fying, and making of it a place of detention for the secessionists whom they have arrested in the country occupied by their troops, and whom hitherto they have been sending to Ohio. It is my belief that as long as they can be made to apprehend any danger to their possession of the railroad and country in front of me they will not attempt any inroads in the Kanawha Valley, as the movement above reported indicates, and that one of the most effectual means of keeping that valley free of them 4s to occupy them fully here. I moreover think that if General Wise’s column should move from Charleston direct upon Parkersburg, by the road through Jackson, Wirt, and Wood Counties, it would have the effect, not of withdrawing any troops from my front, but of bringing others into Virginia from Ohio and the West, as it could be done with equal facility and rapidity, and greater safety. But if he were tore-trace his steps from Charleston to Summersville, in Nicholas County, and thence go to Bulltown, in Braxton, both of which counties are loyal to our cause, he would be within a day’s march of Weston, and threaten both it and Buckhannon, and the enemy would have to draw from his force in my front to meet him. Communication with me could be had by way of Huttonsville.
The valley of the Kanawha is comparatively loyal to our cause, and the force under General Floyd would be abundant to meet any force which it is probable the enemy will send into that region for the present.
The latest, and I believe the most accurate, information which I have yet received from the front is that the enemy has seven regiments of infantry at Philippi—say between five and six thousand men—and twenty pieces o^'artillery, two of which are mortars. I scarcely think they have as much artillery as. that stated. At Grafton, a few days ago, there were only a few hundred; at Clarksburg they are represented as having about three thousand men; at Weston two thousand, and at Cheat River Bridge from two to three thousand. I cannot learn whether they have artillery at this bridge, or whether they are erecting any defenses about it. General McClellan, at last accounts, was at Grafton. General Morris in command at Philippi. Were these numbers correct it would put their force in Northwestern Virginia at about seventeen thousand men, though I hardly think it can amount to that number. The term of service of one of the Indiana regiments at Philippi expired a few days ago, and I learn that they are now kept there by force. I do not now think it probable that the enemy, notwithstanding his superiority of numbers, will attempt to attack my position unless the necessity for his force elsewhere becomes very imperative, for the simple reason that he has as much of northwestern country as he probably wants. He could have possessed himself of more of the country after Colonel Porterfield’s retreat, if he had desired it, yet refrained from doing so. The onus is upon us to drive him out of the country he already holds, if we can. It is impossible for me or any one else, in my judgment, to say what numbers (within our means) are necessary to effect this. The facilities, on the one hand, which they possess at present, of throwing men in my front from other States, and the numbers they have disposable for this purpose, with, on the other hand, the slow process to which we are subjected in re-enforcing our force, will always enable them to exceed our numbers, whatever they may be, to any degree they may deem necessary 5 for secrecy in the movements of my re-enforcements in this disaffected country is a thing impossible. It then becomes a question which must be decided by the authorities of the Government, whether the mere paralyzation of a superior force of the enemy, in my rront, with the hope of seizing the railroad, if an opportunity should 1G r R—VOL 11

offer itself, is a sufficient object to warrant the maintenance of all our available force in this region; for as I have just said, I do not suppose that this force can ever obtain a strength, relative to that of the enemy, which would warrant us in offering him battle wherever we could meet him. I have by no means relinquished or abated my hope of being able, on some favorable occasion, to get at the road. But this is a contingency. The only certain result we can calculate upon is that our presence here will necessarily occupy a considerable force of the enemy, and, to that extent, relieve other points of the State where they might be employed against us. It is not for me to determine what the value of this very negative result is, but I have deemed it my duty to state the case as it presented itself to my judgment. I can only say I shall watch vigilantly, and strike whenever arid wherever I can see a reasonable hope of success.
Colonel Starke arrived yesterday, and I am gratified to learn that I am to have an addition to my force, and sufficient supplies to secure the health and efficiency of my command for the present. I am exhausting the country immediately around me of grain and other supplies, and the operation of supplying myself almost exclusively from Staunton is becoming a serious difficulty with me on account of the scarcity of transportation. The crops are backward in this region, and I shall not be able to draw from them earlier than the end of August.
I stated in my letter of the 1st instant that Colonel Heck’s regiment had been ordered to take up a position on the Saint George road, and that he had been relieved by Lieutenant-Colonel Hansborough’s battalion of five companies. This arrangement was countermanded in consequence of the appearance of the enemy in force at Buckhannon. Lieutenant-Colonel Hansborough took the positions on the Saint George road assigned to Lieutenant-Colonel Heck.

Your opinion as to the advantage of giving a more northerly direction to General Wise’s column will be communicated to that officer,! and it is hoped that he will find himself in a condition to conform to it, and that with your united columns you will be able to fall upon the enemy. I do not think it probable that the enemy will confine himself to that portion of the northwest country which he now holds, but, if he can drive you back, will endeavor to penetrate as far as Ptaunton. Your object will be to prevent him, if possible, and to restrict his limits within the narrowest range, which, although outnumbered, it is hoped by skill and boldness you will accomplish.
Your recommendation of the appointment of Mr. G. Thomas Getty a lieutenant in the 0. S. Army will be complied with, and also the promotions of Capts. R, G. Cole and Julius A. De Lagnel. Should you feel embarrassed by the present rank of Capt. G. Jackson you will please

say so. Mr. S. M. Yost will also be appointed assistant quartermaster. The officers whom you state you have found in that region were appointed by the governor, in the hope that their standing and political influence would enable them to organize regiments of volunteers. The appointment of Col. L. Wilson has not been confirmed by the convention. He is, therefore, not in the service. Maj. P. B. Adams is the major of the Thirty-fifth Virginia Begiment, whom you were directed, in a previous letter, to cause to report to Col. Alfred Beckley. W. L. Jackson was appointed lieutenant-colonel of the same regiment. The regiments commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Heck and Lieutenant-Colonel Jack-son, I presume, are the Twenty-fifth, of which G. A. Porterfield is colonel, and the Thirty-first, of which W. J. Willey is colonel. Should I be correct, please number them accordingly, and inform me the field officers which you have attached to them. Should Lieutenant-Colonel Arnett, Maj. Boston Stewart, Second Lieut. J. Bosworth, Second Lieut. B. Haymond, and Lieutenant torment have no commauds with the troops of your army, and be unable to organize any volunteer companies, please let me know. I am glad to hear that the troops and articles forwarded you have reached you in safety. A Georgia regiment, Col. E. Johnson, and a North Carolina regiment, Col. S. Lee, are on their way to join you.

Commanding, (fie., Charleston, Va.:
General: In a letter received to-day from General Garnett, commanding Northwestern Army, he reports having learned from reliable sources that two thousand eight hundred men, who had been embarked on light draught steamers at Pittsburgh to operate in the Kanawha Valley, have been diverted from that purpose and landed at Parkersburg, from which place they have been advanced to Clarksburg and Buckhannon, and with other troops have taken up their position in his front. He thinks they will not attempt an invasion of the Kanawha Valley if made to apprehend danger of losing possession of the Northwestern Bailroad and country, and that one of the most effective means of keeping that valley free is to give General McClellan full occupation where he now is. He thinks that if your column should move from Charleston direct upon Parkersburg it would merely have the effect of bringing further re-enforcements from Ohio; but if it were to march from Summersville, in Nicholas County, to Bulltown, in Braxton, both of which are loyal to our cause, it would be within a few days’ march of Weston, and would threaten both it and Buckhannon, and that the enemy would thus be divided, and might be struck at in detail. Communication with General Garnett can be had by way of Hutton sville. He estimates the enemy’s force at six thousand men; at Grafton, a few hundred; at Clarksburg, about three thousand; at Weston, two thousand; and at Cheat Biver Bridge, from two to three thousand; making a total of about seventeen thousand men. General McClellan was said to be in command at Grafton and General Morris at Philippi.

I cannot yet tell the extent of the disaster, but fear, from Colonel Scott’s retrograde movement, that it is serious, and also much fear that General Garnett will at least lose all his wagons and baggage going through Hardy.
Mr. Hughes, a member of the Convention, from the county of Ban-dolph, I think, was sent by Colonel Scott to Colonel Pegram, and was killed by our own men. Captain De Lagnel was dangerously wounded, and reported left on the field. Give my orders by telegraph as anything occurs. Please see the Quartermaster-General. I wrote to him by to-day’s mail, and you will see, from his letter, that I need instructions to purchase horses for the transportation required. I have asked to be furnished with $20,000.

President Davis:
Oar force has retreated to Monterey. We have no certain knowledge that the enemy have taken possession of Cheat Mountain in force. We hope that by prompt action it can be taken and held by our troops with suitable re-enforcements. Certainly they can hold other mountains west of Monterey. The enemy is in possession of Cheat Mountain, and still more at Monterey will find free passage to the Central Railroad, and to the valley in rear of General Johnston, unless vigorously opposed. There is a turnpike road from Huttonsville to Huntersville, and thence to the Warm Springs, and thence to the Central Railroad at Millborough, as well as to Jackson’s River and Lewisburg, from Monterey to the Warm Springs, and to Hardy County. There are turnpike roads to prevent the enemy coming from the direction of Warm Springs, or northeastwardly into the valley. We should hold Cheat Mountain, or be as neat it as possible, so as to threaten his rear and flank in any movement he makes, besides checking his advance in this direction, and keeping command of several roads for the advance of our troops. A force may be sent also to Jackson’s River, by the Central Railroad, or by canal and turnpike from Lynchburg. A piece or two of artillery, with powder, lead, and buckshot, for the militia, should be sent with this force. They cannot be bought in this county. Without prompt action a local reverse may become a general disaster. Excuse these suggestions.

Major-General Lee:
Lieutenant Smith, of Lee’s Rifles, just arrived, reports that the fight commenced about 4 p. m., and lasted about one hour and a half. The enemy outnumbered us ten to one. We repulsed them three times. We lost forty killed and prisoners. Among the killed, Captain De Lagnel. We killed quite one hundred and fifty of the enemy. Captain Curry, who was wounded, came down the hill to the fort, and was the only one who did. The men in the engagement were not re-enforced from Heck’s command, because he was fearing an attack from the front, the enemy being in view. Heck brought his regiment out of the fortifications to retreat, about 11 o’clock at night, by order of Pegram, who had returned from the battle-field, hurt from a fall from his hors’e. Heck formed in the road, Lilley’s company in front, and started through the mountains in the dark, and soon got separated, about three hundred having arrived at Monterey. Nearly the whole of Pegram’s regiment are safe. It is

Dear Sir : After your dispatch of to-day, I have informed all that no company would be received as a volunteer company for less than three years or the war, except those companies that were in process of organization before the proclamation.
I would earnestly suggest for your consideration and prompt action the great importance of fortifying Cheat Mountain, and sending forces on the right and left, so as to guard the road from Huttonsville to Huntersville, and prevent the enemy from approaching the Central Railroad, at either Millborough or Jackson’s River, and from near Beverly, through Hardy and Pendleton, and thence to Rockingham, in rear of General Johnston. I would call your attention to the fact that there is a very good road down on the eastern base of Cheat Mountain to Huntersville.
Our retreat, in my opinion, to Monterey, is disastrous to us. If not changed, by marching at once upon Cheat Mountain and taking possession of it and fortifying it, so that we can hold them in check in front, and flank them on the right and left, the retreat to Monterey will havo a very demoralizing effect upon our people. And I would urge upon you the great importance of keeping the enemy from ever touching this country, for Union men, in great numbers, would be found here in this county, and other counties in the valley, if the Federal troops were here in force to protect them. It is necessary, to keep all our people loyal, to keep the enemy from having an opportunity to tamper with many of them. Of course, I would not express this opinion where it would be spoken of, as it would have a bad effect; but I assure you it is nevertheless true.
I hope you will not consider me as desiring to press my opinions, but my knowledge of the country induces me to make these suggestions. I feel confident that if Colonel Scott had gone to the aid of Colonel Pegram we would have gained a victory instead of meeting with a serious defeat. The enemy displayed no courage after defeating us on the top of Rich Mountain, or the whole force at Camp Garnett would have been cut to pieces. If President Davis would take twelve-months’ yolunteers, the call for the militia could be turned to a good account.
Yery respectfully,	M. G. HARMAN,
Major, Commanding.
Staunton, Ya., July 16,1861. President Davis and Col. George Deas :
Below is a dispatch from General Jackson. Send on re-enforcements. I will prepare transportation:
Camp at Monterey, Ya., July 15, 1861. Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-Genei'al:
Reliable information received that General Garnett, on his retreat from Laurel Hill, through the counties of Tucker and Hardy, towards this point, was pursued and

attacked in the rear several times by the enemy and defeated; that on Saturday he himself was killed, and it would seem that his command had been routed and dispersed. It is reported that Colonel Heck surrendered. The enemy may advance upon this line towards Staunton, or upon the line by Huntersville and the Warm Springs, to the Central Railroad. Speedy re-enforcements, especially of engineers and artillery, are'needed, to enable us to hold our position should he advance. The effective force under my command amounts to from twenty-five hundred to three thousand men, with three pieces of artillery—G-pounders. More circumstantial accounts will be transmitted at the earliest moment.
HENRY R. JACKSON, Brigadier-General.
Will inform you as further details reach me. Allow me to establish a pony express from this place to Monterey and Winchester.
M. G. HARMAN,
Major, Commanding.

Establish both pony expresses without delay. I will do all in my power to comply with General Jackson’s request. Send all reliable information to me.
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
Headquarters Forces,
Staunton, Fa., July 16, 1861. Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant- General:
Dear Sir : Inclosed is a communication sent you by telegraph, after waiting hours for the office to open.* It is most important that the telegraph offices should be open night and day, and that we should have a through connection between Richmond and Staunton, instead of having a relay at Gordonsville, and thereby creating great delay. The instrument at this office is nearly worn-out, as I months ago informed the superintendent of the telegraph line at Richmond in person. See that these matters are corrected.
Yours, very respectfully,
M. G. HARMAN,
Major, Commanding.
P. S.—I have asked the President to allow me to establish a pony express from this place to Monterey and Winchester. By all means, ammunition of all sorts should be sent to this point immediately. I have been notified to report at Richmond, for settlement of my accounts as quartermaster, on the 15th of this month. My accounts are all ready, but the present unfortunate state of affairs will prevent my attendance. Is anything necessary for me to do in regard to it? Please advise me.
