July 6 to 15.
Buckhannon, July [6], 1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend :
Have directed movement in force up the Great Kanawha, and other movements of troops covering nearly the whole of Western Virginia. My advance guard goes at 4 in the morning to occupy the Middle Fork Bridge. By the 8th or 9th at latest I expect to occupy Beverly, fighting a battle in the mean while. I propose to drive the enemy over the mountains towards Staunton, and expect your further orders by telegraph whether to move on Staunton on the south or towards Wytheville.

Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. (7. :
Colonel : My advance guard, consisting of the Fourth and Mnth Ohio, Loomis’ Michigan battery, and Burdsal’s Ohio dragoons, under the command of Col. E. L. McCook, moves at 4 a. m. to-morrow to seize the Middle Fork Bridge, twelve miles from here. The headquarters will follow as soon as the transportation arrangements can be completed— say by 9 a. m. Two regiments of Bosecrans’ brigade will move in the morning. Another regiment of Sehleich’s brigade would have moved in support of the advance guard but for an unfortunate blunder in sending out a scouting party without my knowledge. This party is in trouble, and I have been obliged to send out a large portion of the Third Ohio to cover its retreat.
I expect to attack the enemy on the 8th or 9th. He is intrenched on Eich Mountain. I have to-day ordered General Morris to advance in the morning from Philippi with his command (sixty-two companies and one battery) to within one and a half miles of the Laurel Mountain, where the enemy is strongly intrenched. His instructions are to observe them closely and to follow rapidly any movement in retreat, but not to attack until he hears that I have carried Beverly.
I have instructed General Cox to occupy Eipley with one regiment, and to move with four on Charleston and the Gauley Bridge, the Eipley regiment supporting the movement. He is to reopen the navigation of the Kanawha, and when Gauley is occupied will open a communication with me via Summersville and Bulltown. Six companies are to occupy California, the county seat of Roane; four to hold Wirt County Court-House; six companies, Glenville; two, Weston; eight, Bulltown; four, Frenchtown; two, French Creek. At least four will hold this place after we advance.
I hope the General-in-Chief will regard these orders as prudent and efficacious. I hope in a few days to occupy all that portion of Western Virginia that is in my department; to restore order; establish the authority of the provisional go vernment, and to quell the secession feeling. I have taken the liberty of going somewhat beyond my department, and have instructed General Cox to occupy Barboursville and Guyan-dotte. If circumstances permit, and the General does not object, I would be glad, after securing all the country north of the Great Kanawha, to move on Wytheville and cut off the railroad communication. I shall soon be prepared to do that or move on Staunton, as the General may direct.
Hoping that my movements may meet his approval, I am, very truly, yours,

Col. E. D. Townsend:
My advance guard, under Col. B. L. McCook, consisting of Fourth and Ninth, and one battery and one company of cavalry, has occupied Middle Fork Bridge, twelve miles east. Tenth Indiana has moved up in support. Headquarters and four regiments, with one battery and one company of cavalry, move east to-morrow. Supply train now arriving. Three Indiana regiments march to-morrow. Enemy said to be intrenched in force in my front. Cannot rely on reports. Will not learn what I have met until the advance guard comes in contact. I will be prepared to fight whatever is in front of me. One of my parties surprised a party near Weston last night and took prisoners six armed men with their horses. Another party of fifty killed at least seven of the enemy, and lost one man killed and five wounded. Brought off all the wounded and the arms of the killed. Advance guard received the body .to-day. The men are in magnificent spirits for a battle. The only trouble will be to restrain them.

Major- General.
Buckhannon, July 7,1801. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Newspaper reports say that my department is to be broken up. I hope the General will leave under my control both the operations on the Mississippi and in Western Virginia. If he cannot do so, the Indiana and Ohio troops are necessary to my success. With these means at my disposal, and such resources as I command in Virginia, if the Government will give me ten thousand arms for distribution in Eastern Tennessee I think I can break the backbone of secession. Please instruct whether to move on Staunton or on to Wy theville.* I thank the General for his commendation, and hope to deserve rather in the future than in the past. Please enforce the occupation of Cumberland and Piedmont. The condition of things in that vicinity renders it absolutely necessary to occupy both these points, and you will remember that my command does not extend that far. I cannot too strongly impress upon you the necessity of holding these points. The Pennsylvania State troops now in the vicinity of Cumberland will answer the purpose perfectly well.

E. D. TOWNSEND.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Middle Fork Bridge, Va., July 10, 1861. To Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend :
In sight of the enemy, who is strongly intrenched and holds firm. A strong armed reconnaissance is now starting out. I think I can turn his position; feel sure of success in any event. This country exceedingly difficult to operate in. My other column from Philippi is also within a mile of the intrenchments on Laurel Hill; advanced guards within two hundred yards of the enemy on each line; all my men eager for the fight. The companies at Glenville are safe, and favorable chance of cutting off O. J. Wise. I shall make no further extended movement without laying the whole case before the General and obtaining his orders in advance. Wish to clear my department fully of the enemy, and then be ready to carry out the views of the General-in-Chief. Can shorten distance from base by adopting a new base in event of extended operations.
Please send me more regular officers; some old regiments, if possible. I want those mountain guns at once. I have great difficulties to meet, but have gone into them knowing that the General will give me support as I need it, and that he will appreciate my position.

Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Rich Mountain, Va.—9 a. m., 12th, [July, 1861.] Col. E. D. Townsend :
We are in possession of all the enemy’s works up to a point in sight of Beverly. Have taken all his guns, a very large amount of ivagons, tents, &c.—everything he had. A large number of prisoners, many of whom wounded. Several officers prisoners. They lost many killed. We have lost in all perhaps twenty killed and forty wounded, of w hom all but two or three in the column under Bosecrans, which turned the position. Mass of enemy escaped through the woods entirely disorganized. Among prisoners, Dr. Taylor, formerly of the Army. Colonel Pegram wras in command.
Bosecrans’ column left camp yesterday morning and marched some eight miles through the mountains, reaching turnpike some two or three miles in rear of the enemy. Defeated an advance force, taking a couple of guns. I had position ready for twelve guns near main camx>, and as guns were moving up ascertained that enemy had retreated. I am now Xiushing on to Beverly, a part of Bosecrans’ trooi>s being now within three miles of it. Our success complete and almost bloodless. Doubt whether Wise and Johnston will unite and overpower me. Behavior of troops in action and towards prisoners admirable.

Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Camp at Beverly, Fa., July 12—8 p. m.
Colonel : I have the honor to inform you that the army under my command has gained a decisive victory, which seems to have accomplished the objects of my march. I turned the enemy’s very strong in-trenchments on Rich Mountain yesterday with General Rosecrans’ brigade of four regiments and one company of cavalry. He had a spirited action with a large party of the enemy (who had two guns) on the summit of the mountain, captured both guns, and killed a large number of the enemy.
This morning, as we were in the act of moving twelve guns into a position commanding the enemy’s intrenchments by a road cut last evening, it was ascertained that he had left in the utmost confusion. We have all his guns (six in number), all his wagons, tents, &c. The number of killed, wounded, and prisoners is large. Our loss very small— about 11 killed and 35 wounded.
I advanced at once on Beverly, and occupied it with the least possible delay, thus cutting off Garnett’s retreat on Huttonsville, and forcing him to take the Leedsville and Saint George road. I have ordered General Morris to press him closely, and have also given instructions by telegraph which will throw from 5,000 to 6,000 men and four guns in his front, so that there is good reason to hope that we may yet capture him. I shall move on Huttonsville to-morrow morning, and endeavor to seize the Cheat Mountain pass before the enemy can occupy it in strength. With that pass seized, the position on Cheat River (near Rowlesburg) strongly occupied, and the Gauley Bridge held, as it probably is by this time, by General Cox, I think we shall have placed the occupation of Western Virginia on a safe basis. After reaching Huttonsville I can determine better than I now can whether it will be advisable to occupy the Greenbrier Valley at present.
I hope to be able to give you to-morrow full details of the transactions of the last few days. I advanced so rapidly to this place that it is not now in my power. We occupy here a very strong defensive position. We are constantly picking up more prisoners.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
geo. b. mcclellant,
Major-General, U. 8. Army.
Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington.
Captured official papers show Garnett’s force to have been 10,000 men. Please give instructions as to the disposition to be made of the prisoners of war. I shall for the present order them to Columbus, Ohio. We have several officers, among them Dr. Taylor, formerly of the Medical Corps, TJ. S. Army.
G. B. McC.
Beverly, Va., July 13,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend :
Success of to-day is all that I could desire. We captured six brass cannon, of which one is rifled, all their camp equipage and transportation, even to his tents. The number of tents will probably reach two hundred, and more than sixty wagons. Their killed and wounded will amount to fully one hundred and fifty; at least one hundred prisoners, and more coming in constantly. I know already of ten officers killed

and prisoners. Their retreat complete. Occupied Beverly by a rapid inarch.
Garnett abandoned his camp early this morning, leaving much of his equipage. He came within a few miles of Beverly, but our rapid march turned him back in great confusion, and he is now retreating on the road to Saint George. I have ordered General Morris to follow him up closely. I have telegraphed for the two Pennsylvania regiments at Cumberland to join General Hill at Bowlesburg. The general is concentrating all his troops at Bowlesburg to cut off Garnett7s retreat near West Union, or, if possible, Saint George, f may say that we have driven out some ten thousand troops strongly intrenched, with the loss of eleven killed and thirty-five wounded.
Provision returns found here show Garnett’s force to have been ten thousand men. They were Eastern Virginians, Georgians, Tennesseeans, and, I think, Carolinians. To-morrow I can give full details as to prisoners, &c. Will move on Huttonsville to-morrow, and endeavor to seize the Cheat Mountain pass, where there are now but few troops. I hope that General Cox has by this time driven Wise out of the Kanawha Valley. In that case I should have accomplished the object of liberating Western Virginia. I hope the general will approve my operations.
geo. b. McClellan,
Major- General, Com manding.
Headquarters, July 13,1881.
Gen. McClellan, Beverly, Va:
The General-in-Chief, and what is more, the Cabinet, including the President, are charmed with your activity, valor, and consequent successes of Rich Mountain the 11th,, and of Beverly this morning. We do not doubt that you will in due time sweep the rebels from Western Virginia, but we do not mean to precipitate you, as you are fast enough.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Huttonsville, Va., July 14,1861.
Colonel Townsend :
Garnett and forces routed; his baggage and one gun taken; his army demoralized; Garnett killed. We have annihilated the enemy in Western Virginia, and have lost thirteen killed, and not more than forty wounded. We have in all killed at least two hundred of the enemy, and their prisoners will amount to at least one thousand. Have taken seven guns in all. I still look for the capture of the remnant of Garnett’s army by General Hill. The troops defeated are the crack regiments of Eastern Virginia, aided by Georgians, Tennesseeans, and Carolinians. Our success is complete, and secession is killed in this country.

to Staunton, and I have the pleasure to announce that, with the exception of the Kanawha, the part of Western Virginia included in my department is now free from the presence of the enemy. I expect every day to hear that the measures taken to drive Wise out of the Kanawha have proved successful. I shall now proceed to scour the country with small columns, unless the moral effect of our successes has sufficed to disperse the guerrilla bands. The three-months’ regiments are to be reorganized, and some time will be required to prepare this hastily-organized army for further operations.
The general’s kind telegraph is received. Offer him my thanks for it.
GEO. B. McCLELLAN.
Hdqrs. Army of Occupation Western Virginia,
Camp near Huttonsville, July 14, 1861.
Colonel : I have the honor to submit, for the information of the Commanding General, the following report of the operations of the forces under my command from the time of my leaving Grafton. Previous to my departure from Grafton I became satisfied that a large body of the rebel army, supposed to consist of six or seven thousand men, under Brig. Gen. Bobert S. Garnett, formerly of the U. S. Army, occupied an intrenched position at Laurel Hill, about thirteen miles south of Phi-lippi, on the turnpike leading to Beverly, with the apparent intention of making a determined stand at that point; whereupon I at once resolved to push on with all the available force at my disposal, and endeavor, by making a rapid detour through Buckhannon, to reach Beverly, and strike their rear, cutting off their supply communication from Staunton.
As soon as I had concentrated my forces at Buckhannon I moved forward, and at the same time ordered General Morris to advance from Philippi, and take a commanding position about a mile and a half distant, and directly opposite the enemy’s works, thereby enabling him to divert their attention from me, also to watch their movements, and be in position to act promptly after I had reached their rear, at Beverly. General Morris promptly responded to my order, and secured the proper position with but slight resistance, and I pushed forward with my column as rapidly as my means of transportation would permit.
On the evening of the 9th instant I arrived at Roaring Creek, near the base of Rich Mountain, where I found the enemy in considerable force had destroyed a bridge, and were strongly intrenched at a point where the road enters a defile leading up the mountain, about two miles distant from my camp.
On the morning of the 10th I ordered a reconnaissance in force, consisting of the Ninth and Fourth Ohio Volunteers, and Loomis’ battery, under the supervision of Lieutenant Poe, Topographical Engineers. This was pushed within two hundred yards of the enemy’s guns, and resulted in the loss of one man killed and one wounded, but the dense thickets with which their works were surrounded prevented the attainment of much positive or satisfactory information. It served, however, to confirm my previous supposition, that the intrenchments were held by a large force, with several guns in position to command the front approaches, and that a direct assault would result in a heavy and unnecessary loss of life.
These considerations at once determined me to make an effort to turn their flank and commence the attack from the rear. Accordingly I ordered General Rosecrans to move at 4 o’clock in the morning with the Nineteenth Ohio, the Eighth, Tenth, and Thirteenth Indiana Regiments, and

Burdsal’s dragoons, to cut liis way through the almost impenetrable thickets of brush to the lofty summit of Rich Mountain, at Hart’s farm, about five miles distant, and to move thence at once down the turnpike road and attack the intrenchments in rear, and during the progress of his march to communicate with me every hour. The remainder of the force under my command to be held in readiness to assault in front as soon as Rosecrans’ musketry should indicate that he was immediately in their rear.
The order to General Rosecrans to advance to attack the rear of the enemy’s lower intrenchments was not carried out, but his brigade remained at Hart’s farm during the remainder of the day and the night, and I received no communication from him after about 11 o’clock a. m., when he was still distant about a mile and a half from Hart’s farm.
About the time I expected the general to reach the rear of their intrenchments I moved up all my available force to the front, and remained in person just in rear of the advance pickets, ready to assault when the indicated moment should arrive.
In the mean time I sent Lieutenant Poe to find such a position for our artillery as would enable us to command the works. Late in the afternoon I received his report that he had found such a place. I immediately detailed a party to cut a road to it for our guns, but it was too late to get them into position before dark, and as I had received no intelligence whatever of General Rosecrans’ movements, I finally determined to return to camp, leaving merely sufficient force to cover the working party. Orders were then given to move up the guns with the entire available infantry at daybreak the following morning. As the troops were much fatigued, some delay occurred in moving from camp, and just as the guns were starting intelligence was received that the enemy had evacuated their works and fled over the mountains, leaving all their guns, means of transportation, ammunition, tents, and baggage behind.
Then, for the first time since 11 o’clock the previous day, I received a communication from General Rosecrans, giving me the first intimation that he had taken the enemy’s position at Hart’s farm, from which it appeared that he, with great difficulty and almost superhuman efforts on the part of his men, had forced his way up the precipitous side of the mountain, and at about 1 p. m. reached the summit, where he encountered a portion of the enemy’s force, with two guns in position behind earth and log works—affording protection to their men.
The attack was commenced by the enemy with heroic spirit and determination. They opened upon the advance of our column with volleys of musketry and rapid discharges of canister, killing several of our men, and at first throwing them into some confusion. They, however, soon rallied, and returned a brisk and accurate fire, which told with terrible effect in the enemy’s ranks—killing and wounding nearly every man at their guns. The troops then advanced, continuing their well-directed fire, until they drove the enemy from their position, and caused them to take flight down the turnpike towards their intrenchments at the base of the mountain.
The troops then encamped on the battle-field at about 2 o’clock p. m., and remained there until the following morning, when I made a rapid march and occupied Beverly. I here learned that General Garnett, as soon as he discovered we were approaching his rear and had cut off his retreat in this direction, abandoned his intrenchments at Laurel Hill, leaving his tents and other property, and had irade a hasty retreat in the night over a rough country road leading towards Saint

George. General Morris had been repeatedly instructed by me to keep a close watch upon Garnett’s movements, and to be ready the moment he retreated to follow him up vigorously with all his available force, and crush him if possible 5 but, much to my surprise, when he discovered that Garnett had escaped, he only sent a portion of his force about eight miles, and then halted it for several hours, to communicate with me and bring up re-enforcements. This detention gave Garnett the opportunity to get far in advance, and had it not been for the rapid and well-directed march of the advance, conducted by Captain Benham, it is believed that the rebel general would have escaped unharmed. Captain Benham is entitled to great praise for his prompt and energetic movement upon Garnett’s rear, the result of which will be seen from his report inclosed. This shows that General Garnett and about twenty others of the enemy were killed, and fifty prisoners and two stands of colors and one rifle cannon taken, besides the baggage train and a large amount of other property. I take very great pleasure in recommending Captain Benham to the especial notice of the General in-Chief. Immediately after learning that Garnett had retreated, I ordered Brigadier-General Hill, commanding at Grafton, to assemble all his disposable force, and endeavor, by a rapid march upon Saint George or West Union, to cut off the retreat of the rebels, but I have not yet heard the result of his movement. My last advices this evening report General Hill’s advance within four miles of the retreating rebels.
I have not time now to notice individual acts of merit and bravery displayed in the recent conflicts, but shall take an early opportunity of presenting them to you in detail. I cannot, however, let the present occasion pass without making mention of the services of Brigadier-General Rosecrans in conducting his command up the very precipitous sides of the mountains and overcoming the formidable obstacles which impeded his progress} also for the very handsome manner in which he planned and directed his attack upon the rebels at Hart’s farm, carrying them after a stout and determined resistance.
I also conceive it to be due to my volunteer aide-de-camp, Col. F. W. Lander, to speak of his services in this connection. He, by the request of General Rosecrans, accompanied his column, and by his experience assisted materially in conducting the troops over a most difficult country, and displayed extraordinary activity and courage in the battle. He escaped unhurt, having the horse under him disabled by a canister shot.
I pursued the retreating rebels yesterday as far as Cheat River, and became satisfied that they would not stop short of Staunton. I therefore returned to this camp, which commands the communication between Eastern and Western Virginia, over the Staunton and Parkersburg turnpike.
General Garnett’s command when last heard from were retreating in great confusion near the North Branch of the Potomac, on the road leading from West Union to Williamsport.
I trust I will not be regarded as merely conforming to a formula when I express the great obligations due to my personal and general staff, who by their good judgment, untiring energy, and cool conduct have enabled me to overcome the inevitable difficulties of an imperfect and hasty organization, and to accomplish whatever good results have been achieved. As far as I have myself observed and learned from their officers, the conduct of the volunteers who participated in the actions at Rich Mountain and at Oarrick’s Ford was unexceptionable. They invariably displayed an ardent desire to meet the enemy, and

[Chap. IX.
great gallantry in action, and in my judgment all they require to make good and reliable soldiers is a little more drill and discipline.
The results of the action at Eich Mountain, as nearly as can be ascertained, were as follows:
Our loss in killed, 12; wounded, 59; no prisoners. The loss of the enemy in killed, 135 $ wounded and prisoners not yet reported, as near as can be determined between 800 and 900. Two brass 6-pounder cannon, a large number of muskets, two stands of colors, and other property were taken. Two 6-pounder brass cannon were captured at the lower intreochments with a large wagon train, with horses and a large number of tents.
But the really important results of these operations are the complete rout and annihilation of the rebel forces; the capture of one and the death of the other of their leaders; that this portion of Western Virginia is entirely freed from their presence, and that there is now not one single organized band of the rebels on this side of the mountain north of the Kanawha Valley.
After my arrival at Beverly I received a note from Colonel Pegram, containing a proposition to surrender his command as prisoners of war. This note with my reply are inclosed. His command, consisting of 33 commissioned officers and 560 men, are now prisoners.
