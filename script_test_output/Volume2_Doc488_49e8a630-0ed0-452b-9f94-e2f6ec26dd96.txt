By order of Brevet Major-General Oadwalader :
THOS. IT. NEILL, Captain, Fifth Infantry, A. A. A. G.
Washington, May 16, 1861. Bvt. Maj. Gen. G. Oadwalader, IT. S. A.,
Commanding Department of Annapolis, Baltimore, Md.:
Sir : I have already, by the direction of the General-in-Chief, addressed to you a letter and a telegram of yesterday’s date, and have received your acknowledgment of the letter. Herewith you will receive a power to arrest persons under certain circumstances, and to hold them prisoners though they should be demanded by writs of habeas corpus.
This is a high and delicate trust, and, as you cannot fail to perceive, to be executed with judgment and discretion. Nevertheless, in times of civil strife, errors, if any, should be on the side of safety to the country. This is the language of the General-in-Chief himself, who desires an early report from you on the subject of the number of troops deemed necessary for your department.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—The Lieutenant-General desires me to add that he has just been instructed by highest authority to cause Mr. Boss Winans, of Baltimore, now a military prisoner at Fort McHenry, to be liberated on condition of his written parole, to this effect: u I solemnly give my parole of honor that I will not openly or covertly commit any act of hostility against the Government of the United States pending existing troubles or hostilities between the said Government and the Southern seceded States, or any one of them.”
Headquarters Department of Annapolis,
Baltimore, May 16, 1861.
To Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I have already written two letters to you to-day in reply to your two letters of yesterday’s date,* and have since received your letter
Only one letter found.

of this date. In regard to the number of troops deemed necessary for this department, I have already in my letters of this date expressed the difficulty which I experience in forming an opinion from not having had time since my arrival to visit any other of this department, or to converse or receive reports from any officer in command of troops.
In forming any opinion upon this subject I would be guided by a consideration of the question of a probability of an advance of hostile troops, of which probability I have no means of obtaining information. Should no such advance take place, I should suppose one or two regiments here sufficient for present protection, if there should be nothing to develop the hidden and stifled sympathies which certainly exist, and of which I have the candid admission of persons of high standing here, who assume to be in favor of the Government and the Union, but who would immediately take part against it if their fears of the consequences were removed.
On receipt of your letter, which gave me the first official [information] I had that Mr. Boss Winans was a military prisoner at Fort McHenry, I sent an officer to read to him the condition of the written parole, upon acceptance of which I was instructed to liberate him. The result was that Mr. Winans signed the parole and was immediately liberated. I inclose the parole duly signed and witnessed.
I have to report that on leaving Philadelphia three regiments of the First Division of Pennsylvania Volunteers, commanded by Colonels Ballier, Gray, and Owen, mustered into the service of the United States (and not then furnished with clothing and equipments), were directed to remain until properly equipped. The regiments of Colonels Dare and Nagle are fully equipped, and are stationed upon the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Eailroad near to Havre de Grace and Perry ville. They could, if it was desired, be brought forward immediately and replaced by the regiments before mentioned or by two regiments from Ohio that were in camp near Philadelphia when I left there. I think it proper to mention the fact, although having nothing to do with my present command.
The power to arrest persons under certain circumstances, and to hold them prisoners though they should be demanded by writs of habeas corpus, is certainly a high and delicate trust. I will use every effort to execute it, if necessary, with prudence and discretion, and with the best judgment I am capable of giving to the subject. As a matter of caution I would merely state that I did not receive any further power to arrest persons under circumstances than that which is contained in your letter of this date, as your letter seems perhaps to imply that I was to receive a power with instructions to accompany the letter. Awaiting your orders, either by letter or telegraph,
I am, very respectfully, yours,
GEO. CADWALADEE,
Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, May 18,1SG1. Maj. Gen. B. F. Butler, TJ. S. Volunteers:
Sir: You will proceed to Fort Monroe and assume the command of that post, when Colonel Dimick will limit his command to the regular troops, composing a part of its garrison, but will, by himself and his officers, give such aid in the instruction of the volunteers as you may direct.

Besides the present garrison of Fort Monroe, consisting of seven com-X>anies of regular artillery, portions of two Massachusetts regiments of volunteers, and a regiment of Vermont volunteers, nine additional regiments of volunteers from New York may soon be expected there. Only a small portion, if any, of these can be conveniently quartered or encamped in the fort, the greater part if not the whole area of which will be necessary for exercise on the ground. The nine additional regiments must therefore be encamped in the best positions outside of and as near the fort as may be. For this purpose it is hoped that a pine forest north of the fort and near the bay may be found to furnish the necessary ground and shade for some three thousand men, though somewhat distant from drinking and cooking water; this, as well as fuel, it may be necessary to bring to the camp on wheels. The Quartermaster’s Department has been instructed to furnish the necessary vehicles, casks, and draught animals.
The war garrison of Fort Monroe against a formidable army provided with an adequate siege-train is about 2,500 men. You will soon have there, inside and out, near three times that number. Assuming 1,500 men as a garrison adequate to resist any probable attack in the next six months for at least many days or weeks, you will consider the remainder of the force under your command disposable for aggressive purposes, and employ it accordingly.
In respect to more distant operations you may expect specific instructions at a later date. In the mean time I will direct your attention to the following objects:
1.	Not to let the enemy erect batteries to annoy Fort Monroe;
2.	To capture any batteries the enemy may have within a half-day’s march of you, or which may be reached by land ;
3.	The same in respect to the enemy’s batteries at or above Craney Island, though requiring water craft; and
4.	To menace and to recapture the navy-yard at Gosport in order to complete its destruction, with its contents, except what it may be practicable to bring away in safety.
It is expected that you put yourself into free communication with the commander of the United States naval forces in Hampton Eoads, and invite his cordial co operation with you in all operations in whole or in part by water, and no doubt he will have received corresponding instructions from the Navy Department.
Boldness in execution is nearly always necessary, but in planning and fitting out expeditions or detachments great circumspection is a virtue. In important cases, where time clearly permits, be sure to submit your plans and ask instructions from higher authority. Communicate with me often and fully on all matters important to the service.
I remain, with great respect, yours,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Baltimore, May 18,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : I have just received an order from General Scott transferring the command of the Department of Annapolis to General Cadwalader and ordering me to Fort Monroe. What does this mean ? Is it a censure upon my action? Is it because I have caused Winans to be arrested ? Is it because of my proving successful in bringing Baltimore to subjection and quiet ?

Cadwalader may release Winans—probably will. You must guard against that.
If my services are no longer desired by the Department, I am quite content to be relieved altogether, but I will not be disgracejd. In all I have done I have acted solely according to what I believed to be the wishes of the President, General Scott, and yourself.
I am not disposed to be troublesome to you, but I wish this matter might be laid before the President. To be relieved of a command of a department and sent to command a fort, without a word of comment, is something unusual at least, and I am so poor a soldier as not to understand it otherwise than in the light of a reproof.
At least, I desire a personal interview with you and with the President before 1 accept further service. This will be handed you by my friend and aide-de-camp, R. S. Fay, jr., who knows its contents, and is able to represent me fully to you.
Yery truly, yours,

The Anacostia is just in and reports a battery at Aquia Creek, four guns, and one of heavy caliber. Work not completed. About two hundred men on it.

Hon. Simon Cameron :
Important to occupy Cumberland at once. Advices indicate movement through it on Western Virginia to influence election. Occupation of Cumberland will stop the movement. I hope Ohio contingent will not be limited to nine regiments—be brought up to twenty. I have as yet received neither instructions nor authority. My hands tied until I have one or the other.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters of the Army:
Colonel : In the absence of General Patterson I forward the accompanying report of the capture of parties engaged in the burning of bridges. I suggested to Colonel Dare that he should ascertain if the civil authorities in the district where the offense was committed would take cognizance of these cases, and hold the men by bail to appear in future5 if they would do so, to turn them over, first (as I understand they are responsible persons) requiring them to take oath to commit no act of hostility against the United States. If the civil authorities

Headquarters Camp Susquehanna,
Perryville, Md., May 19, 1861. Maj. F. J. Porter, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Major : I have the honor to report that last evening signal rockets were reported in direction of Aberdeen. I immediately proceeded to Havre de Grace (Lieutenant-Colonel Birney being absent), and finding they were not according to code agreed upon, considered no re-enforce-ment necessary. I proceeded to Aberdeen to ascertain why the rockets had been fired, and at that post they were reported as having been seen in direction of Perrymansville. Taking a guard to that point, I found all quiet.
Information having been given in relation to Capt. Benedict H. Kean, in command of Spesutia Rangers, William B. Michael, and Thomas Wilson, Captain Hoffman, of Company E, First Regiment P. C. G., arrested them ; the first as in command of forces hostile to the United States, and the two latter-named gentlemen as being engaged in destruction of bridges. The arrests were made quietly, and every consideration shown to the gentlemen detained. They were taken to Perry ville and lodged at my quarters.
From representations made by Captain Kean and by other parties, the Spesutia Rangers have not been engaged or intending to engage against the Government. His action in opposing the destruction of the bridges, as represented by credible parties, induced his release on parole of honor to appear if wanted. The others I believe to have been engaged in destruction of bridges, and that the evidence will be ample to sustain the fact. I am now detaining them until I receive instructions from headquarters.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
CHAS. P. DARE,
