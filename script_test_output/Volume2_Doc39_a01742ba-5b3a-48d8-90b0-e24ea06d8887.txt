crossed the Potomac by the Long Bridge, on the morning of the 24th instant, assuming the command of the troops on the Virginia side. The troops took position as follows:
On the right, the Sixty-ninth Regiment N. Y. S. M., which crossed the Potomac Aqueduct, was posted near the canal culvert. The other two regiments of that wing (the Twenty-eighth N. Y. S. M. and the Fifth NT. Y. S. M.) were thrown forward on the road to Leesburg, about two miles from the river. In the center, the Seventh N. Y. S. M. was placed at the head of the Long Bridge. The Twenty-fifth N. Y. S. M. was posted at the toll-gate and Vose’s Hill, on the Columbia turnpike. Three regiments of the New Jersey Brigade, under Brigadier-General Kunyon, together with the Twelfth N. Y. S. M., occupied the Alexandria road as far as Four-Mile Run$ the pickets of the Twelfth extending as far as the point where the canal crosses the Alexandria road. The left wing, consisting of the Eleventh Regiment N. Y. Vols. and the First Regiment Michigan, occupied the city of Alexandria, supported by the IJ. S. steamer Pawnee.
Immediately after crossing the river, I proceeded to an inspection of the whole line, commencing on the right. I found the Sixty-ninth N. Y. S. M. halted in position, waiting for the arrival of the intrenching tools in order to commence the works of defense which had been projected by the U. S. Engineers. Thence, following up the Leesburg road, I found the Twenty-eighth and Fifth Regiments N. Y. S. M. about a mile and a half in advance of the Sixty-ninth. Alb this place I found that Lieutenant Tompkins, of the Second 17. S. Cavalry, supported by two companies of infantry of the Twenty-eighth, had advanced up the Leesburg road towards the Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad. I pushed forward with my staff, and found him at the point where the Leesburg road crosses the railroad. He had just intercepted a passenger train of cars on its way to Alexandria, and Lieutenant Houston, of the U. S. Engineers, had destroyed the track in front and rear ot the cars and had destroyed two bridges by fire. I examined the passengers, and after conversation with them and the examination of private papers voluntarily exhibited to me, I thought it proper, with one exception, to impose no further restraint upon them than to detain them there until 5 o’clock p. m. of that day. This I did in order to prevent their carrying information of our movements into the neighborhood. Among them was a sergeant of the Fairfax Rifles, whom I sent to General Mansfield at Washington. I took pains here, and everywhere else, in my intercourse with the citizens, .to impress upon their minds that the object and intention of the presence of the United States troops were to insure good order, and to afford protection to their persons and property in the pursuit of their ordinary avocations, and I am happy to say that I have been met everywhere by most of the people with expressions of kindness and cordial welcome.
Returning thence, past the positions of the Twenty-eighth and Fifth Regiments, I examined the cross-roads in the neighborhood of Arlington. Finding the mansion vacated by the family, 1 stated to some of the servants left there that had the family remained I would have established a guard for their security from annoyance; but, in consequence of their absence, that I would, by occupying it myself, be responsible for the perfect care and security of the house and everything in and about it. I then returned, by the head of the Long Bridge, where the troops were now engaged in throwing up intrenchjnents, under the direction of Capt. B. S. Alexander, of the U. S. Engineers.

Thence I proceeded down the Alexandria road, visiting the posts of the New Jersey Brigade, the Twelfth N. Y. S. M., the First Michigan Regiment, and the Eleventh Regiment N. Y. Vols. (Ellsworth’s) to Alexandria. I then received the confirmation of the morning’s report, which had reached me, of the fall of the gallant Ellsworth.
On the following day (the 25th) I repeated the inspection of the gr eater part of the lines, particularly the right wing, where intrench-ments were being thrown up by the Sixty-ninth Regiment, under the direction of Captain Woodbury, of the U. S. Engineers. On this day the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment took post between Four-Mile Run and Alexandria, thereby filling an interval between the Twelfth Regiment and the city of Alexandria, which I had reported to you on the previous evening as being too great for mutual support. On the 26th the Eighth N. Y. S. M., which at my request you directed to cross the Potomac, was encamped by me on Arlington Heights in rear of the mansion, and on the 27th the light battery of that regiment arrived, under the command of Caj)tain Yarian, and was posted in its camp, two of the guns, with sufficient protection, being thrown forward to cover our pickets. On the evening of the same day the First New Jersey Kegiment relieved the Seventh N. Y. S. M. in the trenches at the head of the Long Bridge, and the latter returned to its post at Camp Cameron.
During the 26th I completed my examination of the roads and woods in the vicinity of Arlington and near the position of the Fifth and Twenty-eighth Regiments, and upon consultation with Capt. W. H. Wood, of the Third U. S. Infantry, concluded to change the position of those regiments to a point more capable of support from the Eighth on the left and from the Sixty-ninth on the right, and to cut a road through the woods in a direct line from the outposts in rear of Arlington House to the new position on the Leesburg road. This road is now in the course of construction. The company of Second U. S. Cavalry, under the command of Captain Brackett, being insufficient to perform the extended guard and picket duty which devolved upon it, and being desirous to extend the patrols which Captain Brackett had sent forward, I authorized him to direct the lieutenant commanding Company G of the Second Cavalry to report his command for duty with Captain Brackett, who was thereby enabled to direct more efficient and extended patrols and pickets, by which I now think the whole of the central division of the country in front of the line is occupied. Sherman’s battery of light artillery rendered prompt and efficient service throughout the movement, and one of the sections captured the troop of Virginia Cavalry at Alexandria.
I have caused to be circulated extensively throughout the country the proclamation to the inhabitants, which was submitted to and approved by the President, the Cabinet, and yourself, and of which I transmit a copy.*
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
CHAS. W. SANDFORD,
Major-General.

ISTo. 2.
Report of Maj. Gen. 8. P. Heintzelman, U. 8. Army.
Headquarters Department of Washington,
Washington, July 20, 1863.
General: I understand that no report has been made of the crossing of the Potomac at the Long Bridge and occupation of Arlington Heights and Alexandria on the morning of the 24th of May, 1861. I was at that time acting inspector-general to Brig. Gen. J. K. F. Mansfield, commanding the Department of Washington, and as the troops that crossed the bridge moved under my direction, I have the honor to make the following report:
On the afternoon of the 23d, I went with General Mansfield to the Engineer Department, and he there explained to me the plan of operations. This, I understood from him, did not include the occupation of Alexandria. Before the troops moved, however, this part of the plan was changed.
The troops which crossed, from the original manuscript now in my possession [were]:
By the Aqueduct.—Staff commanding Captain Wood, now Maj. W. H. Wood, Seventeenth U. S. Infantry. Engineers Woodbury, Blunt, and Houston. Forty-eight pioneers of Fourteenth Begiment New York, Colonel Wood; Sixty-ninth Begiment New York, Colonel Corcoran, and 250 workmen, unarmed; Fifth Begiment New York, Colonel Schwartz-walder; Twenty-eighth Begiment New York, Colonel Burns; one company cavalry; one section artillery.
By the Long Bridge.—Staff commanding Colonel Heintzelman. Engineers Alexander, Prime, and Bobert. Twelfth Begiment New York, Colonel Butterfield; Twenty-fifth Begiment New York, Colonel Bryan: Seventh Begiment New York, Colonel Lefferts; Third Begiment New Jersey, General Bunyon; one company cavalry; one section artillery.
By steamer.—First New York Zouaves, Colonel Ellsworth. This regiment was encamped on the Potomac below the Eastern Branch, and was landed on the wharves of Alexandria under the guns of the gunboat Pawnee.
Also by the Long Bridge.—First Michigan and Pioneers, Colonel Will-cox; one company cavalry; one section artillery.
Captain Brackett commanded the company of cavalry (I, Second Cavalry) that crossed the Long Bridge, and the artillery, I think, belonged to Maj. T. W. Sherman’s battery.
During the day I warned the regiments to be prepared to march at a moment’s notice, and at 9 p. m. officers were sent to the colonels, directing them to march their troops to the Washington end of the Long Bridge.
The orders were to enter on the bridge at 2 a. m. on the 24th of May. A few minutes before the hour the head of the column halted at the Washington end of the bridge, and precisely at the hour the troops advanced, the Twelfth New York, Colonel Butterfield, leading. Col. C. P. Stone, in command of the District Volunteers, had made such admirable arrangements that he was enabled to take possession of the Virginia end of the bridge before any alarm was given, and thus prevented the rebels from firing it. He immediately pushed forward on the different roads strong pickets. On the road towards Arlington they extended as far as the bridge across the canal.
Capt. S. Owen, who commanded some of the District Cavalry, aecom-

panied me, and had with him men well acquainted with the country. The morning was beautiful moonlight. At the forks of the road, where Fort Runyon has since been built, I turned the Twenty-fifth New York, Colonel Bryan, to the right.
I gave directions to Captain Owen to lead Colonel Butterfield’s regiment as far as the Four-Mile Run, and it to take post on the right of the road, and then to conduct Colonel Willcox, with the First Michigan, to Alexandria, there to unite with the First New York Zouaves, Colonel Eilsworth, and occupy Alexandria. This was done without opposition, capturing in the town a few rebel cavalry. Some 700 rebel infantry in the town had received notice of the approach of the troops, and were ready to take the cars. They escaped on the Orange and Alexandria Railway, burning the bridges behind them. Our troops pursued a short distance, also burning such bridges as they had spared.
Capt. H. Gr. Wright, U. S. Engineers, accompanied me. We advanced with the Twenty-fifth New York on the Columbia turnpike, and took post between. Roach’s and Dr. Antisell’s, where Fort Albany now stands. Captain Brackett’s company of cavalry was posted a short distance in the advance on the turnpike. The movement was made so quietly, that the troops had stacked arms an hour before the inhabitants were aware that we had crossed the river.
As far as I can learn, there were only a few men located at the Virginia end of the Long Bridge. The horses of two of them we captured to the right of the Arlington road where it leaves the Columbia turnpike, and a few hours later the men fell into our lines, and were also captured. Communication was immediately made to the right with Captain Wood and to the left with Colonel Willcox.
Thus was commenced the first operation against the rebels in front of Washington.
I have the honor to be, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. P. HEINTZELMAN, Major-General, Volunteers.
Gen. L. Thomas, Adjt. Gen. U. 8. Army, Washington.
