the State, Maj. Gen. Eobert E. Lee assumes command of the military and naval forces of Virginia.
E. E. LEE,
Major- General.
Fredericksburg, Va*, April 23,1861. His Excellency John Letcher:
I am this moment informed that the enemy has landed from a small steamer at Lee, on the Eappahannock Eiver, fifty miles below us, attacked the inhabitants, and caused general alarm. Can you send us three or four thousand disciplined volunteers at once, two or three batteries of light artillery, with ammunition; also twenty heavy guns, with plenty of ammunition'? Please answer immediately.
DANIEL EUGGLES, Brigadier-General Virginia Volunteers.
Headquarters, Alexandria, Van April 24,1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee :
Sir : Your dispatch of the 23d instant,* by telegraph, has been received. I had fully anticipated all your instructions. I recognized from the moment I took position and command on this line of operations the policy of preserving the anomalous military position now existing, but which may at any moment be overthrown in the present disorganized and feeble military position of our State, and especially on this line of operations. Time, therefore, gained on the one side will enable us to organize and strengthen; but, unless every possible nerve is strengthened on our side, and every moment reckoned as a month, our enemy will press us in this race. Your summons, therefore, from the heart of the State should be “To arms! To arms!*’ from the center to the remotest confines, and, as soon as you can cover from Alexandria to the heart of the State, at Eichmond, immediately extend the whole might of the commonwealth to come up to the aid of the line of operations. I stand here to-day in sight of the enemy’s position, an army now numbering from ten to twelve thousand men, under arms, and rapidly increasing by re-enforcements from the North, while I have today but three hundred men fit for duty; and while I am without any staff organization, cannon, or any ordnance and ammunition, without any officers, engineers, artillery, or ordnance, and without suitable staff’ officers, it will be my part to mask your designs and operations; to act for the present absolutely on the defensive; to watch the enemy; to keep you informed of his movements; to rally to my aid the whole country in the rear; to organize, and await re-enforcements from every possible quarter. Indicate to me, as soon as possible, whatever points shall be decided upon in rear of my position for the rendezvous of any proposed re-enforcement. Your instructions, also, as to the best position of my own headquarters and of my camp of recruits and organization in my rear will be gladly received. I am moving back the flour from Alexandria to the depots on the railroads in the interior. I am also moving back a large amount of railroad iron, which we shall want for batteries. I am cutting off the supplies from Washington, and sending them back to the farms, or returning what may pass through this place.
Not found.

In case of a change of existing military status, in case the enemy take the initiative and invade our soil, I would be glad to have your instructions or advice as to the line by which I should retire to soonest meet with support and co-operation. Say whether you think I ought to continue my headquarters in Alexandria or remove them elsewhere, or under what probable contingencies I should make any movements.
PHILIP ST. GEO. COOKE,
Brigadier- General.
Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Va., April 24,1861.
General P. St. George Cocke:
General : Your dispatch of the 24th is at hand. I rejoice that you so fully recognize the proper policy to be pursued, and initiated it on your arrival at the scene of your operations. Continue it till compelled to change. I am endeavoring to organize the military of the State. Two 8-inch columbiads, with implements and one hundred rounds of ammunition, go to you to-day.
Captain Walker, with four rifled 6-pounders, was dispatched, by the governor, to the Potomac before my entering on duty. Direct him to report to you, and assign him to service where you deem best. Lieutenant Simms, State naval forces, has been ordered to duty on the Potomac, above Aquia Creek. He will be under your orders.
Select points of rendezvous on or near the railroads leading to Alexandria. Leesburg would be a suitable point for forces on that road such points as you think convenient on others. Establish your headquarters as necessary. Establish camps of instruction, and instruct your troops in the use of their different arms; make the necessary arrangements for their support. Ko bacon is to be obtained in Virginia. Consult with merchants in Alexandria as to the feasibility of obtaining bacon from Ohio or Kentucky. If this is not practicable, beef and mutton must be your meat ration. The valley of Virginia will naturally suggest itself to you as the point from which this part of the ration must be obtained.
Let it be known that you intend no attack, but invasion of our soil will be considered an act of war.
Very few officers of experience have as yet reported; as soon as possible some will be sent to you.
In reference to the regiment to be raised by Mr. Funsten, I will state that, in conformity to an ordinance of the convention, volunteers are accepted by companies; when organized into regiments, the field officers are appointed by the governor and council.
It is not now believed that the enemy will attack you; should he do so, however, and you are not able to maintain your position, fall back on your reserves, on the route to Gordonsville.
I am, very respectfully, yours, &c.,
E. E. LEE,
Major-General, Commanding.
Headquarters Forces of Virginia,

General Daniel Euggles :
General : Your dispatch, of the 24th instant, requesting to know the policy and orders by which you are to be governed, is at hand.

You will act on the defensive. Station your troops at suitable points to command the railroad 5 write and give assurance of protection to the inhabitants on the rivers; cause your troops to be instructed in the use of their several arms, and take immediate steps for provisioning them. If bacon cannot be procured, fresh meat must compose that part of your ration.
Two 8-inch howitzers have been sent you to-day 5 also ammunition for the same. I regret I cannot furnish you with carriages for these pieces, but I hope you will be able to have them constructed or made available for your purpose in Fredericksburg. You will endeavor to allay the popular excitement as far as possible. As soon as you can, send in a return of your troops, and where stationed.
I am, general, very respectfully,
E. E. LEE,
Major-General, Commanding.
Alexandria, Ya., April 21,1861. -General Lee, Commander-In-Chief;
I can destroy the light-boats and remove the buoys, through the pilots, without military force. Shall I do it ?
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE,
Brigadier- General.
[Indorsements. ]
Our object is to interrupt the navigation of the Potomac by batteries, &c. If the governor and council see no objection, I will direct General Cocke, unless he can remove the light-boats to places of safety, to destroy them and to remove the buoys.
E. E. L.
Submitted to the council by the governor.
Council Office, April 24,1861.
Advised unanimously that the decision upon the matter be left to the discretion of General Lee.
By order of the council:

Secretary.
Approved:
John Letcher.
Fredericksburg-, Ya., April 24, 1861. Brigadier-General Euggles :
By your orders I proceeded to Aquia Creek, and examined the place, with the view of fortifying it, for the purposes indicated by your verbal directions of this date, viz: To secure the railroad iron, the timber, two vessels, and a small steamer at that point from the enemy. I was joined in the evening by Lieutenant Lewis, of the Yirginia Kavy, at your request, and we reviewed the ground together. After examining the topography of the ground and the character and position of the channel, we are of the opinion that the best place to put a battery is on the

Split Rock Bluff, as the channel can be commanded from that point by guns of sufficient caliber. A battery on Cream Point would invite attack, and, being separated from the landing by Aquia Creek, would be difficult to hold. We do not think the place worth fortifying, and would respectfully recommend that a small force of ten or twenty men be kept there, to keep off any boats that might attempt to land there, and be employed in loading cars, which should be sent to remove the iron and timber to Fredericksburg at once 5 that the captains of the vessels be allowed to sail with their vessels at their pleasure. While the enemy holds the Potomac the steamer is of no value to us, and we have not the slightest idea that the enemy will make the attempt to possess themselves of it. The men kept there should be required to give information to headquarters of any attempt of the enemy to land there in force, which would be indicated by the number of vessels in the offing, and not allowed to harass the inhabitants by reporting every vessel they see in the river.
Very respectfully submitted by
THOMAS H. WILLIAMSON, Major of Engineers, Virginia Army.

Lieutenant, Virginia Navy.

Alexandria, Va., April 25, 1861.
Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee :
The following communications have just been received:
Maj. John Lee, of Orange, has just been informed by Richard L. Brown, late a clerk in the Treasury Department, and just from Washington, having resigned his place, and by Mr. Curry, a friend of Mr. Brockenbridge, likewise lately resigned from his position as clerk of one of the Departments, that the Seventh Regiment has certainly arrived in Washington; that communications are open with Annapolis; that cars are constantly bringing troops, to be followed by very large bodies to the amount of twenty or twenty-five thousand troops, and that the purpose of the administration is to forage both Maryland and Virginia for supplies, and to push the war in this State. Their pickets are said to have been down below the Long Bridge last night, and it is said that Alexandria is in imminent peril of being occupied by the U. S. troops.
WM. H. LEE.
April 25.
Dear Steuart : We have later news from Annapolis. Twelve thousand additional troops landed there yesterday. They have possession of the city, and are sending forces on the line of the road. They say they are going to take military possession of our State permanently. Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, is reported in Annapolis, and Sumner is to follow. They are to establish a civil commission, to supersede our State government. The last troops were brought from New York, and the steamers went back for more. A movement will be made on Baltimore from north and south. It is thought Fort McHenry will be assaulted to-day. It is no time for Virginia to stand on etiquette. Let her come and capture Fort Washington. Our legislature meets at Frederick City to-morrow, Annapolis being in the hands of the enemy.
Yours, &c.,
E. W. BELL.
The above is brought by one of our most reliable citizens direct. Answer immediately.

General Robert E. Lee:
The following dispatches, this moment, by the hands of a courier, who received them in person from Daniel Clarke himself, which Daniel Clarke, I am assured here by reliable persons, is the son-in-law of Ex-Governor Pratt:
Upper Marlborough, Md., April 25, 1861. General Steuart, Commander of the Virginia Forces at Alexandria, Fa.:
Accompanying I send you the latest intelligence, brought by me from Annapolis, which is authentic, reliable, and gathered from the best sources. It is desirable to telegraph the news to the South immediately, and to the Cabinet of the Southern Confederacy. In telegraphing to the Southern Cabinet at Montgomery please send the accompanying dispatch, annexed, to Hon. J. P. Benjamin. I am well.known to him, and the intelligence would be known by him to be authentic, coming from me direct from Governor Pratt, Annapolis.
Yours, truly, &c.,
DANIEL CLARKE.
Hon. J. P. Benjamin, Montgomery, Ala.:
The dispatches dated Annapolis, April 24th, 6 o’clock, are reliable and authentic, having been brought by me from Governor Pratt.
DANIEL CLARKE.
Annapolis, Md., April 24, 1801—6 x>. m.
The Northern troops have taken forcible possession of the navy-yard and the depot and railroad. This morning two thousand troops left here for Washington, via the railroad. The track, which was torn up, has been relaid by the troops. Twelve thousand more troops have just arrived by steamers and war vessels from New York. A portion of the troops, which have just arrived, are now leaving for Washington. Twenty-five or thirty thousand troops are expected to be sent to Maryland by Monday next. A joint movement of the forces from Annapolis and Pennsylvania is contemplated upon Baltimore, against which city the Northerners swear vengeance. The city is alive and making preparations against the attack. The Northern forces intend to hold Annapolis as a military post, at which to land the troops, ammunition, and provisions for Washington. Governor Hicks, in consequence of the military occupation of Annapolis, has been forced to convene the legislature at Frederick City. It is thought the legislature will pass an ordinance of secession at once. The people are in arms, and determined to unite in the cause of the South. Prompt and immediate action of the Southern forces for the relief of Maryland is absolutely necessary to prevent the military occupation of the State by the Federal forces.
PHILIP ST. GEO. COOKE,
Brigadier- General.
Alexandria, Ya., April 26,1861. General Lee, Commander-in- Chief;
The two 8-ineli columbiads have arrived, and, there being four rifled cannon at Aquia, under Captain Walker, I shall proceed first to remove or destroy the light boats and the buoys on the Potomac, and, at the same time order General Buggies to hold himself in readiness to support by sufficient detachment of his troops. I shall do the same from this point, to cover and protect any working party, under the direction of the engineer, at a certain point on the Potomac. I would be glad to have Lieutenant Lee, of the Engineers, or some other officer of the Engineers, assigned for immediate service, to direct the construction of the works of this enterprise.
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE,
Brigadier- General.

Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Va., April 26, 1861. General Harper, Commanding Harpers Ferry, Va. ;
Sir : The commanding general desires you to report by letter, without delay, whether, after taking from Harper’s Ferry such machinery as it is necessary for the armory at this city, and which he hopes is now on its way, the condition of the factories at Harper’s Ferry will be such that the arms that are partly finished may be completed and brought into use, and whether, in a military point of view, it could be safely accomplished. In the mean time, if arms can be completed safely, finish them. The property referred to in the letter of yesterday was the machinery for the armory at this place, above referred to.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. S. GAEYETT,
Adjutant- General.

Colonel Langhorne:
Sir : The general commanding the military and naval forces of Virginia instructs me to direct you to proceed, without delay, to Lynchburg, Va., to assume a temporary charge of that district, and to make preparations for the accommodation (food and shelter) of thirteen regiments of troops, shortly expected to arrive there, and such others as may arrive there from time to time, and report to you. Before going confer with Lieutenant-Colonel Heth, now temporarily in charge of the quartermaster’s department in this city, as to the best mode of executing this service.
I am, sir, vour obedient servant,

Engineer’s Office, Norfolk, Va., April 26,1861. General Eobert E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
Sir : In reply to your communication of yesterday’s date, I have the honor to report that, in obedience to the orders of the governor, I proceeded to Yorktown on Thursday, the 18th instant, accompanied by two assistants. Before leaving there on Saturday the form and position of a water battery on Gloucester Point was decided upon, that covers all the channel-way with fire, lying within two miles of the point. The battery will mount thirty-one guns, if twenty feet be allowed to each. If eighteen feet be sufficient, the number can be increased to thirty-four. The faces bearing on the channel above and below are arranged for five and nine guns, respectively. Those intermediate (fifteen) are arranged on the arc cf a circle, containing about one hundred and twenty degrees. The lines of fire cross the channel lines so near that this part may be armed with 8-inch howitzers, while for the faces 8-inch columbiads should be provided. The faces of this battery converge towards the high ground northwest of the point. This high ground affords an advantageous site for a large field work for the defense of the position. NTo attempt was made to trace one on the ground. A very good position for a 6-gun battery was selected on the Yorktown side, near to the river bluff. An assistant, J. J. Clarke, who has had no

experience on military works, but with a high reputation as a civil engineer, was left in charge of this work, with instructions to raise a laboring force in Gloucester, if practicable, and to meet me in Bicli-mond on Monday p. m.
About 1 p. in., with one assistant, I embarked on board the steamer for this place, and arrived a very short time before the steamer Pa wnee passed up the river ; reported myself to the commanding general, but received no orders from him until Sunday morning. Since that time I have been fully occupied with the construction of defensive works on this river. The ground in front of the Naval Hospital has been prepared for mounting fourteen guns on two faces, the half of which are now ready for service, with navy furnaces for heating shot. This work was commenced amid the greatest confusion and excitement. Three guns and carriages were hastily removed from the navy-yard to this place, and mounted in the rear of the ground required to be broken for the battery. One hundred and fifty bales of cotton were sent over, to make a temporary cover for the men between the guns, should the Pawnee or Cumberland attempt to return to the yard. No such attempt having been made, the cotton was carefully piled in a way to prevent serious damage, and will now be returned to the public store nearly in the condition it was when received.
As soon as working companies could be organized at this place, which, from the extreme excitement and confusion prevailing, required much time, even after local officers had been assigned to take charge of them and direct the application of labor, I proceeded to Fort Norfolk, where it was deemed expedient to mount as many guns as could be brought to bear on the channel, and also to construct between the wharf and fort covering the channel a water battery of six guns. This has since been reduced to five, in consequence of finding stone under and near the surface of the earth. Bequisitions were made for materials, tools, and ordnance, and officers assigned to superintend the work; but no laboring force was available before Monday morning.
In the evening, after having made requisition for troops, materials, tools, &c., accompanied by one assistant, I left in a small boat for Craney Island. As far as practicable the ground was examined by moonlight. Neither troops nor laborers arrived during the night, but about 8 a. m. Monday morning labor commenced coming in from the plantations, and by 10.30 a. m. about one hundred and twenty laborers, with a suitable number of carts, had been placed on the work, which had been laid out to mount twenty guns, which cover all the channel-way within range from N. 5° W. to E.
A battery, to mount twelve guns, has been laid out on Penner’s Point. The work on this is under the control of officers of the Navy, but requisitions for the laborers and tools have been filled at this office.
SollePs Point has been examined, and lines marked for three batteries, of six guns each. This position is so unfavorable for defense, no works have been commenced there.
April 27.
The works in progress will mount sixty-one guns when completed. Of these, fourteen will be at the Naval Hospital, fifteen at Fort Norfolk, twelve at Penner’s Point, and twenty on Oraney Island. I am unable to state the number ready for service. At the Naval Hospital the officer in charge reports ten ready for action, two 8-inch shell and eight 32-pounders, with furnaces and fuel for heating shot.
From Fort Norfolk the report is not yet in. On Thursday the guns

were on the rampart, and the platform nearly ready to receive them. Penner?s Point work is to be commenced to-day by the Navy Department. Craney Island is ready for the platform and.guns. One lighter,, carrying four 9-inch columbiads, with fifty rounds of ammunition for each, was ordered down yesterday p. m.
Last evening Assistant Engineer Sharp was detailed to make an examination of the approaches to the city and navy-yard, and to prepare a map of the country lying between the Elizabeth River and East Branch, within ten miles of this place. Mr. Conway Howard was detailed to assist him.
I have unofficially learned that a battery of four guns is under construction, by the residents, near Bushy Bluff, which I contemplate visiting in the course of the day. Further examinations will be made this side of Soller’s Point for more favorable ground before commencing works at Soller’s Point.
Most respectfully submitted by your obedient servant,
ANDREW TALCOTT,
Engineer.
