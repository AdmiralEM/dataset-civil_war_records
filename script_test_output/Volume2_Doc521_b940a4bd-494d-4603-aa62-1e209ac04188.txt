No. 127.
/	Richmond, Va., May 27,1861.
The commanding officer of the cavalry camp at Ashland will select the four companies of his command best prepared for actual service in the field, and prepare them to move by railroad to Manassas Junction. Two of these companies will take the cars on Wednesday, at such hour and place as the railroad officers may appoint with the Quartermasters Department, and will be followed on the next day by the two remaining companies. The four companies will be placed under the command of Maj. Julian Harrison, Virginia volunteers, who will report to Brigadier-General Bonham on their arrival at Manassas Junction. They will be provided with at least one day’s cooked rations for the journey.
By order of Major-General Lee:

Col. E. S. Garnett :
Sir : The women and children have been passing here all day from Hampton, and Major Cary also is retreating on this place with about sixty-five men, out of some two hundred, which he had a day or two since—the remainder of his men being occupied attending to their retreating families. He left two pieces of indifferent artillery behind him within three miles of Hampton. I sent down for these to-night, and think they will be here, or at least in a place of safety by daylight. Since my last dispatch, which I sent through Colonel Ewell, further intelligence has reached me, to the effect that a large body of troops, some two thousand five hundred or three thousand, perhaps exaggerated, marched out of Old Point by the head of Hampton Creek, the bridge by Hampton having been burned, passed through Hampton, and marched to Newport News and united with those who landed there to-day, making, by the smallest accounts, five thousand men. The statement with regard to the number of troops may be inaccurate, but from official reports, from Major Cary and otherwise, there is a very considerable body of Federal troops occupying that place, from which they can march to this place in one day with ease, or can reach this place more rapidly by landing their troops at Grove Landing, on James River, about eight miles from here, and over a road not easily defensible by inferior numbers. This landing is on my right and rear, being, as I said before, only eight miles from here and seven miles from Williamsburg, the distance from the latter place to this being twelve miles, and Williamsburg itself being northwest from us. Colonel Ewell reports to-day that he has only one hundred and eighty men under his command, and Colonel August, whom I left there because I saw that Williamsburg was very much exposed, has only between six and seven hundred men.
I shall urge upon Colonel Ewell your instructions in reference to the defenses between the heads of Queen and College Creeks, directing him to employ all the officers and soldiers of his command as laborers, all the troops here being employed night and day in this capacity. To-day he informs me that he has moved his force and that of Colonel August towards Grove Landing, keeping, however, I presume, his laborers employed upon the defenses between Queen and College Creeks and in

front of Williamsburg. I have not had a moment’s time to examine the country farther than within the circumference of seven or eight miles. I therefore have not been to Williamsburg. I am perfectly satisfied, however, that if the enemy land in force at either of the places on the James River above mentioned and march upon Williamsburg, it will fall, unless strongly re-enforced, or unless I march to operate on his flank and rear while he is making the attack, in which case I should leave this point entirely uncovered and expose it to an attack in its rear from Fort Monroe. This place carried, Gloucester Point is commanded, and the enemy’s ships enter York River. In case of such an alternative, I should decide to defend this place to the last, unless I was satisfied that I could march upon the enemy, beat him, and return in time to meet an attack from the neighborhood of Fort Monroe. Anticipating before I left Richmond that the landing places below Jamestown Island would soon become insecure, I wrote from the depot to the Quartermaster-General a note, begging him to send some lighters of an appropriate kind to ply between Jamestown Island and the mainland on the road to Williamsburg, to enable the commanding general to throw rapidly into the latter place, if he thought proper, the necessary troops and supplies. I do not know if this has been done. It is absolutely necessary that the facilities of both rivers should be used to the utmost to carry on vigorously military operations in the country embraced between them. I know the troops are needed on every line, but I believe I cannot overrate the importance of preserving a numerical superiority of all arms over the enemy on the line of operations between this place and Jamestown, the lowest defensible points on the two rivers, while the works between Queen and College Creeks are being erected. I would respectfully represent, therefore, that the line from Yorktown to Jamestown be occupied by from eight to ten thousand men, and the defenses at the extremities—that is, at mouth of York River and Jamestown Island, be strengthened in every conceivable manner. I wanted Colonel Ewell to cause to be collected the most combustible materials at the wharfs at the landings below Jamestown Island, and to cause these wharfs to be burned whenever the enemy, in great force, makes an unmistakable demonstration to land. I close for fear of detaining the steamer. The second navy gun is in position, and I hope the third will be to-morrow night.
Major Cary and his command have just arrived, confirming the report of a large collection of troops at Newport News, and the presence, near that point, of a large fleet, destination unknown. I beg leave to call the attention of the General-in-Chief earnestly to the fact that there are but fifty rounds of ammunition for the navy batteries, the shells being without fuses, and, if four guns were mounted, there would be only about twelve rounds each. The navy officer reports a coil of heavy rope needed to make wads with. Please also direct one hundred rounds of ammunition to be sent for a 6-pounder gun, brought in by Major Cary, and one hundred rounds for a 12-pounder howitzer, likewise brought in by him. The formal requisition will be sent afterwards.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Colonel, Commanding Hampton Line.

Falls of Kanawha, Ya., May 27,1861. Adjutant-General Garnett, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I have this moment an express from Lieutenant-Colonel Mc-Causland, at Buffalo, dated yesterday, stating, “The Government has sent two hundred men to Gallipolis, and will have six hundred more there to-day. We are informed that they are intended to attack this camp. Send down all the troops you have.” In addition to this, reliable information reaches me that large numbers of troops are concentrating at Oak Hill, twenty-three miles back of Gallipolis, and also at other places along the border. My idea is that these troops have been thrown into this proximity in order to overawe the loyal citizens of that region. For further particulars I beg leave to refer you to the bearer, of this, Mr. David Kirkpatrick, a resident of this valley, and a well informed man.
Yery respectfully,
C. Q. TOMPKIKS,
Colonel, Virginia Volunteers, Commanding.
Falls of Kanawha, Ya., May 27,1861. Col. B. S. Garnett, Adjutant- General:
Sir : I avail myself of a few moments’ delay of the stage to explain more fully the nature of my communication this morning. I consider it of sufficient importance for the employment of a special messenger, and accordingly have instructed the bearer, Mr. Kirkpatrick, to convey this in person, and to telegraph from Staunton its import. I shall of course proceed to Buffalo as rapidly as possible. The idea is that the enemy intend crossing the Ohio Biver, to attack the camps at Buffalo. Unless they come in greatly superior force, we shall drive them back. On the other hand, if his numbers are large and the disaffection of the inhabitants strongly evinced, I shall take the most defensible position I may find, and rally the volunteers now in process of formation in the adjoining counties. Great excitement prevails in this region. The divided sentiment of the people adds to the confusion, and, except the few loyal companies now mustered into the service of the State, there are few of the people who sympathize with the secession policy. I send a special messenger (Mr. Kirkpatrick), because he is familiar with the whole of Ohio border, and can give you valuable information as to the resources, distances, &e. Mr. Kirkpatrick is reliable and intelligent. It is very desirable that Mr. Kirkpatrick should be the purveyor of some supplies for the troops which cannot be procured here. I beg that the quartermaster may be instructed to forward by him material for tents, three hundred blankets, five hundred cartridge-boxes (musket), and ten thousand percussion caps (rifle), &c.
In great haste, yours, respectfully,

[Col. Garnett:]
Colonel : I reported to you on the 26th instant, for the information of the Commander-in-Chief, that the troops under my command are observing the river from Williamsport to the Point of Eocks. I will now give what was then omitted—the precise disposition of these troops:
Colonel Allen is opposite to Williamsport, thirty miles above, with his own regiment, two companies of Colonel Hill’s, and a section of artillery. The position cannot be defended by such a force, the ferry at Wiliiamsport being at the vertex of a horseshoe, five or six miles in length, having another at each heel. A company of cavalry and a section of artillery guard the bridge at Shepherdstown. There are two companies of infantry, two of cavalry, and six field pieces, with their men, at the bridge at the Point of Eocks, twelve miles below, and a company of cavalry at the Berlin Bridge, halfway to the Point of Eocks. Preparations have been made to break each of these two bridges and the railroad bridge here. It is more than forty miles from Williamsport to the Point of Eocks. A detachment of three hundred and fifty infantry occupies a point on the Maryland Heights, one and a half miles from the near end of the crest of the ridge, and two and a half miles from Harper’s Ferry. The crest of the ridge beyond the Shenandoah is guarded by two companies of infantry.
In the present state of the river no force that could be detached from this place could prevent its passage by an enemy. In a few weeks, or even dafs, when fords will be numerous, an army will be necessary to guard the Potomac above, as far as the western line of Berkeley. With this point occupied, as it is, some five or six thousand men, judiciously placed between Martinsburg and the line, and a reserve of about the same force within striking distance of each, invasion would be difficult. As matters now are, the enemy can easily seize Martinsburg, in the heart of a disloyal population, and nearer than Harper’s Ferry to Winchester.
If the Commander-in-Chief has precise instructions to give, I beg to receive them early. I have prepared means of transportation for a march. Should it be decided that the troops should constitute a garrison, this expense can be reduced.
Your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTOK

[Chap. IX.
Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 28,1861.
Consultation on the condition of Harpers Ferry and its defenses reduced
to writing.
The plan of the enemy, indicated by his movements, seems to be a cautious approach to, and entrance of, disaffected districts, securing his advance, if possible, by securing the sentiments of the peojffe. In the district to the northwest of Harper’s Ferry these tactics will be the best he can follow, on account of known Union proclivities and the vicinity of the frontier.
Large bodies of troops are gathering at Carlisle and Chambersburg, the number already reported (probably exaggerated) being fifteen thousand. When ready to move they will occupy Martinsburg, crossing at Williamsport and Shepherdstown. Martinsburg is well known to be disaffected. His line, established from Martinsburg towards Shepherdstown, has an excellent base, and communications very difficult to interrupt by the Hagerstown and Cumberland roads, and very seriously threatens, not only Harper’s Ferry, with its present forces and conditions, but our whole line of operations. Martinsburg is nearer to Winchester than the Ferry, and access easy. Our holding Winchester is necessary to maintain the Ferry. To hold this post, then, either as a fortress, a point fflappui, or as a condition of the defense of the Virginia Valley, we require a force of from twelve to fifteen thousand men, of which two regiments should be cavalry. The force now at the Ferry (about five thousand effectives) might remain as at present, while the main body should be posted centrally, as at Burns’ Ford, on the Ope-quan, where a strong position might be selected, and, if necessary, defended by lines. The strengthening and re-enforcement of this force, as now constituted, seems to have ceased when most necessary. It is essential that supplies of ammunition (especially of equipments of shoes) should be forwarded in quantity, otherwise, without the arrangement designated, we are so deficient in ammunition that this force jnust, on the advance of the enemy, move out from the Ferry and maneuver, to prevent being shut up in a cul-de-sac.
The plan sketched above will absolutely force the enemy to very great delay and vastly extended preparations. It continually (by way of Leesburg and the eastern slope of the ridge) threatens the District of Columbia. If, however, he is beforehand with us (besides the present disastrous results), he gains what may take time, means, and men, on a similar scale, to recover.
Very respectfully,

Sir : The receipt of your communication, relative to the defenses of the peninsula formed by the York and James Eivers, is respectfully acknowledged. As to their state of forwardness, the works have not yet been fully planned by the engineers. One very important has been and is progressing rapidly. A large number of the hands (nearly or quite five hundred), including a part of the volunteer force, are at work. I see no occasion for further delay. I beg you to call the attention of the Commanding General to the fact that the force now here is not sufficient to repel a serious attack. If Yorktown, Jamestown; or the defenses below Williamsburg fall, the way will be open to Eich-mond. To defend them, more troops are necessary, well supplied with artillery. Colonel Magruder is well convinced of all this. So far as he has mentioned his opinions to me, his views coincide with mine, and thus I am more fully convinced of their correctness.
With high respect, your obedient servant,

Sir : There are, including the volunteers, five hundred men at work on the defenses below Williamsburg. There has been some delay, I think, in consequence of the necessity of allowing time to the engineers to complete their reconnaissance. These defenses will be pushed forward with all possible dispatch. Unless artillery is furnished to defend them with, I fear they will avail but little. There ought to be two light batteries at least. Now there is not a piece. Your immediate attention is asked to this.

[Indorsement.]
I recommend, most urgently, that the light batteries asked for by Colonel Ewell be furnished without delay. If they are sent mounted and without horses, harness, or caissons, they will answer. It is requisite that they should have a full supply of ammunition, assorted. They have applied for it formally, and have received the sanction of General Lee. With these remarks the letter of General Lee ["?] is respectfully referred.

I am obliged by the size and position of my command to divide it into two, by the Elizabeth Biver, and assign the eastern division to Colonel Vvlthers, and the western to Colonel Blanchard. Not having the requisite staff, I have to allow them to use acting appointments, without pay, to perform the duty. Such articles as they find it necessary to procure, I must order paid by the quartermaster here, Capt. J. A. Johnston, who, I am happy to inform you, has now entered upon his duties. The law of Yirginia gives volunteers an allowance in money for clothing; but, as the men are not paid, the volunteers, especially those from distant States, can get no clothing, as they have no money to procure it with. I will have to get for them the articles which are absolutely necessary, and have the amount advanced deducted from their pay. I find officers here without means of procuring provisions. I will have to ration them, or give them means to buy food, and deduct it from their pay. I mention these necessities, that you may, if you think proper, cover such cases by a general order. The Federal forces seem establishing themselves at Newj>ort News. They have landed some ordnance and many stores. All the transport steamers have left but one.

Headquarters, Yorktown, Va., May 29, 1861. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces :
Sir : I sent to Hampton for the two pieces left by Major Cary’s command, and succeeded in bringing them up. I sent last night a detachment of light artillery, acting as cavalry, to bring up some spades, shovels, &c., with a large quantity of rope, &c. They have arrived. I hope to be able to leave here to-morrow, with some cavalry and light artillery, to protect the people near Hampton at least, and would like to take down my command of infantry, except three companies of the Yirginia battalion, if I thought that troops from Eichmond could be sent to Williamsburg, and between that place and this. I do not like to leave Yorktown exposed to be taken from Grove Landing. I am anxious to attack, to make the enemy stay within his own immediate neighborhood. Lieutenant Thornton, who is now sick, is my acting assistant adjutant-general. He has had no experience. I have nobody but my nephew, Mr. Magruder, who is a citizen, and Mr. Stanard, who is a private. Captain Lambert, assistant quartermaster, is at Williamsburg, where a quartermaster ought to be stationed. I must have an efficient one here. The whole of my time nearly is occupied in doing other peopled duties. I merely speak of this, as it prevents me from being as useful as I desire. I think that Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson, if he could be spared, would be of great service here.
There is corn and long forage enough in the lower part of the peninsula and about here for one thousand horses, as I am informed by Major Cary, Virginia volunteers. He knows the country. The defenses here and at Williamsburg and vicinity are progressing rapidly.
More troops are necessary at Williamsburg, and between that place and this, or rather facing Grove Landing. All the property of the citizens near Hampton, except that of Union men, will fall into the hands of the enemy, except also that which I can cause to be saved. To-day, for the first time, I have had the use of cavalry. Captain Douthat marched forty-seven miles yesterday, and joined me Jast night at 11 o’clock. I send him to-night near Hampton, with Captain Brown’s artillery, to protect the people, save their property, and, if possible, to cut off some of the enemy. The number of Federal troops at Newport News is probably between five and ten thousand, as they were landing troops from Monday, perhaps half the daylight, till after dark on Tuesday. There are no vessels there this morning. I do not think there are more than five thousand men at the most. I shall probably go down in person to-night or to-morrow morning.
This place has been most carefully examined by me as to its capabilities of defense, at a distance or near, and I am satisfied that it cannot be taken by any number of men that can be brought against it, if it is properly intrenched and defended by a sufficient number of men 5 that is, as long as the mouth of the river is secured by the batteries on this side and on Gloucester Point, which I think will be the case when all the guns are in position that are contemplated. There are here, of all arms, two thousand five hundred and four officers and men. I left Colonel August’s regiment at Williamsburg because I saw that it (Williamsburg) was unprotected. Two regiments of infantry, in addition to the present force, would make this place I think perfectly safe. Since I last wrote, it has been greatly strengthened. Two regiments of infantry, more if possible, should be sent to Williamsburg. I have invited the magistrates of the adjacent counties to meet me here this afternoon, at 5 o’clock, to have all the wagons in the counties collected, and to be

Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 31, 1861.
Intelligence was brought me this morning, from a gentleman residing near Hagerstown, that 1,600 troops arrived in Chambersburg on Tuesday and 5,000 yesterday, making, with the 3,500 there before, 10,100, with plenty of artillery (quantity unknown), many wagons and horses. A note was shown me yesterday, written in Hagerstown on Wednesday afternoon, by a woman, in which it is said that such a force is to move to the Potomac (with baggage wagons) from Chambersburg through either Hagerstown or Greencastle.
In another note (from an officer of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad), it is said that large forces are to enter Virginia somewhere between Cumberland and Hagerstown to meet Ohio troops. The Northern papers confirm this.
An officer of the railroad told me here that news of the occupation of Grafton by U. S. troops is brought by telegraph. We can learn nothing from the west, nor beyond the range of persons specially employed. Should the enemy cross the river above, we cannot learn when the Ohio troops join them, nor in what numbers.

An attempt is being made, under my orders, to bring one or two steamboats (to act as tugs or transports) into the Nansemond Biver. I think it will be successful. I have here (besides my two Maryland companies) a regiment from North Carolina and two troops of cavalry, and have been ordered by General Huger to take command of the forces in this district. On good authority, I believe the landing at Newport News to be a sanitary measure, and the enemy’s forces there do not exceed thirty-five hundred men. If I may be permitted, and the troops in Yorktown can co-operate with me, I think I can (say two nights hence) cross the James Biver and strike him a blow, and then retire.
