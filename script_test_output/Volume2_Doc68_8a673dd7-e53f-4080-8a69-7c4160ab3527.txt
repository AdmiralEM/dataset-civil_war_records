No. 4.
Reports of Brig. Gen. M. L. Bonham, C. S. Army.
Manassas Junction, Va., June 1,1861.
Captain Marr was killed; Colonel Ewell wounded in the shoulder, and one private badly in the right breast. The delay in this work makes me hesitate as to sending forward the main body of our troops at once to Ewell’s line. I shall strengthen him to-night. I inclose you, for what it is worth, the following dispatch:
General Bonham:
Within- five days the troops of Fairfax, Centreville, and Manassas are to be attacked. The principal attack at Manassas. This by authority of one who does not
wish his namo as giving information. Mr.--reports no troops this side of Falls
Church. He met the retiring cavalry, much cut up. Fifteen led horses. One dead man and another badly wounded were in a wagon. Many wounded men ^nd horses.

I Lave one prisoner, who says they have on this side of the river the Second Cavalry (Companies —, B, E, I, and G) and several batteries of artillery. Arm our cavalry with shot-guns or muskets, if nothing else can be had.

Camp Pickens, Fa., June 2, 1861.
Sir : The reports of the attack on Fairfax Court-House by the enemy’s cavalry, on the 1st instant, from Colonels Ewell and Gregg,* already transmitted, should have been accompanied by this report, but a pressure of urgent business has hitherto prevented my sending it forward. Accompanying this is a fuller report from Colonel Ewell. Having taken an advanced position at Centreville, with Gregg’s regiment of infantry, and at Bull Bun with Kershaw’s regiment, I had directed Colonel Ewell, commanding the cavalry of this department, with one company of light infantry (Captain Marr), and two companies of cavalry (Captains Thornton and Green), to take position at Germantown, or at Fairfax Court-House, one and a half miles in advance of Germantown, whichever he might deem best, upon examining the positions. I had also ordered Captains Cabell and Ball, with their troops of cavalry, to report to Colonel Ewell the evening preceding the attack ; but unavoidT able circumstances prevented their reaching the place that evening. The reports of Colonel Ewell being full, I do not deem it necessary to add a great deal to what he has said. Unfortunately the two companies of cavalry were poorly armed, which prevented their taking so active a part as they would, doubtless, otherwise have done.
Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell was wounded in the shoulder. Not only on this occasion, in the face of the enemy, but at all other times he has exhibited promptness, energy, and gallantry in the discharge of his duties. Captain Marr fell early in the action, deeply lamented by all who knew him. His loss to the service will be sensibly felt. His corps of light infantry (the Warrenton Bifles) bore themselves like veterans, twice repulsing the enemy, and finally compelling them to fly across the fields, after fruitless efforts to return through the village by the streets through which they had entered. By Colonel Ewell and others present the bearing and usefulness of Ex-Governor Smith on the occasion are spoken of in the highest terms.
Killed, Captain Marr 5 wounded, Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell; missing (taken prisoners), five. One of the enemy known to have been killed; wounded, not known—several reported; prisoners, three, each of whom I saw and examined.
The enemy was eighty to eighty-five strong, well armed, and commanded by Lieutenant Tompkins, Second U. S. Cavalry.
I again respectfully urge the thorough arming of Green’s, Thornton’s, and Powell’s troops of cavalry with double-barreled shot-guns, musket-oons, or lances and pistols.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. L. BONHAM,

SKIRMISH AT FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, VA. Ko. 5.
Reports of Lieut. Col. R. 8. Ewell, C. 8. Army.

Fairfax Court-House, Ya., June 1,1861.
Sir: I have the honor to make the following report: Between 3 and 4 o’clock this morning the pickets on the Little Falls Church road gave an alarm, stating that the cavalry of the enemy had captured our advance pickets, and were rapidly approaching the town. This was immediately followed by the appearance of the enemy, and here rapid firing took place. They did not stop, but passed through towards Germantown. I found Captain Man’s company of Bifies (receiving valuable aid from his excellency Ex-*Governor Smith), and took a position on the road by which the enemy had gone towards Germantown. In a few minutes the enemy returned, and firing took place on both sides, and the enemy fell back. Having reformed, the enemy again advanced, and more firing took place on both sides. They again retreated, and made their way through the fields, by pulling down the fences. Captain Harrison has been sent with his company, to intercept them, and Captain Wickham has been sent on their trail. Some prisoners and some horses have been taken; what number I do not know. Also several carbines and pistols have been picked up in the road. Captain Marr, of the Warrenton Bifies, has been found dead near his company’s quarters, having been shot by a detachment of the enemy. I received a flesh wound in the shoulder from a bullet. Dr. Gunnell says that it will keep me from taking the saddle for several days. This is the result as far as known. I am having the roads patrolled. A United States saddle has just been brought in to me. The enemy were driven back twice by the Warrenton Bifies, who did good service.	«
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. S. EWELL,
Lieutenant- Colonel.
Col. Thomas Jordan, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—A report has just been made me that two of the enemy have been found dead on their trail.
June 1, 1861.
Sir: Between 3 and 4 o’clock this morning the pickets on the Little Falls Church road gave the alarm, stating that the cavalry of the enemy had taken the advanced pickets and were rapidly approaching the town. This was soon followed by their appearance, firing at the windows and doors of the hotel, where were no resistance or troops. They did not stop, but passed through toward Germantown. I formed Captain Marr’s company of light infantry (receiving valuable aid from his excellency Ex-Governor Smith) and took a position on the road to intercept the enemy’s return. They soon reappeared, forming in the street below the court-house, and, on the interchange of shots, they retreated up the pike. In a few moments they formed a second time at the same spot, and, after firing on both sides, the enemy ran off ingloriously, pulling down fences, and making their escape through the fields by Flint Hill. I had ordered up a squadron from the station, which was sent in pursuit, but the enemy outrode it. They left no dead on the ground, but carbines, pistols, sabers, &c., were lying around. I know of four horses left by them, two in the service of General Beauregard, one wounded and one unfit for use, being

both obstinate and unmanageable, besides two dead, close to the field, and have heard of several left dead on the road. An officer’s saber was picked up on the road by which they ran away. Three prisoners were brought in, who separately reported their strength at eighty, rank and file. They were driven off by less than fifty of Captain Marr’s company of War-renton Rifles. These had no bayonets or other arms than the rifle, while the eighty men of the enemy had a revolver and carbine each, or five hundred and sixty shots without loading. The two cavalry companies here (Rappahannock and Prince William) had very few fire-arms and no ammunition, and took no part in the affair. The enemy captured one vedette and picked up four of the Prince William Cavalry the first time they charged through the town. Captain Marr was found shot through the heart a short distance from the field. I understand he had started, with a portion of his company, toward the enemy and was intercepted by their pickets. This also explains, in part, why there were so few rifles present at the fight. Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell received a flesh wound through the shoulder when they made their last attack.
The above includes all our loss of killed and wounded. Official statements, published in the papers, vary in the loss of the enemy—killed from one to three, and six or eight wounded. A gentleman reported # that they impressed his wagon to carry off the dead and wounded. Their report states one to have been missing. Three prisoners were brought to me, so that they sink to official falsehoods to conceal the truth. The New York Times of the 4th gives their loss at six killed and wounded.
I send below a report made to me by a clergyman who met them on their retreat:
They appeared about forty, had twelve to fifteen led horses, and a wagon, with one corpse and some wounded men; some wounded men on horseback, supported by soldiers mounted behind.
Respectfully,
R. S. EWELL,
