No. 3.
Report of Col. George A. Porterfield, commanding Confederate forces at
Philippi.
Headquarters of Yirginia Forces,
Philippi, Fa., May 29, 1861.
Colonel: On the 27th instant I received reliable Information of a contemplated movement among those hostile to us, by which a large body of men were intended to be precipitated upon me in the rear, by the railroad, without notice, and in a few hours7 time. I was also assured that about fifteen hundred Federal troops had collected at Marietta, some at Bellaire, one thousand or fifteen hundred on the island opposite Wheeling; in fact, that there were considerable bodies of men everywhere on that border that could be easily collected and launched therefrom. In this state of things I ordered some of the bridges of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad northwest of Fairmont to be destroyed, which order was carried into effect by the destruction of two between Farmington and Manuington, about thirty-five miles northwest of Grafton.
I also sent out an expedition to destroy a bridge of the Northwestern Yirginia Railroad, fifty or sixty miles west of Grafton. The object of this expedition has, I am informed, been accomplished, although my party has not yet returned. I caused a small bridge of the same road, about fifteen miles west of Grafton, to be destroyed, but I learn that it has been repaired by the company, so that trains pass over it.
On the evening of the 27th I received information of the arrival, by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, of a body of troops, variously estimated at from one thousand to three thousand, at the burned bridge^

near Mannington. It was supposed that these men would be followed by others as soon as the house-cars which contained them could be returned to the Ohio River. In this state of things I inquired of General Johnston, by telegraph (the Grafton end of which only was under the control of our friends, so far as I know) if he could re-enforce me. For reply, I was informed that no men could be sent from his command at Harper’s Ferry.
On the 28th, learning from the most reliable persons that the invading force had reached Fairmont, twenty miles northwest of Grafton, and thinking that the latter point, from its topography and the character of its population (a good part of which would have united with our enemies upon their appearance) was not an eligible one for us, and considering our very inadequate supply of provisions and ammunition, particularly caps, and that our number of infantry was small (not more than about five hundred and fifty), and the want of any sort of training or military disclipine among our men, and being informed that other bodies of men besides those first spoken of had passed the burned bridges by means of temporary repairs of them, and approached Fairmont, I concluded to remove the State arms and stores to Philippi, about fifteen miles in our rear, there establish a depot, in a friendly country, to concentrate such volunteers as were on the way or could be easily and speedily attracted to that point, and there to organize and strengthen my command. I met on the way an unarmed company of volunteers from Upshur, and at Philippi I was joined by a well-armed company of horse from Rockbridge. I have been compelled to send home, for want of arms to supply them with, a company of horse from Pocahontas, and to dismiss to their homes for a short time a like company raised in Barbour.
As soon as I can organize my command, which I hope to do soon, I will return to some more eligible point in the neighborhood of Grafton, which will enable me to command both railroads, and in the mean time I hope to be able more effectually to cut off the railroad communications east and west of that place. The railroad is unquestionably used by the company against us, and I may be obliged, for the safety of the command at Harper’s Ferry, to make further destruction of it.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. A. PORTERFIELD,
Colonel of Volunteers.

MAY 27-29, 1861.—Expedition to and occupation of Newport News, Va.
Reports of Maj. Gen. B. _F. Butler, U. 8. Army, commanding Department
of Virginia.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
May 27,1861.
Sir: The expedition (of which I gave you information in my former dispatch) to Newport News got off in fine style this morning about 7 o’clock. I have added to the expedition the Eighth New York Regiment, 780 strong, which came here on board the Empire City on Sunday afternoon, and they proceeded without debarking. I also added two 6-pounder and two 12-pounder guns, with a detachment of twenty-five men from Colonel Dimick’s command, who are intended to act as drill-masters to the volunteers in the exercise of the guns. My purpose is to intrench

and hold that point, and ultimately to mount a few heavy guns, which will command that channel of approach to James River.
Since I wrote my last dispatch the question in regard to slave property is becoming one of very serious magnitude. The inhabitants of Virginia are using their negroes in the batteries, and are preparing to send their women and children South. The escapes from them are very numerous, and a squad has come in this morning to my pickets, bringing with them their women and children. Of course these cannot be dealt with upon the theory on which I designed to treat the services of able-bodied men and women who might come within my lines, and of which I gave you a detailed account in my last dispatch. I am in the utmost doubt what to do with this species of property. Up to this time I have had come within my lines men and women with their children—entire families—each family belonging to the same owner. I have therefore determined to employ, as I can do very profitably, the able-bodied persons in the party, issuing proper food fqr the support of all, and charging against their services the expense of care and sustenance of the non-laborers, keeping a strict and accurate account as well of the services as of the expenditures, having the worth of the services and the cost of the expenditures determined by a board of survey, hereafter to be detailed. I know of no other manner in which to dispose of this subject and the questions connected therewith. As a matter of property to the insurgents it will be of very great moment, the number I now have amounting, as I am informed, to what in good times would be of the value of $60,000. Twelve of these negroes, I am informed, have escaped from the erection of batteries on SewelPs Point, which this morning fired upon my expedition as it passed by out of range. As a means of offense, therefore, in the enemy’s hands, these negroes, when able-bodied, are of the last importance. Without them the batteries could not have been erected, at least for many weeks. As a military question, it would seem to be a measure of necessity to deprive their masters of their services. How can this be done? As a political question and a question of humanity, can I receive the services of the father and mother and not take the children? Of the humanitarian aspect I have no doubt. Of the political one I have no right to judge. I therefore submit all this to your better judgment; and as these questions have a political aspect, I have ventured—and I trust I am not wrong in so doing—to duplicate the parts of my dispatches relating to this subject, and forward them to the Secretary of War.
It was understood when I left Washington that the three Massachusetts regiments, two of which are at the Relay House, should be forwarded to me here, and also Cook’s light battery, of which I have the utmost need, if I am expected even to occupy an extended camp with safety. May I ask the attention of the Commanding General to this subject, and inquire if the exigencies of the service will permit these troops to be sent to me immediately? I have to report the arrival of no more troops except the New York Eighth since my last dispatch. The steamship Wabash, which was expected here to take the place of the Minnesota, has not yet reported herself. The Harriet Lane has reported herself here from Charleston, and is employed in convoying the Newport News expedition. I find myself extremely short of ammunition, having but a total in magazine of 85,000 rounds, of which 5,000 rounds only are for the smooth-bore musket, and the major part of my command are provided with that arm. May I desire the attention of the Lieutenant-General to this state of facts, and ask that a large amount of ammunition for that arm—I would suggestu buck and ball”—be ordered forward

[Chap. IX.
from the Ordnance Department 1 The assistant adjutant-general has made a requisition for this purpose. I will endeavor to keep the Lieutenant-General informed daily of any occurrences of interest, provided I am not interfered with by tiie irregularity of the mails and modes of conveyance.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ; F. BUTLER, Major-General, Commanding.
Lieutenant-General Scott.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
May 29, 1801.
Sir: The expedition to Newport News, of which I spoke in my last, eight miles from this place, landed without opposition. I have caused an intrenched camp to be made there, which, when completed, will be able to hold itself against any force that may be brought against it, and afford even a better depot from which to advance than Fortress Monroe. The advantages of the News are these: There are two springs of very pure water there; the bluff is a fine, healthy location. It has two good, commodious wharves, to which steamers of any draught of water may come up at all stages of the tide; it is as near any point of operation as Fortress Monroe, where we are obliged to lighter all vessels of draught over ten feet, and have but one wharf. The News, upon which I propose to have a water battery of four 8-inch guns, commands the ship channel of James River, and a force there is a perpetual threat to Richmond.
My next point of operation I propose shall be Pig Point, which is exactly opposite the News, commanding Nansemond River. Once in command of that battery, which I believe may be easily turned, I can then advance along the Nansemond River and easily take Suffolk, and there either hold or destroy the railroad both between Richmond and Norfolk, and also between Norfolk and the South. With a perfect blockade of Elizabeth River, and taking and holding Suffolk and perhaps York, Norfolk will be so perfectly hemmed in, that starvation will cause the surrender, without risking an attack on the strongly-fortified intrenchments around Norfolk, with great loss and perhaps defeat.
If this plan of operations does not meet the approval of the Lieutenant-General I would be glad of his instructions specifically. If it is desirable to move on Richmond, James and York Rivers, both thus held, would seem to be the most eligible routes.
I have no co-operation substantially by the Navy, the only vessels here now being the Cumberland and Harriet Lane, the former too unwieldy to get near shore to use her heavy guns, the other so light in her battery as not to be able to cope with a single battery of the rebels.
I have yet need of surf-boats for sea-coast and river advances, and beg leave to suggest this matter again to you.
This evening the First New York Regiment, three years’ men, came in on board the State of Georgia. It is in a most shameful state as regards camp equipage, camp kettles, &c.
Another matter needs pressing attention. The bore of a majority of the muskets in my command is smooth, of the issue of ’48, and I have only 5,000 rounds of buck and ball and no other ammunition to fit this arm. Might I request immediate action upon this vital subject ?
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLER.
Major-General, Commanding.
General Winfield Scott.
