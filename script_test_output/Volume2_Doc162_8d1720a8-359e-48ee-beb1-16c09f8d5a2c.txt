Report of Col. P. Jarrett, Eleventh Pennsylvania Infantry.
Hdqrs. Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers,
Camp near Martinsburg, July 3, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report to you the part taken by my command in the engagement of yesterday morning.

reached, from which, however, their guns had by that time been removed. The loss in this part of the command was one killed and eight wounded. Then, closing in my line, I reunited the regiment, and there being no occasion for further operations in that direction, rejoined the remainder of the brigade upon the road.
The officers and men behaved well, and it affords me pleasure to say that each one performed his duty to my entire satisfaction. I am also happy to state that Lieutenant-Colonel Coulter and Major Earnest deserve much credit for the able manner in which they brought their command into action.
Respectfully submitted.

Colonel, Comdg. Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers.
