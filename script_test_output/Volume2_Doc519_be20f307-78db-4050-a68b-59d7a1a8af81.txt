Adjutant-General.
Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Va., May 26, 1861. Col. J. B. Magruder, Commanding, &c., Yorktown, Va.:
Colonel : I have received your communication of the 25th instant. In reply, I would state that I do not think it advisable to receive the company of cavalry from Gloucester. The Varina Troop, Capt. Abner Aiken, and a company from Charles City County, have already been ordered to you. The insufficiency of forage, to which you have alluded, and the unsuitability of the country for the action of cavalry, densely covered as it is by woods and intersected by creeks, nearly render it necessary to diminish the number of companies which you were yesterday informed would be sent you. I request that you will inform me how many companies you will need and how many can be provided for, as it is impossible to send you forage from Richmond.
Very respectfully, &c.,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Va., May 26, 1861. Col. Daniel Ruggles, Commanding, Fredericksburg, Ya. :
Colonel : Your letter of the 24th instant is at hand. The commanding general desires you to report what number of companies you have called out and mustered into the service in the lower counties of the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, what description of troops they are, and where they are now stationed. If, after the arrival of the Second Regiment Tennessee Volunteers and the battery of four 6-pounders, you deem your force still insufficient to hold the enemy in check until other re-enforcements could reach you, it is suggested that you might draw from the counties before mentioned such companies as might be best spared from their present localities. If your mounted force is not already sufficient, and the service of Captain Cauthorn’s company is deemed indispensable, you can muster it into service.
I am, &c.,
R. S. GARNETT,
Adjutant- General.

hundred men. The statement includes what is still in the Ordnance Department, and is exclusive of the twelve or fifteen rounds issued. I respectfully suggest the importance of instant measures to send an additional supply as soon as possible. There is scarcely half enough here for an action.
We are observing the river from Williamsport to the Point of Rocks, at least thirty miles. Our force is too small, however, to prevent invasion by an enemy strong enough to be willing to attempt it. To hold this point and observe the river above the Point of Rocks would require fifteen or twenty thousand men. This position can be turned easily and effectively from above and below. After turning it, an enemy attacking in the rear would have decided advantage of ground against so small a force as our present one. Should the enemy cross the river the troops in this vicinity would be best employed in trying to retard his advance into the country. Their utter want of discipline and instruction will render it difficult to use them in the field. I beg to receive the views and instructions of the Commander-in-Chief in relation to the manner in which the troops under my command can best be used. I am procuring wagons to march, if necessary.
Captain Ashby, commanding near the Point of Rocks, was instructed by my predecessor to break the railroad whenever he found such a measure necessary for his defense. Those instructions were repeated by me. Captain Ashby reported this morning that in consequence of intelligence just received he was about to throw a mass of rock upon it, by blasting.
Most respectfullv, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier- General, 0. 8. Army.
Memorandum in relation to Harper’s Ferry.
[May 26, 1861.]
There is no danger of attack in front, but the position is easily turned by crossing the river above or below. The present force is not sufficient for defense against a superior one, attacking from the Virginia side. Relief, in case of investment, could not be furnished. Considered as a position, I regard Harper’s Perry as untenable by us at present against a strong enemy. We have outposts at the Point of Rocks, near the ferry at Williamsport, and the bridge at Shepherdstown, the extreme points being at least thirty miles apart. Our effective force, including those detachments and two others on the opposite heights, is about five thousand men, with one hundred and forty thousand cartridges and seventy-five thousand percussion caps. The only way in which this force can be made useful, I think, is by rendering it movable, and employing it to prevent or retard the enemy’s passage of the Potomac, and, should he effect the crossing, in opposing his advance into the country. This I shall endeavor to do, unless instructed to the contrary. Orders to provide wagons have been given. Cartridges have been made at the rate of four thousand per diem. I have directed increase of the force employed. Bullet-molds and cartridge-paper are wanting, and may not be^ procured.
J. E. JOHNSTON,
Brigadier-General, G. 8. Army.
