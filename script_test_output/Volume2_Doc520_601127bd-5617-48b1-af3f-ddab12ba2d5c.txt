Brigadier-General Huger, Commanding, ffc., Norfolk, Fa. ;
Sir: From the facts stated in your telegram received to-day I think it not improbable that the object of the troops which are landing at Newport News may be either to ascend Nansemond Biver to the town of Suffolk, or, if that river be too well protected for this, to cross James Biver to Burwell’s Bay, and thence, by land, to Suffolk, or some point of the railroad. The effect of either of these movements will be to cut off your communication with Bichmond, and I take the liberty of calling your attention to this, as I know the pressure of the duties now upon you. I would recommend that you telegraph the governor of North Carolina to hasten the movements of those troops which are destined for Norfolk, Va., if they have not already arrived, and to recommend that he dispatch a sufficient force to Suffolk.
I am, general, with respect, your obedient servant,
B. E. LEE, General, Commanding.

Sir: You will proceed to Petersburg, and if the company from Fort Powhatan meets you there you will conduct it to Zuni, and endeavor to make temporary arrangements for its accommodation. You will give instructions to the commanding officer to guard the bridges over that river, and how to proceed in the event of the approach of the U. S. troops in force. Should the company not have reached Petersburg on your arrival, you will leave orders for it to follow to Zuni, where you will post it. If you find it necessary, you will continue to Norfolk and concert with the president of the road the best measures to be taken to guard it. After this, you will return to this point. You

Sir: I have received information, by telegraph, to-day from Norfolk that the Federal troops are landing at Newport News, i deem it proper to inform you of this, as it may be their intention to move on to Warwick Court-House, and thence, by the road, to Yorktown. Captains Cosby and Hood, of the Confederate Army, have been ordered to report to you for the purpose of instructing the cavalry troop.

Col. J. A. Early,
Virginia Volunteers, Commanding, cfee., Lynchburg, Va. : Colonel: The commanding general instructs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant,* and to express to you his satisfaction with the manner in which you repressed the difficulty among the companies under your command in relation to their arms. There are no cavalry arms here to issue, unless your companies would be willing to accept flint-lock pistols, of which we have only two hundred and ten.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston,
Commanding, &c., Harper’s Ferry, Fa. ;
General: In a letter from Colonel Jackson, of the 21st instant, lately received, he speaks of the want of an ordnance or artillery officer at your post. There is none at present available, but Major Elzey, of the Confederate Army, has been ordered here, and I will endeavor to place him on duty with you. Meantime I have thought that the services of Colonel Jackson might be applied to the mounting and preparing the batteries for service. The proper defense of the country west of you and the command of the railroad through that region is deemed very important to the safety of your position, and it is hoped you will be able to take measures to maintain it, or prevent the use of the road to invaders of the State. It is thought probable that you might add to the comfort of your command by procuring, or causing to be procured,

Sir : You will proceed with the company under your command to Burwell’s Bay, to watch the movements of the enemy, in order to give notice of his approach, should he land in that vicinity and attempt to penetrate towards the railroad. In that case you will immediately dispatch messengers to Suffolk and to Zuni, where the Norfolk and Petersburg Eailroad crosses the Blackwater. You will then keep in front of the enemy, to observe his motions and retard his advance. Should it be necessary to communicate with you, such communications will be sent through the Smith field post-office.

Colonel Garnett, Adjutant- General:
Sir : I have just received, by a special messenger from Major Cary, the following dispatch: u The enemy are landing at Newport News. Five steamers are up James Biver. Destination unknown. Please send down cavalry immediately.” I have not a single horseman, and cannot get one. A large force of cavalry, as I have stated before, seems to me to be absolutely necessary, to learn of the movements of the enemy. Major Cary is falling back with only thirty-five men, the rest of the troops being engaged in removing their families. The five steamers are reported by the express as being filled with troops. I am of the impression that this is intended to be an attack on our flanks.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

See if you can get some cavalry off to Colonel Magruder. Should an advance be made by Williamsburg, Randolph’s battery, with the others here, must be sent down. Send those artillery companies from Lynchburg to Craney Island and Jamestown.

Headquarters,
Yorhtown, Va., May 27, 1861—3 p. m. Colonel Garnett, Adjutant-General:
Sir : I am instructed by Colonel Magruder to inform you that, although he had been positively assured by Major Cary that five steamers had proceeded up James River (destination unknown), they have not yet made their appearance at Grove Wharf or King’s Mill, and that, should they land at either of the above-mentioned places, his present force would be insufficient to resist them effectually. I am also instructed to inform you that for the want of cavalry he has been obliged to disorganize his artillery, in order that they may act as vedeites. Under any circumstances, though, you may depend upon this place being defended, and held for two or three days at least.
I am, very respectfully,
