If strong defensible positions can be found on Bull Bun Creek, or in advance of it, it is advised that they be also occupied and strengthened; but the position of Manassas Junction, being of great importance to us, must be secured by all means in your power.*

With his practical knowledge of engineering, and the assistance of Lieutenant Colonels Ewell, Jordan, and Jones, all capable men, it is believed that you will be enabled to adopt judicious means of defense for your position. An additional regiment of infantry will be sent you tomorrow. Be pleased to make formal requisitions on the proper departments for whatever may be necessary for your command, and forward them to this office. As soon as practicable, the commanding general desires a statement of the circumstances under which Ball?s dragoons were captured, as mentioned in your telegraphic dispatch.

Sir : Your requisition for harness for a battery of artillery and for ammunition has been received. The Ordnance Department has been instructed, as far as practicable, to supply the ammunition, and to send it to the care of Maj. M. G. Harman, at Staunton, who has been instructed to adopt the safest and most expeditious means of sending it to you. You will confer with him by letter as to the best means of doing this. It is believed that suitable harness can be made or purchased in the valley. If good, strong wagon-harness can be made or purchased, you are authorized to direct the quartermaster to buy it for you. There is none to be had here immediately. You will report what can be done in this respect. Send a copy of this communication to Colonel Tompkins, commanding, &c.

By this time the companies from Staunton must have reached you; also one from Harper’s Ferry, and I hope that the true men of that region have been encouraged to come out into the service of the State. I will write to the commanding officer of

Harper’s Ferry to give you all aid in his power, and I hope you will spare no pains to preserve the integrity of the State, and to prevent the occupation of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad by its enemies. In answer to your inquiry as to the treatment of traitors, I cannot believe that any citizen of the State will betray its interests, and hope all will unite in supporting the policy she may adopt.

Fredericksburg, May 24,1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces :

Headquarters, Fredericksburg, Va.7 May 24,1861. General R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir : I have the honor to state, in answer to the communication from the commanding general of the forces, dated the 13th instant, that I cannot spare the two companies from Richmond (Captains Wise’s and Cunningham’s), without irreparable injury to the service for some time to come. These companies, under the command of Colonel Cary, are now (in conjunction with other forces) covering the Potomac batteries and avenues of approach, becoming acquainted with the character of the district and its natural defenses, thus rendering their services indispensable.
I have also to state (on information) that the officers and men in said companies are anxious to remain here, to be incorporated with a regiment about being organized. Their return to Richmond, it is said, would give the greatest dissatisfaction, and very probably break up these fine companies.
The receipt this morning of private advices from Washington warrants the belief that the enemy contemplate striking a blow without much further delay. Under these circumstances, as I am not able to place a sufficient force for the protection of the upper border of Stafford County, from which, if a landing is once effected, a flank movement will endanger the efficiency of the Aquia Creek battery, and as the force for covering the battery on the Potomac Creek is not of sufficient strength to do full justice to the position, I respectfully recommend that one thousand well-disciplined volunteers be sent here, with a battery of four rifled or smooth-bore field guns for immediate service. With this reenforcement I shall hope to prevent the enemy from effecting a landing or advancing before additional force may be concentrated against him.
I respectfully represent that a successful debarkation of the enemy on this part of the Potomac coast would in all probability drive a large portion of the population from between the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers, possessing themselves of a large amount of supplies, (necessary for the support of the people and our forces), and thus carry

demoralization and alarm throughout the State, from the fact that a successful invasion of our soil had been effected. The position of the enemy once attained between the Potomac and the Rappahannock Rivers, a fertile region, filled with supplies and resources, would, from its natural advantages, become a most important possession, from which it would be difficult to dislodge him.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
DANIEL RUGGLES,

Col. Benj. S. Ewell, Commanding, cfic., Williamsburg, Va.:
Colonel: I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, and to inform you that he approves of your views respecting the defense of Hampton. #Adjutants of battalions or regiments must be appointed from the lieutenants belonging to the battalion or regiment. They cannot be taken from the ranks. If Mr. Taliaferro is elected a lieutenant of one of the companies under your command General Lee will request the governor to commission him, and you can then appoint him your adjutant. Field pieces have been sent to Colonel Magruder at Yorktown. General Lee has not heard whether the lines are begun at Williamsburg. Will you please to inform him if they are under way and what progress has been made in their construction? No time should be lost in completing these works. They are of great importance, and a large force should be employed on them. You are requested to inform him what force you have working on these lines, and, if insufficient, whether you cannot increase it from the neighboring country. Colonel Magruder has been written to upon this subject.
I am, &c.,

General Benj. Huger, Comdg. Virginia Forces, Norfolk, Va. : General : I wish to -call your attention to the condition of Craney Island. It is the first point that will arrest the passage of a vessel to Norfolk) it is the most exposed and the least prepared for defense. I cannot urge upon you too strongly the necessity of putting it in good condition. More troops should be ordered there, and laborers, if practicable. If laborers cannot be obtained, the troops must work at the trenches at that point and all others within your lines of defense. A North Carolina regiment will leave here to morrow for your post.
Very respectfully, &c.,

Colonel : Your letter of the 24th instant* has just been received. I understand there is no cavalry at Fort Monroe, no baggage wagons, and but one company of light artillery. I do not think an immediate movement by land may be expected, but 1 wish you to be prepared for any emergency. According to reports in this office, there must be three companies of cavalry under your command. 1 will order to you five more. We have no wagons yet for service with troops in the field. It is supposed that you will find no difficulty in procuring wagons and teams in the neighborhood, as many persons in that section of the country engaged in the wood trade, which is now suspended, must have them on hand. You will please see what arrangements you can make for hiring or purchasing the same through your quartermaster, and let him make a report to the chief quartermaster at this place.

Col. J. B. Magruder, Commanding, ctie., YorTctown, Ya.:
Colonel : Two 12-pounder brass pieces have been directed to be sent you at Yorktown, which may be applied to the land defenses either below Yorktown or Williamsburg, as you may deem best. Two 8-inch columbiads are also sent to you at Yorktown, and, if not wanted for the water defense, they had better be applied to the land, either there or at Williamsburg. I again urge upon you the necessity of the line of defenses between the heads of Queen and College Creeks, about which Colonel Ewell has already received instructions. Colonel Ewell had better be directed to apply all the force he can procure to the erection of those lines. Captains Fives and Meade, of the Engineer Corps, are on duty in the peninsula, and subject to your orders. Should the lines below Williamsburg not have been surveyed and laid out, they had better be put at it directly.

He will be subject to your orders for the general purposes of defense, but will conform to the instructions of Colonel Talcott as regards the plans and details of the work. You are desired to urge forward the completion of all the batteries, both for the water and land defense, for which purpose it will be desirable for you

Hon. L. Pope Walker, Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.:
Sir : Being very much embarrassed in furnishing the troops which have been called into service by the State of Virginia with arms, ammunition, and the necessary accouterments, on account of the limited supply and the small size of our arsenal and workshops, I beg leave to suggest that the troops ordered to this State may come provided with arms, ammunition, cartridge-boxes, knapsacks, haversacks, and all other necessary equipments, and that their organization be as complete as practicable.

Referred to General J. E. Johnston, commanding officer at Harper’s Ferry.

Yorktown, Va., May 25,1861. Maj. J. B. Cary, Commanding near Hampton:
Sir : I have not been able to see Colonel Ewell since my arrival here. We learn from Mr. White, a member of your troop, that you are probably at Back Eiver, and that you have been joined by a company of rifles and one of artillery, the latter with two or three pieces. If so, you must be very careful not to be cut off by a larger party getting in your ' rear. It would be difficult for you to bring off your pieces if the enemy got in your rear. You will therefore keep mounted sentinels at night at or near Newport News wharf, on your right, and at all the proper points on your left; and should you "discover a design to cut you off, you must withdraw in time to prevent it. It would be very desirable

to have the artillery drawn by horses or mules. Ordinary wagon harness will answer, and the people of the country ought to furnish the horses. If you cannot get the horses you will lose your pieces, if the enemy choose to send a force up James Eiver much larger than yours. I therefore think that you had better send your artillery to Hood’s Mill, about ten miles from here. Place it strongly there, protected by your rifles, and keep your cavalry, as usual, in sight of Fort Monroe. In this way you would show front to the fort, and place your guns and rifles in safe connection with this point.
I have established an express^ to Eichmond from here. Please send me your dispatches by one of your mounted men whenever you observe anything worth communicating, and I will forward it to General Lee by the special express. I will be down to see you as soon as I arrange affairs here.

I have ordered four hundred men of the command to be set to work to-morrow morning on this battery, and as soon as I can select the defensive positions towards the interior, which will be to-morrow morning, I shall commence the intrenchments there and prosecute them vigorously.
