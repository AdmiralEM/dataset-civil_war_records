No. 2.
Reports of Col. John B. Magruder, commanding Confederate forces.*
Steamer Logan,
West Point, Fa., May 24,1861—5 p. m.
Sir : A person, said to be reliable by the captain of this boat, states that he fled from Hampton last night, and that twenty-five hundred troops had taken possession of it. I have to request that two lighters, with three hands each, be sent to Jamestown Island as soon as possible, to establish communication with that place and the mainland. At present supplies for Williamsburg have to be carried eight miles, I believe at King’s Mills, and of course liable to be seized by the enemy. They can be furnished at once in Richmond and sent down by the daily steamers. I have earnestly to request that a portion of the cavalry already organized should be sent to me at Yorktown or Williamsburg. No reliable information can be attained without them. This steamer

can carry twenty-five liundred men per day, with smaller vessels sent to take their baggage. She can carry three troops of horse a day, fifty horses each. I shall need at least four companies of cavalry to operate against the advance of troops from Hampton, to cut off their parties, to harass them on the march, and to beat up their quarters at night $ and, to make these more effective, I know of no greater service the section of navy howitzers at Gloucester Point can do more than to operate with this cavalry. The advance could even be checked by this small force thus constituted. I should mount the artillery with the means of the country for this purpose. This can be done at once. I have no doubt they cannot be of much use anywhere as fixed batteries, and could at any time be recalled to Eichmond, if required there. Should it be deemed advisable to send cavalry immediately, as I earnestly hope may be the case, I have the honor to state that both Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell and Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram have stated to me their desire to command such a detachment under my command.
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. B. MAGBUDEK,
Colonel, Commanding Troops on York and James Rivers.
To Colonel Garnett.
Steamer Logan,
# Yorktown, Va., May 24, 1861—11.30 p. m. Sir : Since arriving at this point I have learned that the news which was forwarded to you from West Point was incorrect. Only one thousand troops were marched into Hampton, which they only occupied fora short time. A small surveying party was landed at Newport News. There is no cavalry between this and Hampton. One company there. Not a horseman nor a wagon here. Mr. Anderson, the bearer, will give further particulars.
I am, sir, verv respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. B. MAGETTDER, Colonel, Commanding.
Colonel Garnett.
