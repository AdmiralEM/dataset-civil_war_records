)	Richmond, Van April 26, 1861.
Maj. Gen. Walter Gwynn, of the Virginia volunteers, has been assigned to the chief command of the State forces in and about the city of Norfolk. In exercising that command, it is desired that he advise with, and, as far as practicable, act in relation to naval matters in consonance with the views of the senior naval officer present. It is further suggested that the interests of the State might be best served by employing naval officers in the construction and service of water batteries, or such as are intended to act against shipping.
By command of Major-General Lee:

Montgomery, April 26, 1861. Governor John Letcher, Richmond, Ya.:
The convention between your commonwealth and this Government places at the disposal of the President the military force of Virginia* Will you therefore inform me of what this force consists, and at what points and in what numbers it is being rendezvoused. For action here an early answer is requested.

I respectfully ask of the governor and council what arrangements have been made to enable the army of the State to take the field % Besides the necessary camp equipage, some means of transportation must be provided other than that furnished by the railroad companies. It will not always be possible to adhere to the railroad routes, and provision must be made for maneuvering in front of an enemy and for supplying troops with provisions, and at positions to be held or forced. Horses for the light batteries will be necessary, and wagons for local transportation. Are there any funds for these purposes, or how are they to be procured

Sir : You will direct Col. T. J. Jackson to proceed to Harper’s Ferry, to organize into regiments the volunteer forces which have been called into the service of the State, and which maybe assembled in the neighborhood. Direct him to report with as much dispatch as possible the number and description of the companies thus organized $ the character and condition of their arms, and the names of the company officers present for duty, and where from; also, the names of all general, field, and staff officers now in the field in that command, that the Executive may have the information required for the proper organization of the regiments and brigades according to the ordinance of the Convention of April 21,1861. You will place Colonel Jackson, for the present, in command of the troops in that locality, and give him such general instructions as may be required for the military defenses of the State. Direct him to make diligent inquiry as to the state of feeling in the northwestern portion of the State. If necessary, appoint a confidential agent for that purpose, but great confidence is placed in the personal knowledge of Major Jackson in this regard. If deemed expedient, he can assemble the volunteer forces of the northwest at such points as he may deem best, giving prompt information of the same. Promptness in all these matters is indispensable.
I am, very respectfully,

companies from the same section of the State. These will be placed under their senior captains, until the field officers can be appointed by the governor. It is desired that you expedite the transfer of the machinery to this place, ordered to the Richmond Armory, should it not have been done, and that you complete, as fast as possible, any guns or rifles partially constructed, should it be safe and practicable. Your attention will be particularly directed to the safety of such alrms, machinery, parts of arms, raw material, &c., that may be useful, to insure which they must be at once sent into the interior, if in your judgment necessary. If any artillery companies offer their services, or are mustered into the service of the State, and are without batteries, report the facts.

Alexandria, Va., April 27, 1861. General Lee, Com mander-in- Ch ief:
Having succeeded in accomplishing the objects of taking up my temporary headquarters at this place, I proceed to-morrow morning to Culpeper Court-House, by the 6 o’clock train, which, as at present advised, will be my headquarters for some time to come. Colonel Jones, having arrived, will accompany me to Culpeper Court-House. I have arranged for my communications, through the medium of rail, wire, and courier, to headquarters, and I have, also, through a private chain of couriers (hence through Maryland to Baltimore), connected with General Steuart, in that city. My first volunteer aid, John S. Barbour, jr., remaining here, will receive dispatches at Alexandria.
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE.
Ordnance Department, Richmond, Fa., April 27,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Army and Navy of Virginia:
General : As your attention is so much monopolized by the personal applications of our rather unsystematized citizen soldiers, I prefer to put on paper what I have to say:
1st. Without your positive order I fear there will be a dangerous delay in removing the machinery from Harper’s Ferry. Captain Carter, of this department, sent by me to take charge of and remove this machinery, writes me that it will take probably six weeks to remove it. From the tenor of his letter I conclude that there is a disposition from the surrounding citizens to hold back the removal. Would it not be best for you to instruct General Harper, in command, to push forward this matter ?
2d. As there is not room at the armory to work up and pack away all the ammunition for heavy ordnance, field pieces, and small-arms, I respectfully suggest that the laboratory work upon all ammunition for the heavy pieces for stationary batteries be done elsewhere than at the armory, and under the superintendence of a naval officer. Why not at Norfoik? If not there, I can get a large tobacco factory in this city. It is more than I can attend to, having but one officer in my department, and he away at Harper’s Ferry. In conversing with Captain Minor, of 50 R R—VOL II

the Navy, he entirely approves of this; but your order seems to be required. I can attend to all field artillery and foot troops, but wish the heavy guns and their ammunition to be under the Navy Department.
If it be intended to give me an experienced officer to aid me in the Ordnance Department, please do so, but give him a rank beyond that of captain, as if he is experienced he should rank higher than captain. The call for ammunition has been and is yet great. ? I hope none will be wasted, for we have none to spare. As it now is, General Richardson, adjutant-general, gives the orders for the issues—carefully, I know, but he is importuned excessively. Some assistance, I think, should be given him. Pardon this suggestive communication.
I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,
0. DIMMOCK, Colonel of Ordnance.

As soon as practicable you are instructed to report here the number and condition of the arms so returned.

Headquarters Potomac Department, Culpeper Court-House, Fa., April 28, 1861—12.30 p. m. General Lee, Commander-in-Chief, Richmond, Va.:
Having completed the requisite arrangements at Alexandria, and succeeded in informing myself of the actual state of things at that outpost of my command, in sight of the enemy, I proceeded this morning, by the 7 o’clock train, accompanied by the assistant adjutant-general, my aide, and secretary, towards this place, which I reached at 10 a. m., and where I propose, for some time to come, to establish my headquarters. I left all quiet and composed at Alexandria, where by my presence, during the suddenly augmented flow of Northern vandalism through Annapolis, I was so fortunate as to avert alarm and panic.
Intelligence first reached me, ever finding a solution through my knowledge of and confident faith in the existing status, not immediately, in my opinion, threatened to be overthrown, so long as there is nothing more than a mere persistence in a course on the part of the enemy, long ago initiated, and even now only intensified and strengthened; thus solving, as I did, the thousand sensations, rumors, and accounts that poured in upon me during my whole stay in Alexandria.
I have been enabled to infuse the same confidence into the minds of the leading citizens of the place, to have secured their confidence, and to

have left them for the present tranquil and firm; whilst at the same time I have provided to organize the few troops in that extreme outpost ; to provide for strengthening the same for the present up to about one thousand men; to establishing my communications in every direction, and thence to these headquarters 5 to throw myself in connection with various persons and sources of information at Alexandria 5 to inform myself as correctly as possible as to the number, efficiency, movements, and animus of the enemy, and by every means in my power to urge on such an organization, drilling, and discipline of the troops of that post as would best prepare them for the trying position they occupy.
In coming here, sir, I find myself, as upon my first arrival in Alexandria, “ with naked hands.”
Colonel Jones, fortunately assigned to me as assistant adjutant-general, is the first Army officer to report for duty within my command. He promptly arrived in Alexandria last evening, and is with me here to-day. He will know what to do with his department, but I want an assistant quartermaster-general, a chief of the medical department, an ordnance officer, a chief of military engineering of talent. I had heretofore insinuated a preference in this last connection. I want arms. I am expecting from fifteen hundred to two thousand guns from Harper’s Ferry, when they shall be able to fit them up from the wreck of that place. I want a chief of artillery ; I want powder; two or three batteries of field artillery (6-pounders), with caissons, ammunition, complete for service, &c.
My part now will be to rally the men of the fine country around me, to establish camps of instruction, to wit: Leesburg, Warrenton, headquarters, and at or near Dangerfield, in supporting distance of Alexandria. I want camp equipage for the various encampments above indicated.
In regard to Harper’s Ferry, that most important strategic point on my left, and in connection with which I have not yet been able to place myself in a satisfactory attitude and connection owing to the lack of telegraph communication; of continued rail; for want of full understanding with the chief of command at that position; for want of the requisite and reliable information of all the various circumstances and conditions affecting the present military state of things at that post.
I have, since my arrival here, indicated the plan of sending Assistant Adjutant-General Jones, by rail, to-morrow, to that point, to obtain all such information, and to report to me accurately and fully the present condition of things there with as little delay as possible.

It is desirable that the business operations of the company and peaceful travel shall not be interrupted, but be afforded protection. Maj. F. M. Boykin, jr., has been directed to give protection to the road in the vicinity of Grafton. You will place yourself in communication with him, with the view to cooperate, if necessary.

You will proceed to the valley of the Kanawha, and muster into the service of the State such volunteer companies (not exceeding ten) as may offer their services, in compliance with the call of the governor $ take the command of them, and direct the military operations for the protection of that section of country. Your policy will be strictly defensive, and you will endeavor to give quiet and assurance to the inhabitants. It has been reported that two companies are already found in Kanawha County, Captain Patten’s and Captain Sevann’s, and that there are two in Putnam County, Captain Becket’s and Captain Fife’s. It is supposed that others will offer their services. The number of enlisted men to a company, fixed by the Convention, is eighty-two. You will report the condition of the arms, &c., of each company, and, to enable you to supply deficiencies, five hundred muskets, of the old pattern, will be sent. I regret to state that they are the only kind at present for issue. Four field pieces will also be sent you as soon as possible, for the service of which you are desired to organize a company of artillery. The position of the companies at present is left to your judgment, and you are desired to report what points below Charleston will most effectually accomplish the objects in view.

Col. R. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General, Virginia Army, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to report that there are three light artillery batteries now together at the artillery barracks, Baptist Seminary, viz: Randolph’s (of six pieces, called the Howitzer Battery), Cabell’s (four pieces of light artillery), and Latham’s (four pieces of light artillery). Two pieces will be added to Randolph’s battery, he having two hundred and twenty-five drilled men in his company. I propose that these two pieces should be Parrotts rifled cannon, as being more nearly the weight of Randolph’s howitzers, which are of the Dahlgren pattern.
I have to request that the battery of rifled cannon (Parrotts), now in charge of Captain Walker, and some forty men, not mustered into service, and now at Fredericksburg, Va., be ordered to the artillery barracks near this place, and, after turning over their cannon and implements, that Captain Walker’s company (if it can be made up to its proper complement) be received into the artillery service and drilled, so as to be ready for service with any battery that may be prepared for it.
Randolph’s battery, being divided into two batteries, of four pieces each, both under his command, will thus (with the cadet battery) make six batteries, of four pieces each, which should be housed immediately. I have to request, therefore, that three hundred and fifty-six horses be purchased without delay for mounting these companies, and that the Quartermaster-General should be directed to send them out to the artillery barracks (as they may be called for by requisitions of the captains, approved by the proper authorities), and to furnish, also, the necessary halters, riding-saddles and bridles, picket-rope, girths, horse-blankets, horseshoes, and forage; also, that the Ordnance Department be instructed to furnish such batteries of light artillery with their harness and caissons complete, and battery wagons and forges, as may be required from time to time by requisition, and to purchase at once the running-gear of as many wagons as can be conveniently turned into caissons, for the service of such pieces as are or may be mounted.
The following is the estimate of horses for each battery, subject to such modifications as experience may suggest, viz : Randolph’s Dahlgren howitzers, with two rifled guns attached, 84 horses ; Cabell’s light battery, of four pieces, 68 horses; Latham’s light battery, of four pieces, 68 horses) rifled battery, of four pieces, at Fredericksburg, 68 horses; cadet battery, of four guns, at the fair grounds, 68 horses. Total for six batteries, 356 horses.
For the purpose of assisting in drilling these companies, I request

## p. 790 (#806) ############################################

﻿790	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA, VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX,
that ten cadets, of the higher classes, be detached and ordered to report to me for temporary duty. They will be borne on the provision return of one of the companies, and arrangements will be made for messing and quartering them comfortably. I recommend that the cadet battery be turned over to me also, to be prepared for the field and for the purposes of drill. I request, also, that as many artillery officers (late of the U. S. Army) as can be spared be ordered To report to me for duty. At present I have no staff officers of any description.
There are field pieces enough in the State for more than twenty companies, or two regiments. Taking that as a basis, and deducting six batteries (the horses of which have been estimated for above), there will be required for the remaining batteries, if six horses to a piece be used, 952 horses; if four, 616 horses. Should any of the batteries be of 12-pounder guns and 24-pounder howitzers, which I would recommend to a limited extent, then the estimate would be increased proportionately.
There is at the camp of the cadets one rifled gun (Parrott), without carriage. I think it ought to be sent to the artillery barracks. Colonel Gillam offered it to me, and also informed me that Sergeant Rap wt say, an experienced ordnance sergeant, was at my service, and recommended him strongly to me. 1 should like to have him ordered to report to me at once. I am also informed that the cadets have sixty-five artillery sabers, which I desire to get, as one of the companies of artillery has not an arm of any kind with which to arm themselves, even as sentinels.
As the making of harness for artillery seems to be a slow operation, from the scarcity of mechanics, I would respectfully recommend that a pattern of the artillery harness be sent to each of the considerable towns on the lines of the railroads, where they can be manufactured. Some carriages might also be procured with more rapidity in this way, as well as tents, which the artillery companies, that have reported, are in want of.

To place this battery a large supporting force will be necessary, and as the Federal Government has now in Washington, as we believe, twenty or twenty-five thousand troops, and means of transporting four or five thousand in a few hours to any point on the Potomac, we consider a movement of that kind at present injudicious. We would respectfully suggest that the two 8-inch guns, ammunition, &c., now in Alexandria be removed to this or some other point on the railroad, where they would be in a safer position.

A PROCLAMATION.
The sovereignty of the Commonwealth of Virginia having been denied, her territorial rights assailed, her soil threatened with invasion by the authorities at Washington, and every artifice employed which could inflame the people of the Northern States and misrepresent our purposes and wishes, it becomes the solemn duty of every citizen of this State to prepare for the impending conflict. These misrepresentations have been carried to such extent that foreigners and naturalized citizens who but a few years ago were denounced by the North and deprived of essential rights have now been induced to enlist into regiments for the purpose of invading this State, which then vindicated those rights and effectually resisted encroachments which threatened their destruction. Against such a policy and against a force which the Government at Washington, relying upon its numerical strength, $ is now rapidly concentrating, it becomes the State of Virginia to prepare proper safeguards. To this end and for these purposes, and with a determination to repel invasion, I, John Letcher, governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, by authority of the Convention, do hereby authorize the commanding general of the military forces of this State to call out and cause to be mustered into the service of Virginia, from time to time, as the public exigencies may require, such additional number of volunteers as he may deem necessary.
To facilitate this call the annexed schedule will indicate the places of rendezvous at which the companies called for will assemble upon receiving orders for service.

Advised unanimously that General Gwynn be instructed to furnish, upon the order of the governor of Missouri, the heavy ordnance called for in his requisition, provided that the order can be filled without detriment to the public service at Norfolk, in all twenty-two pieces, ten 24 and 18-pounder siege guns, four 8-pounder howitzers, six 8 or 10-inch mortars, and two 8-inch columbiads.

Officers will be sent to the respective rendezvous to muster these troops into service and rapidly to organize the whole force.
Therefore, I call upon the brave men within the geographical limits above indicated to respond instantly to this demand upon their patriotism in defense of all that is held sacred and dear to freemen. Men of the Potomac Military Department, to arms! The once peaceful capital of the United States is now the great rallying point of the armed military power of the Korth! The Constitution of your country, the sovereign rights of your State, truth, justice, and liberty, are all ignored and outraged amidst the brutal and frenzied cry of the Korth for force, force!
At this moment hosts of armed men profane by their insolent presence the city, the grave, and the memory of Washington, whilst an unbroken stream of thousands in arms violate the soil of Maryland and murder her citizens in their march to re-enforce and occupy the caintal.
And for what'? The capital has never been threatened; it is not now threatened. It is beyond and outside the limits of the free and sovereign State of Virginia.
The Korth has not openly, and according to the usage of civilized nations, declared war on us. We make no war on them; but should Virginia soil or the grave of Washington be polluted by the tread of a single man in arms from north of the Potomac, it will cause open war. Men of the Potomac border, men of the Potomac Military Department, to arms! Your country calls you to her defense. Already you have in spirit responded. You await but the order to march, to rendezvous, to organize, to defend your State, your liberties, and your homes.
Women of Virginia! Cast from your arms all cowards, and breathe the pure and holy, the high and glowing, inspirations of your nature into the hearts and souls of lover, husband, brother,*father, friend!
Almighty God! Author and Governor of the world; Thou source of all light, life, truth, justice, and power, be Thou our God! Be Thou with us! Then shall we fear not a world against us!

Colonel: Under the authority of the governor of Virginia, by his proclamation of the 3d instant, you are hereby authorized to call out and muster into the service of the State volunteer companies from the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Eoanoke, Botetourt, Craig, Giles, Mercer, Tazewell, Wise, Buchanan, McDowell, Smythe, Wythe, Pulaski, Montgomery, Carroll, Floyd, Patrick, Henry, and Franklin, to ren-• dezvous at Lynchburg, Campbell County, not to exceed five regiments of infantry and riflemen and one regiment of cavalry. You will organize them into regiments, associating together, as far as possible, the troops from Campbell, Bedford, Eoanoke, Botetourt, and Craig, and associate the troops from the other above-named counties together, as far as possible, with reference to the sections of the State from which they come. Col. J. A. Early has been directed to take command of the troops as mustered. Place them under such officers as may be available, until their proper field officers can be appointed by the governor, and, in event of his absence, you will perform this duty until his arrival.

Colonel : In my letter to you of this date you were directed to muster the volunteer companies from the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Roanoke, Botetourt, and Craig distinct from the troops coming from the other counties named in my letter. The reason of this is, that Col. P. St. G. Cocke had already been ordered to muster the troops from these five counties into the service of the State, and to send an officer to Lynchburg for that purpose, and they are designed, to serve in his division. The order to Colonel Cocke to send an officer to Lynchburg to muster the troops from these counties will be countermanded, and, though mustered into service by you, they will be considered as a part of the troops intended for Colonel Cocke’s line, who will order them to some point on his line, after you notify him that they have been mustered into service.

yard, as well as in other parts of my command, there has been, and still [is], the most cordial co-operation in all measures intended for the common defense, not only between Commodore Forrest and myself, but between all the officers of the Army and Navy in this command. As an illustration of this, I may mention that one of the most important posts of my command, viz, Fort Norfolk, is under the command of Oapt. Arthur Sinclair, of the Navy, including all the land forces stationed at that post.
The immediate occasion of the communication of Commodore Forrest, of which I sent you the copy, was the act of Captain Fairfax, ordnance officer, in taking possession without my knowledge of the whole supply of percussion caps within my control, the greater part of which, I understood, he was about to send off to Richmond under an order from Colonel Dimmock, which would have left my whole force inefficient. Besides which, I had not been able, notwithstanding my repeated requests, to get any sufficient information as to the quantity of munitions and stores in the navy-yard, which information was indispensable to the proper discharge of my duties. Under these circumstances I thought it best to send that communication to Commodore Forrest with a view to the prevention of further embarrassments and misunderstandings. I must add that I have not yet been able to get the inventory of the munitions and stores in the navy-yard, nor has the commodore made any reply to that part of the above-mentioned communication. I trust, however, that your communication will remove all doubt upon the point of difference above indicated.
I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General : I assumed command of this post on Monday last, soon after my arrival here. Since that time I have been busily occupied organizing the command and mustering the troops into service. 1 send herewith a report of the strength for May 4.# To-morrow I will give you a more detailed account of the forces, equipments, &c. All the troops have been mustered into service, except some companies on detached service. I have occupied the Virginia and Maryland Heights, and I am about fortifying the former with block-houses of sufficient strength to resist an attempt to carry them by storm. Whenever the emergency calls lor it, I shall construct similar works on the Maryland Heights. Thus far I have been deterred from doing so by a desire to avoid giving offense to the latter State. If you have an experienced engineer officer, I hope that you will order him here, if you have no duty for him elsewhere. There are four 6-pounder guns here without caissons. I re* spectfully request that you will send the caissons, and also two 6-pounder batteries and two extra 12-pounder howitzers, all fully supplied with ammunition, horses, equipments, and everything necessary for being turned over to companies now waiting for them.

four thousand flints have been found here, I have taken the responsibility of ordering the one thousand flint-lock rifles from the Lexington Arsenal, and also ten barrels of musket and ten barrels of rifle powder, as in my opinion the emergency justified the order. Should the Federal troops advance in this direction, I shall no longer stand on ceremony. In addition to the cavalry stationed at Point of Eocks, I this morning ordered two 6-pounders to the same position. The enemy, from good authority, are about four thousand strong in the neighborhood of Chambersburg. About two-thirds of the machinery from the musket factory has been removed from here. This morning Mr. John Ambler, the quartermaster in Winchester, informed me that the merchants were paying double freights, and were thus securing all the transportation. To prevent the consequent delay of the machinery, I directed him to impress the wagons. He also notified me that the baggage cars from Strasburg were employed in carrying flour from the valley to New York, and that every barrel would be required for our use. To remedy this evil, until the subject could be referred to you, and also to secure the transportation for the machinery, I directed him to impress the cars. About four hundred and eighty Kentucky volunteers are here without arms, and stand greatly in need of them. I directed some old arms to be issued to them, but they refused to receive them. I refer the subject to you, with the hope that something may be done towards arming them. The material is good. My object is to put Harper’s Ferry in the most defensible state possible, and hence feel it my duty to give the best arms to the Virginia troops, as the others may at any time be ordered off. The news from the northwest shows great disaffection, especially in Ohio County.

Col. E. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General Volunteer Forces, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to transmit, for the consideration of the general commanding the forces, the report of Maj. Thomas H. Williamson, chief engineer of the State, respecting the proposed battery at Mathias Point, the substance of which has been already communicated by mail and telegraph. I am making every possible preparation for the prosecution of the work. There is very little probability of executing it without threatened or real molestation, for which, of course, I shall endeavor to be prepared.
I also transmit a report of Major Williamson, made of a reconnaissance directed by me on assuming the command at this station. I regard the Aquia Creek Landing and the preservation of the steamer George Page as of secondary importance, except in the moral influence necessarily involved in the endeavor to protect a point regarded important by a community unused to the chances and vicissitudes of war. It is difficult as a position to defend, being easily turned by the Potomac Creek, and exposed to disaster from an attack in the rear. It has served its purpose of drawing attention from the two important points on the Potomac suj>posed to control its navigation, and which, when occupied, will render a battery at this place of little importance.

[Inclosures.]
Fredericksburg, Ya., May 4,1861.
Sir: In obedience to your verbal orders, I have examined Mathias Point, on the Potomac, and the shores of the Bappahannock to its mouth, with the view of selecting proper points for batteries, to prevent the enemy passing up those rivers, when we think proper to do so. Mathias Point is a bluff headland, twenty feet above the water, and while I was there a war steamer passed the point and showed me the channel. I also made inquiries of persons who were recommended to me by the gentlemen in the neighborhood, and learned from them that the extreme distance from the shore to the farther side of the channel is not over three-quarters of a mile, and that a vessel would be in that range at that distance for one mile. I would recommend at Mathias Point a semicircular sunken battery, on the side next the river, for ten heavy guns, and an intrenchment, with a strong profile and plan, on the land side. Should the enemy attempt to land on the point between Gambo Creek and the Potomac, or go up Machodoc Creek to land, with a view of attacking the fort, a detachment would be required at that point to prevent their landing.
After examining Mathias Point, I proceeded across to the Bappahannock Biver and examined a point called Bristolmine Creek. The bluff in the intersection of this creek with the river is high (sixty-five or seventy-five feet), and commands the river completely, both up and down; and the guns of a battery at this point would cover the ground inland all around. The ridge between Bristolmine and Machodoc Creeks falls suddenly towards the valley of the Mattox Creek, and this sink extends about fifteen miles down the neck between the Potomac and the Bappahannock, and is completely overlooked from the ridge, so that no force could land below and march up the country without being observed from many points on the ridge. There are two roads passing up this ridge; one by Millville, at the head of Bosier’s Creek, and the other at the head of Bristolmine Creek. The intervening ridge is covered with a dense forest, and the roads through it could be easily obstructed, should the enemy attempt (which is not likely) to pass through it. Detachments at Miilville, and at the road at the head of Bristolmine Creek, would be in good positions to watch the country below, and to offer resistance to their march. This line of defense, in conjunction with forts at Mathias Point and the White House, which would prevent the enemy using the Potomac, would protect the railroad communication with Bichmond on the east side, and keep up the line to the South, through the Carolinas, as well as the nature of the ground and the very extensive line will admit, from Jamestown to the White House.
At your request I accompanied Commander Lewis down the Bappahannock Biver to its mouth. The points lowest down the river where batteries would be effective in preventing the passage of vessels are at Lowery’s and Accokeek Points, about seven miles below Tappahannock. The channel does not exceed three-quarters of a mile from these points,

and a small redoubt, with five or six heavy guns on each point, would close the passage to any vessels that are likely to attempt it. Respectfully submitted.

Fredericksburg, Ya., May 6,1861.
Since writing the above, at the request of Captain Lynch, and by your verbal directions, I have been to Mathias Point, and measured the distances of the opposite shores of the channel from the Point, and find the far side of the channel five thousand eight hundred feet, and the near side two thousand three hundred and thirty feet, which makes the width of the channel three thousand four hundred and seventy feet.
Respectfully submitted.

Lynch.
I am given to understand that the intention of erecting a battery at Mathias Point is not abandoned. Although, after sounding the channel off that point, I expressed, in my report, the opinion that a cross-fire from it upon a steamer, at a distance of a mile and a quarter, for the space of about five minutes, would be a waste of ammunition, yet I am ready to obey any order upon the subject ; and, in pursuance of the intimation I have received, respectfully ask what guns can be furnished for that position % It was originally designed to mount twelve 8-inch guns there and a like number at the White House. To the latter place I gave the preference.

This political question I desire to have decided, and ask your instructions on the subject.

I have just arrived with two hundred and twenty-six men. Two companies yet behind. There are satisfactory reasons for postponing this movement. I have countermanded the order, not being subject to Governor Letcher’s orders, and wait instructions from War Department. Shall I obey Governor Letcher and proceed when my regiment is complete?

Yery respectfully, &c.,
E. E. LEE,
Major- Genera Z, Commanding.
Division Headquarters, Harper’s Ferry, Van May 7,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces :
General: I forward herewith a statement of the strength of my command at this post, of the deficiency of arms, ammunition, and accouterments.*
The deficiencies I respectfully request may be supplied at the earliest practicable period, as I wish to put the post in as defensible a condition as possible. I have finished reconnoitering the Maryland Heights, and have determined to fortify them at once, and hold them, as well as the Virginia Heights and the town, be the cost what it may. For this purpose I would urge the necessity of giving me an ample supply of good arms, and such disciplined troops as you can spare (though it should swell the number here to nine thousand five hundred or ten thousand men). Two pieces of field artillery (12-pounders) should be placed on the Virginia Heights, and a larger number of 6-pounders on the Maryland Heights. Heavier ordnance, in addition to the field pieces referred to in yesterday’s letter, could be advantageously employed in defending the town. The heights west of Bolivar must be strengthened. I would be more than gratified could you spare the time for a short visit here, to give me^the benefit of your wisdom and experience in laying out the different works, especially those on the heights. I am of the opinion that this place should be defended with the spirit which actuated the defenders of Thermopylae, and, if left to myself, such is my determination. The fall of this place would, I fear, result in the loss of the northwestern part of the State, and who can estimate the moral power thus gained to the enemy and lost to ourselves ? The commissary department here is in a suffering condition, and will continue so, unless the estimates are complied with. All the cadets you can spare from Eichmond are needed here.
The enemy are in possession of the Eelay House, and permit no freight cars to come west. Personal baggage is searched. At Grafton the cars have been broken open by the Eepublicans, upon the suspicion that they contained arms. I dispatched a special messenger this evening to Baltimore, for the purpose of having the arms which Virginia furnished Maryland returned to us, and I trust that the scheme will be so carried out as to elude the vigilance of the enemy.
The pressure of office business here is so great as to induce me to retain Maj. T. L. Preston, of the Virginia Military Institute.
Mr. Burkhart, who is in charge of the rifle-factory, reports that he can finish fifteen hundred rifle-muskets in thirty days. I have, in obedience to the orders of Governor Letcher, directed the rifle-factory machinery to be removed immediately after that of the musket factory. My object

is to keep the former factory working as long as practicable without
interfering with its rapid removal.
An unarmed company, in Harrison County, has offered its services, and I design arming it at Grafton. With prudent management I hope to assemble a number of companies at that post from the northwest, and for this purpose I have been corresponding with reliable gentlemen in various parts of that section of the State. Major Boykin was here yesterday on his way to Grafton, where I hope he will not long remain without a command.
I would respectfully recommend that the money for which estimates have been made by the quartermaster and commissary be turned over to them at once, and, if practicable, that it be deposited in a Winchester or Charlestown bank. They have been forced to use their private credit, that of the State being insufficient.

Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond Va., May 8,1861. George Mason, Esq., Spring Bank, Alexandria, Va. :
Sir : I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 5, respecting the defenseless condition of your neighborhood. General Lee is not insensible to the dangers to which your own and other unguarded neighborhoods in the State are exposed, and no one laments more deeply than he does that the available resources of the State do not enable him to give such efficient protection as he desires to every portion of the Commonwealth. He has instructed the commanding officers that every neighborhood shall be protected, as far as possible, by the troops stationed in it; but the limited resources of the Stjte and her pressing exigencies render it necessary that the people in each locality should take such measures as are in their power to guard against marauding parties and do what they can for their own protection. The formation of home guards, arming and drilling them, and, by concerted signals, to collect the guards of adjacent neighborhoods in time of danger, to resist the sudden attack of small marauding bands of the enemy, are among the means of defense adopted by the inhabitants of the country bordering on Chesapeake Bay and the lower rivers, and are recommended for the consideration and adoption of yourself and your neighbors. He cannot but hope, if war is to be waged against us, that reason and the opinion of mankind will at least induce our enemies to conduct it in accordance with the rules that prevail among civilized nations.

General : I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of communications from Maj. T. H. Williamson, engineer, Virginia Army; Lieut. H. H. Lewis, Virginia Navy, and W. H. Kerr, brigade inspector Virginia volunteers, in relation to fortifying Aquia Creek.* The general commanding desires me to say that the object in view is the defense of the avenues of approach to the terminus of the railway, rather than the protection of the few vessels at Aquia Creek ; that the instructions given by him with reference to this matter were based upon the report of Captain Lynch, Virginia Navy. You will therefore, being on the spot and in possession of the facts requisite to a proper disposition of the works and the troops under your command, exercise your judgment, in connection with that of Captain Lynch, with reference to the defense of the avenue of approach to the terminus of the railroad and the general protection of that country.
The importance of erecting batteries at Mathias Point is apparent; but from the report of Captain Lynch, which represents the necessity of supporting such a movement by a larger force than you had at your disposal, it was considered advisable to employ the guns originally intended for that point in the defense of the approaches to Fredericksburg by rail or river.

Col. R. S. Garnett:
Sir: In accordance with orders received from the general-in-chief, to post at Manassas Junction sufficient force to defend that point against any attack likely to be made against it by troops from Washington, I immediately ordered the Powhatan troop of cavalry to march from this place this morning, to join Capt. J. S. Green’s company, now at Amissville, Rappahannock County, and to proceed together to Manassas Junction, where there are two (raw, undrilled, ununiformed, and armed with the altered musket) Irish companies, lately sent out from Alexandria, and which I had ordered to be held and drilled at Manassas Junction. We will endeavor to use these companies. I have also ordered one section (twTo pieces) of Captain Kemper’s artillery, (the only part of his battery at all available as foot artillery, and that rendered available by doubling upon the two pieces the horses and ammunition he had for the four pieces), which I shall also take along to the same point. The Powhatan troop of cavalry and the section of artillery are absolutely all of the force at all available at this time at this place. I have telegraphed back to Charlottesville for two companies of riflemen to be dispatched to this point, and learn from Lieutenant-Colonel Fry that I will get but one, and that not until this evening.
Looking to Lynchburg, I learn that the armed companies of that place are now in Richmond, under Colonel Garland. If so, I trust, sir, they will be immediately dispatched to the command at Manassas.
We have no ammunition of any kind, except the limited supply sent forward to Alexandria. I shall gather in as fast as possible the armed companies that have not been mustered into the service throughout my department (if any there be besides those referred to), and concentrate them here at Manassas and Alexandria, as occasion may require.
From three to five thousand muskets or rifles should be immediately forwarded to this point for the use of this command 5 thence to be drawn for arming companies, as mustered into service. Some place will be provided as a magazine at this point. The powder, balls, munitions, equipments, and all ammunition whatsoever required for at least five thousand men, should be immediately prepared and forwarded to this place.
The city of Alexandria, situated, as it is, in the re-entering curve of the river opposite to Washington, on the convex side of that curve, is a point difficult to hold, in case the enemy shall have any designs upon it in the present weak condition of our forces. The enemy, by proceeding below, to Fort Washington or Mount Vernon, may turn the position, take it in the rear, and cut off its communication, and so by advancing 52 r r—VOL 11

over the bridges from above the enemy may, by short lines, turn and get in the rear of that place. In order to prevent such a disaster there should be, obviously, outside of and behind Alexandria, a force sufficient to throw out outpost guards, radiating upon the possible lines of advance of the enemy, to protect that place in the rear, and thus to support and cover the little force now held in Alexandria, and prevent its capture or annihilation. With such an arrangement the force in Alexandria could return, without danger of being surprised, and find support in falling back upon the force in its rear. But I have absolutely nothing at present out of which to constitute such a supporting force in rear of Alexandria. As soon as I can collect the means, or you shall send them to me, I shall endeavor to make the best use of them to this end.
Very respectfully, your obedient,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE, Brigadier-General, Commanding Potomac Department.
Headquarters Potomac Department,
Culpeper Court-Souse, May 8, 1861.
Col. E. S. Garnett :
Your order of May 7, this moment received, stating that “The general in command is in want of information from you as to the strength and organization of your command, and begs that you will supply him with it at the earliest possible moment. The return due on the 1st instant by General Orders, Ko. 4, has not been received. The general desires particularly to know with what force you can take the field, provided any movement is made against you from Washington; how it would be composed, officered, and what service could be counted on from it.” I have to say in reply that, coming to this command with “naked hands” and in my plantation dress, arriving in Alexandria on the morning of the 22d of April, I have had everything to do towards organization, with extremely limited means of accomplishing anything. It has been entirely iuqmacticable, in consequence of the want of my proper staff, until very recently, to initiate the means of obtaining the regular, formal, and full company returns and other returns which would show the strength and organization of the weak, unorganized, and widely-scattered force under my command.
The assistant adjutant-general, since his appointment and entrance upon duty, has taken the most active steps to accomplish the objects desired by the commanding general. Those steps will be persevered in. Such partial returns as I have been able to obtain from time to time from captains, both in regard to number of men, arms, and ammunition, and general equipment, have been forwarded to the headquarters at Richmond, and will be found on file there.
The assistant adjutant-general, Jones, has this morning left me, by my order, under the pressing emergency of sending the only experienced officer of the army at my command to march with the Powhatan troop this moment en route for Manassas Junction, to assist in collecting, establishing, and organizing at that point the force that I may be able to command, to carry into effect the order of the general-in-chief, received yesterday, to occupy and hold that point against any probable attack of the enemy. I propose to follow myself to-morrow with such other forces as I can gather, going “by rail” to the same point, and

thus to effect a contemporaneous arrival at Manassas Junction. This necessary absence of the assistant adjutant-general from these headquarters, together with the yet unorganized state of the general staff and the inexperience of many of the captains of many of the companies, will yet cause some delay in making regular army returns.
I beg, however, that the general-in-chief will have collated from my dispatches and reports from the beginning the information therein imparted in this connection, and which may thus furnish him with an approximate estimate and exhibit at least of the available forces heretofore and now at my command.
In order to facilitate the accomplishment of this object, I will here briefly indicate from the best sources I possess the present character and disposition of what available force I have. (See statement inclosed.)

Sir : I have the honor to report, for the information of the commanding general, that I located a battery at the Aquia Creek Railroad Landing this morning, and placed it under the charge off Maj. T. H. Williamson, Engineers, for completion.
In the absence of Captain Lynch, of the Navy, for whom I have dispatched a messenger, I have directed Captain Thorburn to put the guns in position and make the necessary preparation for service. It is my expection that the battery will be in a measure completed within forty-eight hours. Measures will be taken to give the requisite protection.
I respectfully recommend that a battery of four 32-pounders be established on the Rappahannock River, at Bristol Mines or Tappahannock, with as little delay as is practicable.
I transmit a memorandum of a statement made yesterday by Messrs. John T. Washington and John H. Stuart, of King George County, Virginia. Measures were taken immediately by dispatching mounted men to intercept and recover the slaves supposed to have escaped, but thus far without satisfactory results.
Repeated applications have been made to me from counties bordering on the Rappahannock on both sides, along the Northern Neck, for instructions preliminary to enrollment as volunteers, from the fact, doubtlessly, that they were within my original jurisdiction. I am instructed by General Cocke to embrace my original limits until further orders.

That he was one of the patrol on last night, 6th instant, starting on duty about 10 p. m., with some six or seven others, and that upon his return home the following morning, about sunrise, he discovered that five of his negro men had packed up tbeir clothing and absconded, and, from some tracks he discovered, thinks they moved in the direction of Fredericksburg.
Upon making inquiries he found that Mr. John Hill Stuart had missed two of his negro men, Dr. A. B. Hooe two of his, Mr. Custis Grymes two of his, Mr. H. M. Tennent two of his, Mr. Quisenberry one of his, Mr. John H. Washington two of his, and Mrs. Virginia Washington two of hers.
The above-named persons were all whom he had an opportunity of hearing from, and as they all had missed some of their negroes, he infers that his neighbors generally have suffered.
Mr. Washington also stated that the patrol visited seven estates upon the night of the 6th instant, and that upon six of the estates they saw but one negro man each and upon the other but two negro men.

Gloucester Point, Va., May 8,1861. Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee, Commander 4n-Chief:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I assumed command at this post at 7 o’clock yesterday evening. I hastened to assume the command from the fact that I learned, on my way from Richmond, that the howitzer battery under Lieutenant Brown, acting under the orders of Captain Whittle, of the Virginia isavy, had resisted the approach of the steamer Yankee and driven her back, after the firing of some ten or twelve rounds on either side. I immediately ordered out the volunteer forces of the county, amounting to some two hundred and fifty men, to re-enforce the battery and prevent a landing of the enemy in boats. These troops had not been mustered into the service of the State, and no force beyond a small guard had been stationed at this place. Major Page, mustering officer, will muster in three companies to day. I have now subsistence for four hundred men for thirty days, and will erect huts for the troops this evening. I have to urge that you will order to this point some effective sea-coast guns, for the small battery of 6-pounder guns now here will prove of small consequence in resisting an attack upon this place by a naval force of much importance.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. B. TALIAFERRO,
Colonel, Commanding.

This letter came to me unsealed. I presumed that I might read it. I know not on what authority Colonel Taliaferro says that the firing at * Gloucester Point was authorized by me. This is an entire mistake.

In your preparation for the defense of your position it is considered advisable not to intrude upon the soil of Maryland, unless compelled by the necessities of war. The aid of its citizens might be obtained in that quarter. I regret I have no engineer of experience to send you. You will have to rely upon your judgment and the aid of the oflicers with you. I have directed that four 6-pounder guns be forwarded to you as soon as possible, and two 12-pounder howitzers, with a supply of ammunition and equipment for firing, will be sent to you at once. There are no caissons. Horses, wagons, and harness will be procured near you by an agent of the quartermaster’s department, sent for the purpose.
Captain Pendleton’s company of artillery from Lexington will join you as soon as possible, with such field pieces as it has. Flour and provisions for use of the troops must be secured. In other respects it is not designed to embarrass the legitimate commerce of our citizens.
I have directed that one thousand muskets, obtained from North Carolina, be sent to you, to aid in arming your command and to respond to requisitions that may be made upon you by Colonel Porterfield. Your requisitions upon the staff department at headquarters, as far as possible, will be filled.

Colonel : It is very important that the volunteer troops be organized and instructed as rapidly as possible. I know you are doing all in your power towards that object. It is desired that you attach to the battalions or regiments, as formed, as soon as possible, the field officers who have been or may be directed to report to you from the same region with the companies, place them at such point or points as you think best, with capable instructors, and press forward their instruction and equipment. The regiments under Colonels Garland and Preston were designed for Manassas Junction. You are requested to send them there, and as company and field officers are available which might properly be assigned to them, to forward them to the respective regiments. That the troops may be prepared for field service, it is desirable that they be removed from the towns and placed in camp, where their instruction may be uninterrupted and rigid discipline established. Officers and men will sooner become familiar with the necessities of service, and make their preparations accordingly. It is impossible at this time to furnish tents, but unoccupied buildings might possibly be obtained or temporary plank huts established. I beg you will adopt the best plan in your power to prepare the men for hard, effective service.

roy, of the Xavy, who is ordered to report to you, and I hope will be useful in defending your post.
Your intention to fortify the heights of Maryland may interrupt our friendly arrangements with that State, and we have no right to intrude on her soil, unless, under pressing necessity, for defense. I had hoped that her own citizens would have relieved us of that question, and you must endeavor to give to the course you may find it necessary to pursue the appearance of its being the act of her citizens. At all events, do not move until actually necessary and under stern necessity.
I have directed the companies ordered to rendezvous at Staunton to be sent to you as soon as mustered into the service, and I hope you will receive a large accession of troops under the authority extended to you. Several officers of experience have been sent to you, and I shall endeavor to send some cadets. I know, from the spirit with which you are animated, that you will leave nothing undone to insure the defense of your post and the security of your command. You will not neglect, therefore, the instruction of the troops, who ought to be constantly practicing their military exercises and prepared in every way for hard service. Every rifle that you can finish will be of advantage, but it will be necessary to send off that machinery as soon as the musket factory is removed. I have directed the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments to send funds, if practicable, to the assistant quartermaster and commissary at your post.

Colonel: Your letter of May 9th has just been received. The guns you refer to, intended for Maryland, have, I understand, been stopped by the governor. I wrote you to-day that two 32-pounders had been ordered to you. I fear you may have been premature in occupying the heights of Maryland with so strong a force near you. The true policy is to act on the defensive, and not invite an attack. If not too late, you might withdraw until the proper time. I have already suggested to you the probability of the use of the canal as a means of carrying ordnance and munitions from Washington to use against you. In that event it would be well to cut the supply dams to prevent its use. Ten cadets have been ordered to report to you, in addition to the ten now there.

Colonel : In forwarding Special Orders, Eo. 39,1 take occasion to say that, while pursuing a strictly defensive policy, it is necessary that you should be vigilant, have your troops at or near points where they may be needed, and urge forward their instruction and preparation with all the means in your power. For this purpose it will be necessary to remove them from the towns, if possible, and establish them in camps, where their constant instruction and discipline can be attended to. They will the sooner become familiar with the necessities of service, and be better prepared for its hardships. It will be impossible to furnish tents at this time, but it is hoped that unoccupied buildings or temporary plank huts might be obtained where needed. At Manassas Junction, where it will be necessary to establish a portion of your command to secure the road to Harper’s Ferry, some preparation of this sort will be needed. Colonel Garland’s and Colonel Preston’s battalions (the first consisting of four and the second of seven companies) have been ordered to that point, to report to you. These battalions will be increased to regiments as companies from their districts arrive, which will be forwarded to you by Colonel Cocke. You will give them the necessary orders and add such re-enforcements as you think proper. The troops near Alexandria will be kept in readiness to move whenever necessary, will afford such protection to the town and neighborhood as their number will permit, and you will endeavor to take measures to allay unnecessary excitement, and not to provoke aggression.
