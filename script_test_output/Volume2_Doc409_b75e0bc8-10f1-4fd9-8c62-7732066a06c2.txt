No. 31.
Report of Col. David Hunter, Third U. S. Cavalry, commanding Second
Division.
Washington, August 5,1861.
Sir : Having had the honor to command the Second Division of the Army before Manassas, on the 21st of July, 1861, and having been wounded .early in the action, the command, as well as the duty of making the division report, devolved on Col. Andrew Porter, of the U. S. Army. I deem it, however, a duty I owe to the gallant gentlemen of my staff briefly to mention their services:
The Hon. Isaac N. Arnold, of the U. S. House of Representatives, one of my volunteer aides, was with me on the field till I received my wound, and then devoted himself to having the wounded removed and to alleviating their sufferings.
Capt. D. P. Woodbury, chief engineer of the division, fearlessly exposed himself in front of the skirmishers during our whole advance, and determined with great judgment the route of the division.
Capt. William D. Whipple, A. A. G.; Captain Cook, of the Fourth Pennsylvania Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Cross, of Engineers, and Lieut. D. W. Flagler, Ordnance, aide-de-camp, all performed their duties to my entire satisfaction. They were absent conveying orders during the short time I was in the field.
My aide, Lieut. Samuel W. Stockton, of the First Cavalry, was with

mo on tlie field, and his conduct under a heavy fire was perfectly beautiful.
Dr. Rouch, of Chicago, 111., a citizen surgeon, accompanied Mr. Arnold to the field, and devoted himself to the care of the wounded during the whole battle.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
D. HUNTER,
