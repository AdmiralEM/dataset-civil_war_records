Washington, April 28, 1861. Major-General Patterson,	cfic., &o.:
Sir : I hope in a few days to have the railroad communication between Washington and Annapolis well re-established and guarded, and in about the same time troops enough here to give reasonable security to the capital—that is, to the Government, the public buildings, and archives—with a surplus of troops for offensive operations. The next step will be by force to occupy Baltimore and reopen regular communications between Washington and Philadelphia by rail and wires. The plan that has occurred to me is, 1st, to advance a column from this place via the Belay House to the Washington depot 5 2d, another column by the road from York ; 3d, the same from Havre de Grace, if destruction of bridges be not an insuperable obstacle 5 and, 4th, to move the principal force by water from Annapolis, and to make the four attacks simultaneously.
I wish you to consider and methodize the second and third attacks, and give me your views in advance on the whole subject.
Nothing shall prevent the occupation of Baltimore by a competent force but the voluntary reopening of free communications by rail and wires through Baltimore and Maryland before our preparations are ready.
