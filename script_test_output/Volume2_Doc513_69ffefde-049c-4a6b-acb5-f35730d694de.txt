II. Col. John B. Magruder, of the Provisional Army of Virginia, is placed in command of the troops and military operations on the line to Hampton. He will establish his headquarters at Yorktown, take measures for the safety of the batteries at Jamestown Island and on York River, and urge forward the construction of the defenses between the heads of College and Queen Creeks, in advance of Williamsburg. The orders heretofore given to Lieut. Col. B. S. Ewell, Virginia volunteers, are referred to him for execution. Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell, with the troops under his command, will be stationed at the defenses in front of Williamsburg, and Major Cary on or near the Southwest Branch of the Back River, where it is crossed by the main road from Hampton. Authentic information of what occurs at Fort Monroe, and the operations of the U. S. forces, if important, will be forwarded to headquarters. Col. L. G. He Russy, with his regiment of Louisiana volunteers; Col. H. H. Hill, with his regiment of North Carolina volunteers, and Col. T. P. August, with his regiment of Virginia volunteers, will report to Colonel Magruder for service under his command.

Brig. Gen. M. L. Bonham, C. S. A.:
General : In the execution of the orders with which you have been furnished, relative to the command of the Alexandria line of operations, I need not call the attention of one as experienced as yourself to the necessity of preventing the troops from all interference with the rights and property of the citizens of the State, and of enforcing rigid discipline and obedience to orders. But it is proper forme to state to you that the policy of the State at present is strictly defensive. No attack, or provocation for attack will therefore be given, but every attack resisted to the extent of your means. Great reliance is placed on your discretion and judgment in the application of your force, and I must urge upon you the importance of organizing and instructing the troops as rapidly as possible and preparing them for active service. For this purpose it will be necessary to post them where their services may be needed and where they can be concentrated at the points threatened. The Manassas Junction is a very important point on your line, as it commands the communication with Harper’s Ferry, and must be firmly held. Intrenchments at that point would add to its security, and, in connection with its defense, you must watch the approaches from either flank, particularly towards Occoquan. Alexandria in its front will, of course, claim your attention as the first point of attack, and, as soon as your force is sufficient, in your opinion, to resist successfully its occupation, you will so dispose it as to efiect this object, if possible, without appearing to threaten Washington City. The navigation of the Potomac being closed to us, and the U. S. armed vessels being able to take a position in front of the town, you will perceive the hazard of its destruction, unless your measures are such as to prevent it. This sub-55 R R—YOL II

ject, being one of great delicacy, is left to your judgment. The railroad communications must be secured, however, and their use by the enemy prevented. In the absence of tents or vacant houses, you will have to erect temporary plank sheds for the protection of your men.

General Gwynn :
Call on the governor of North Carolina for the force you require to the full extent. Two hundred laborers are on the way to you.

Col. George H. Terrett, Commanding, &cr Alexandria, Ya.: Colonel : Unless you can devise some better plan for securing the rolling stock of the Loudoun and Hampshire Eailroad than that, suggested to you in my letter of the 19th instant, I desire you to adopt it, and give directions that a track be laid from the depot of the Loudoun and Hampshire Eailroad to the Orange and Alexandria Eailroad, in Union street, or some other more convenient point, by which this rolling stock can be carried to a place of safety on the Orange and Alexandria Eailroad when not wanted for use on its proper road, and confer with presidents and directors of said roads as to perfecting this connection, which will not only be useful for the above purpose, but afford convenient transportation from one road to the other.
Very respectfully, &c.,
E. E. LEE,
Major-General, Commanding.
Gloucester Point, Va., May 22,1861. General E. E. Lee, Headquarters Yirginia Forces, Richmond, Ya.: General : On my arrival here I presented your letter to Colonel Taliaferro, and soon had a conference upon the object of my visit. This place is literally without defense against a land attack. A force of five hundred men, landed within a day’s march, with even a feint by water, could take, by prompt movements, every gun. Mr. Clarke, the engineer here, is appointed by Colonel Talcott, and does not consider himself under the command of Colonel Taliaferro. This want of concert prevents unity of action and concert of measures. I could not therefore, without authority from you, urge the citizens to send laborers here to be directed by Mr. Clarke. His time and attention are much required by the works now in progress. I leave at once for Matthews County, in company with Major Page, where one or two companies are reported as organized.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
THOS. L. PEESTON.

Headquarters, Fredericksburg, Fa., May 22,1861. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir : I have the honor to state, for the information of the commanding general, that I have not been able to push the organization of volunteer companies forward with sufficient rapidity to make up a force of sufficient strength (under discipline) for our sole reliance, in the event of an attack on our Potomac coast, within a brief period of time.
I am under the necessity of manning the batteries by companies of volunteers, in consequence of the ineffectual efforts of the naval officers to enroll men for that service; and, indeed, I have been obliged to perform work on those batteries by detail for the want of laborers. It is to be observed that Captain Walker’s battery has not, therefore, thus far (in spite of the united efforts of the captain and myself), been put in readiness for the field, being deficient in men and equipments, and this is the only field battery in the department.
The above-noted employments, in connection with the necessity of covering the batteries and the avenues of approach to this city, have absorbed my volunteer force to such an extent that, if attacked by the enemy in great numbers, re-enforcements will be necessary 5 say at least one thousand well-disciplined volunteers and a field battery.
If occasion demands, I propose telegraphing to you for such force (well supplied with ammunition) the moment it is apparent that it will be needed, to repel actual invasion, with the confident hope that it will be sent.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
DANIEL EUGGLES,
Colonel, Provisional Army, Commanding Forces.
