No. 26.
j	Washington, May 27,1861.
All that part of Virginia east of the Alleghany Mountains and north of James Biver, except Fort Monroe and sixty miles around the same, will for the present constitute a new military geographical department, under the command of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell, IJ. S. A., whose headquarters will be movable according to circumstances.

Colonel : I arrived here too late in the afternoon of the 27th to assume on that day formally, in orders, the command of the department, but I reported to Major-General Sandford at this place, and received from him such information as to the state of affairs as he was able then to give me. I encamped the night of the 27th with the New Jersey brigade, and early on the morning of the 28th went to Alexandria, and was occupied from 5 a. m. till 9 o’clock at night in examining the position occupied by the troops and looking into the condition of the men.
Defensive works under construction.—The works at Alexandria had not been commenced nor even laid out as late as 10 o’clock a. m. yesterday, nor had the plans been definitely determined upon. A want of tools in the first place, and in the second place of means of transportation for the men from the wharf in Alexandria to the hill to be fortified, and changes made necessary by a better knowledge of the ground, were the principal causes given for the delay. Both the Michigan regiment and the New York Zouaves were bivouacked and encamped on the site, leaving but a few men in town. I trust, therefore, that the Navy Department may be requested to [retain] the Pawnee at her present station. The works at the bridge-head of the Long Bridge were progressing finely, and the report to me was that the men were working diligently. The main work covering the Aqueduct and ferry opposite Georgetown was in a fair state. The Sixty-ninth New York is the only regiment at work on it, and they seemed to me to be working admirably.
Subsistence and means of transportation.—Subsistence is furnished to the troops away from the vicinity of Alexandria by returns on the main depot in Washington. This, and the utter absence of any wagons on

this side, the want of means of communication on the part of some of the regiments, and the inexperience of most of the commanders, have caused the supplies to be irregularly and insufficiently furnished. One regiment has hired on its own account, out of private means, some wagons to procure its supplies. Forage has also been wanting. A depot is to be established at Alexandria, which will afford supplies to the troops in that vicinity. The depot in Washington might answer for all the others, provided the regiments be furnished with wagons to go for them. I suppose the Quartermasters Department in Washington has not at this time enough wagons to supply the force here with its allowance for its baggage merely, which would require about 200.
For the purpose of giving greater efficiency and a better administration of affairs, I have organized the troops not now brigaded into three brigades, and placed them under the colonels ordered to report to me in their letters of appointment. If a portion of the allowance of wagons for the regimental baggage were sent on and placed under the control of the brigade commanders, I think a better state of affairs will be gained at the least cost. With a view to movements in that direction, I have directed Colonel Stone to ascertain and report the amount of rolling stock on the Alexandria and Manassas Gap Railroad, and the amount of material required to place the road in working order.
I beg to request that some of the recent graduates heretofore assigned to the duty of instructing the volunteer regiments may be sent here for the same purpose and other duty. The only assistant quartermaster in the department is at Alexandria, to be in charge of the Quartermaster’s and Commissary Departments. I have to request that another officer of that department, furnished with funds, be sent for duty at headquarters. The troops are occupying houses in some cases, and fields, and cutting wood for fuel. Shall not rent and compensation be paid ? If so, funds are needed for that purpose, as well as the hiring of means of transportation where the same has not been furnished.
I have the honor to be, colonel, very respecfully, your most obedient

Colonel: There have been rumors of outrages committed by volunteers in Alexandria. Colonel Butterfield, of the Twelfth New York, has reported several cases of trespass, depredations, and attempts at burglary in his vicinity.
I am aware we are not, theoretically speaking, at war with the State of Virginia, and we are not, here, in an enemy’s country $ but if the ordinary courts and officers of the State, against whose peace and dignity it is these acts have been committed, are not in the exercise of their functions, shall not these cases be punished, as similar ones were in Mexico, by military commission.? It is a question of policy which, being so near at hand, I beg to submit to the General-in-Chief.
In connection with this subject I will mention that the battalion of Georgetown Volunteers at the head of the Chain Bridge are reported as acting harshly towards the inhabitants on this side, whom they charge

The plea that a man is a secessionist is set up in some cases by persons depredating on property as a justification of their acts.

Mrs. R. E. Lee :
Madam : Having been ordered by the Government to relieve Major-General Sandford in command of this department, I had the honor to receive this morning your letter of to-day, addressed to him at this place.
With respect to the occupation of Arlington by the United States troops, I beg to say it has been done by my predecessor with every regard to the preservation of the place. I am here temporarily in camp on the grounds, preferring this to sleeping in the house, under the circumstances which the painful state of the country places me with respect to its proprietors.
I assure you it has been and will be my earnest endeavor to have all things so ordered that on your return you will find things as little disturbed as possible. In this I have the hearty concurrence of the courteous, kind hearted gentleman in the immediate command of the troops quartered here, and who lives in the lower part of the house to insure its being respected.
Everything has been done as you desired with respect to your servants, and your wishes, as far as they are known or could be anticipated, have been complied with. When you desire to return, every facility will be given you for so doing.
I trust, madam, you will not consider it an intrusion if I say I have the most sincere sympathy for your distress, and that, as far as is compatible with my duty, I shall always be ready to do whatever may alleviate it.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, vour most obedient servant,

P. S.—I am informed it was the order of the General-in-Chief, if the troops on coming here found the family in the house, that no one should enter it, but that a guard should be placed for its protection.

Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
•	Cincinnati, June 1, 1861.
Lieut Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel: I had intimated in preceding dispatches an intention of moving on the valley of the Great Kanawha, and had in fact matured my plans for carrying that intention into effect in such a manner as to render all resistance hopeless, with the design of effecting the occupation, as I did that of the Grafton line, without firing a shot.
My view of our course m Kentucky and Western Virginia is that we should not cross the frontier without being fully assured that our assistance is demanded by the Union men, and that our movements should be in such force as to preclude the probability of resistance.
I had a long interview this morning with Judge L. Kuffner and Col. B. F. Smith, both of the Kanawha Valley. They came accredited by Hon. V. B. Horton, of Pomeroy, and other reliable men, and are represented as expressing the sentiment of the Union men of that region. My conference with them was full and frank. I told them that I did not believe it to be the will of the General Government to force assistance on the Union men where there was good ground to believe that they were able and willing to take care of themselves; that should I learn that any force from Eastern Virginia had entered their valley I could promptly drive them out; that they might count upon our aid whenever demanded, and that it is necessary for them to make up their minds to take a decided stand.
They stated that the Union feeling (shown to be decidedly preponderant by the late elections) is rapidly increasing; assert their ability to keep the secessionists under; say that they will not allow themselves to be forced into the Southern Confederacy, and deprecate sending any troops there at present. I have therefore thought it prudent to submit the matter to General Scott, the more especially as I think no ill effects can follow from some delay, for I have information which satisfies me that there are no Eastern Virginians nor Confederate troops in that region, and that they cannot move them there at present. These Kanawha gentlemen approve of the Grafton movement, and I have determined, until I receive further instructions from the General, to modify my original plan so as to accomplish the same result in a manner that will not be obnoxious.
Learning that the rebels who abandoned Grafton were this morning at Philippi I have ordered an advance on that point in two columns from Grafton and Clarksburg, with instructions to drive them beyond Beverly, and hold the latter place. I propose also gradually to advance on Elizabeth and Weston, in order to encourage the Union sentiment and to induce the Kanawha people to take a more decided course. I think they are not yet fully up to the mark, and need careful nursing. By driving the rebels beyond Beverly I think we shall free almost the whole of Western Virginia from their influence.
I have already informed you that I have placed the operations in Western Virginia under Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris, of the Indiana volunteers, a graduate of West Point, and a cool, deliberate man.
I would be glad to have some cavalry at my disposal as soon as possible. There are two companies organizing in Indiana, as many in this State, and some in Illinois, under the State laws. I presume they will be received into the regiment to be raised in this department. We should have at least a couple of companies in Western Virginia. I am watching Beauregard’s movements closely, and am glad that he is to be my antagonist.

I received a detailed report of the condition of the Illinois troops today. With the exception of those at Cairo and Caseyville it was unsatisfactory. It would be well if efficient general officers could be promptly assigned to the troops of this department, as well as a greater number of adjutants general, quartermasters, and commissaries. The absence of all military information in this region is very lamentable. It is a very rare thing to find any one who knows even the elements of squad drill.
The Michigan Battery will be here to-morrow. I have ordered it to Camp Dennison for the present, and will probably retain it there until it is ready for the field.

Sir : I have the honor to state, for the information of the General-in-Chief, in reply to his telegram of this date, calling for a report of my intended operations, that, though looking to Cumberland, my plans have been mainly directed to turning Harper’s Ferry, throwing across the river near Williamsport ample force (with support following and threatening Shepherdstown) to push on and occupy Martinsburg, if I do not find the enemy too strong and moving to cut my line of march. His attitude and strength will then determine the course to be pursued, either to move direct upon him through Shepherdstown or to cut off his retreat along the Winchester Bailroad and to harass his rear. I wish to place such a force on the Virginia shore as can hold every inch of ground gained, and, however slowly, to advance securely, after Harper’s Ferry falls, upon Winchester.

A movement, as soon as the force is prepared, will be made to Hagerstown, for the purpose of establishing beyond an encampment as the base of future operations. You are relied upon to organize and hold ready for instant movement those regiments which are prepared to move and face an enemy, and now gathering at Chambersburg, in the following manner:
1.	A column of cavalry and three regiments of well-drilled infantry,, to march from Chambersburg to Hagerstown. This column to be under the command of Col. George H. Thomas, Second Cavalry, TJ. S. Army.
2.	A second column, to be commanded by Brigadier-General Williams, to follow next day on foot, or by rail, if circumstances demand.
3.	A third brigade, to go by rail, and to land in Hagerstown just after arrival of Colonel Thomas’ brigade. If the second brigade goes by rail, the third, wholly or in part, will be pushed to Hagerstown as rapidly as transportation will permit.
4.	A fourth brigade, composed of the other regiments, will be pushed by regiment to Hagerstown as soon as prepared and transportation (rail) can be procured.
Colonel Thomas, with his cavalry from Carlisle, will arrive at Chambersburg on Friday. Direct the regimental commanders to report at once.
Wagon transportation is being prepared at Harrisburg and will be pushed to Chambersburg, and the train organized by A. R. Eddy, assistant quartermaster. Captain Eddy will have charge of the quartermaster’s department at Chambersburg, and transfer the depot to Hagerstown as the forces are located.
Capt. B. Du Barry, Subsistence Department, at Harrisburg, will provide for your present depot, and you are desired to see that each regiment has when it moves at least three days’ provisions.

The commanding general, with his staff, will join you in a few days, till which no movement to the front will be made unless circumstances should imperatively demand, which you will telegraph. He hopes on his arrival to find, through your energy and judgment, aided by the active efforts of every officer of your command, the different commands organized and prepared to move at a moment’s notice on arrival of accouterments, and, if necessary, before their arrival.

Colonel : I have the honor to report my arrival at this place. Pre vious to leaving Philadelphia, I arranged for the satisfactory working of the staff departments there and on this line, and in passing Harrisburg removed many inconveniences under which we have labored for the transportation of troops and supplies. Though this road is of very limited capacity, I expect to execute my designs as herein expressed. I am forced to adopt this mode of putting the column in motion, as not more than six regiments of infantry per day can be transported over the railroad. Wagons will be arriving and no inconvenience will be experienced, as regiments will be receiving accouterments while the troops are advancing to Hagerstown.
My impressions as to the point of attack indicated in my plan of operations have been confirmed by Captain Newton, who has been industriously engaged gathering information, and I shall arrange to advance on Thursday morning. I request to be informed by telegraph if the General-in-Chief has no objection.
Unless something should change my present design, I will direct Colonel Thomas to pass through Hagerstown early on Saturday morning, and advance the whole or part, as circumstances indicate best, of his command to Williamsport, seize the ford, and throw pickets beyond.
As he passes through Hagerstown a company of cavalry will be detached from his advance guard to the road leading through Boonsborough to Harper’s Ferry. The brigade under General Williams (three regiments) will be directed to follow Colonel Thomas, and will be close upon him. Other regiments will be thrown forward as rapidly as the capacity of the road will permit (six or seven per day, probably), and sent on the roads towards Boonsborough and Williamsport—the former to guard against forays from Harper’s Ferry, the latter to sustain the main column. Some of these regiments will reach Hagerstown as soon as Colonel Thomas. Of course I rely upon artillery arriving in time to permit the column to continue on towards Martinsburg.

Colonel : The last paragraph in the general’s letter [next preceding] refers to this, that at night the sound of the hammer is heard breaking stone on the Maryland Heights, the ax felling trees. Evidently a blockhouse is going up. No one can get near enough to see, and no one is permitted to come here all the way from there. Their informers only go part way. No guns have been placed on this side, unless they are light field pieces, and taken up in wagons. The Virginia side of the Shenandoah is armed, and the guns are iron and long—probably 32 or 24 pounders. Squadrons of cavalry roam the Virginia shore, oppressing people and pressing them into service. Our volunteers are as green as green can be. Marching is their forte, if they have a drum or a band. They cannot form a square yet of those I have seen, yet they think themselves perfect. As the General has just said he would send one or two batteries here, the general will do nothing about getting the field artillery from Harrisburg, though ammunition will be called here, which will be available for the two field batteries if they come. If they do not come, we can get those guns and plant them. We are working like bees.

You are not the aggressors. A turbulent faction, misled by ambitious rulers in a time of profound peace and national prosperity, have occupied your forts and turned the guns against you; have seized your arsenals and armories, and appropriated to themselves Government supplies; have arrested and held prisoners your companions marching to their homes under State pledge of security; have captured vessels and provisions voluntarily assured by State legislation from molestation, and now seek to perpetuate a reign of terror over loyal citizens.
They have invaded a loyal State and1 intrenched themselves within its boundaries in defiance of its constituted authorities.
You are going on American soil, to sustain the civil power, to relieve the oppressed, and to retake that which is unlawfully held.
You must bear in mind you are going for the good of the whole country, and that while it is your duty to punish sedition, you must protect the loyal, and, should occasion offer, at once suppress servile insurrection.

and drill is mucli improved. I have had great pain in being obliged to issue the accompanying general order. The volunteer troops seem to have adopted the theory that all property of the inhabitants was subject to plunder. I have taken the most energetic measures to correct this idea and prevent plundering. There are some few flagrant instances which can admit neither of palliation nor justification.. I have proposed to deal with these by court-martial, which I have ordered in session to morrow. As the outrages to be investigated are very grave, and as the punishment ought to be, and may be, very severe, I will take leave, unless otherwise instructed, to report the proceedings to yourself before any severe punishment is inflicted.
I have had no new accession of troops since my last report, save that a body of men known as the Naval Brigade, amounting to eight hundred and eighty, were reported here as ready to enlist in the service of the United States; but, under the instructions of the War Department, I have not received them into the service, and have sent so many of them home by the steamer in which they were brought as did not voluntarily engage to labor in the engineer, ordnance, and quartermaster’s departments about the fortress. These men ha ve very much embarrassed me. While I impute no fault, save that perhaps of want of discretion {which I easily pardon), to their colonel, Washington A. Bartlett, esq., I have been exceedingly annoyed with this whole subject; but I hope it is now finally adjusted.
I have here altogether about six thousand effective men, and no more. I am as yet without transportation trains or surf-boats, which I must have in order to make a movement, the project of which I will submit to yourself in my next dispatch. I am preparing myself, however, to be able to land, by causing one regiment at least to be drilled in embarking in and landing from boats. I have also sent up to the mouth of the Susquehanna to charter or purchase ten of a kind of fishing boats, which, I am informed by a gentleman connected with the squadron will be the best possible, except regularly-constructed surf-boats, for the purpose of landing troops. I hope to receive them within the next three days.
I have the honor to report the camp at Newport News and the battery there, to command the mouth of the James Biver, in a state of defense and forwardness, which I think will enable us to hold it against any force which may be brought against it.
We have made an armed reconnaissance some nine miles towards Yorktown, and find no armed men in that direction nearer than the Half-Way House, some twelve miles hence, and that but a picket guard of the enemy, who is in considerable force at Yorktown.
May I most respectfully ask if there is any reason known to the Lieutenant-General why the troops that were expected, and which I understood were promised to arrive here, have not been forwarded ?
I beg leave further to call the attention of the Lieutenant-General to the fact that from some oversight, probably in the Adjutant-General’s Office, the orders creating the Department of Virginia, North and South Carolina, which I understood were issued when I was in Washington, have not been published; at least I have not seen them. May I ask the attention of Lieutenant-General Scott to this omission, which might prove embarrassing?
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BXJTLBB, Major-General, Commanding.
