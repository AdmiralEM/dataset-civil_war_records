No. 30.
J	Richmond, Fix., July 4, 1861.
I.—The court of inquiry, which convened at Beverly on the 20th ultimo, at the request of Col. G. A. Porterfield, of the Virginia Volunteers, to examine into the circumstances of the retreat of the Virginia forces from Philippi on the 3d of June, under his command, has reported the following facts in the case:
A force of Virginia troops, consisting of some six hundred effective infantry (or thereabouts), and one hundred and seventy-five cavalry (or thereabouts), sufficiently well armed, but badly and insufficiently supplied with the necessary accouterments and ammunition, was stationed at Philippi, Barbour County, Virginia, on the morning of June 3, 1861 (where they had been for six or seven days), under the command of Col. George A. Porterfield, of the Virginia Volunteers.
On the morning of the day just indicated, at between daybreak and sunrise, this command was attacked and taken by surprise 5 no alarm or intimation of the enemy’s approach having been given by the guard or infantry pickets, until the enemy was within some four hundred yards of the place, and had commenced the fire from his artillery. By the examination it is shown that a main and picket guard, as strong as was consistent with the effective infantry force present, was regularly detailed and posted at distances sufficiently far out to accomplish the object in view, provided they knew and did their duty, which latter is strongly to be suspected| from the fact that, although in advance, they failed to give any intimation of the enemy’s approach, a conclusion which is strengthened by the official report of the mounted officers, out with the scouting parties on the night of June 2, that they had neither seen an infantry picket nor been challenged by its sentinels, going from or returning to the town that night. It appears that, immediately upon the arrival of the command at Philippi, the officer in command, Colonel Porterfield, took measures to place his force, which was raw and new in service, under a course of instruction, and to select those, in his opinion, best fitted to instruct the sentinels and guards in their duties. The testimony shows that, while there was a certain degree of confusion in some quarters, a portion of the command moved from the town in good order, and that the whole force, nearly, after passing some distance from the town, was reformed, and proceeded in order.

ACTION AT PHILIPPI, W. VA.
It is shown in the evidence that an expectation of attack or movement upon Philippi, shortly to be made, was entertained generally among the officers and others of the command, and that intelligence (how well founded is not known) was brought from time to time of the strength and supposed intent of the enemy.
The testimony sets forth that this had so far produced its effect as to induce the officer in command to call a meeting of his officers; that the result of their consultations and deliberations was an almost, if not unanimous decision in favor of immediate retreat; that when Colonel Porterfield returned to the room (from which he had been absent a short time) their opinion was conveyed to him, to which he seemed loth to accede; yet, determined to make a further examination of the ammunition on hand, and to prepare the baggage and train for removal at a moment’s notice.
No orders to march at any particular time were given, so far as can be gathered from the testimony, although it appears that an understanding or impression was had or entertained by some that the movement would not take place until morning, while some believed it contingent upon the weather.
The record will disclose the fact of a difference of construction (as to the hour of return) of the orders given to the officer in command of the cavalry company, from which the scouting party or parties was taken for duty on the night of 2d instant.
The testimony of several witnesses bears evidence of the cool, deliberate, and self-possessed conduct of Colonel Porterfield on the morning of June 3.
The court having been directed to express its opinion, as well as report the facts, presents the following:
1st. That the commanding officer, having received information, deemed by him sufficient to prepare for an early retreat, erred in permitting himself to be influenced by the weather, so far as to delay the execution of his plan.
2d. That the commanding officer did order dispositions to be made to prevent surprise ; but a misunderstanding as to the time at which the scouts were to be called in, and a total want of proper vigilance on the part of the infantry pickets, caused a surprise, which distinct and definite instructions, properly executed, would have avoided.
3d. That the commanding officer erred in not advancing and strengthening his picket beyond the usual limits under the circumstances.
4th. That the commanding officer exhibited upon the occasion decided coolness, self-possession, and personal courage, and exerted himself, as far as possible, to effect a retreat in good order.
II.—The commanding general having attentively considered the proceedings of the court of inquiry in the foregoing case, concurs in the opinion expressed by the court and in the statement of facts deduced from the testimony. These facts show that the position at Philippi was seriously threatened by a superior force of the enemy, distant only four hours’ march; that Colonel Porterfield was aware of the danger of his position, and prudently prepared to evacuate it. His desire to prevent the occupation of the town by the enemy was worthy of all praise, and had he promptly sent back his baggage and ineffective men, arranged his plan of defense, and taken proper measures to secure information of the advance of the enemy, he might safely have retained his position, and either given battle or retired, as circumstances might dictate. It does not appear from the record of the court that any plan of defense was formed; but it does appear that the troops retired with-

out his orders, and that the instructions to his advance guard were either misconceived or not executed. To these circumstances must be attributed the disaster that followed, and they call for heavy censure upon all concerned. The commanding general remarks with pleasure upon the coolness, self-possession, courage, and energy displayed by Colonel Porterfield at the moment of attack 5 but he cannot exonerate him from blame in not taking proper precautionary measures beforehand. Yet, in consideration of all the circumstances of the case, he does not think it necessary to do more than to express the opinion of the court, in the hope that the sad effects produced by the want of forethought and vigilance, as exhibited in this case, will be a lesson to be remembered by the army throughout the war.
III.—The court of inquiry, of which Col. William B. Taliaferro, Virginia Volunteers, is president, is dissolved.
