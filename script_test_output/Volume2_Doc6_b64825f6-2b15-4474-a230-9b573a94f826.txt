OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA.
[Chap. IX.
office, I have the honor to report that the U. S. Armory at Harper’s Ferry was established in the year 1796.
The amount expended on the same is—
For land purchased at different times............................... $45,477
For impro vements thereon for water-power, canals, embankments, walls, and water privileges, and for hydraulic machinery and buildings of all kinds............................................................... 1,787,430
Total, exclusive of the amount expended in the manufacture and repair of arms............................................ 1,832,907
The latest annual inventory of the property belonging to the United States at that armory is dated June 30,1860, in which the value of all the property on hand at that date is appraised as follows, viz:
1,669£ acres of land ...................................................... $37,457
Mill-dams, canals, water-powers, and hydraulic machinery................... 233,279
Forges, rolling-mills, machine-shops, storehouses, dwellings, and other buildings.............i.................................................... 341,221
Amount of real estate........................................... 611,957
Machines used in workshops...................................$270,235
Tools used in service.............................-.......... 109,560
---------- 379,795
Unwrought materials on hand.................................. 100,043
Parts of arms in progress.................................... 93,573
-------193,616
20,507 arms of different models in store.............................. 285,145
Total appraised value June 30, 1880
1,470,513
By the latest returns received at this office from the armory, it appears that the number of arms in store when the armory was destroyed in April, 1861, was reduced to 4,287, the value of which was about $64,000.
We may assume that the quantity and value of all other property than the arms in store remained without material change from June, 1860, to April, 1861. The diminished number of arms in store at the latter date reduces that item in the inventory from $285,145 to $164,300, and the total appraised value of all the property from $1,470,513 to $1,207,668.
Respectfully, &e.,
WM. MAYNADIER, Lieutenant-Colonel, Ordnance. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War.
U. S. Capitol, November 14,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
