By command of the Secretary of War:
JNO. WITHERS, Assistant Adjutant-General,
Camp Mason, Leesburg, June 9, 1861. Lieut. Col. Thos. Jordan, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : Inclosed please find a memorial from a committee on behalf of the citizens of this county, asking for additional forces for the defense of this point. If it is the design of the military authorities to defend this portion of Virginia, then it is very important that additional forces should be concentrated here. I feel very sensibly the importance of this fertile country to the subsistence department of our army and that of the enemy. Besides, if a good force be placed here, it will cut off the enemy from one of the routes to Harper’s Ferry. I earnestly second the wishes of the petitioners, and ask that at least twenty-five hundred men be sent here.
I have just learned from reliable information that there are ten canal-boats in Georgetown loaded with provisions and ammunition. 1 am assured from a clergyman who has been across the river that this information is reliable. With the additional force asked for we would probably be able to cut to pieces any force that they may send up, under the impression that we have only a few hundred men here. Send the force asked for if the exigencies of the service will allow it.
I have no information of any movement of the enemy on this side the river.
Your dispatch was received to-day in regard to tearing up railroad and burning the ties. Will you inform me whether I am to put the troops here at that work and stop their drill ? The guard duty here is very heavy, and if a force has to be detailed for the purpose indicated it will break up our drill, which is very important to our raw, undisciplined troops. Your orders shall be obeyed.
Very respectfully,
EPPA HUNTON,
Colonel, Commanding.

Col. Eppa Hunton:
The undersigned, a committee in behalf of the citizens of Loudoun County, respectfully represent that it is our impression, in which we believe you concur, that the military force at Camp Mason, under your command, is totally inadequate to the protection and defense of this portion of the State of Virginia, which we are assured is attractive to the enemy, for the following reasons:
1st. We border upon the Potomac River, which forms our boundary

[Chap. IX.
for thirty miles, upon which there are not less than thirteen fords and ferries. Leesburg, the county seat, is within four miles of the nearest crossing. We are within thirty miles of Washington City, whence we can be approached by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which runs parallel with the Potomac River, and by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at the Point of Rocks.
2d. We are a large wheat and corn growing country, with heavy crops of the former now nearly matured. There are not less than twenty thousand cattle now being grazed in the county, a large proportion of which are fat and ready for market, and at least one thousand of these are upon the flats of the river. This is exclusive of the dairy stock, hogs, sheep, &c. There are large amounts of flour, bacon, and grain of last year’s growth. A very important item must not be omitted 5 that is, a large stock of the finest horses, suited to cavalry and artillery service.
We deem it well worthy of serious consideration that there is a large Union element in Loudoun, and that it is the policy of the Federal administration to intervene in their behalf. In view of these considerations, and of the fact that the Federal papers have frequently spoken of Leesburg as an eligible position for a camp for the Federal forces, by reason of its healthfulness and the productiveness of the surrounding country, we feel it highly important that a force of troops shall be immediately stationed here sufficient to successfully repel invasion, and respectfully beg that you will exert your influence to attain this end.
Respectfully,

Sir: The sentiments ascribed to many of the inhabitants of the towns in Virginia on and near the Potomac border may render it important to place them, for a time at least, under close surveillance.
I am instructed to state that Mr. James M. Mason, who, from his residence in that quarter of the State and intimate knowledge of its inhabitants, can probably best advise you, has been instructed by the President to indicate to you such points as in his judgment should be placed under such care, and it is the wish of the President that Mr. Mason’s suggestions in this regard should be considered by you, and, so far as consistent with your judgment and authority, that you place it in his power to give them effect.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

of the United States will hereafter employ rifled cannon, of large caliber, at long range. It is reported that such means will be employed. It is therefore advisable that the batteries should be rendered as secure as possible by the application of some such means as were so successfully employed at Charleston. Railroad-iron, laid at an angle of about thirty degrees with the horizon, on the exterior slope, the upper ends not projecting above the exterior crest, would probably answer the purpose. If such an arrangement can be made, you are authorized to procure the iron and apply it where in your judgment it may be required.
It is not unlikely that for the attack of these batteries the enemy will provide himself with iron-plated vessels. In this event the shots from the batteries should be so directed as to strike the water short of but near the vessel, so that after the rebound they might strike below any eave which may be presented near the water line and at right angles to her sides. The accompanying sketch* expresses the idea herein contained.

Colonel : Your letter of the 8th instant lias been received, and it is hoped that you have accomplished the destruction of the bridges upon the Loudoun and Hampshire Railroad, and otherwise rendered the road unserviceable to the enemy. Unless any of the rolling stock can be transferred to the Orange or Manassas Railroad, it must be destroyed immediately. Should it not already be demolished, the gondola and flats must not be permitted to fall into the hands of the enemy.
Lieut. Col. C. C. Cocke has been ordered to duty with your regiment. General G. T. Beauregard is in command of all the forces in Prince William, Fairfax, and Loudoun, through whom you should make your reports, and from whom you will receive instructions. Your letter of the 8th has been referred to him for his information and action. It is necessary to destroy the navigation of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, to prevent its being used by the enemy, and you will take measures to do so effectually, by cutting the dams at Seneca and Edwards Ferry, and blowing up the Monocacy Aqueduct.

On the day of my return to Eichmond forty-two wagons were ordered to be sent you. Twelve were sent day before yesterday, twelve on yesterday, twelve more will be sent to-morrow, and the others as soon as possible.
As you are aware that it is probable, when an effort is made to attack you, it will be both by land and water, I take this occasion of urging upon you the importance of pressing the construction of the batteries for water and land defense.

Mill Point, Pocahontas County, Ya.,
June 10,1861.
President Jefferson Davis:
Dear Sir : Having the best interests of our country at heart, and having taken an active part in the welfare of this county from the first appearance of danger to the present hour, I feel confident you will hear me. While I have no doubt of the success of the South in casting off the Northern yoke ultimately, I must say that this is the last appeal from me, at least for the protection of this section—this county and Greenbrier—that I ever expect to make, and I very much fear that it is already too late for you to prevent our being overrun to some extent, perhaps totally. Our interests have no doubt been cared for, but there has been too little energy at work, and the view has been a short-sighted one. Three weeks since it would have been quite an easy matter to have taken possession of all Western Virginia, except Wheeling, and perhaps that also; but now it is very doubtful if twenty thousand of the best-armed men we have in the State will do it. The few troops we have had out there have had no other effect than to gather in a still stronger force of the enemy, and they are doing their best to carry off and destroy everything upon which a large army can subsist, having entire control of all the railroads and almost the whole country. If not driven back soon, we have no hope of anything being left to support our army now or hereafter, and you will find it next to imiiossible to take provisions for an effective force a distance of one hundred or one hundred and fifty miles, on common road wagons, from the Central Eail-road. Two weeks since this thing was not half so gloomy. In less than two more we shall be overrun, unless there is a far greater force than we have any knowledge of being sent us. The enemy is now within a few hours7 march of our county lines. We have no force at all beyond Huttonsville, and a great part of it far this side—some on the Parkersburg and some on the Marline Bottom roads. Our force all told is not more than from twelve hundred to two thousand. The last account we had from them was on the 7th. They were not more than half armed, and had not ammunition sufficient for more than one round to the man. I sent fifty miles to Covington, and only got seventy-five pounds of powder, but no lead. We have got some fifty pounds of old lead pipe, &c., which we sent on this morning, with powder. I wish I could tell you our situation.
Our county is loyal to the South j only thirteen votes against secession ) population less than four thousand. We laid a war levy of $15,000. Have sent out four volunteer companies, and in all nearly five hundred

soldiers out of about six hundred and fifty militia. There are not men sufficient left to raise our crops or save our harvests. We have urged our governor time after time, again and again, to grant us arms, ammunition, and men. Our wants are this hour still further than ever from being supplied. Last night at 11 o’clock we started a special messenger to the governor or yourself, which is the fourth time we have done so. The enemy still advancing, our danger increasing, our arms and men nearly all gone from the county, no ammunition nor hopes of getting any in time to stay the enemy, we have done all that we can do up to this hour. Will you help us ? Can you help us in time ? One short week, and I fear it will be too late. Many of our best families have their carriages in readiness to move; many more are having their wagons prepared. All that can go I fear will soon be on the move. Then woe to those who are left. Nothing but destruction awaits our houses and barns. Our waving fields of grain and grass, our thousands of cattle, they will soon possess. On my own grass I have from one hundred and fifty to two hundred head of good beef cattle. I have no hope of anything being saved unless you can send on a large force at once.
It seems there has been no one capable of managing the business out northwest. They have suffered themselves to be routed and robbed of everything, or nearly so, and stripped of ammunition and clothes. Provisions could still be had in the Randolph Yalley if the enemy were removed. One of our officers told me on yesterday that there was no question but an army of twenty-five thousand men could be provisioned for a considerable length of time out there. Many large farmers would willingly give all they have. The coming harvest is promising, and will soon be ripe.
Our enemies declare they are determined to take Pocahontas and Greenbrier. This our officers told me this morning, and this will take them to the top of the Alleghany Mountains.
I have now, Mr. President, in a homely manner, tried to tell you a few stubborn facts, and it does seem to me that our case is a hard one. I have three sons in the Army. Two of them came home from the West for this jmrpose. I have spent all my time for more than a month past trying to aid, and took one trip to Richmond, and now I am done writing. I will take my rifle, shot-gun, pistol, and cutlass, relying upon the God of battles, and go to meet the enemy.
Ask Col. Paul McNeil, in Convention, if you doubt one assertion.
Respectfully, yours,
JOHN H. RUCKMAN.

General B. Huger, Commanding, cfee., Norfolk, Va.:
General : The preparations which are understood to be making at Old Point Comfort indicate an early movement of the U. S. troops. While so many points are threatened, it is difficult to say which may be attacked. Great vigilance and alacrity will, therefore, be required at every point, to prevent surprise. The first of the water defenses that will be reached in approaching Norfolk will be those at Sewell’s Point and Craney Island. During my visit at Norfolk these points were in a weak condition and feebly garrisoned. I hope the defenses have

been completed and provided with sufficient garrisons. Each should be commanded by an intelligent and active officer, and of some experience. I hope there are many in your command. The batteries at both places should be provided with works, to prevent their being taken in reverse.
Should the enemy desire to cut off your communication with Richmond, the possession of the battery at Pig Point would become important to them. Its defenses should, therefore, be looked to, and every arrangement made to prevent its surprise and capture. The troops that I have endeavored to collect at Suffolk, being prepared for service, under an efficient officer, may enable you to hold command of the railroad and prevent its destruction. Should a movement be made upon that point, information should be immediately communicated, if possible, to Weldon and this city, that troops may be concentrated from these points and Norfolk to oppose it. It is thought probable, from the conduct of the enemy at other points, that when an attack is made it may be expected at the dawn of day. Every preparation should, therefore, be made at night for such an event.
The officer commanding the troops near Hampton has been directed to watch the movements of the enemy encamped at Newport News, &c., and should preparations for their embarkation be discovered, to press upon them, with a view both of retarding their embarkation and of retaining as large a force as possible in their camp. No great reliance can be placed upon this operation, however, unless it can be discovered that the batteries on York or James Rivers are not to be attacked, as the security of the batteries will have to be attended to by the troops on that line.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Lloyd’s, Va., June 12, 1861. His Excellency Jefferson Davis, &c. :
My Dear Sir : Since I left Richmond I have been thinking of the rumor that the real attack upon Richmond would be made from the Rappahannock River. Whether the plan has been laid I know not; but I fear it is feasible, and, as you cannot be acquainted with the topography of the country, I will say why I think it practicable. The only defense to bar the passage of our steamers on the Rappahannock, up to the head of tide, is a little fort (Lowry), w7hieh is now being erected, about thirty miles from the mouth of the river. This fort is four and a half miles below Tappahannock, the county seat of Essex. Should an army be landed a little below the fort, it would cost but little to silence it, and then the whole Rappahannock Yalley would be thrown open to the hostile fleet. This valley abounds in supplies of food, and is thickly populated with negroes. From Tappahannock to the junction of the Central with the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad, in Hanover, is a distance of from twenty-five to thirty miles. The obstacles to the march are mainly to be found in the Mattapony and Pamunkey Rivers. The Mattapony, where it would be crossed on the route, is so narrow7 and shallow as to present a military obstacle of small importance. The Pamunkey, near the junction, is fordable, except at high water. Both have wmoden bridges, but these might be burned. Once at the junction, an invading army might take either of two railroads, and reach Rich-

mond in a run of twenty miles; or it might, by a march of forty miles, upon the Central Eailroad, put a strong force at Gordonsville, the junction of the Lynchburg and Alexandria Bailroads, and cut off the communications of our Manassas Gap army. The last could not be reenforced from the south or west, except from the valley, through the Manassas Gap Eailroad; nor with the Hanover Junction, in the hands of an enemy, could Eichmond be re-enforced, except from the south side of James Biver. As a strategic point, would not Hanover Junction be more valuable to an enemy than Harpers Ferry itself? Indeed, would not its possession secure Harper’s Ferry? In what way can this be prevented at the least cost in men and money ? I answer as follows:
About eighteen or twenty miles below Fort Lowry, and eight or ten miles below Urbana (one of the reputed places of her sound debarkation), is a point from which the channel can be commanded. I forget the name of the point, but the Coast Survey chart (to be found in Eichmond) will show it, and Lieutenant-Governor Montague, who lives in that county, can describe it. I am told that this chart proves that a fort at this point, in Middlesex, on the south side of the river, and one opposite to it, on the north side, would command the channel completely. Indeed, no vessel could pass up at a greater distance than one and a quarter miles from the Middlesex Point, which is within the range of rifled cannon. This being done, the enemy (if they landed with a view to a march upon Hanover Junction or Eichmond) must land below the fort, which is below Urbana.
NTow, at Urbana is Urbana Creek (a deep creek), bounded by marshes, which runs to within two or three miles of the Dragon Swamp, a military obstacle of the first class. A part of this distance of two or three miles was densely wooded ten years ago, and I suspect that not more than half of it is as yet cleared. On such a neck of land a small force could retard the advance of an army long enough to assemble in sufficient strength to resist it. The length, too, of the march would be thus increased some thirty miles to the junction and fifteen or twenty miles to Eichmond. There would also be another advantage in these lower forts. Nearly the whole valley of the river and most valuable oyster beds would be protected. These oyster beds, without these forts, lying below Fort Lowry, will be in the enemy’s hands. I know that there are some difficulties in throwing up these forts. Our steamers are in the river, but still, with a covering force, and with even a small covering force, it could be done, I presume.
On the northern neck side, the three lower counties of Eichmond, Lancaster, and Northumberland could easily furnish one thousand men, without takiug away the men from Fredericksburg. On the southern side the counties of Essex, Caroline, King and Queen, and Middlesex could furnish twelve or fifteen hundred men without robbing any of the present forts. The men on the southern side, if placed under the command of a regular officer (such a man as Major Hetli is described to be), and aided with a battery, would not only cover the fort on the Middlesex Point, but would, perhaps, resist the march of an army between Urbana Creek and the Dragon Swamp long enough to procure re-en-foreements, through steamers from Fredericksburg (where there are two steamers), also to scour the country along the line of march. Unless this covering force could be commanded by a good officer, and a u regular,” it would not be of much assistance; but under a good commander it might be relied upon.
I know it is presumptuous in me to offer military counsel. No man could know less of such matters. But there are topographical details

with which you could not be acquainted, and so much hangs upon the defensive measures now being taken that I have ventured this letter, although I feel that your time is too important to be wasted on idle suggestions.
If you will show this letter to General Lee, I think he will confirm my topographical description of the country.
Whether the strategic importance of the Hanover Junction be such as I suppose, and whether the march upon it be as practicable as seems to me, both you and he can judge far better than I can; but I cannot be mistaken in supposing that the subject is worthy of your attention and study.
I ought to add to this letter (although it is already a long one) that, notwithstanding Fort Lowry, troops could be landed on the Bappahan-nock at not more than thirty-five miles from the Hanover Junction.
Very truly and faithfully, your friend,
B. M. T. HUNTEB.
Headquarters,
Harper’s Ferry, Fa., June 12, 1861. General B. E. Lee, Commanding:
General : I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 10th instant informing me that two regiments from Lynchburg have been ordered to report at Harper’s Ferry. Permit me to urge most respectfully the importance of equipping the troops ordered to this place before putting them en route. Ammunition and means of transportation cannot be obtained here. Without them, additional troops only make this command more helpless. Before the arrival of the Tennessee and Georgia regiments, our supply of ammunition and means of transportation were far too small. The further division makes us no more able to fight, and unable to march. It is much to be regretted, I think, that the Tennessee regiment was admitted into the service. It is without accouterments, instruction, or subordination.

My Dear General : Colonel Jones delivered to me your letter of the 12th instant,* and, as suggested by you, I conversed with him of the matters to which it related. Your information may be more accu rate than we possess in relation to the purpose of the enemy, and I will briefly reply to you on the hypothesis which forms the basis of your suggestions.
If the enemy commences operations by attack upon Harper’s Ferry, I do not perceive why General Johnston should be unable, even before overwhelming numbers, to retire behind the positions where the enemy would approach him in reverse. It would seem to me not unreasonable to expect that before he reached Winchester, the terminus of the railroad in his possession, the people of the fertile and populous valley

would rise in mass to aid him in repelling the invader. But suppose it should be otherwise, he could still, by retiring to the passes on the Manassas Railroad and its adjacent mountains, probably check the progress of the enemy, and prevent him from either taking possession of the valley or passing to the rear of your position. We hope soon to re-enforce you to an extent equal to the strength you require by the junction of General Johnston, and I cannot doubt but that you will agree with me that you would then be better circumstanced to advance upon Alexandria than if General Johnston, by withdrawing from the valley, had left the enemy the power to pass to your rear, to cut your line of communication, and advance to attack you in reverse while you were engaged with the enemy in front.
Concurring fully with you in the effect which would be produced by possession of Arlington Heights and Alexandria, if your rear is at the same time sufficiently covered, it is quite clear that, if the case should be otherwise, your possession, if acquired, would be both brief and fruitless.
To your request that a concerted plan of operations should be adopted, I can only reply that the present position and unknown purpose of the enemy require that our plan should have many alterations. I have noticed your converging lines upon Richmond, and it can hardly be necessary to remind you that we have not at this time the transportation which would enable us to move upon those lines as described. Should the fortune of war render it necessary to retire our advance columns, they must be brought mainly upon railroads, and that of Harper’s Ferry would come by your present position. It would therefore be a necessity that General Johnston’s columns should make a junction with yours before yours retired; but I have not anticipated the necessity of your retreat, and have struggled rather to increase your force, and look hopefully forward to see you enabled to assume the offensive. Had I been less earnestly engaged in providing for yours and other commands, I should have had the pleasure of visiting you before this date.
Two regiments have been sent forward, neither of which had reached you at the date of your letters, and you will soon receive further re-enforcements. They are not trained troops, but I think they are better than those of the enemy, and the capacity which you have recently exhibited successfully to fight with undisciplined citizens justifies the expectation that you will know how to use such force as we are able to furnish.

You had been heretofore instructed to exercise your discretion as to retiring from your position at Harper’s Ferry and taking the field to check the advance of the enemy. It is to be inferred from the papers now transmitted that you have considered the authority given as not equal to the necessity of the case—that you must needs

[Chap. IX.
retire before the enemy was present, or otherwise that you would be unable to avoid capture, and would not be permitted to fight in retreat. In all the directions which have been given to you you will not have failed to perceive that, relying equally on your sound judgment and soldierly qualifications, it was intended that you should judge of the necessities of your condition and of the means best adapted to answer the general purpose of the campaign. As the movements of the enemy could not he foreseen, so it was impossible to give you specific directions, and the cause of the country could only be confided to one who, like yourself, was deemed entirely competent to decide upon events as they arose.
We have no reliable information that the enemy is at Cumberland, and had hoped that he could not so soon be able to reach that point. We had not anticipated that he could turn your position without your being apprised of it in time to make your movements conform to that fact. As you seem to desire, however, that the responsibility of your retirement should be assumed here, and as no reluctance is felt to bear any burden which the public interests require, you will consider yourself authorized, whenever the position of the enemy shall convince you that he is about to turn your position and thus deprive the country of the use of yourself and the troops under your command, to destroy everything at Harper’s Ferry—the bridge across the Potomac, platforms, and trestle work included—which could serve the purpose of the enemy, and retire upon the railroad towards Winchester, carrying with you all the rolling stock and destroying the road behind you. Should the people of Winchester and the surrounding valley rally to your aid in such numbers as to enable you to resume active operations, you will avail yourself of the first opportunity to attack the enemy, and endeavor to drive him from his purpose of invasion, and to do as much else as possible. The ineffective portion of your command, together with the baggage and whatever else would impede your operations in the field, it would be well to send without delay to the Manassas road.
Should you not be sustained by the population of the valley, so as to enable you to turn upon the enemy before reaching Winchester, you will continue slowly to retire to the Manassas road, upon some of the passes on which it is hoped you will be able to make an effective stand even against a very superior force. To this end it might be well to send your engineer to make a reconnaissance and to construct such temporary works as may be useful and proper.
The position of Harper’s Ferry, as has been heretofore stated, is deemed valuable because of its relation to Maryland and as the entrance to the valley of Virginia, the possession of which by the enemy will separate the eastern and western sections of the State from each other, deprive us of the agricultural resources of that fertile region, and bring in its train political consequences which it is well believed you cannot contemplate without the most painful emotions. If, therefore, much reluctance has been exhibited to a retirement from your position, you will not fail to appreciate the motives which have led to it. Should you move so far as to make a junction with General Beauregard, the enemy would be free immediately to occupy the valley of Virginia and to pass to the rear of Manassas Junction; so that, unless the proposed attack upon Alexandria should be prompt and successful, you would soon be cut off both from re-enforcements and supplies until an army could be sent large enough to defeat that before which you had retired, and you know too well our condition to render it necessary that you should be informed that this could hardly be done before the enemy could make a

conjoint attack upon you by bis armies both front and rear. Troops are now coming forward from the Southern States, and it is to be expected that within a week General Beauregard’s position may be re-enforced by troops equal in number to that which is reported as the effective portion of your command. If you have until then covered the valley of Yirginia, General Beauregard may thus with more probable success advance upon Alexandria than by the junction of your command with his by surrendering the valley of Yirginia to the enemy. It is not expected that you will believe that mere numbers will give you strength, yet it is hoped that the people fighting for their homes and their liberties, with even a small number of instructed troops, may enable you to operate successfully against such forces as are opposed to you; and it is but justice to add that the greatest confidence is placed upon your capacity to inspire others with the soldierly qualities you have so often exhibited, and that the most unlimited confidence is reposed in you both as a commander and a patriot. For these reasons it has been with reluctance that any attempt was made to give you specific instructions, and you will accept assurances of the readiness with which the freest exercise of discretion on your part will be sustained.

General Johnston finds himself unable to maintain his position at Harper’s Ferry, but the President still hopes, if compelled to retire by the enemy passing to his rear, that he will fall back upon the people of the valley, assembled in such force as to enable him to assume the offensive, and perhaps to crush the invading column.

Hdqrs. Dep’t of Northwestern Virginia, Yeager’s, 24 miles south of Huttonsville, Fa., June 13^ 1861. General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General C. 8. Army:
Sir : I overtook Colonel Heck’s command at this point to-day, seven hundred and fifty strong, with four pieces of cannon. I shall reach Colonel Porterfield to-morrow. Accounts from the front are not very encouraging, very contradictory; but, as the information, in my judgment, is not reliable, I will defer giving you details until I reach Huttonsville, and can get something authentic. The condition of things is due to the want of proper officers to conduct the reconnoitering. The cavalry of this region is entirely raw; the officers without experience or confidence. The purpose of this letter is to beg, urgently, that three or four officers of experience, to conduct reconnoitering parties, may be sent me at the earliest possible moment.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. S. GAENETT,
Brigadier- General.

Headquarters of the Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Fa., June 14, 1861. His Excellency John Letcher, Governor of Virginia :
Sir : The defensive works about Eichmond are progressing so slowly, from the want of laborers, that I think it proper to call your attention to the subject, that you may submit it to the city council for their consideration and action. I beg leave, also, to suggest that all available persons in and about Eichmond be organized for the defense of the city; that they provide themselves with such arms as each can procure, and that arrangements be made for the fabrication of suitable ammunition. These are intended as precautionary measures, which can better be made now than upon the eve of the emergency, should it arise.
Very respectfully, &c.,
E. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Winchester Va., June 14, 1861. General William H. Eichardson,
Adjutant-General Virginia Militia:
General: At 10 o’clock this morning I issued an order dismissing the militia which I had called into service. I did so in consequence of the retreat of the enemy from Eomney and the arrival at this place of several regiments of the Confederate forces. In dismissing the militia, I repeated the order for frequent drilling, and for holding themselves in

readiness for service at a moment’s warning. The militia obeyed the call to arms with great alacrity and with considerable unanimity. I have directed the proper rolls, &c., to be prepared and returned.
We received no arms from the State or Confederate States authorities. About one-third of the militia who turned out had no arms at all 5 the others had their own, or such as they could procure.
Very respectfully,
JAMES H. CABSON,
Brigadier-General Sixteenth Brigade, Virginia Militia.
Yorktown, Ya., June 15, 1861.
General B. E. Lee:
Sir : As I am left in temporary command of this post, I hope that I will be pardoned for making a few suggestions. The enemy is burning for revenge for his total rout at Bethel Church. There can be no doubt that he will attempt to take this point either by a night surprise or by a regular siege. We are totally unprepared for either alternative. The development of our lines is so great that they cannot be manned by less than six thousand troops. Now we have no siege guns at all. Our forces are now divided between Bethel Church, Grove Landing, and Williamsburg. We are therefore liable to be beaten in detail with our present weak force, and the York line may be lost at any moment. At this time there are scarce three thousand men in Yorktown, and our lines cannot possibly be defended with fewer than six thousand. Permit me, then, to urge that more troops may be sent here, and that some dozen siege guns be mounted in our batteries. I understand that the Bifle Bangers from Florida are exceedingly anxious to come here, and, as they are all experienced hunters, their services would be of great value to us.
With great respect,
D. H. HILL,
Colonel First Regiment North Carolina Volunteers.
Headquarters, Richmond, Van June 15,1861. His Excellency John Letcher, Governor of Virginia:
Sir : Agreeably to your request, I submit a statement of the military and naval preparation for the defense of Virginia, from the period of her separation from the U. S. Government to the date of transfer of the military operations of the State to the Confederate Government. Arrangements were first made for the establishment of batteries to prevent the ascent of our enemy by hostile vessels. As soon as an examination was made for the selection of sites, their construction was begun and their armament and defense committed to the Virginia Navy. Preparations were also begun for receiving into the service of the State volunteer consumes, and for organizing, arming, and equipping them. Mustering officers were appointed, rendezvous established, and provision made for their subsistence and shelter. The primary estimate of the number of troops, of all arms, required, based upon the points to be defended, amounted to fifty-one thousand men. The estimated quota of each portion of the State has been furnished, except from the western

section. Arrangements were made for calling out the volunteers from the western section at the same time and in the same manner as from the eastern section, but as yet it has been feebly responded to.
Comidete returns from the troops in the field have not, and, from the nature of things, cannot for some time be received; but, from the best source of information within our reach, the number of Virginia troops is about 35,000. This amount probably falls below the real number, for, referring to the report of the Colonel of Ordnance, it will be seen that he has issued 2,054 rifles and carbines and 41,004 muskets, in addition to pistols and sabers to the cavalry. Thirteen thousand arms have also been issued from Lexington, making a total of 56,658. Seven thousand of those from Lexington and several thousand from the arsenal at Eichmond have been issued to troops from other States; but as many of the Virginia companies, supposed to be about 5,000 men, were armed and equipped when received into the service of the State, should the number of unarmed companies from other States not differ materially from the number of armed companies of the State, the number of Virginia troops in the field may be assumed to be about 40,000. When it is remembered that this body of men were called from a state of profound peace to one of unexpected war, you will have reason to commend the alacrity with which they left their homes and families and prepared themseives for the defense of the State. The assembling of men, however, was not the most difficult operation. Provision for their instruction, subsistence, equipment, clothing, shelter, and transportation in the field required more time and labor. Ammunition of every kind had to be manufactured. The carriages of the guns for river, land, and field service had to be made, with the necessary implements, caissons, battery wagons, &c. One hundred and fifteen guns for field service have thus been provided, from which twenty light batteries, of four guns each, have been furnished, with the requisite horses, harness, &c.
For the defense of James Eiver, two batteries and two steamers have been provided, mounting, altogether, forty guns, ranging in caliber from 32-pounders to 8 and 9 inch columbiads. Arrangements are also in process for mounting sixty guns, of different weights, on the defenses around Eichmond, and a naval battery of 6 to 12 pounder howitzers is in process of organization.
On York Eiver three batteries have been constructed, mounting thirty guns, of caliber similar to the guns on James Eiver.
Sites for batteries on the Potomac have also been selected, and arrangements were in progress for their construction; but the entire command of that river being in the possession of the United States Government, a larger force is required for their security than could be devoted to that purpose. The batteries at Aquia Greek have only been prepared. Twelve guns are in position there.
On the Eappahannock Eiver a four-gun battery of 32 pounders and 8-inch columbiads has been erected.
Six batteries have been erected on the Elizabeth Eiver, to guard the approaches to Norfolk and the navy-yard. They mount eighty-five guns, 32-pounders and 8 and 9 inch columbiads.
To prevent the ascent of the Nansemond Eiver and the occupation of the railroad from Norfolk to Eichmond, three batteries have been constructed on that river, which will mount nineteen guns.
The frigate United States has been prepared for a school-ship, provided with a deck battery of nineteen guns, 32-pounders and 9-inch columbiads, for harbor defense. The frigate Merrimac has been raised

and is in the dry-dock, and arrangements are made for raising the Germantown and Plymouth.
In addition to the batteries described, other works have been constructed for their land defense, exceeding, in many instances, the works on the batteries themselves. An extensive line of field works has been erected for the security of ^Norfolk on the sides towards the bay. Re-doubts for the same purpose have been constructed at Jamestown Island, Gloucester Point, Yorktown, and across the neck of land below Williamsburg. I have confined myself to a general narration of operations, and for the details refer you to the reports of several chiefs of staff.

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General 0. S. Army, Richmond, Va.: General: Since my arrival here I have made careful reconnaissance of the coast, and sought in every way possible to possess myself of the enemy’s movements and intentions. There is no evidence of a disposition on his part to land in this vicinity, and I am obliged to think that the force here is unnecessarily large. To all appearances the Federal forces will be directed against Manassas Junction and Harper’s Ferry. If those places fall, this position will be unnecessary, as he will have opened for himself a more direct route to Richmond. I beg therefore respectfully to suggest that after leaving a sufficient guard for the batteries, say 500 men, it will be better for me to march with the great body of my command to Manassas, or some other point where they can be made available, to resist the first great onslaught of the enemy. It may be the time for this move has not yet arrived, and my only object now is to inform you that if you agree with me in opinion as to the enemy’s intention, I can at very short notice march from here with three regiments of volunteers and two batteries of artillery.

Headquarters, Richmond, Ya., June 16, 1861. Col. J. B. Magruder, Commanding, York to ten, Va.;
Colonel : Your letter of the 14th, directed to General S. Cooper, has been received. The result of your examination of the James Biver is different from the conclusion arrived at by the engineer and naval officers to whom that duty was assigned. They supposed that a battery at Day’s Point would not command the passage of James Biver, and therefore established it at Jamestown Island. A battery at Day’s Point was considered to be advantageous in other respects, but, as it would require a larger covering force for its security than could then be assigned it, its construction was necessarily postponed. Since the concentration of troops at Suffolk has become possible, arrangements have been commenced for its erection, and it is hoped it will not be too late for the benefit proposed.
Bespeetfully, &c.,
B. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Headquarters, Richmond, Va., June 16,1861. To the Commanding Officer Yorktown, Va. :
Col. D. H. Hill’s letter of the 15th instant has been received. The advantage to the enemy of his possession of Yorktown will be sufficient to induce him to adopt every means to take it. It is hoped that every precaution will be adopted to prevent its being carried by surprise. Should it be besieged, measures will be taken for its relief. There are no siege guns at present available for your post. Be-enforcements will be sent to Yorktown as rapidly as the arrival of available troops at this point will permit. Should the works at Yorktown be too extensive for defense by the troops now there, it will be advisable, if possible, to contract the lines, so as to render them defensible by the force you can command for that purpose.

er’s battery of artillery, Captain Anderson’s half battery (two pieces), and one company of cavalry. The Buckhannon Pass is occupied by one regiment of infantry, a half battery, and a company of cavalry. I made a forced march by night to reach these passes, in consequence of having heard that the enemy were moving from Philippi to Buckhannon. I presumed his object to be to get possession of the two passes, and thus shut up my force in the valley of Beverly, Huttonsville, &c.
The other troops in rear have not yet arrived. Major Williams, on engineer duty, reported this afternoon, but I doubt whether anything can be done for this pass. It is not so formidable as I had been induced to suppose, and would present no difficulty to good light infantry.

Headquarters, Yorlctoicn, Fa., June 16, 1861. Col. S. Cooper, Adjutant-General G. 8. Army:
Sir : I have the honor to state that the Louisiana regiment, numbering 800 men, and the Zouaves, numbering about 500, with Major Cary’s battalion of some 250 men, are at Bethel} that Colonel August’s regiment of Virginia volunteers, 600 strong (effectives), and the regiment of local troops which I have organized under the name of Peninsula Guards, ten companies, about 600 men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell, are all at or near Williamsburg, say 1,300 men; there are here 2,700 effective men ; making in all 5,550 effective men. This is not enough; 4,500 more troops are necessary to secure this line, and fifteen heavy guns. There are at Norfolk, I am informed, many 32-pounders on navy carriages. They would answer here very well. The enemy will come on this line provided with heavy siege guns. Now we have time, if the 32-pounders from Norfolk can be ordered and sent, to put them in position, and to foil the enemy in every attack. Many are needed for this place and Williamsburg also. If the enemy lay siege to this fort and those before Williamsburg with heavy siege guns and men armed with the long-range muskets, it will be impossible to hold either with light field pieces and common muskets. We are now strong enough to prevent being stormed, I think, provided our lines are filled with men, which is not the case now. The heavy guns are absolutely necessary, and without loss of time. So are men. Four more regiments, of one thousand effective men each, or five regiments of the ordinary strength, with the heavy guns asked for, would put anxiety to rest as to a successful attack on Richmond from this quarter. I have here asked for the smallest number. I again ask the attention of the headquarters of the Army to the fact that no fuses are furnished the shell for the navy battery here, and that the amount of ammunition for that battery is ridiculously small (forty-seven rounds, without fuses, to each gun). I sent a good fuse-maker to Captain Barron the other day— Anderson—who has been employed at Fort Monroe in the ordnance department for many years.
I cannot too urgently press upon the consideration of the headquarters the immediate necessity of having the heavy guns from Norfolk or elsewhere at this place. The defense of Richmond is here at Williamsburg and Jamestown, and the men and guns are necessary to that de-

fense. I have stationed four companies of Colonel August’s regiment at GroYe Wharf, with one piece of artillery, with orders to fortify (breastwork and an intrenchment for one gun) immediately. Same at King’s Mill. Also one company on the King’s Mill road, at Tetter’s Keck, and another on Spratley’s farm. A redoubt will be built at once, which will command the King’s Mill Landing, and one at Spratley’s farm, which will enfilade the shore between King’s Mill and the Grove. This latter must be furnished with two columbiads, which I have to request may be forwarded to Jamestown, care of Captain Rives, Engineers, with their carriages, ammunition, &c. I proceed to Bethel to-day.

Headquarters, Richmond, Eh., June 17,1861. General T. H. Holmes, Dep t of Fredericksburg, Va.:
General : In answer to your letter of the 15th instant, addressed to General S. Cooper, I have to state that, until the plans of the enemy are more clearly disclosed, it is not considered advisable to reduce the force in the vicinity of Fredericksburg, lest that place might fall into their hands, and thus open a short and convenient line to Richmond. It is, however, desired that you keep your command in condition to move at any point when required, leaving a sufficient force to maintain the batteries. It has been stated to me that troops have been stationed at Mathias Point, Colonel Brockenbrough commanding, and that their position is unmasked and unprotected. It was designed to occupy this point with a battery, for the purpose of commanding the passage of the Potomac. Kot having sufficient troops to secure it, its construction was postponed, and the guns have been applied, I presume, to other points. If your force is sufficient, I would suggest the project of its erection be resumed. Captain Lynch, of the Kavy, had the matter in charge, and is informed of the circumstances of the case. Everything should be prepared, before breaking ground, for its rapid construction, and troops sufficient for holding it at the spot.

A good position for them to occupy would be Brentsville, a few miles southeast of here, where they would protect my rear, and be prepared also to act against any force of the enemy attempting to land at Quantico Creek or even at Aquia Creek.

I have already informed General Holmes, through his aide, Colonel Lacy, of the necessity of establishing a battery and supporting force at the mouth of the former creek, but I am unable to do so at present for the reason given above; hence I would be happy to have him do it if in his power. I would suggest also the necessity of establishing immediately a telegraph station near your headquarters and another near those of Lieutenant-Colonel Green, at Camp Chopawamsic, near Evans-port, so as to be in telegraphic communication with this place, via Richmond, for a most thorough and perfect concert of action must exist between our different military departments to insure victory to our arms and success to our glorious cause.

I disagree with General Beauregard as to the propriety of detaching any part of this command.
The point designated by him is entirely out of reach of Aquia Creek. If this command is relieved, it should be on the supposition that there is no danger to be apprehended of an invasion from near here, and in that event nearly the whole command should be sent.

Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee, Commanding Forces, Richmond, Va.;
Sir : I have had reports for a week past that the Lincoln forces were putting artillery on the Ripraps. I presumed at the time it was to prevent small vessels from passing to the southward of it.
On Saturday afternoon the command at Sewell’s Point was surprised by a rifled shell passing just over the battery, and exploding some hundred yards beyond. Some eight or ten shells were fired, but no others fell so near the battery. Some went near the camp of the Georgia battalion, near half a mile distant. The distance from the Ripraps to the battery is about three and five-eighths miles. I immediately ordered a lighter load of railroad iron sent down, and commenced work, securing the magazine and battery from the effect of these shells, and, as it is a long shot, the men will learn to dodge them. I am pushing on the work of fortifying the battery. The shells proved to be 32-pounder calibqr, of Sawyer’s pattern, flanged projectile, covered with composition metal, and having a concussion fuse. They did not fire at all yesterday (Sunday). Last evening I received a report that a small propeller was lying

near tlie Eipraps, and presume it was bringing a supply of ammunition for this gun. I shall secure the work, and expect to hold it, as there is safety in a long shot, and every round must cost them $10 or $12.
There was an arrival of troops in a steamer yesterday at Old Point. They were landed on the farms near Hampton. Last evening a steamer took a load of men from Newport News to Fort Monroe.

General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
General : On the morning of the 16th intelligence was received, apparently reliable, that no enemy is advancing on Eomney, and that the large body of troops collected near Hagerstown would cross the Potomac yesterday. The troops under my command were therefore directed to this point, on the road from Hagerstown to Winchester, the main route from Maryland into the valley of Virginia. We are twelve miles in advance of Winchester. My only hope from this movement is a slight delay in the enemy’s advance. I believe his force to be about 18,000; ours is 6,500. Lieutenant-Colon el Stuart, commanding our small body of cavalry, sent me intelligence last night that the Federal troops encamped yesterday afternoon about eight miles from Martins-burg (seventeen miles from this place) on this road.
I will endeavor to conform as nearly as circumstances may permit to the instructions received from you on the 15th. The want of ammunition has rendered me very timid.

Sir : Yours of the 17th instant this day delivered by Colonel Thomas, and the ammunition will start this evening under his charge by a special train. In the letter to you of the 15th, if the instructions seemed to you specific, be assured it was only intended to respond to the desire manifested in the letter communicated by you, and both then and theretofore and now the fullest reliance was placed in your zeal and discretion, and you are expected to act as circumstances may require, only keeping in view the general purpose to resist invasion as far as may be practicable, and seek to repel the invaders whenever and however it may be done. In order that all disposition may be made to meet your wants it is necessary that you should write frequently and fully as to your position, and the movements which may be contemplated by you. Since the date of my last letter to you re-enforcements have been steadily sent forward to the camp at Manassas June-

tion, and others will be added to that force and to yours, as the current of events may determine us to advance on one line or the other. Should we not be able to assume the offensive with prospects of success the war must for a time remain one of positions, and active operations be carried on against small detachments and lines of communication. If the enemy should advance boldly, the latter operations will become to you more easy and to him more injurious. It is needless to tell you that we are poorly supplied with disciplined troops and with transportation for maneuvering in the field, and you will therefore readily understand why we have not sought to accumulate in your command before receiving requisitions from you and before being in a condition to instruct you to advance.
Our information here—much less perfect than your own—has not led to the conclusion that a main attack was now contemplated upon your line of operations, but we have not failed to observe indications of a purpose to make such attack hereafter—probably not before affairs in Western Virginia remove the apprehensions of the enemy as to popular resistance in that quarter. We have, however, endeavored to use the limited means at control so as to meet the contingency of attack either by way of Harper’s Ferry or by Alexandria, as the case might be, should either occur before we were ready to shift the campaign to suit our own views. The advance upon Eomney was most probably only intended to capture the arms which had been placed there, and a painful rumor is in circulation here that this was near being effected by surprise, on account of the neglect to have scouts and pickets on duty sufficiently far in advance to gain timely warning of the approach of an enemy. You will in the manner which you may deem most effective enforce upon all the troops under your command the necessity of the greatest vigilance and activity on picket and reconnoitering duty. If the inhabitants of the valley have rallied with spirit to your standard, you will no doubt find among them men well suited to the duty of scouts and guides. As far as it may be practicable you will seek to strip the country which may be possessed by the enemy of those things which may be most available to him, especially horses suited to the military service and herds of beef cattle. If it be possible to do so, it is desirable that the gun-stocks, gun-barrels, tilt-hammers, &c., which have not been removed from Harper’s Ferry should be brought away and sent forward for our use elsewhere.
Ee-enforcements will be sent to you of such character and numbers as you may require and our means will enable us to afford $ and here I would enforce upon you the necessity of communicating promptly all reliable information which you may obtain in relation to the enemy. The reports which we receive from other than official sources are so often incorrect that no action can possibly be based upon them.

It is important that yon particularly watch the landings in the vicinity of Grove Wharf, on the left bank, and Stonehouse Wharf, on the right bank, below Jamestown, and endeavor to give notice to the troops on either bank. A body of infantry guard the former point, and a troop of cavalry, commanded by Captain Ruffin, patrol the country about BurwelPs Bay, to convey intelligence to the troops at Suffolk. It is suggested that you establish a system of signals, as a means of communication with the troops, and take every precaution not to jeopardize the safety of your boat by proceeding too far beyond the protection of the guns of the batteries. You will report to the commanding officer of Jamestown Island, to whom a copy of your orders will be sent.

These will be sent as soon as possible to Captain Whittle, at West Point, who will forward them to Yorktown. If Captain Whittle should think it expedient to do so, he is authorized to send to Yorktown the guns that are intended for Gloucester Point, and to replace them when the above-named requisition is filled, if they are not wanted immediately at Gloucester Point.

It always has been the intention to send additional troops to the Yorktown district as fast as they became available, and this arrangement will be continued until a sufficient number is obtained. As regards the guns which you report necessary for the land defense at Yorktown, they also have been forwarded for that and contiguous points as fast as they could be provided. I cannot learn of any requisition having been made by you for ammunition for the water batteries, but I take pleasure in informing you that fifty shells, properly fused, were forwarded to you yesterday. The laboratory at this point is so small that it does not furnish facilities for rapidly making fuses. More shells with fuses can, however, be sent you if desired.

Sir : In reply to your letter of the 18th instant,* I have the honor to state that I consider it very important to the military operations within Virginia that proper and easy connections of the several railroads passing through or terminating in Richmond or Petersburg should be made as promptly as possible. The want of these connections has seriously retarded the operations so far, and they may become more important. All the guns, ammunition, &c., from Norfolk, on reaching Petersburg, have either to be transported across the Appomattox to the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad, or forwarded to the Richmond and Danville Railroad, and to be again transported at Richmond. The transportation of troops has also been delayed in the same manner. I have previously urged the connection of the roads within the cities of Richmond and Petersburg, and hope it may now be established.
Very respectfully, &c.,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.

Hon. William C. Parks,
Grayson County, Virginia, Convention of Virginia;
Sir : In answer to your letter of the 18th instant,* I regret to state that the supply of arms available for arming the volunteers of Virginia for service in the field is so limited that at present I am unable to comply with your request. I have suggested to the governor a method of procuring some flint-lock muskets of the old pattern, which, if successful, I hope will furnish the means of giving arms to your county and others that are much in*want.
Respectfully, &c.,

General : In writing by Colonel Thomas yesterday I reported myself on the road hence to Martinsburg and twelve miles from this place. Since then I have encamped within four miles, and have just selected a position for the 12 batteries covering the route from the west and northeast. There are eight heavy guns here, which, with the military of the town and country, ought to enable us to hold out against any probable force which can be expected, provided ammunition shall he furnished, especially caps, which I am told are now made very expeditiously in Richmond. These troops have not a supply for half an hour’s fighting. I beg you to direct that efforts may be made to supply this want, which makes me overcautious, perhaps.
Very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier-General, C. 8. Army.

General S. Cooper, Adjt. Gen. (7. S. Army, Richmond, Fa. ;
Sir : I have the honor to report that I now occupy this post with the Second Louisiana Regiment, the Zouaves, to which I have attached the York and Warwick companies, two batteries of artillery, and some cavalry, and that the Georgia regiment is so placed in our rear as to be able to watch the Poquosin River, to fall back upon Yorktown, or to support Bethel.
Yesterday a flag of truce was borne by Mr. Butler, aide-de-camp to General Butler, who was accompanied by Mr. Winthrop, brother of Major Winthrop (who was also on the staff of General Butler), and was killed on the 10th. The object was to ask the body of Major Winthrop. I had it disinterred and escorted by a detachment of artillery and a troop of dragoons to a farm-house beyond our works, where it was delivered to Mr. Butler with military honors to the deceased.
One of our vedettes, Private Prior, was cut off the day before yesterday, and killed. A lieutenant of Captain Adams’ company of horse was shot in the leg by a picket of the Georgia regiment. I had directed a bandeau of white to be worn by our forces, but the Georgians had it not. The wound, though severe, is not considered mortal. Badges prescribed are worn now by the Georgians, and I hope no mistake of this serious nature will again occur.
I requested in a letter from Grove Landing that Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, Fifteenth Virginia Infantry, might be appointed colonel, and ordered to report to me. I have attached the York and Warwick companies to the Zouaves, partly in order to give the battalion a colonel. In fact, the captains of the Zouaves called upon me in a body, and stated that they would be obliged to resign and serve as privates unless something was done, their lieutenant-colonel being, though a brave and good man, entirely without energy or the faculty to command. Whilst reminding them of the impropriety of their course, I saw that they were actuated by no ill or ignoble feeling. I ordered them here, under the command, of course, of their lieutenant-colonel, and they obeyed promptly$ but I am most anxious to have a colonel for this battalion—a man of some knowledge of his profession, and firmness—and I have learned it would not be distasteful to Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens himself, who will still be lieutenant-colonel. Please let this be done with as little delay as possible.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Colonel, Commanding.

General S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General:
Sir : As already reported, I have four companies of cavalry under my command. I find that beyond Laurel Hill and the Buckhannon Pass there are so many country by-roads and cross-roads that this force is not quite sufficient to keep my command properly guarded. I therefore request that I may be supplied at the earliest practicable moment with two companies of well-armed and well-instructed cavalry.
The force which I found here is in a miserable condition as to amrnu-

nition and equipments. As regards the latter, they are actually suffering. Many are without blankets, and I may say nearly all without tents. The nights are cold, and there is much rain in this mountainous region. Sickness is therefore to be apprehended. In addition to this? they are obliged to carry their ammunition in their pockets, and that which escapes the rain is ruined by the perspiration of the men and the wearing out of the paper cartridges. I asked before leaving Staunton for one thousand cartridge-boxes, but I suppose it will be some time before I shall see them. I shall ask to-day for five hundred tent flies, as it will take too much time to make tents. I simply want something to protect arms and ammunition from rain.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Richmond, Va., June 18, 1861.
General R. E. Lee,
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Virginia:
General : I have been ordered by Col. L>. H. Hill, temporarily in command at Yorktown, to see you in reference to a letter recently written by him requesting re-enforcements and that some heavy guns should be sent for the interior lines at Yorktown. At present there are in Yorktown, besides the field pieces of my battalion, four columbiads in the water battery, two brass 12-pounders, one 12-pounder navy howitzer, and two iron 6-pounders. The interior lines are very extensive, not less than three-quarters of a mile in length, to some extent commanded by the heights north of the morass, which are too extensive to be occupied, and on the east there is a level, open country, traversed by the roads from Hampton and Wormley’s Creek, favorable to the erection of batteries by the enemy. To render the place tenable, if attacked by a force with a siege train, I respectfully submit that we should have at least twelve heavy guns, eight of them to be mounted on the eastern lines, three on the southern, and one on the western, to command the road from Williamsburg. I find that Captain Ingraham, the Chief of the Naval Bureau of Ordnance, can supply us with eight 32-pounders of twenty-seven hundred weight, and four 42-pounder carronades with navy carriages. These guns are well suited to our purposes, the former firing round shot and shell effectively, and the latter firing grape shot for short ranges, such as are to be found on the northern lines, facing the morass. Captain Ingraham can also furnish four boats, capable of transporting four or five hundred men, which will be very useful in preserving the communications between Yorktown and Gloucester Point. I respectfully ask permission to receive these guns and boats. Two of the guns are at Gloucester Point and two at West Point ; but Captain Whittle authorizes me to say that they are not ready for them at either place, and that he should prefer seeing them mounted at Yorktown.
The Secretary having given me an order for thirty-six horses, to supply the loss of eight in the action of the 10th instant, to mount four men for each of the six navy howitzers in my battalion, to mount two chiefs of caissons, and to furnish two spare horses for the two batteries, I respectfully ask a detail of a non-commissioned officer and eighteen men to carry the horses to Yorktown. General Fauntleroy informs me that he can furnish the men without inconvenience.
I also inclose a requisition upon the Ordnance Bureau for thirty-six halters and twenty-six riding saddles and bridles for the horses above

General Joseph E. Johnston,
Commanding (7. S. Forces near Winchester, Va. ;
General : Your letter of 18th instant just received. A large supply of ammunition for your command left here this morning, including eighty thousand percussion caps. An additional supply will be forwarded to you by to-morrow morning’s train. Every effort will be made here to support and sustain you to the extent of our means. All that is asked is to be informed promptly of your wants.
The movements of the enemy indicate the importance he attaches to the position of the valley of Virginia, and that he has probably seen the power he would acquire, if left free to do so, by advancing as far as Staunton, and then distributing his force so as to cut off our communication with the West and South, as well as to operate against our Army of the Potomac by movements upon its lines of communication, or attacking upon the reverse, supplying himself at the same time with all the provisions he may acquire in the valley of the Shenandoah, and enabling him to dispense with his long train of transportation from Pennsylvania. Everything should be destroyed which would facilitate his movements through the valley.
Very respectfully, vour obedient servant.

Col. George Deas :
Sir ? Our vedettes reported this morning the enemy marching in force, via Warwick Court-House. We.being at Bethel, this, if true, would cut us off from Yorktown. I immediately marched for Yorktown, carrying with us such baggage as the wagons which I had (seven in num-

her) permitted, and sent an express to Colonel Hill to order out a regiment at the junction of the York and Warwick roads to stop the enemy, while we took him in rear. He has not yet made his appearance, and we are in the works, but we hear of him in the neighborhood, and I have sent cavalry to feel him. General Butler has called for a re-enforcement of ten thousand men. Please send all you can spare, with plenty of ammunition.
I am, sir, verv respectfully, your obedient servant,

Headquarters, Richmond, Fa., June 19, 1861. Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, LloyWs, Essex County, Fa.:
Sir : Your communication of the 12th instant, to his excellency the President of the Confederate States, has been referred to me. I have the honor to reply that my attention has been frequently and earnestly called to the subject of the defense of the Rappahannock, both as regards Essex and the surrounding counties. The battery at Lowry’s Point seemed to be most advantageous at first for the defense of Fredericksburg, because it was at the narrowest and most difficult portion of the channel, and because it could be best defended by the guns that were available. It was desired to place the battery as near the mouth of the river as possible, and attention was particularly directed to Gray’s Point and Cherry Point $ but it was found that the distance was so great as to require guns of heavy caliber, not then available, and works of such size as to be difficult of construction and protection. Those points were therefore abandoned. Recently the project for the construction of batteries at those points has been received, and a proper officer has made examinations to that effect. As soon as means can be provided the works will be commenced$ but in the mean time it is desired that the measure be kept secret.
Respectfully,
R. E. LEE,
General, Commanding.
Headquarters, Richmond, Fa., June 20, 1861.
Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes,
Commanding, cfee., Fredericksburg, Fa, ;
General : Your letter of the 19th instant has been received. Your explanations of the object for which a force has been stationed at Mathias Point is satisfactory; but I think it would be better if the troops would keep themselves concealed from the enemy, and especially refrain from firing into ships, as I am informed has been done. As your force is not sufficient for the protection of the battery at Mathias Point, its erection, for the present, must be postponed; but I desire you to keep its establishment in view, as it is proposed to place one there when circumstances will permit. Your arrangements as to the hospital at Fredericksburg and the appointment of Burgeon McClanalian are approved.
Yery respectfully,
R. E. LEE,
General, Commanding*

Brig. Gen. S. Cooper,
Adjt. and Insp. Gen. C. 8. Army, Richmond, Va.;
Sir : I wrote to you yesterday from Beverly in relation to two additional companies of cavalry, but I am constrained to recur to the subject again to-day, to urge upon you the necessity of great dispatch in forwarding them to me. During the last two days the enemy have evinced great activity and boldness in pushing their scouts to within two or three miles of my position, on the approaches to it, and it has quite worn down my small cavalry force (two companies at this point) in watching and checking their movements. The force is too small to enable me to push heavy scouts as far to the front as I desire. My scouts have had one or two partial rencounters with those of the enemy, in which we have captured one of their men and two horses, and have killed one man and wounded others; but the service is too hard on the men and horses. The enemy are reported to be six thousand strong in Philippi, and about four thousand strong in Grafton, with six pieces of artillery (two rifled) at the former place; but these numbers vary very much. I do not think that they have more than seven thousand at Grafton and Philippi together. As I must keep one or two pieces of artillery in each of the passes now held by me, I hope it may not be deemed unreasonable if I ask two additional pieces. Gould I get rifled pieces1? Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram’s regiment will reach me to-morrow. Colonel Ramsey’s regiment of Georgia volunteers is two days behind Colonel Pegram.
I am, sir, very respectfullv, your obedient servant,

Headquarters, YorTctown, Va., June 20, 1861. Col. George Deas, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir: Having learned from the vedettes stationed on the Warwick road yesterday morning at 7 o’clock that a large body of the enemy was seen by himself and others on that road as high up as Lee’s store, nearly equidistant with our troops, after deducting the distance from that place to our position, and learning from Captain Levy, Louisiana volunteers, whom I had sent in the night before with a flag to General Butler, that there was every indication of an expedition of some magnitude being on foot, I determined to march without delay to this post, and, if the enemy had preceded me, to attack him in his rear. With this view, I sent a dispatch, by night express, to Colonel Hill, commanding at Yorktown, directing him to place one of his regiments about two miles in front of his works, and at the junction of the York and Warwick roads, by which the enemy, if he arrived before Yorktown before we did, would be obliged to pass. I intended to attack him there, but, having sent fresh vedettes to Warwick Court-House and Lee’s store, I found that a strong party of the enemy had marched out early in the morning to procure horses, mules, &c. The embarrassment of operating on the Peninsula with a weak force before a strong one is that, if you want to verify a report of a vedette, your force is cut off, and the important point to be defended at all hazards is in danger. This marching

and countermarching, however, not being understood, fatigues and dispirits the troops. Still, it must be done, as the enemy must be kept in his trenches and fortifications. I had no wagons with me except three loaded with provisions, and had to leave the cooking utensils, some few tents, and the extra rations of our men on the ground. I reasoned that, if the force of the enemy turned out to be large, and an attacking party on Yorktown, I should be in time to recover it by this course; if small, I could easily send for the articles left. I have already most of them here, and the rest will be here to night.
I shall continue to occupy the lower part of the country—Bethel and neighborhood—but must construct some intrenchments, both on the Poquosin River and on the Warwick road, before making a move with an infantry force.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,
Colonel, Commanding.
P. S.—I have the honor to request that Captain Stanard’s battery, now at the Baptist College, be sent to me, as the erection of intrenchments on the Warwick and Poquosin roads makes it necessary that I should have more field pieces.
