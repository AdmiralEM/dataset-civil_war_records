No. 52.
Report of Maj. Henry G. Staples, Third Maine Infantry.
Hdqrs. Third Begiment Maine Volunteers,
Clermont) Fa., July 27,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the operation of the regiment under my command, Third Maine Volunteers, at the battle at Bull Bun, Sunday, July 21,1861. My regiment left camp at Centreville at 2.30 o7clock on the morning of the 21st, with the Third Brigade, under your order. After a tedious march, we arrived at Bull Bun, to within half a mile of the enemy’s battery. At 2 o’clock p. m. at this place the regiment was halted under cover of the woods in front, to recover from their fatigue. After remaining in this position some fifteen minutes we were ordered into line of battle, and proceeded to engage the enemy. They were marched to the top of the hill, one-fourth of a mile from their resting place, when the enemy’s battery opened upon us from the right with terrible effect. The men stood firm in their position, firing in volleys about twenty rounds with good effect, when they retired to the foot of the hill, reformed, and returned to the encounter. Finding we were wholly unsupported, there being ft one of our troops in sight and no batteries to assist us, we again retired, after a desperate struggle of about fifteen minutes, under a raking fire from the batteries of the enemy. My regiment retired from the field over the plain, in full view of the enemy, in good order, but on reaching the

woods became somewhat scattered. They soon rallied, however, and marched in retreat at route step to their camp at Centreville.
I would take this opportunity to mention the heroic conduct of several officers of the regiment, and particularly of Capt. E. Burt, of the brigade staff, who met me on the way and tendered his valuable services to act in capacity of adjutant. He deserves the hearty support and good-will of the entire regiment.
Captain Hesseltine, before leaving camp with his company, engaged in prayer, and was heard to say to his men, u Trust in God, stand by the flag, and you will know no fear.” They did stand by, one and all, and the captain cared not for his own comfort, but ministered to the wants of the wounded, and conducted a part in safety to the camp.
Captains Sawyer, Heath, Lakeman, and Lieutenants Hatch, Hall, Wiggin, Colson, Johnson, Watson, Savage, and Harvey evinced true courage, kept their positions during the engagement till ordered to retire, and administered to the wants of the suffering.
The report of the killed, wounded, and missing, as far as can be ascertained,, is as follows.*

Report of Col. Hiram G. Berry, Fourth Maine Infantry.
Hdqrs. Fourth Beoment Maine Volunteers,
Clermont, Fa., July 26,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report to you my regiment now in quarters at this post. The engagement with the enemy on Sunday, and the long march incident thereto, have exhausted my men, and some time must necessarily elapse before the regiment will be fitted for active duties. As near as can be ascertained, the loss in killed in the engagement at Bull Bun consists of two commissioned officers, Lieutenant Clark, of Company G (Wiscasset), and Lieutenant Burd, of Company F. Two commissioned officers wounded, Captain Bean and Lieutenant Huxford. Sergeant-Major Chapman killed; twenty-eight privates killed and thirty-three wounded, t This indeed has been an unfortunate affair for this regiment.
I herewith hand you report of wants for regiment, in accordance with order so to do. In doing so, I must beg leave to say that my men have no confidence whatever in the kind of arms with which we are now partially supplied. Had they been properly armed, the result of Sunday’s loss would have been somewhat different. It will take some time to bring the regiment up to that sfete of confidence in the managers of this war that it had prior to last Sunday’s affair. I mention these things
