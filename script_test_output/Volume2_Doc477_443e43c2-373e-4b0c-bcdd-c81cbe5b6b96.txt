No. 125.
Congratulatory proclamation of Generals Johnston and Beauregard.
Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
Manassas, Pa., July 25, 1SG1.
Soldiers of the Confederate States:
One week ago a countless host of men, organized into an army, with all the appointments which modern art and practical skill could devise, invaded the soil of Virginia. Their people sounded their approach with triumphant displays of anticipated victory. Their generals came in almost royal state 5 their great ministers, senators, and women came to witness the immolation of our army and the subjugation of our people, and to celebrate the result with wild revelry.
It is with the profoundest emotions of gratitude to an overruling God, whose hand is manifest in protecting our homes and our liberties, that we, your generals commanding, are enabled, in the name of our whole country, to thank you for that patriotic courage, that heroic gallantry, that devoted daring, exhibited by you in the actions of the 18th and 21st, by which the hosts of the enemy were scattered and a signal and glorious victory obtained.
The two affairs of the 18th and 21st were but the sustained and continued effort of your patriotism against the constantly-recurring columns of an enemy fully treble your numbers, and their efforts were crowned on the evening of the 21st with a victory so complete, that the invaders are driven disgracefully from the field and made to fly in disorderly rout back to their intrenchments, a distance of over thirty miles.
They left upon the field nearly every piece of their artillery, a large portion of their arms, equipments, baggage, stores, &c., and almost every one of their wounded and dead, amounting, together with the prisoners, to many thousands. And thus the Northern hosts were driven from Virginia.
Soldiers, we congratulate you on an event which insures the liberty of our country. We congratulate every man of you whose glorious privilege it was to participate in this triumph of courage and truth—to fight in the battle of Manassas. You have created an epoch in the history of liberty, and unborn nations will call you blessed. Continue this noble devotion, looking always to the protection of a just God, and before the time grows much older we will be hailed as the deliverers of a nation of ten millions of people.
Comrades, our brothers who have fallen have earned undying renown upon earth, and their blood, shed in our holy cause, is a precious and acceptable sacrifice to the Father of Truth and of Eight. Their graves are beside the tomb of Washington 5 their spirits have joined with his in eternal communion. We will hold fast to the soil in which the dust of Washington is thus mingled with the dust of our brothers. We will transmit this land free to our children, or we will fall into the fresh graves of our brothers in arms. We drop one tear on their laurels and move forward to avenge them.
Soldiers, we congratulate you on a glorious, triumphant, and complete victory, and we thank you for doing your whole duty in the service of your country.

﻿Chap. IX.] NEW MARKET BRIDGE AND BACK RIVER ROAD, VA. 575 JULY 19, 1861.—Affair near New Market Bridge, Va.
Report of Col. Robert Johnston, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters of Cavalry,
Cocldetown, Fa., July 19, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that a volunteer scout, consisting of Private W. Causey, Old Dominion Dragoons; Colonel Sandidge and son, and Mr. Ferrett, of Louisiana, attached to the Charles City Cavalry, returned to my camp this morning, bringing in as prisoners Capt. E. W. Jenkins and Lieut. R. M. Shurtleff, both of the Naval Brigade.
They met near the New Market Bridge a party of six, supposed to have been annoying our pickets; killed one, who the prisoners state was Major Rawlings; wounded the two brought in, and put the rest to flight. Upon the person of one was found, upon examination, a lot of ammunition, identified as the property of a member of my command. They were met by the surgeon of this post and every attention given. The captain is very seriously wounded, the lieutenant only slightly, and will be sent to you to-morrow. Two guns taken from them are in my possession.
I am, sir, verv respectfully, your obedient servant,
RO. JOHNSTON,
Colonel, Commanding.

JULY 19, 1861.—Affair on the Back River Road, Va.
Report of Col. Robert Johnston, 0. 8. Army.
Headquarters of Cavalry,
Cocldetown j Fa., July 20,1861.
Major : I regret to have to report the loss of the horses of the picket on the Back River road last evening just before the time for the picket to fall back to the position assigned it for the night. No blame is to be attached to the private in charge or to any person connected with it. This picket has orders to dismount, and, leaving their horses, to take a position in advance of them during the day. The position occupied by them can be approached to within a short distance through the woods between the Back River and the Sawyer Swamp road. It was in this way that the horses were taken. A large party of the enemy came through the woods from a point on Sawyer Swamp road to within a short distance of where the picket was stationed, and then approached the horses by file from the rear under cover of a ditch brush fence and got over the fence just where the horses were. Fortunately they were seen by our picket as they cleared the fence, who were thus enabled to make their escape by the river side. Had they attempted to escape on the other side in the direction of the woods they would have been taken, as the enemy seemed to have expected their escape on that side and searched for them there. *
The enemy were in force, probably 300 strong, and came out to avenge the death of Captain Jenkins, who they supposed had been killed yesterday. They visited Dr. Semple’s farm, but committed no depredations,

and have returned. I have felt constrained to draw the picket back to near Dr. Semple’s, whence an occasional vedette will move down the road. The enemy is well provided with guides, and can learn the road as well as we can. If this picket were cut off an infantry force could cross the Bethel Creek on the mill-dam below the bridge, and come direct to my camp through the woods without being discovered. I sent out two small parties last night, Captain Curtis with thirty infantry to near Lee’s store, and a detachment of thirty dragoons to light campfires in the woods at Bethel and to lie in ambush below on the Sawyer Swamp road. As soon as I can I should like to confer with the general in relation to my command.

JULY 24, 1861.—Operations on Back River, Va.
Report of Col. Robert Johnston, C. 8. Army.
Headquabtebs Fobces fbom Cockletown,
Half-Way House, Va., July 25,1861.
Majob : I have the honor to report that I returned to this point yesterday, after occupying Bethel for a few hours, the Messex picket having reported that the enemy had landed in force from nine barges in their vicinity. These barges were towed by two armed steam-tugs under way at this point. I was informed that a detachment of the enemy’s forces were occupying a position almost two miles from their boats. Judging them to be in large force, and thinking that perhaps the movement might be a combined one with a party from Newport News or Hampton, I established my headquarters at this point and ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Camming to join me here, and detached Lieutenant-Colonel Hood, with two guns, a squadron of cavalry, and Colonel Bight-or’s battalion, and five companies of Colonel Cumming’s regiment, under Captain Hardee, to look out [for] this party.
Colonel Hood returned this morning. He found that the enemy had burnt a number of vessels and towed out others, one known to be the property of Mr. Booker, which was loaded with Mr. Booker’s effects and was to have dropped down the river last night. The enemy left before dark, and had succeeded in getting out of the river, except one steam-tug, which got aground before dusk and was detained until the high tide, but got out before he could fire on it.
I strengthened my picket at Messex Point and established one near New Market Bridge. This picket was not permitted to take its position. It was driven beyond its horses by a strong picket of the enemy, but returned at 12 o’clock and brought off its horses, which had not been discovered by the enemy.
Owing to the fatigue my soldiers had undergone and the difficulties occasioned by the quartermaster’s and commissary departments, I have remained in camp here during the day with my infantry and artillery, the cavalry being at Bartlett’s to obtain forage. I expect to occupy Bethel, where I shall endeavor to secure the negroes in the lower part of the peninsula and to carry out your instructions in relation to this

position. When this is completed, unless otherwise directed, I expect to occupy Harrod’s and Young’s Mills, from which points I can best with safety operate against marauding parties.

Hon. Simon Cameron :
Dear Sir : I have received from our agent at Baltimore the following:
Baltimore, April 16, 1861.
Mr. Wm. Crawford :
Dear Sir : Is it true as stated that an attempt will he made to pass the volunteers from New York intended to war upon the South over your road to-day? It is imj)or-tant that we have an explicit understanding on the subject.
Your friend,
GEO. P. KANE.

S. M. Felton, Esq.:
Dear Sir : The above is from our marshal of police. I have replied that I have no knowledge of anything of the kind. It is rumored that the marshal has issued orders to his force not to permit any forces to pass through the city.
Yours, truly,
WM. CRAWFORD.
I send you the foregoing, thinking it important yon should know of the communication, in order that you may ascertain the facts.
Yours, truly,

Washington, April 18,1861.
To his Excellency Thos. H. Hicks, Governor of Maryland:
Sir : The President is informed that threats are made, and measures taken, by unlawful combinations of misguided citizens of Maryland to prevent by force the transit of United States troops across Maryland, on their way, pursuant to orders, to the defense of this capital. The information is from such sources and in such shape that the President thinks it his duty to make it known to you, so that all loyal and patriotic citizens of your State may be warned in time, and that you may be prepared to take immediate and effective measures against it.
Such an attempt could have only the most deplorable consequences; and it would be as agreeable to the President as it would be to yourself that it should be prevented or overcome by the loyal authorities and citizens of Maryland, rather than averted by any other means.
I am, very respectfully, yours, &c.,
SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.

April 18, 1861. Major Clark, Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Baltimore ;
Two or three Massachusetts regiments may reach Baltimore in the next three days, and one New York regiment. Hasten the latter to this place. One of the Massachusetts regiments must be turned off to Harper’s Ferry, unless it be known that the establishment has been captured. If a fourth Massachusetts regiment by mistake arrive at Baltimore by rail instead of Fort Monroe by sea, send it down the bay to that fort.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Columbus, Ohio, April 18, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War :
We had made arrangements with the Baltimore and Ohio Road to transport troops, and Mr. Garrett was anxious to take them until late last night, when he declined, on the alleged ground that the Washington Branch will employ all his empty cars in transportation of troops.
This looks ominous. We hope Harper’s Ferry is safe.
W. DENNISON, Governor of Ohio.
Philadelphia, April 19,1861.
Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
We are informed here that the troops sent last night have been .stopped at Baltimore, and that it is impracticable to send more through that city. Shall we send them by steamer to Annapolis ?

Philadelphia, Pa., April 19,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : Having arrived at Philadelphia, we are informed by the Baltimore road that Governor Hicks states that no troops can pass through Baltimore City; in fact, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad refuse to transfer. We will wait for instructions.

To S. M. Felton :
Washington, April 19,1861.
Governor Hicks has neither right nor authority to stop troops coming to Washington.
Send them on prepared to fight their way through, if necessary.
