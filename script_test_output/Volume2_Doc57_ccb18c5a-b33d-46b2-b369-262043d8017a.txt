Reports of Col. Daniel Buggies, commanding Department of Fredericksburg.
Headquarters Department of Fredericksburg,
Fredericksburg, Va., May 30 [?], 1861.
Sir: I have the honor to report that two small steamers of the enemy attacked the Aquia Greek Eailroad battery last evening about sunset, and fired some fourteen shot and shell. Our battery returned the fire with twelve shot and shell. The contest terminated about 9 o’clock, when the enemy departed. One man was slightly wounded in the hand by the fragments of a shell. I prepared to cover our front with my whole force, comprising the Tennessee Eegiment and a battalion of volunteers, assembled at Camp Mercer, and proceeded, with some seven hundred men, to the point attacked, having in view sending back the train for the remaining five hundred. The conflict having terminated before we reached the scene of action, I returned with the forces above specified, reaching this town about 5 a. m. The spirit and conduct of the troops have been admirable in connection with this little affair. Much agitation prevails along the Potomac coast from apprehension that the enemy will land, in large and small numbers, to devastate and plunder. I respectfully recommend that guns of heavy caliber be furnished (say 12s, 18s, and 32s), for use at various points on the coast for surprising and harassing the enemy.
Yery respectfully, your obedient servant,
DANIEL EUGGLES,
Colonel, Provisional Army, Commanding Forces.

Sir : The report has arrived this moment that five of the enemy’s steamers, with two transport ships, one of which is of considerable size, had appeared off Aquia Creek battery, with the evident intention of attacking it. When the train left (11 a. in.), soon after, heavy firing was heard from that point. I am in want of at least one thousand well-disciplined volunteers as soon as it is possible to send them. Twenty thousand musket-rifle caps are absolutely necessary for the use of troops with percussion arms. I go to the battery at once. Communicate with Major Barton, acting assistant adjutant general, to this office.

Sir : The enemy attacked the naval battery at Aquia Creek yesterday about 10 a. m. The enemy had three war steamers and some small

transports, not containing, however, many troops. They had some long boats or launches ; but, so far as observed, made no preparation for lauding. The fire on both sides was skillfully directed, and continued up to about 1 p. m., when the steamers hauled off, and, it is supposed, in a partially disabled condition. I took all the available forces, comprising the four companies of infantry and one of cavalry, from this vicinity, and Colonel Bate’s Tennessee (Walker) Legion with me, reaching the Potomac soon after the firing ceased. The conduct of the troops in the batteries—that of Captain Walker, with his 6-pounder rifle-guns, having been brought early into the action—is represented as having been admirable, including the covering and protecting force on the field. I have transferred the Tennessee (Walker) Legion to Brooke’s Station, where I have re-established Camp Jackson. From that point lateral movements may be easily made to cross the coasts, and forward movements to cover the batteries, with great facility.
The ladies are now making tents, cartridges, and belts, and I hope soon to have our forces sheltered and better equipped. I left Aquia Creek late last evening, and return there this morning.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
DANIEL EUGGLES,

Sir: I have the honor to state, for the information of the commanding general, that four of the enemy’s armed steamers commenced firing on our batteries at Aquia Creek yesterday morning, at about 9 o’clock, and continued until about 4 p. m. On our side nobody was hurt and no material damage was done to our batteries. The enemy gave no indications of an intention to land, but hauled off to the Maryland shore at the close of the action. This demonstration, thus persevered in, is made, I doubt not, in view of collateral action and movements. I arrived on the field about midday, and returned to this place at night. The batteries were commanded by Captain Lynch and other naval officers. The conduct of my entire force, under the command of Colonel Bate, of the Walker Legion, until my arrival on the field, was admirable throughout the day. The enemy is represented to have thrown five hundred and ninety-seven shots and shells, and our battery, under Captain Lynch, seventy-five.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S.—The colors were cut away from one of the enemy’s ships by a shot from our battery.

batteries at Aquia Creek, and that the steamer Pawnee only has been lying off at that point, repairing damages, and in communication with various steamers and other vessels passing up and down the Potomac. It has just been reported to me, however, that after I left the creek yesterday, and at about 9 o’clock at night, two or more war steamers, with a vessel in tow, came down the Potomac and joined the Pawnee. Thus far I have no report of the renewal of the attack this morning. It is my intention to throw the Arkansas regiment, Colonel Fagan’s, now at Camp Jackson, upon the Potomac coast, near Chopawamsic, as soon as it is in condition to do so.
I am much in want of an effective battery of 24-pounder howitzers for service, in conjunction with that force, to prevent the enemy from landing. The Fredericksburg Artillery, of 6-pounders, will be wanted at Aquia Creek to prevent landing there, if an attack is made. The movements of the enemy indicate that an attempt will soon be made in force to land at, or in the vicinity of, Mathias Point in a brief period of time. I respectfully recommend that that point be covered by a good regiment of infantry, with a good battery of field-guns, until measures are taken to establish a good and sufficient battery at that point to command the channel, for the establishment of which I respectfully renew my former recommendation. Under authority given me, I have fabricated here carriages for a battery of 6-pounder guns, and respectfully request that guns may be furnished me without delay for use in the field.
Since it has become impracticable to establish a battery at the White House to command the Potomac, I respectfully recommend that a competent engineer be sent me to examine the vicinity of Evansport with that view, and, if found suitable, that a battery may be established there with as little delay as is practicable. That point is important in connection with the position at Manassas Junction, as well as the avenues of approach from the Potomac to this town.

DANIEL EUGGLES, Provisional Army, Commanding Forces.
