No. 3.
—Maj. Ro. M. Mayo, C. S. Army.
Ho. 1.
Report of Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters, Brooke’s Station, Ya., June 28, 1861.
General : Herewith you will please find the report of Colonel Ruggles of an affair at Mathias Point. There are now there fifteen companies of volunteers, and I have ordered a section of Walker’s battery to re-enforce them. This force I think sufficient to prevent a landing for the purpose of holding the point. If it be your design to erect a battery there to command the river, I think instructions to that effect should be given immediately, and another regiment ordered to report to me for its defense after construction.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
T. H. HOLMES, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
General R. E. Lee, Commanding.
