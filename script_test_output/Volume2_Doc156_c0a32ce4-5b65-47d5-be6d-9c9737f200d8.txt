Major-General Patterson, TJ. 8. Army, Charlestown, Va.;

E. D. TOWNSEND,
Assistant Adjutant- General.
Harper’s Ferry, July 21,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend :
I came here to-day. Yesterday Winchester and this county were abandoned by all armed parties. Johnston left for Millwood, to operate on McDowell’s right and to turn through Loudoun upon me. I could not follow. The only active troops I have are the Second Cavalry, Doubleday’s, Perkins’, Ehode Island Battery, Second Massachusetts, Third Wisconsin (not fully equipped), Fourth Connecticut at Hagerstown, &c., Twelfth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth New York. All others are barefooted. Their term expires in a few days, and I am required by General Orders, No. —, to send them home. Five regiments have gone; four go to-morrow, and so on. The Third Wisconsin will be placed temporarily on the canal, which parties have lately attempted to destroy, and will remain till I am provided with troops for active service. I have ordered the hospital depot, &c., at Hagerstown to be transferred to this place, but if you order me to you, will countermand the order. A large force will be required to defend this place against an active foe. I hear nothing of the Pennsylvania Eeserves. Shall I join you with all my effective force, abandoning this place, sending home the three months’ men, and my supplies to Washington ?
E. PATTEBSON,
Major-General', Commanding.
Headquarters, July 22,1861—1.30 a. in. General Banks, Baltimore, Md. :
Proceed to Harper’s Ferry and relieve General Patterson, turning over your present command to General Dix.

Harper’s Ferry, July 23,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters Army:
My train is crossing the river, and I will go to join with all my available force unless I hear from you by immediate return dispatch.
E. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Washington, July 23,1861—4.15 p. m. To General Patterson, Harper's Ferry, Va.:
Your force is not wanted here. It is expected you will hold Harper’s Ferry unless threatened by a force well ascertained to be competent to expel you.	WINFIELD SCOTT.
Washington, July 23,1861—11.30 p. m.
Major-General Banks,
U. 8. Army, Commanding, &c., Harpers Ferry:
I deem it useful, perhaps highly important, to hold Harper’s Ferry. It will probably soon be attacked, but not, I hope, before I shall have sent you adequate re-enforcements. A Connecticut regiment may soon be expected by you. Others shall to-morrow be ordered to follow.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Washington, July 23,1861—11.30 p. m. Major-General Banks, Harper's Ferry:
The following information has just been received from A. N. Rankin, editor of Rep. and Transcript:
There are nine 32-pounders, four 44-pounders, and two 6-pounders, and 1,000 stand of arms at Winchester, with but 500 men, raw militia, to guard the same. There are also about 1,000 tents and a very large amount of powder, balls, and shell.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Harper’s Ferry, Va., July 23,1861. Brevet Major-General Cadwalader, Hagerstown, Md.:
My Dear General : I inclose an army order cut from a newspaper, which contains the only information on the subject which has reached these headquarters.* It is doubtless genuine, and under these circumstances neither you nor I can make any movement towards Washington without being liable to the imputation of seeking service or thrusting ourselves upon the administration.
I have therefore to request that you will consider the order whfbh you sent to Hagerstown rescinded.
Brigadier-General Williams will leave here to-morrow with the Tenth Regiment, and is ordered to take command of any troops he may find at Hagerstown and conduct them to Harrisburg.
I will follow you as soon as relieved.
With great regard, very sincerely, yours,
R. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.

Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Harpers Ferry, Va,, July 24, 1861—3 p. in.
Col. E. D. Townsend :
While awaiting the arrival of General Banks, who is addressed as commanding here, I have carefully considered the telegram of 11.30 p. in. of 23d from the General-in-Chief to him, and the course to be followed. Winchester is now occupied by about three thousand men. It is true they are militia; more in number than the effective men at my disposal. Three-years7 men only reliable. A proper force to take it now would strip the supplies here and at Sandy Hook of reliable protection. I consider the occupation of Harper's Ferry with the small force here as hazardous, and as untenable against a formidable force with less than 20,000 men. The number now here is too small to hold Harper’s Ferry, and too large to retreat with if forced to evacuate. No re-enforcements heard of, and regiments going off at the rate of two to four per day.
R. PATTERSON,
Major- General, Commanding.
Hagerstown, July 25, 1861.
Col. F. J. Porter,
Asst Adjt. Gen,, Hdqrs. Department of Pennsylvania ;
Sir : I am possessed of reliable information that a messenger left this place for Baltimore with a dispatch from the Confederate Army to the rebels in Baltimore, to the effect that their generals were determined to make a dash at some point, and that Beauregard was for attacking Washington and General Lee was for Baltimore, going through this State at this point, and this plan was adopted. This messenger stated that there would be hell to pay in this place in less than six days, and that Baltimore would be in their hands without the slightest doubt.
This messenger left here on the night of the 23d, and stated that his dispatch was from Governor Pratt, of this place.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
LEVI WOODHOUSE,
Colonel Commanding Fourth Regiment Connecticut Volunteers.
