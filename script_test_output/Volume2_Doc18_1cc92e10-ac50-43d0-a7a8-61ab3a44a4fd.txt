Alexandria. I report, in this connection, that I know the fact that Colonel Taylor received that letter of instruction upon the arrival of the messenger at Alexandria, on the 5th instant, by the regular train from this place on the morning of that day. Mr. F. G. Skinner, now hero, and who was on the 5th instant in Alexandria, is my authority for the above statement ; and Mr. Skinner tells me that he saw that letter of instruction in the hands of Colonel Taylor, and discussed with him the purport of it prior to the movement of the troops out of Alexandria on the afternoon or evening of that day (yesterday). I this day sent by telegraph to the commanding general-in-chief a full abstract of the only letter or communication I have received from Colonel Taylor alluding to or explaining the movement of the troops out of Alexandria. Nor have I been able, from any other source, except that furnished me by the arrival of Mr. Skiuner, direct from Alexandria, by the train of this morning, to learn the cause of that movement; and, so far as I am informed up to this moment, there was no proper or justifiable cause whatsoever for any such movement. After waiting for further intelligence and receiving none, and duly considering and weighing all the circumstances and bearing of that movement with the information before me, I have ordered the return of the troops, as communicated by telegram, a duplicate of which has just been transmitted to the general-in-chief.
Very respectfully, your most obedient,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE, Brigadier-General, Commanding Potomac Department.

Culpeper Court-House, Ya., May 5,1861. Colonel Taylor, Commanding at Alexandria, Ya.;
Sir : You will not move the troops out of Alexandria unless pressed by overwhelming and irresistible numbers; and even then you should retire to Manassas Junction, to hold that point, assist in obstructing and breaking up the road between that point and Alexandria, harassing the enemy should he attempt to use the road, and not retire farther in the interior unless overpowered and forced, as a last extremity, to so retire. You will use your cavalry and infantry in this connection, and, under these orders, which I have full authority from headquarters at Bich-mond for giving to you, keep up your communications with the various parts in your rear, so as to call every resource to your aid and support in making a gallant and fighting retreat, should you be forced to it, and can stand at all without danger of uselessly sacrificing your command.

Culpeper Court-House, Va., May 7, 1861—6.45 a. m. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General:
Sir : After writing you last night, and having previously ascertained during the day and up to 10 o’clock p. m. last night that I could not communicate with the command of Colonel Taylor after Colonel Terrett left Alexandria, to go to him at Springfield, because, after several attempts, through the telegraph operator at Alexandria, to send a dispatch through various persons, none of whom could be found in Alexandria, and when the operator finally advised me that not one single man connected with the military had been left to speak to me through the wires, I immediately determined to send one of my aides, Giles B. Cooke, to put myself in communication with Colonels Taylor and Terrett; and, accordingly, Mr. Cooke left me at 2 o’clock last night, by an extra train, bearing copies of the telegrams which I had failed to put through to Colonel Terrett, because of his departure from Alexandria for Spring-field, no one having been left at Alexandria in whom I could confide and through whom 1 might have transmitted it; and bearing also a letter of instructions sent by me to Colonel Terrett, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. Mr. Cooke will proceed to Alexandria with dispatch, after having communicated with Colonel Terrett, and will once more enable me to have one person at least in Alexandria with whom I can converse through the wires. He is instructed to give me information upon which I can rely the moment of his arrival at Alexandria.
Yery respectfully,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Headquarters Potomac Department.
Colonel Terrett,
Commanding Troops at or near Alexandria, Va.:
Sir : I have endeavored up to this moment to communicate with you by telegraph, through Alexandria, and learn through the operator there that not one single military man has been left at that end of the wire. I send Mr. Cooke, my second aide, by extra train, to put me in communication with you and your command, and to convey to you the substance of telegrams which have been stopped in Alexandria in the hands of the operator. By these you will find that I am not informed of any circumstance whatsoever that could have furnished just and sufficient cause, or any cause at all, for the movement of the troops out of Alexandria; and, as all my orders from headquarters, and all my own purposes in accordance therewith, and my late order to Colonel Taylor, enjoined the holding of the troops in Alexandria until absolutely driven out by force of arms, and even then to retire fighting, if possible without endangering the unneccessary destruction of your force, I must therefore now order that the troops return to Alexandria, if it be practicable, and if any movement of the enemy has taken place unknown to me, and which

would render that return impracticable and really dangerous, and if, as I believe, no such movement has taken place, return the troops to the position they occupied with as little delay as possible. If, however, there has been any new and threatening movement by the enemy unknown to me, and which in your judgment may render it impracticable or imprudent to return to Alexandria, communicate the fact to me, and, in the mean time, exercise a sound discretion as to' your acting.

Col. P. St. George Cocke, Commanding Potomac Division:
Colonel : I am instructed by Major-General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 6th instant, with accompanying papers, in relation to the evacuation of Alexandria, asking whether you shall arrest Colonel Taylor, Virginia Volunteers. The general commanding directs that you will not arrest Colonel Taylor, but require from him an explanation.
Respectfully, &c.,

Report of Lieut. Col. A. 8. Taylor, Va. Vols., transmitted by General Cocke.
Headquarters Potomac Department,
Culpeper Court-Souse, Va., May 13, 1861. Major-General Lee, Commander-in-Chief:
Sir : I have the honor to transmit herewith the reply of Col. A. S. Taylor to my call on him, at your suggestion, for a statement of the causes and reasons which induced him to evacuate the post of Alexandria on Sunday, May 5, as reported by me to headquarters some time since.
Very respectfully, your most obedient,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE,
Commanding Potomac Department.

Culpeper Court-House, Va., May 9,1861.
Sir : I have just received your communication of this date, calling upon me, by order of the general-in-chief, to give in writing my “reasons 77 and u causes” why I retired from Alexandria with the troops under my command.
In the first place, because of the inefficient condition of a large proportion of the trpops and my exposed and indefensible position. Under my command there were two companies of raw Irish recruits, numbering about one hundred and twenty privates in both, armed with the altered flint-lock muskets of 1818, and without cartridges or caps; Captain Devaughn’s company (Mount Vernon Guards), eighty-six privates,

armed with the new musket—fifty-two men without accouterments and fifteen without arms, and very little ammunition ; Captain Simpson’s company of rifles, numbering in all fifty-three, and well armed with the minie rifle, and about nine rounds of ammunition complete; Captain Herbert’s company of rifles, numbering eighty-five, rank and file, armed with the minie rifle, and with an average of five rounds of cartridges and four of caps 5 Captain Ball’s company of cavalry, numbering forty privates, armed with carbines and sabers, and with a very limited amount of ammunition$ Captain Powell’s company of cavalry, numbering about thirty, and twenty-two horses, no arms or equipments of any kind except a few of Colt’s revolvers.
In the second place, the men were becoming almost useless from home influences. All but Captain Simpson’s company belonged to Alexandria (and were necessarily scattered over the city), and it would have been impossible to have assembled the command at any particular point in time to have defended itself with the slightest possibility of success, or even to have made anything but a disastrous and demoralizing retreat in the face of an enemy.
In the third place, I was possessed of, apparently, such reliable information that the Government at Washington would occupy Alexandria on the 6th or 7th instant, and knowing that a large force was being concentrated at Fort Washington and that two steamers were anchored off Mount Yernon, I was induced to suppose that from that point an attempt would be made, in concert with a force from Washington City, to hem in my small and inefficient command, and thereby the services of good material be lost to my State and our cause.
I inclose herewith an order,* which was obtained secretly by Mr. J. D. Hutton, who was formerly employed in the War Department, and which shows the intention of the Federal Government as to Alexandria. The foregoing are my reasons and the causes for retiring to Springfield, and, in addition to which, from that position I could the more successfully assist in breaking up and destroying the road.
Very respectfully,
A. S. TAYLOR,
Lieutenant-Colonel, Virginia Volunteers.
Col. P. St. Georg® Cocke,
Commanding Potomac Department of Virginia Volunteers.
MAY 9,1861.—Exchange of shots between the United States steamer Yankee and the batteries at Gloucester Point, Va.
Report of Bvt. Col. Justin DimicTc, Second U. S. Artillery.
Headquarters Fort Monroe, Ya., May 10,1861.
Colonel : I have been informed by Flag Officer Pendergrast that on the 7th instant a battery of three guns was discovered at Gloucester Point, on the York River, nearly opposite Yorktown. One of the small steamers attached to the Home Squadron (the Yankee) exchanged several shots with it yesterday, but as there was one 8-inch gun in the battery and those of the steamer were of much shorter range her commander hauled off.
With regard to the force necessary here, the portions of the surrounding country which should be occupied, and the defenses erected for the

protection of the fort, the commanding general and General Totten are much better able to judge than myself. It appears to me, however, that the sand hills, some two thousand yards from the fort, should be occupied and a battery built there. To do this will require a larger force than I have at my disposal. Colonel De Bussy suggests that a battery should be erected near the picket bridge, on the Hampton side. In the vicinity is a spring (apparently inexhaustible) of fine water, which may be of the highest importance, though with the present command I entertain no apprehension of a scarcity of water, as, in addition to the supply in the fort, there is a large quantity at the hotel.
The mail-boat from Baltimore was allowed to land the mails here yesterday, and the mail for Norfolk sent there in the steamer William Sel-den. She has not, however, returned, and I presume has been seized.
I inclose herewith a copy of a letter which was yesterday transmitted by mail, and will add that I cannot urge too strongly the necessity of immediately authorizing the repairing of the wharves and of sending the laborers asked for.
