No. 1.
Report of Maj. J. B. Cary, Virginia Artillery.
Hampton, Ya., May 23,1861.
Sin: I have the honor to inform you that quite a full regiment of the enemy, estimated, by count of companies, to contain eight hundred men, under command of Colonel Phelps, made a demonstration against this place this afternoon, between 4 and 5 o’clock, which seemed at first to wear a very ugly aspect, but which, happily, resulted in no damage, save the alarm of our women and children and the excitement of our citizens.
I had nearly perfected my arrangements for the defense indicated in your instructions, by making preparations for the destruction of all the bridges leading across the main tributary of Back River as well as the Hampton Bridge. Unfortunately, the absence during the day of the party chosen for the firing of the latter, and the consequent failure to have the combustibles on the spot, delayed operations so far that the enemy were in sight before the fire could be started, though it would have made sufficient progress, I think, to have arrested their entrance into the town. At this stage, meeting with Lieutenant Cutshaw, at his suggestion I sent him forward as my aid to demand of the colonel the intent of his approach with so large a body of men, and being assured that he came with no hostile purpose, but simply, as he said, by order of General Butler, to reconnoiter, and having received the subsequent assurance from him in person that he would make no attack upon our people nor injure their property in any way unless he himself was molested, and coinciding in your view that defense at this point was useless and hopeless, I aided him in extinguishing the fire, and gave tjie

assurance that he should not be fired upon by the volunteer force under my command (which, by the way, had by that time nearly retreated to the line of defense which I intended to occupy and where I designed making the first resistance). I also urged our citizens to abstain from any attack, which counsel, I am pleased to say, prevailed with them. The entire body then marched into the town as far as the intersection of our main streets, halted for a short while, and then returned. I have since learned that this body was supported by about three hundred men, with a battery of six brass pieces, and that there was a still further reserve on the march. But this latter information I do not consider so reliable. I have only to add, in this connection, that the force at my command, as estimated by information since derived from the several captains, was only one hundred and thirty men on the approach of the enemy. This demonstration, in my judgment, indicates the propriety of removing the camp farther from Hampton than the point already agreed upon. Our people have responded very indifferently to the call for aid in erecting intrenchments at the points indicated by you, and the proposed location of the camp is distinctly visible from the dome of the Chesapeake Female College, if not from the ramparts of the fort, and I do not doubt but that the erection of the first tent would be the signal for another such demonstration. Under this conviction I shall delay operations on the camp until I receive your reply, though nearly all the timber is at hand, and operations would have commenced in the morning. The order directing the removal of the cannon had been carried into execution, and they were beyond the reach of seizure.
I make no comments, restricting myself to a brief statement, merely remarking that Lieutenant Cutshaw, who was present most of the time, will be at the Grove Wharf to-morrow, and can give detailed information on all points not sufficiently elucidated. As soon as they left I sent a dispatch to the battalion to return in order to the town for the discharge of their usual duties.
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. B. CARY,
Major Artillery, Virginia Volunteers.
