General Joseph E. Johnston,
Commanding, cfee., Harper’s Ferry, Va. :
General : I received, on my return from Manassas Junction, your communications of the 26th and 28th ultimo, in reference to your position at Harper’s Ferry. The difficulties which surround it have been felt from the beginning of its occupation, and I am aware of the obstacles to its maintenance with your present force. Every effort has been made to remove them, and will be continued, but with similar necessities pressing on every side you need not be informed of the difficulty of providing against them. The arrangements made ard positions taken by the troops under your command are judicious, and it is hoped that sufficient re-enforcements can be sent you to enable you to occupy your present point in force and carry out the plan of defense indicated in your communications. Great reliance is placed on your good judgment, the skill of your officers, and the ardor of your troops, and should you be attacked by a force which you may be unable to resist at all points and to keep beyond the frontier, you must move out of your position and destroy all facilities for the approach or shelter of an enemy. Concentrate your troops, and contest his approach step by step into the interior.
With a view of making your column movable, the Quartermaster’s Department was ordered, some weeks ago, to provide all the wagons they could, and I was informed that agents were sent to the country east and west of the Blue Bidge for the purpose. The little use for wagons, save for farming purposes, makes their collection difficult; but by the efforts of the Quartermaster’s Department and the means you have taken it is hoped you may be provided.
Ammunition has been sent to you. The supply was necessarily limited, in consequence of the calls from other points. Can you make arrangements to provide an auxiliary amount for your command %
I have informed you of the military arrangements east of the Blue Bidge. A large force is now collecting in front of Alexandria, and General Beauregard has been sent to command it. Its presence will make the enemy cautious in approaching your rear south of the Potomac, and in that event I hope you will receive timely intelligence, through the light troops under Colonel Ewell, extending to the Leesburg road. Should such a movement be made, as was suggested in a previous letter, you are expected to use your discretion as to the best mode of meeting it.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
B. E. LEE, General, Commanding.

General : In answer to your letter of the 31st ultimo, received by Col. H. A. Edmundson, I have to state that, since my letter to you of this morning, I have directed all the available companies at Staunton to proceed to Harper’s Ferry and to report to you for duty. The First 57 R R—VOL II

Tennessee Regiment, now at this place, Colonel _ Turney, has also been directed to report to you as soon as practicable. With this re-enforcement, and such as you may be able to obtain from the valley, you may probably hold your position and prevent the passage of the Potomac by hostile troops until further troops can reach you.* I think that no troops from Ohio have yet reached Grafton, as a special messenger from Colonel Porterfield reports the contrary, and that certain bridges on the Parkersburg road had been burned. Some little time must therefore elapse, in all probability, before a movement can be made against you from that direction. Information of the movements of troops in that direction might be obtained from friends in that region. Should you, however, be opposed by a force too large to resist, I can only repeat what is contained in my letter of this morning, viz, destroy everything that cannot be removed which may be of advantage to the enemy. Deprive them of the use of the railroad, take the field, and endeavor to arrest their advance up the valley.
I am, general, with great respect, your obedient servant,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.

Col. Daniel Ruggles, Commanding, (fee., Fredericksburg, Va. :
Sir : Your telegraphic dispatch of yesterday to the governor of the State, for ammunition for Captain Waiker’s battery, was referred to the General Commanding, and the Ordnance Department has been instructed to supply it as far as practicable. The General regrets to have to remind an officer of your experience of the propriety of adhering to the usages of the military service in relation to official communications. Your application for ammunition should have been sent for his action. He feels constrained to call your attention also to the necessity of economizing the ammunition issued to the troops. The straitened means of the State are taxed to the last degree to provide for the first wants of the troops in this respect. As understood by him, the recent exchange of shots between your batteries on the Potomac and the enemy’s vessels could have no other result than to waste ammunition and to expose our condition and the strength of the batteries, which was probably the object of his visit.
I am, sir, very respectfully,
R. S. GARNETT,
Adjutant-General.
Headquarters, Harper’s Ferry, Fa., June 1, 1861. Colonel Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Colonel : I respectfully transmit herewith Colonel Allen’s last report, and a paper in relation to affairs near Grafton, for the information of the General Commanding-in-Chief.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier-General, C. $. Army.
