No. 3.
Report of Col. John C. Vaughn, Third Tennessee Infantry.
Headquarters Third Tennessee Reghment,
Colonel Hill’s Brigade, C. S. Army,
June 19,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that on yesterday, at 8 p. m., in pursuance to your orders, I took two companies of the Thirteenth Virginia Volunteers, C.S. Army, commanded by Captains Crittenden and White; also two companies of Third Tennessee Volunteers, C. S. Army, commanded by Captains Liflard and Mathes, and advanced eighteen miles west to the line of the enemy, upon the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and found them posted in some strength, with two pieces of artillery, on the north bank of the Potomac, at the twenty-first bridge on said road. The enemy had no pickets posted.
At 5 a. in., after reconnoitering,! gave the order to charge the enemy, which command, I beg leave to say, wras gallantly executed and in good order, but with great enthusiasm. As we appeared in sight, at a distance of 400 yards, the enemy broke and fled in all directions, firing as they ran only a few random shots, one of which, however, I regret to say, entered the arm of Private Smith, of Captain Lillard’s company, which was in advance, wounding him slightly. The enemy did not wait to fire their artillery, which we captured, consisting of two loaded guns, both of which, however, were spiked by the enemy before they fled.
From the best information, their number was between 200 and 300. I do not know the loss of the enemy, but several were seen to fall. We did not take any prisoners, owing to the start the enemy got and to our having left in the rear all the horses belonging to my command.
I then ordered the twenty first railroad bridge to be fired, which was done, and in a few minutes only the piers remained. In further pursu* ance of your order I then retired, bringing with me the two guns.
The enemy’s flag, which I forgot to mention, was captured, and other articles of little value.

I cannot close this report without bringing to your notice the gallant conduct of both officers and men, who were each at their post and burning to engage the enemy, and when the order to charge was given, rushed forward with enthusiasm and waded the river to their waists.
I arrived here this evening, the spirits of my command in nowise flagged.

JUNE 24, 1861.—Affair on the Rappahannock River, Va.
Statement of Mr. Joseph Christian, forwarded by Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder, C. S. Army.
Headquarters, Yorlctown, Va., June 27,1861.
Sir: I have the honor to send a report* made to Colonel Crump, of an abortive attempt to land soldiers from an armed steamer in the Rappahannock River, where the enemy was driven back by our citizens. This morning at sunrise I sent a force of fifteen hundred men to support the cavalry and artillery under Major Hood, operating near and on the Poquosin, to meet any party sent from the enemy’s works and cut it off. I shall join this force to-day. The Rev. Mr. Adams will hand this to the colonel commanding the Virginia forces. I have been extremely indebted to this good and patriotic minister of the Gospel for much assistance. He has lost everything in the cause, and I would like to see him appointed as chaplain to one of the regiments in this department.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General, C. 8. Army.

Urbanna, Va., June 26,1861.
My Dear Sir: I have just received a note, by special messenger, from C. W. Montague, esq., requesting me to furnish to you an accurate account of all the doings of the enemy on the Rappahannock, on Monday evening last. I have taken much pains to gather, from persons who have visited the scene of action and conversed with those who were engaged in it, the following particulars, which you may regard as reliable: About 4 p. m. on Monday, the 24th, a war steamer (the Star of New York, of one thousand tons burden [the Monticello]), came to opposite the house of Mr. James W. Gresham, of Lancaster, situated immediately on the river, about twelve miles below Urbanna, on the Lancaster side. She dispatched to the shore three barges, one a very large one, with a swivel in the bow, and two smaller ones, all filled with armed troops. The large barge grounded on the flats. The other two came ashore with a number of armed men, variously estimated at between thirty and sixty. After reaching the shore some six or eight proceeded up to Mr. Gresham’s house. One of the party accosted Mr. Gresham, and introduced another

of the party. The first named, it seems, was the pilot, who was a captain of a wood vessel, and acquainted with Gresham. He inquired df he had any chickens or lambs for sale. Mr. Gresham replied that u He had a plenty, but not a d—d one for that party.77 He then took the pilot aside and told him they had better be getting away, as there were troops in the neighborhood, and that he did not wish his premises to be the scene of a battle, as his mother was very ill in the house. While they were talking a small company of Lancaster troops, about thirty in number, were seen coming down the road in double-quick time. The alarm was given, and the enemy fled precipitately to their boats, our men firing into them as they shoved off. In their flight they left one of the barges, the men, in great confusion, crowded into the other, and others wading out to the large barge on the flats. In their flight they left, besides the barge, two breech-loading rifles, a revolver, and several swords, with coats, hats, and shoes, thrown away in their hasty retreat. It is confidently asserted that four of the enemy were killed in the boat. Nobody hurt on our side. As soon as our men fired on the enemy the ship opened her guns on Mr. Gresham’s house. She fired fifty-three shot and shell, seventeen of which took effect, damaging the house to the amount of at least $1,000. As in all of our engagements, the preservation of life was most remarkable. One of the balls struck the bed on which Mrs. Gresham was lying ill. She was then removed to an outhouse, and a bomb-shell camb in and exploded in the room without injury to any one.
I have given you, in a very hurried manner, these particulars, which I gather from most reliable sources of information. You will unite with us in contemptuous indignation at the cowardly conduct of these dastardly scoundrels, who, refusing to meet half their number face to face, at a safe distance, in their ship, destroy the property of our citizens.
I hope to be able to visit your camp soon and renew the acquaintance I had the pleasure of having with you last winter.
Hastily and truly, yours,
JOS. CHRISTIAN.

Report of Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters, Brooke’s Station, Va., June 27,1861.
Sir : I have to report that a small party of the enemy landed at Mathias Point on the 25th and burned the house of Dr. Howe. The landing was effected under the guns of the enemy, and doubtless was with a view to discover whether we were erecting a battery there. If it be the wish of the commanding general that a battery should be erected to prevent the free navigation of the river, I respectfully recommend that the neighborhood of Evansport should be preferred to Mathias Point. There is very little difference in the distance of the channel from the shore, and large guns will command either. From Evansport there is a good road to Fredericksburg, which would turn this position, and a good road to Manassas, turning that position; whereas from Mathias Point it would require a long land travel to any vulnerable point. If you can send me two 32-pounders (rifled), or two 8-inch columbiads, I believe I

could stop tlie navigation of the river, if the general commanding thinks it a matter of sufficient importance to justify the expense. I could use the rifled 6-pounders that I now have in Walker’s battery to annoy the enemy’s commerce; but we have not the ammunition to spare.
I am, colonel, very respectfully,

JUNE 26, 1861.—Skirmishes at Erankfort and on Patterson’s Creek, W. Va.
Reports of Col. Lew. Wallace, Eleventh Indiana Infantry.
Grafton, YA., June 28, 1861.
The following dispatch from Colonel Wallace is so gratifying, that I send it to you entire:
Cumberland, June 27.
General McClellan: I have been accustomed to sending my mounted pickets (thirteen men in all) to different posts along the several approaches to Cumberland. Finding it next to impossible to get reliable infoAnation of the enemy yesterday, I united the thirteen, and directed them, if possible, to get to Frankfort, a town midway between this place and Romney, and see if there were rebel troops there. They went within a quarter of a mile of the place, and found it full of cavalry. Returning, they overtook forty-one horsemen, and at once charged them, routing and driving them back more than a mile, killing eight of them, and securing seventeen horses. Corporal Hayes, in command of my men, was desperately wounded with saber cuts and bullets. Taking him back, they halted about an hour, and were then attacked by the enemy, who were re-enforced to about seventy-five men. The attack was so sudden that they abandoned the horses, and crossed to a small island at the mouth of Patterson’s Creek. The charge of the rebels was bold and confident, yet twenty-three fell under the fire of my picket close about and on the island. My fellows were finally driven off, scattering, each man for himselfi and they are all in camp now; one, Corporal Hayes, of Company A, wounded, bur recovering; one, John C. Hollinbeck, of Company B, dead. The last was taken prisoner and brutally murdered.
Three companies went to the ground this morning, and recovered everything belonging to my picket except a few of the horses. The enemy were engaged all night long in boxing up their dead. Two of their officers were killed. They laid out twenty-three on the porch of a neighboring farm house. I will bury my poor fellow to-morrow.
I have positive information, gained to-day, that there are four regiments of rebels in and about Romney, under a Colonel McDonald. What their particular object is I cannot learn. The two Pennsylvania regiments are in encampment at the State line, about nine miles from here, waiting further orders. They have not yet reported to me. They hesitate about invading Maryland.
The report of the skirmish sounds like fiction, but it is not exaggerated. The fight was really one of the most desperate on record, and abounds with instances of wonderful daring and coolness.

Sir: Yesterday a mounted picket of mine of thirteen men, on the road to Erankfort, attacked a company of rebels, forty-one in number,

cliased them a couple of miles, killed eight of them, and captured seventeen horses. Returning from the skirmish, they were in turn attacked by the enemy, re-enforced to seventy-five men, and driven to a kind of island in the neighborhood of the mouth of Patterson’s Greek, where they made a stand and fought till dusk, killing and wounding a large number, when they escaped with the loss of one man, John Hollinbeck, Company B, killed, and Corporal David Hayes, Company A, wounded. The bodies of twenty-three rebels were laid out on the porch of a farm house near the scene of the last engagement. Eight dead bodies (rebels) were left on the railroad track, where the first encounter took place. Hayes is doing well. His hurts are a saber cut on the head and two bullet wounds on the body.
I would simply say of this skirmish, that it was one of the boldest, most desperate, and fortunate on record, abounding with instances on the part of my scouts of rarest coolness, skill, and courage. What makes it most singular is that, for a considerable portion of the time, it was a hand-to-hand fight, carried on with pistol, saber, bayonet, and fist. One man, Louis Farley, killed six rebels; another (Grover) killed three; David Hayes, the wounded corporal, killed two, and received all his wounds while in hot pursuit at the very tails of the rebels’ horses. Among the dead of the enemy are a Captain Blue and two lieutenants.
Hollinbeek, the only man of mine killed, was severely wounded, then taken prisoner, and then brutally murdered by his captors.
All my men bear marks of the contest; some in bruises and cuts, others in bullet-holes through their clothes and equipments.
Very respectfully,
LEW. WALLACE, Colonel Eleventh Regiment Indiana.
