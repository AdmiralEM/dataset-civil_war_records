[Chap. IX.
Headquarters Army, July 25,1861. General McDowell, U. S. A., Arlington:
General Scott says lie hears some of your regiments are too far advanced, particularly between Little Biver turnpike and old Fairfax road, being three to five miles out. Examine carefully that part of your line $ draw the troops nearer in before dark, and strengthen it by approximation.
E. D. TOWNSEND.
Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, July 25,1861. General Dix, Commanding, cfee., Baltimore:
Of the four and a half regiments long-term volunteers, which will be up at Baltimore Friday night, retain two and send hither the remaining two and a half, including Baker’s regiment and a half. I have just learned that the Northern Central Bailroad from Baltimore is without protection, the Pennsylvania troops guarding it being discharged. Look to the security of that road. I ask your attention to Annapolis and the railroad leading to it, as in a possible case we may again be thrown upon that line of communication with the North.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
