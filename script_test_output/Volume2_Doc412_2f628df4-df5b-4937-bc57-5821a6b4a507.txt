Report of Maj. J. J. Bartlett, Twenty seventh New Yorh Infantry.
Hdqrs. Twenty-seventh Reoiment N. Y. V., Camp Anderson, Washington, J). (7., July 23,1861.
Sir : Pursuant to orders, I hereby submit for your consideration a report of the operations of the Twenty-seventh Regiment New York State Volunteers, under command of Col. H. W. Slocum, in the battle at Bull Run, on July 21, 1861.
At precisely 2 o’clock a. m. we formed in column for march in rear of the Marine Corps, commanded by Major Reynolds. After an exhausting march of eight hours, the enemy were discovered to be in force on our front and left. Fifteen minutes after their appearance we were hurried on at double-quick time for the distance of at least one mile, and formed in line of battle by the left flank on the brow of the hill commanding a part of the enemy’s position. Without coming to a halt, we were ordered to charge the enemy by a road leading to the valley beneath us, where they were in numbers strongly positioned in and about a large stone house, with a battery of six mounted howitzers commanding the

approach. The men, though greatly fatigued and exhausted, gallantly attacked and drove the enemy from the house, who retired in disorder behind their battery, leaving a large number of killed and wounded on the held. The battery was next attacked, and after receiving eleven rounds hastily retired, taking up another position about one hundred and fifty yards on our left and front.
We were immediately attacked on our right flank by a large force, who approached by a ravine under cover of a thick growth of bushes, and in the front by about 1,500, who had been driven from their position on the hill commanding our left, and whom we mistook for the Eighth New York Regiment coming to our support. By this mistake we lost many killed and wounded, besides the opportunity of capturing a large number of prisoners. We were now engaged by more than twice our own numbers, and fired upon from concealed positions, and receiving the fire of the battery from its new point of attack. Perceiving the necessity of support, I rallied about 200 of the Eighth New York Regiment on the brow of the hill commanding the enemy, and the colonel withdrew the regiment to the top of the hill in a perfectly exhausted condition, formed, and marched them into the woods for rest.
During our retreat Colonel Slocum received a wound from a musket ball in the right thigh, which rendered it necessary for him to retire from the field, which he did, placing the command in my hands. After remaining half an hour in this position I w as commanded by Captain Averell, aide-de-camp to the colonel commanding, to join a united charge to be made against the enemy’s strongest position by all the regiments not actually engaged at that moment. I marched in four ranks, under fire of the battery commanding the road, to the creek, and filed to the right, under protection of its banks, to await the general assault. Seeing our forces engage the enemy by small detachments, and not in the order in which the attack was commanded to be made, that they were repulsed and driven back in disorder, and believing that no assistance I could render would avail in restraining the troops or stay their flight, I withdrew my command in perfect order to the heights above the stream, and formed in line of battle, facing the enemy, and remained in position until thousands of troops had passed to our rear in flight and confusion. I then, at the urgent solicitation of the line officers, marched to the rear in direction of the retreat, and again formed, by command of General McDowell, in line of battle, facing the enemy, that he might have a nucleus to form the division upon once more. The attempt proving ineffectual, I again marched to the rear, and by his command formed tn line a third time. It being impossible to form in any force upon our lines, I withdrew the regiment from the field, and after a short rest joined the retreating column.
In the retreat to Washington we lost two sergeants, believed to have been cut off* from the regiment at the bridge which was fired upon by the enemy, and many men from exhaustion.
I am happy to report that during the whole day the men of the regiment behaved coolly and gallantly, promptly obeying every order, and that they never once retreated or gave way before the enemy without a positive command.

Major, Commanding.]

Report of Maj. George Sykes, Fourteenth U. $. Infantry, commanding battalion of Regulars.
Headquarters Battalion of Regulars,
Camp Turnbull, Va., July 24, 1861.
Captain : In compliance with yonr circular of the 23d instant, I have the honor to report the following casualties that occurred in my command during the recent battle before Manassas: Three commissioned officers wounded; one assistant surgeon missing; 13 rank and file killed, 17 wounded, 12 of whom are missing; 42 missing. A list is inclosed.* Many of the latter are supposed to have taken the Alexandria road by mistake, and will no doubt rejoin their colors to-day.
This battalion, composed of two companies of Second U. S. Infantry, five companies of the Third IJ. S. Infantry, and one company of the Eighth Infantry, left its camp near Centreville about 3.30 a. m. on the 21st instant, and after a circuitous march of ten or twelve miles arrived on the enemy’s left, and was immediately ordered to support the force under Colonel Burnside, which was suffering from a severe fire in its front. Our line was rapidly formed, opening fire, and a column under Colonel Heintzelman appearing at the same moment on our left, the enemy fell back to the rising ground in his rear. My battalion was then advanced to the front, and took a position on the edge of a wood immediately opposite a masked battery and a large force of the secessionists posted about a house and the fences and trees around it. My three left companies were deployed as skirmishers under Captain Hodge, Eighth Infantry, and did great execution among their ranks. At this time the whole battalion became actively engaged, and a Rhode Island battery coming into action on my right, and having no support, at the request of its commanding officer, and seeing myself the necessity of the case, I remained as a protection to his guns. For more than an hour the command was here exposed to a concentrated fire from the batteries and regiments of the enemy, which seemed doubled when the guns of the Rhode Islanders opened. Many of my men assisted in working the latter battery.
As the attack of our Army became more developed on the right, and the necessity for my staying with the guns ceased, I moved my battalion in that direction, passing through crowds of retiring troops, whom we endeavored in vain to rally. Taking a position on the extreme right, in front of several regiments of the enemy, I opened an effective fire upon them, and held my ground until all our troops had fallen back and my flank was turned by a large force of horse and foot. I then retired a short distance in good order, and facing to the enemy on the crest of a hill, held his cavalry in check, which still threatened our flank.
At this stage of the action, my command was the only opposing force to the enemy, and the last to leave the field. By taking advantage of woods and broken ground, I brought it off without loss, although the guns of our opponents were playing on our line of march from every height. While thus retiring, I received an order from the brigade commander to cover the retreat of that portion of the Army near me, which I did as well as I was able, remaining in rear until all of it had passed me.
After crossing Bull Run my command was threatened by a large force of cavalry, but its order and the regularity of its march forbade

any attack. We reached our camp beyond Centre ville at? 8 p. m. It is but proper to mention that our officers and men were on their feet from 10 p. m. on the 20th until 10 a. m. on the 22d. Without rest, many without food, foot-sore, and greatly exhausted, they yet bore the retreat cheerfully, and set an example of constancy and discipline worthy of older and more experienced soldiers. My officers, nearly all of them just from civil life and the Military Academy, were eager and zealous, and to their efforts is due the soldierly retreat and safety of the battalion, as well as of many straggling volunteers who accompanied my command. The acting major, Capt. N. H. Davis, Second Infantry, rendered essential service by his coolness, zeal, and activity. Captain Dodge, Eighth Infantry, commanding the skirmishers on the left, was equally efficient, and to those gentlemen and all my officers I am indebted for cordial co-operation in all the movements of the day. Lieutenant Kent, although wounded, endeavored to retain command of his company, but a second wound forced him to give it up. He and Lieutenant Dickinson, acting adjutant, wounded, and Dr. Sternberg, U. S. Army, are believed to be in the hands of the enemy.
I beg to call the attention of the brigade.commander to the services of Sergeant-Major Devoe, of the Third Infantry, who was conspicuous for his good conduct on the field. The arms and equipments of my command are in good condition, but the men are destitute of blankets, and in want of necessary clothing.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Maj. John G. Reynolds, commanding battalion of TJ. 8. Marines.
Marine Barracks Headquarters,
Washington, July 24, 1861.
Captain : I have the honor to report the movements and operations of the battalion of marines under my command detailed to co-operate with the Army.
The battalion left the barracks at headquarters in time to reach the Virginia end of the Potomac Long Bridge at 3 p. m. July 16, and proceeded up the Columbia turnpike until an officer, purporting to be the assistant adjutant-general of Colonel Porter’s brigade, came up and assigned us position in the line of march, which placed us immediately in. the rear of Captain Griffin’s battery of flying artillery. This assign ment was continued up to the period of the battle at Bull Bun.
On reaching the field, and for some hours previously, the battery’s accelerated march was such as to keep my command more or less ?n double-quick time; consequently the men became fatigued or exhausted in strength. Being obliged at this period to halt, in order to afford those in the rear an opportunity of closing up and taking their proper place in line, the battery was lost to protection from the force under my command. This I stated to Colonel Porter, who was ever present, watching the events of the day. The position of the battery was

pointed out, and I was directed to afford the necessary support. In taking this position the battalion was exposed to a galling tire. Whilst holding it General McDowell ordered the battalion to cover or support the Fourteenth New York Regiment, which was about to be engaged. The battalion, in consequence, took the position indicated by the general, but was unable to hold it, owing to the heavy fire which was opened upon them. They broke three several times, but as frequently formed, and urged back to their position, where finally a general rout took place, in which the marines participated. No effort on the part of their officers could induce them to rally.
I am constrained to call your attention to the fact that, when taking into consideration the command was composed entirely of recruits— not one being in service over three weeks, and many had hardly learned their facings, the officers likewise being but a short time in the service— their conduct was such as to elicit only the highest commendation.
Of the three hundred and fifty officers and enlisted men under my command, there were but two staff officers, two captains, one first lieutenant, and nine non-commissioned officers and two musicians who were experienced from length of service. The remainder were, of course, raw^ recruits, which being considered, I am happy to report the good conduct of officers and men. The officers, although but little experienced, were zealous in their efforts to carry out my orders.
In the death of Lieutenant Hitchcock the corps has been deprived of a valuable acquisition. On the field he was ever present and zealous. He sought and won the approbation of his commanding and brother officers.
Inclosed please find a return of the battalion, showing its present strength, with casualties, &c.*
The abrupt and hasty retreat from the field of battle presents a deplorable deficiency in both arms and equipments.
The rout being of such a general character, the men of all arms commingled, the only alternative left was to hasten to the ground occupied by the brigade to which we were attached on the morning of the day of the battle. On my way thither I had the good fortune to fall in with General Meigs, whose consternation at the disastrous retreat was depicted upon liis countenance. He was of the opinion the Army should hasten to Arlington, fearing otherwise the enemy wmuld follow up their successes and cut us off on the road. My men being weary and much exhausted, without blankets and other necessaries, I determined to strengthen such as should pass the wagons by hot coffee, and move on to headquarters at Washington City, where their wants could be supplied. But few came up; others continued on to the Long Bridge, where, on my arrival, I found some seventy or more, who, at my urgent solicitation, were permitted to accompany me to the barracks.
In assuming the responsibility of the return to headquarters, I trust my course will meet the approbation of authority.
Blankets were thrown aside by my order on entering the field, which from force of circumstances we were afterwards unable to recover.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JNO. GEO. REYNOLDS,
Major, Commanding Battalion Marines.

Report of Maj. Innis AT. Palmer, Second TJ.. $. Cavalry, commanding
battalion.
Cavalry Camp, near Arlington, July 23, 1861.
Sir : In obedience to circular from brigade headquarters of this date, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command during the battle before Manassas on the 21st instant.
My command consisted of one company of the Second Dragoons, Capt. F. C. Armstrong commanding, two companies of the First Cavalry, under Capt. A. V. Colburn, and four companies of Second Cavalry, under Capts. A. G. Brackett, W. W. Lowe, J. E. Harrison, and First Lieutenant Drummond.
At the commencement of the action the whole cavalry force was ordered to the front, and it took a position on the extreme right of the line. From this point portions were detached from time to time, to support the different batteries and to examine the ground on the left of the enemy’s line. While they were thus engaged, a small body of the enemy’s cavalry, which had charged through the Yew York Zouave Regiment, came within short distance of my command, and I directed a small party, under Sergeant Sachs, of the Second Dragoons, to pursue them. He succeeded in capturing several prisoners, among them General George Steuart, of Maryland.
During the entire action the cavalry, sometimes together and sometimes in detachments, moved by the direction of the commanding general to various points in the field, where there was a prospect of their being able to act to advantage. When the force on the right of our attacking line first gave way, all of my officers, assisted by Governor Sprague, of Rhode Island, endeavored to rally them, and I found it necessary to deploy the cavalry to oppose the retreat of these men. They were, however, totally demoralized, and a galling fire, opened suddenly from the woods in front of us, made all our efforts unavailing.
When the retreat from the field became general, the whole of the cavalry, excepting those killed, wounded, or dismounted by loss of horses, was together, and in good condition. I was directed to cover the retreat, assisted by a section of Arnold’s battery. The enemy rapidly advanced upon the rear, and at the crossing of Bull Run it was necessary to form my command to receive their cavalry. Two shots from the guns of Arnold caused them to retire, and soon after I received orders to push on as rapidly as possible in order to save my command. I reached Centreville about 8.30 p. m., and this place at 5.30 a. m. the next morning.
The conduct of officers and men throughout the day was in the highest degree praiseworthy.*
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Major, Second Cavalry, Commanding Cavalry. Capt. W. W. Averell,
A. A. A. G. Colonel Porter’s Brigade.
