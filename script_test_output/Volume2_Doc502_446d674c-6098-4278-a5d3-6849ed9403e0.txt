Fort Monroe, Va., July 26,1861.
Lieutenant-General Scott :
Dear Sir : Your orders directing four and one-half regiments to be sent to Washington, via Baltimore, were received at 2 o’clock this morning. Believing that the exigency required promptness, I have sent forward the California regiment, Colonel Baker, and the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Regiments New York Volunteers, making an aggregate force of about four thousand men. These regiments are among the very best I have, and, with the exception of their equipments, will compare favorably with any other volunteers in the service.
The General will'perceive that this reduction of my forces here leaves it impossible to take up or hold any advanced position. Newport News, where I have an intrenched camp, and a very important point in my

judgment, will be in great danger of attack from Yorktown and Warwick, where the Confederates are now concentrating troops across James River from Smithfield to Warwick.
From the very best sources of information I can get there are about eight thousand men at Yorktown, and some ten thousand at Norfolk and vicinity. Might I suggest that we here now are too few for safety, unless under the guns of the fort, and too many for comfort or health even within the fort 1
Would it not be better, if no offensive movement is intended from this quarter, to withdraw three regiments and a light battery, which I have just mounted, leaving about two thousand men for a garrison, which I remember the Commanding General remarked would be a sufficient number 1
I ask direction upon the point whether I shall hold Newport News or withdraw the troops from it. It will be at once occupied by the enemy when we leave it. It will be recollected that the Vermont regiment will be entitled to return home in a week from date. I trust my action will meet the approval of the Commanding General.
I have now no brigadier, and my senior colonels, with the exception of Colonel Phelps, who will be away by limitation of time in a few days, are with the withdrawing regiments.
I have the honor to be, most truly, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLEE, Major-General, Commanding.
Harper’s Ferry.—(Received July 26, 1861.)
Colonel Townsend :
Received dispatch. Twenty thousand men is the least force that can hold this place against a probable attack. There are three points that must be held—Loudoun Heights, Maryland Heights, and the plateau beyond the village of Bolivar that commands the road to Winchester. If the enemy has possession of either one, it will command the town. If attacked with our present force we shall secure the Maryland Heights, which will make the town absolutely untenable by the enemy and cover our line of communication. Orders have been sent to Hagerstown to have the stores ready for removal if attack is threatened in that direction. We are sending as far as convenient the regimental wagons across the ferry for safety. No indications of a movement of the enemy is seen here, but various reports of his intentions.
There is no doubt that the local cavalry scouts are busy in impressing men into service of the rebels, but that is all we know with certainty. The remaining three months’ force is unreliable.

Your post is in no particular danger for the next three or five days. In the mean time I will try to re-enforce you to the number of twenty or twenty-one regiments.

Headquarters of the Army,
Washington, July 21, 1801.
Major-General Banks, XL S. A., Harper’s Ferry, Va.:
I have ordered Captain Newton back to you. I do not ask that, you shall attempt to hold Harper’s Ferry at a great hazard even after being largely re-enforced. With less than 15,000 men, and a probability of being attacked by 20,000, it may be better to cross the Potomac and take up position on Maryland Heights and opposite to Leesburg. Give me your views.
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Headquarters Department of Virginia,
Fort Monroe, July 27, 1861.
Lieutenant-General Scott :
Sir : I have the honor to report that by adding four steamers of my own to the steamers furnished by the Bay Line I was enabled to get off the forces mentioned in my report of yesterday, with the exception of four hundred men, who go forward in the boat to-night. I have been obliged to abandon the village of Hampton and withdraw the regiments that I have here under the walls of the fort. I beg leave further to report that upon advising with Colonel Phelps I have concluded to hold Newport News until I get instructions from the General Commanding. I have also the honor to ask instructions as to the disposition to be made of some twenty-five prisoners that I have taken—some in conveying intelligence to the enemy; some in supplying them with provisions, and all of whom refuse to take the oath of allegiance, or take it with reservation. I have no power to try them ; it would be dangerous to allow them to escape, and I am guarding and feeding them at Fort Calhoun.
It becomes my duty to report that Colonel Duryea, commanding Fifth New York Begiment, took with him certain negro slaves to Washington. They are reported nine in number. This was done against my express orders, and after a portion of them had been detained by my provost-marshal. This is a question of difficulty with departing regiments, and one upon which I ask instructions. I will forward to Colonel Baker, as senior officer commanding, the official returns as soon as they reach me.
Awaiting instructions, I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. F. BUTLER.
War Department, July 27, 1861.
Maj. Gen. J. A. Dix,
Comely. Department of Maryland. Fort McHenry, Md.:
Sir : Your letter of the 24th instant, proposing to arm a home guard of 850 picked men in Baltimore, has been received and referred to the General-in-Chief, who approves the proposal warmly.
You are authorized to organize and equip a regiment of home guards as you suggest. The necessary instructions will be given to the Ordnance Department.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
