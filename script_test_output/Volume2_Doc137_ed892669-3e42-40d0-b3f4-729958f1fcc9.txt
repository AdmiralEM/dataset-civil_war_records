The board of police was arrested this morning at 4 o’clock. Troops have been stationed at the principal squares of the city. All is perfectly quiet. We greatly need cavalry for patrol duty.

General : In pursuance of orders of the 24th ultimo, received from your department, I arrested, and now detain in custody of the United States, Mr. George P. Kane, chief of police of the city of Baltimore. Mr. Kane was arrested on the morning of the 27th ultimo. The strong-position he held as the head of a large body of armed men, posted in different parts of the city, who might be summoned together without loss of time, and the necessity of succeeding in the arrest, if attempted, made it impracticable, in my judgment, in view of all facts, to undertake at the same time the execution of other parts of this order.
The arrest of the chief of police, and the suspension of the powers of the board of police, were announced to the people of Baltimore in a proclamation, dated the 27th June, a copy of which is herewith inclosed [A]. Upon the arrest of the chief of police, Col. John B. Kenly, of the First Maryland Begiment, was appointed provost-marshal within and for the city of Baltimore, who entered at once upon his duties. Subsequent to a recognition and protest against the suspension of their functions by the board of police, they declared, in resolutions formally adopted and published, that the police law itself had been suspended, and the officers and men discharged from duty for the present, holding them at the same time to be subject to their orders, both now and hereafter. Colonel Kenly was obliged immediately to organize a force

of four hundred men to serve as police officers, in order that the city should not be entirely divested of all police protection, which, with the aid of many loyal citizens, was effected, and the men sworn to the just performance of their duty, in the course of a few hours.
The city has remained in perfect order and quiet since the organization of the new police. The headquarters of the police, when vacated by the officers appointed by the board, resembled a concealed arsenal. Large quantities of arms and ammunition were found secreted in such places and with such skill as to forbid the thought of their being held for just or lawful purposes. An inventory of the arms and ammunition will be forwarded. Colonel Kenly has performed his duties as provost-marshal in the most prompt, faithful, and discreet maimer.
This morning at 4 o’clock the members of the board of police were arrested by my order, and, together with the chief of police, are now securely held in custody by Major Morris, commanding officer at Fort McHenry, in behalf of the Government of the United States. The persons arrested are Messrs. Charles Howard, president of the board) William II. Gatchell, Charles I). Hinks, and John W. Davis, being all its members, except the mayor of the city, who is connected ex officio with this department.
In view of possible occurrences, and the better to meet contingent action of disloyal persons, rumors of which have reached me from quarters entitled to respect, I have placed a large part of the force under my command within the city, and in possession of the principal public squares. No building of importance will be occupied, and no obstruction to the business of the city will occur, unless it be upon the strongest public necessity. The troops will be withdrawn from the city as soon as the question of the conflicting forces of police can be arranged. This I believe will be done at once. The arrests of this morning and the reasons for the occupation of the city have been announced by proclamation, a copy of which is herewith inclosed [B],
I have the gratification to inform you that all the arrests have been made without disturbance, and that the city is now and has been since the arrest of the chief of police more quiet and orderly than for any time for many months previous.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,

To the People of the City of Baltimore:
By virtue of authority vested in me, and in obedience to orders, as commanding general of the Military Department of Annapolis, I have arrested and do now detain in custody Mr. George P. Kane, chief of police of the city of Baltimore. I deem it proper at this the moment of arrest to make formal and public declaration of the motive by which I have been governed in this proceeding. It is not my purpose, neither is it in consonance with my instructions, to interfere in any manner whatever with the legitimate government of the people of Baltimore or

Maryland. I desire to support the public authorities in all appropriate duties, in preserving peace, protecting property and the rights of persons, in obeying and upholding every municipal regulation and public statute consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States and of Maryland. But unlawful combinations of men, organized for resistance to such laws, that provide hidden deposits of arms and ammunition, encourage contraband traffic with men at war with the Government, and, while enjoying its protection and privileges, stealthily wait opportunity to combine their means and forces with those in rebellion against its authority, are not among the recognized or legal rights of any class of men, and cannot be permitted under any form of government whatever. Such combinations are well known to exist in this department. The mass of citizens of Baltimore and of Maryland, loyal to the Constitution and the Union, are neither parties to nor responsible for them. The chief of police, however, is not only believed to be cognizant of these facts, but, in contravention of his duty and in violation of law, he is by direction and indirection both witness and protector to the transactions and the parties engaged therein. Under such circumstances the Government cannot regard him otherwise than as the head of an armed force hostile to its authority and acting in concert with its avowed enemies. For this reason, superseding his official authority and that of commissioner of police, I have arrested and do now detain him in custody of the United States; and in further pursuance of my instructions I have appointed for the time being Colonel Kenly, of the First Regiment of Maryland Volunteers, provost-marshal in and for the city of Baltimore, to superintend and cause to be executed the police laws provided by the legislature of Maryland, with the aid and assistance of the subordinate officers of the police department, and he will be respected accordingly.
Whenever a loyal citizen shall be otherwise named for the performance of this duty, who will execute these laws impartially and in good faith to the Government of the United States, the military force of this department will render to him that instant and willing obedience which is due from every good citizen to his government.

To the People of the City of Baltimore:
In pursuance of orders issued from the headquarters of the Army at Washington, for the preservation of the public peace in this department, I have arrested and do now detain in custody of the United States the members of the late board of police, Messrs. Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell, Charles D. Hinks, and John W. Davis, the incidents of the late week furnishing full justification for this order. The police headquarters, under charge of the board, when abandoned by their officers, resembled in some respects a concealed arsenal. After public recognition and protest against the u suspension of their functions,they continue in daily secret session. Upon a forced and unwarrantable construction of my proclamation of the 27th ultimo, they declared the police law itself suspended, and the officers and men off duty for the present, intending to leave the city without any police protection whatever. They

refused to recognize the force necessarily appointed for its protection, and hold subject to their orders now and hereafter the old police, a large body of armed men^ for some purpose unknown to the Government, and inconsistent with its security. To anticipate their intentions and orders, I have temporarily placed a portion of my command within the city. I disclaim for the Government I represent all desire, intention, and purpose to interfere in any of the ordinary municipal affairs of Baltimore. Whenever a loyal citizen can be nominated to the office of marshal who will execute the police laws impartially and in good faith to the United States, the military force will be withdrawn at once from the central parts of the municipality. No soldier will be permitted in the city except under regulations satisfactory to the marshal, or by order of the general in command, and whenever the municipal laws and regulations shall be by them violated, they shall be punished according to the municipal laws and upon the judgment of the civil tribunals.
