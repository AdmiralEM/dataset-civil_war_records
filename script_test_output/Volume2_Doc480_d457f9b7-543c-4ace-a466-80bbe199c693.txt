No. 37.
f Massachusetts Volunteer Militia,
On board steamer Maryland, off Annapolis, April 22,1861. Colonel Munroe is charged with the execution of the following order: At 5 o’clock a. m. the troops will be paraded by company and be drilled in the manual of arms, especially in loading at will, firing by file, and in the use of the bayonet, and these specialties will be observed in all subsequent drills in the manual ; such drill to continue until 7 o’clock, when all the arms will be stacked upon the upper deck, great care being taken to instruct the men as to the mode of stacking their arms, so that a firm stack, not easily overturned, shall be made. Being obliged to drill at times with the weapons loaded, great damage may be done by the overturning of the stack and the discharge of the piece. This is important. Indeed, an accident has already occurred in the regiment from this cause, and although slight in its consequence, yet it warns us to increased diligence in this regard.
The purpose which could only be hinted at in the orders of yesterday has been accomplished. The frigate Constitution has lain for a long time at this port substantially at the mercy of the armed mob which sometimes paralyzes the otherwise loyal State of Maryland. Deeds of daring, successful contests, and glorious victories had rendered “Old Ironsides” so conspicuous in the naval history of the country that she was fitly chosen as the school-ship in which to train the future officers of the Navy to like heroic acts. It was given to Massachusetts and Essex County first to man her; it was reserved for Massachusetts to have the honor to retain her for the service of the Union and the laws.
This is a sufficient triumph of right and a sufficient triumph for us. By this the blood of our friends shed by the Baltimore mob is in so far avenged. The Eighth Regiment may hereafter cheer lustily on all proper occasions, but never without orders. The old Constitution, by their efforts, aided untiringly by the'U. S. officers having her in charge, is now safely upossessed, occupied, and enjoyed” by the Government of the United States, and is safe from all her foes.
We have been joined by the Seventh Regiment of New York, and together we propose peaceably, quickly, and civilly, unless opposed by some mob or other disorderly persons, to march to Washington, in obedience to the requisition of the President of the United States. If opposed, we shall march steadily forward.
My next order I hardly know how to express. I cannot assume that any of the citizen soldiery of Massachusetts or New York could under any circumstances whatever commit any outrages upon private property in a loyal and friendly State. But fearing that some improper person may have by stealth introduced himself among us, I deem it proper to state that any unauthorized interference with private property will be

most signally punished, and full reparation therefor made to the injured party to the full extent of my power and ability. In so doing, I but carry out the orders of the War Department. I should have so done without those orders.
Colonel Munroe will cause these orders to be read at the head of each company before we march.
Colonel Lefferts’ command not having been originally included in this order, he will be furnished with a copy for his instruction.
By order of B. F. Butler, brigadier-general :
WILLIAM H. CLEMENS,

State of Maryland, Executive Chamber,
Annapolis, April 22,1861.
To Brig. Gen. B. F. Butler :
Sir : I am in receipt of your two * communications of this date, informing me of your intention to land the men under your command at Annapolis, for the purpose of marching thence to the city of Washington. I content myself with protesting against this movement, which, in view of the excited condition of the people of this State, I cannot but consider an unwise step on the part of the Government. But I most earnestly urge upon you that there shall be no halt made by the troops in this city.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
THOS. H. HICKS.
Fort McHenry, Md., April 22, 1861.
Hon. Gideon Welles,
Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. (7.:
Dear Sir : Please inform the War Department that I sent a detachment from my command, with two pieces of artillery, to take possession of Fort Carroll last evening. They were sent by the U. S. surveying schooner Howell Cobb, which happened to be lying at the dock of this post. I also wrote by her to the commissary of subsistence in New York to send me three months7 additional supplies.
I send this under cover to Mr. Ruger, as I am afraid to communicate this intelligence through the regular channel, on account of the sudden and unaccountable change of sentiment in the city of Baltimore.
The Department has been informed of the resources of this place, and must act on what they already know of my condition.
Very respectfully and truly, yours,
JNO. C. ROBINSON, Captain, Fifth Infantry, Commanding.

other States there en route to this city. If cars can be obtained from the Baltimore and Washington Railroad, yon will obtain as many as practicable for the transportation of those troops hither in one or more trips. Consult the naval commander at Annapolis whether he deems a detachment of troops necessary to defend the Naval School, the fort, and any U. S. vessels which may be there. You will next see the commanders of the regiments of volunteers, and request that one, or both of them together, leave the number of companies that may be needed by Commodore Blake for those defensive purposes. On the arrival of a sufficient naval force at Annapolis for its defense, any detachment left behind will be ordered to join its regiment or regiments. You will remain with the volunteers as long as you can be useful, hiring wagons, &c.
I write by command of Lieutenant-General Scott.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—As it is feared that Baltimore cars cannot be obtained to go to Annapolis for the troops, the cars belonging to the Annapolis road may, in many trips, be able to bring the troops to the junction house, and thence probably the Baltimore cars may bring the troops to Washington. Or in the worst case that may be apprehended, the necessity of marching the whole distance from Annapolis to Washington, you will hire wagons, and make all purchases necessary to their wants.
Take care to admonish the troops to be prepared, in landing, to repel force by force, as in war.
[Unsigned indorsement.]
Captain Blake and the governor both say that the occupancy of any position at Annapolis by volunteers will be prejudicial instead of beneficial.
Adjutant-General’s Office,
Washington, D. (7., April 23,1861. Commanding Officer, Carlisle Barracics, Pa. :
Sir: The Secretary of War directs that you at once order to this city and put en route the four companies of the Second Cavalry now at Carlisle Barracks. You will see that the companies are mounted and filled to the maximum standard, and fully armed and equipped for service. They will march from Carlisle to Gettysburg, and thence to this city, by the best route, avoiding as far as practicable the large towns, such as Frederick City. If possible, send not less than two officers with each company, Lieutenant (now Captain) Roger Jones being one of the officers so sent. You are directed to make all needful arrangements to render this movement prompt and successful.
I am, sir, &c.,

on Friday, the 26th instant, and Annapolis being the place in which, according to law, it must assemble, and having been credibly informed that you have taken military possession of the Annapolis and Elk Bidge Bailroad, I deem it my duty to protest against this step, because, without at present assigning any other reason, I am informed that such occupancy of said road will prevent the members of the legislature from reaching this city.
Very respectfully, yours,
THOS. H. HICKS.
Hdqrs. Third Brigade Mass. You. Militia,

To his Excellency Thos. H. Hicks,
Governor of the State of Maryland :
I did myself the honor, in my communication of yesterday, wherein I asked permission to land the portion of the militia of the United States under my command, to state that they were armed only against the disturbers of the peace of the State of Maryland and of the United States.
I have understood, within the last hour, that some apprehensions vrere entertained of an insurrection of the negro population of this neighborhood. I am anxious to convince all classes of persons that the forces under my command are not here in any way to interfere with, or countenance any interference with, the laws of the State. I am therefore ready to co-operate with your excellency in suppressing, most promptly and effectively, any insurrection against the laws of Maryland.
I beg, therefore, that you announce publicly that any portion of the forces under my command is at your excellency’s disposal to act immediately for the preservation and quietness of the peace of this community.
And I have the honor to be, your excellency’s obedient servant,
B. F. BUTLEB, General of the Third Brigade.
Third Brigade U. S. Militia,
Annapolis, Md., April 23,1861.
To his Excellency Thos. H. Hicks,
Governor of Maryland:
You are credibly informed that I have taken possession of the Annapolis and Elk Bidge Bailroad. It might have escaped your notice, but at the official meeting between your excellency and the mayor of Annapolis and the authorities of the Government and myself it was expressly stated as the reason why I should not land that my troops could not pass the railroad because the company had taken up the rails, and they were private property. It is difficult to see how it could be that if my troops could not pass over the railroad one way, the members of the legislature could pass the other way. I have taken possession for the purpose of preventing the carrying out of the threats of the mob, as officially represented to me by the master of transportation of this city, “ that if my troops passed over the railroad the railroad should be destroyed.”
If the government of the State had taken possession of the railroad in any emergency, I should have long waited before I entered upon it.

I thank you most sincerely for the tender of your men, but I had, before the receipt of your letter, directed the sheriff of the county to act in the matter, and am confident that the citizens of the county are fully able to suppress any insurrection of our slave population.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 21st instant,* and to thank you for the suggestions, which have had my most cordial consideration. I adhere, however, to the opinion, heretofore expressed to the General-in-Chief, as to the line which could be most readily kept open with our present force, and hope that the Government has seized the railway between Annapolis and Washington, with its rolling-stock.
I trust that there are small war steamers in the Chesapeake in sufficient numbers to protect our transports and capture or destroy all armed vessels of the insurgents. Information has reached me from a source which, though not entirely reliable, entitles it to consideration, that they have a steam-tug in the Chesapeake, armed with a single rifled cannon, for the purpose of sinking our transports. She should be overhauled if possible, and no vessel should be permitted to enter or leave the harbor of Baltimore while the people of that city continue to defy the authority of the General Government.
I have furnished four hundred muskets to the mayor of Wilmington, eighty of which have been used to arm Du Pont’s workmen, embodied for the defense of the mills, and the residue appropriated to the organized volunteers of the city, whose loyalty is vouched for by the mayor.
The inclosed statement is obtained from a refugee from Norfolk, whose face and conduct indicate integrity of purpose, and who is evidently familiar with all the localities. I venture to suggest that you bring the

With much respect,

Captain Bussell, of the steamer Louisiana, carried fifteen barrels of gunpowder, stolen from the powder-magazine at Norfolk, to General Steuart, Baltimore. Powder seized by police for the use of the mob. The Louisiana returned within an hour with cannon for the use of the rebels at Norfolk.
The Georgianna, Captain Smith, is carrying contraband articles for the use of the rebels. William Selden (James Biver boat) is employed in same way.
Capt. Arthur Sinclair, late of the Navy, has a steamboat called Beany,% armed with a 6-pounder rifled cannon, cruising off Cape Henry, to sink transports. Steam-tug Star cruising in the bay plundering. Pour rifled cannon (6-pounders) in the possession of the secessionists at Norfolk.
Captain Baker, owner of the Star and Beany, lives in Norfolk, and should be captured.
Lieutenants Pegram and Page, late of the U. S. Navy, are connected with the secession movement.
Norfolk could be held by fifteen hundred men if the railroad bridges are destroyed.
Philadelphia, April 23,1861. Col. L. Thomas, Adjutant-General, Washington:
Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of the General-in-Chief, dated 21st instant, per special messenger, W. J. Palmer. All my efforts have been directed to open the line to Washington by rail from here to the Susquehanna Biver, thence by Annapolis, and from there by rail, believing this to be the only line which could be maintained with the force at my disposal. I hope that more than one war steamer has been put on the water part of the route to protect the transports and sink or capture armed vessels of the enemy.
Two regiments will be embarked immediately for Annapolis, but they are deficient in equipments and their ammunition is unsuitable, cartridges not fitting the muskets in many cases. Great efforts have been made to supply this deficiency, and I hope that it will soon cease to exist.
I have reliable information that 8,000 men are now on their way from New York to Annapolis. Major Sherman arrived last night with his battery, and has been directed to take post for the present at Elkton, Md., supported by 100 infantry. I have no other battery on this side of the river, where one is much needed.
The medical officers appointed to the volunteer regiments are, so far as I am aware, good selections, but, of necessity, without experience in the field, except in rare instances.
It is of great importance that the medical staff should be promptly organized under the direction of an experienced surgeon. I have therefore earnestly to request the General-in-Chief to assign an Army surgeon to my command for service as medical director.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
B. PATTEESON,
Major-General.

Philadelphia, April 23,1861. General Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir : The suspension of intercourse between this place and Washington has caused an intense feeling here in relation to the safety of the capital, and there is great eagerness to rush to its assistance. This anxiety, however, has not been participated in by the military authorities, and as yet there have been but few troops passed through to Havre de Grace. The people of Philadelphia exhibit some mortification that the Bostonians should have got nearly a week ahead of their troops, notwithstanding their greater distance from the scene of action.
After our communication with Washington was cut off via Baltimore in consequence of Mr. Garrett changing his plan of conveying troops through that city from a steam ferry-boat between Canton and Locust Point to the railroad through the streets, I immediately arranged transportation between Havre de Grace and Annapolis for five regiments jper day. It seems, however, that the remaining New England and New York troops have for some reason taken the ocean route, and but few Pennsylvania troops are prepared to move. If the route from Annapolis to Washington City is open, we have transportation facilities now on the Chesapeake equal to the movement of fifteen thousand troops per day to your city, together with any amount of provisions, &c., for their support.
{Sherman’s battery arrived here last night, and could have been in Annapolis to-day. It is understood, however, that it will not leave until to-morrow morning, and then stop at Elkton. We infer from this that you must feel entirely safe at Annapolis and at Washington. Mr. Palmer informs me that you have not taken military possession of the Washington Branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad Company and the Annapolis Road. If you have no superintendent fit to control such an enterprise, I would mention Joseph D. Potts, now in Baltimore, at the Northern Central Railroad Office, and T. H. Duprey, here. Colonel Small smuggled himself off without arms against my earnest protest and refusal to send him without them. He, however, got his force back without much damage to it.	1
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. EDGAR THOMSON.
Philadelphia, April 23,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear Sir : Since I wrote my last of this date I have been informed that the Baltimoreans and Marylanders have destroyed the whole of the bridges on the Northern Central. This seems to have been a mere spite action, and must convince the Government that those loyal to the Government in Maryland are in a vast minority. As soon as the capital is safe from attack, it seems to me that the Government should at once turn on Baltimore and place it under martial law, and require that it should pay all damages to the railroads it has destroyed, and to their business.
There seems to be very little vigor in the organizing and dispatching of troops from this place. Who is to blame time must show. There is evidently a great deal of red tape to retard matters. Sherman’s battery, which could as well have been in Annapolis to-day, is still here. I hope you will give them a stirring up. I have provided ample means

of transit for everything that could be offered. The War Department should at once destroy, if it has not already done so, the bridges on the main stem of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad as high up as Harper’s Berry.
There is now a large field for vigorous operations in the vicinity of Washington, without troubling Charleston until frost. Maryland should feel the power of the General Government in a manner that will hereafter keep her quiet, if it does not make her loyal.
After the excitement in Baltimore on Friday last, I saw at once that the only inland route to Washington was via Annapolis or some point below that place as near to Washington, and did not hesitate to make every preparation to send all the Pennsylvania troops and those from the East over it. The movement down the Northern Central, it seemed to me, could not be more easily effected than through Baltimore, via Havre de Grace. To complete the route, military possession of the Annapolis road should be taken at once. There must be ample force at Annapolis by this time for this object, supported by a respectable artillery force.
If you are in want of railway men to control the road, or locomotives or cars to work it, they can immediately be sent down from here, with competent and loyal engine men. We are in for a fight now, and what we do should be done so as to make an impression over the whole country, striking terror into the malcontents.
Yours, truly,
J. EDGAE THOMSON,
President Pennsylvania Central Bailroad.

General Patterson, &c. :
Dear General : I have only a moment to say the troops have not got round from Annapolis. Butler says he will be here to-day. The New York Seventh decline coming on some punctilio, as I am informed.
There must be no delay in sending the Philadelphia troops by that route, so as to command the road at once. Those coming from the West should, in my opinion, be concentrated on the Northern Central Railroad near Baltimore, so as to force our way through the city if they continue to harass our troops coming round it. The fine counties of York, Lancaster, &c., will furnish supplies, and the march across to the waters of the Potomac is good. These are at present only suggestions, but I beg for them your examination and reflection.

Dear Sir : Mr. Thomson, Mr. Sanford, and myself organized a plan to supply Washington with troops and provisions, &c., by way of Annapolis. A part of this plan was for Fort McHenry to allow no hostile force to leave Baltimore to seize transports. This we have not effected, of course, as we had no means to do it. We want command of the railroad from Washington to Annapolis and of the telegraph. This, of course, the Government must effect. The rest we can do, and are doing as rapidly as we can. We have assumed great responsibility, both pecuniarily and otherwise, but no good man ought in these times to shrink from any amount of responsibility within his reach. It is a question between government or anarchy, and who can hesitate ?

Sir : If this letter should find you not too far this side of Annapolis, I will ask you to consider yourself, for a time, as the commander of that city and retain a competent force to hold it. Next, I wish you to select a regiment (the one of your brigade or any other), and string it at convenient distances all along the railroad, by the junction and towards this city, as far as its numbers may suffice, to protect the road, its rails, bridges, and cars, so as to keep the communication open for troops and travelers between Annapolis and Washington by rail. *
The principal points in the road to be occupied are: the junction, Beltsville, the bridges, cross-roads, and a few of the other stations. Some of the intermediate stations may also require smaller detachments, and every post ought to be instructed to throw out scouts to the right and left frequently during the night and day. If the regiment takes, an the first instance, cooked provisions for a few days, the posts may afterwards be supplied by the trains which will be passing daily. Tents and cooking utensils will, perhaps, be needed at some of the posts or detachments.
Send to this place all the spare troops from Annapolis as fast as you may find means of transportation, and report often.
Very respectfully,

places, but now repaired. The New York Seventh Regiment got over it yesterday, and is here to-day. The people all along the route are quite hostile, and the road is in danger of being broken up everywhere and at any moment.
I have just instructed Brigadier-General Butler to hold the command of Annapolis, and to string one of the regiments along the railroad from that city towards Washington for its protection. Road wagons cannot be hired or impressed for the transportation of baggage for any part of the route. Instructions have been given for making camp equipage and accouterments as fast as jiossible in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. We are destitute of those supplies here, but have arms.
I wish no troops to be sent hither deficient in essential equipments.
Sherman’s battery, and a company of foot artillery with it, are needed here. If they can be spared from Perryville (and I think they may), send them to me. I wish Maj. W. W. Morris to take command of Fort McHenry. Perhaps he can only reach the fort by water.

Dear Sir : Matters are progressing here satisfactorily. We have ample provisions to transport ten thousand men daily from here to Annapolis, and I would recommend that no more be sent from New York or the East via the ocean.
Any amount of provisions can be placed in Annapolis at very short notice as soon as you direct that it shall be done. Having taken the responsibility of establishing the route via Annapolis, and placing upon it the necessary transports, I should be glad if you would, to enable me to have all the accounts properly presented in accordance with the customs of your Department, send to my agent, R. F. Loper, esq., a commission to act as United States transport a’gent between Philadelphia and Annapolis, the commission to date from April 18,1861. Captain Loper acted in this capacity during the Mexican war, and understands all the routine that the Government requires in such service.
The Philadelphia regiments have not yet gone forward, but I am glad to say that General Patterson is using his best exertions to have them properly equipped, and will dispatch them as speedily as he can. It seems that we have been wofully deficient in arms and ammunition in this city. I trust the difficulty will be remedied before it is too late for our city troops to assist in the defense of the capital.

[Chap. IX.
It is u left to the commanding general to watch and await their action, which, if it shall he to arm their people against the United States, he is to adopt the most prompt and efficient means to counteract, even if necessary to the bombardment of their cities, and in the extremest necessity suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.77
In the absence of the undersigned, the foregoing instructions are turned over to Brig. Gen. B. F. Butler, of the Massachusetts Volunteers, or other officer commanding at Annapolis, who will carry them out in a right spirit,* that is, with moderation and firmness. In the case of arrested individuals notorious for their hostility to the United States, the prisoners will be safely kept and duly cared for, but not surrendered except on the order of the commander aforesaid.

General Orders, )	Headquarters of the Army,
Vo. I.	f	Washington, April 26, 1861.
I.	From the known assemblage near this city of numerous hostile bodies of troops it is evident that an attack upon it may be expected at any moment. In such an event, to meet and overwhelm the enemy, it is necessary that some plan of harmonious co-operation should be adopted on the part of all the forces, regular and volunteer, present for the defense of the capital—that is, for the defense of the Government, the peaceable inhabitants of the city, their property, the public buildings, and public archives.
II.	At the first moment of an attack every regiment, battalion, squadron, and independent company will promptly assemble at its established rendezvous (in or out of the public buildings), ready for battle, and wait for orders.
III.	The pickets (or advance-guards) will stand fast till driven in by overwhelming force) but it is expected that those stationed to defend bridges—having every advantage of position—will not give way till actually pushed by the bayonet. Such obstinacy on the part of pickets so stationed is absolutely necessary to give time for the troops in the rear to reach their places of rendezvous.
IV.	All advance guards and pickets driven in will fall back slowly and delay the advance of the enemy as much as possible before repairing to their proper rendezvous.
V.	On the happening of an attack the troops lodged in the public buildings and in the navy-yard will remain for their defense, respectively, unless specially ordered elsewhere, with the exceptions that the Seventh New York Begiment and the Massachusetts regiment will march rapidly towards the Presidents square for its defense, and the Bhode Island regiment (in the Department of the Interior) will make a diversion or detachment to assist in the defense of the General Post-Office building, if it be necessary.

Informal assignments.
The following assignment was informally made before the arrival of any volunteer regiments from the North. The officers passed the night

at their posts during the time of greatest danger. Since a sufficient force has been each night stationed in the public buildings, it is believed the officers generally hold themselves ready, in case of an alarm, to repair at once to their posts to give such advice and aid as they can. Since the assignment was made other officers have arrived, and some have left the city, wilich should perhaps cause a new arrangement to be made:
The staff of the General-in-Chief, General Totten and Captain Fry, to repair to headquarters on an alarm. Gen. L. Thomas to command in Georgetown. Major McDowell, assisted by Capt. J. Y. Macomb and Lieutenant Woodruff, Topographical Engineers, assigned to Capitol Hill. Captain Meigs is now here, and should be the engineer of the Capitol building. Captain Garesche to repair to the General Post-Office. Capt. W. F. Baynolds, Topographical Engineers, to the Patent Office. Captain Shiras to Corcoran’s building, corner of Fifteenth and F streets, where there are public offices. Colonel Earned to repair to Winder’s building. Major Hunter, paymaster, to the President’s mansion. Colonel Stone to command of Executive square, assisted by Captain Wright, as engineer. Capt. W. It. Palmer, Topographical Engineers, to the Coast Survey. Capt. A. A. Humphreys to the Smithsonian Institution. Maj. H. Bache, Department of State. [Great seal.} Captain Franklin, Topographical Engineers, Treasury building, and in charge of a depot of ammunition placed there for use in case of attack.
Washington, April 26,1861. Lieut. Col. A. Porter, U. S. A., Washington, D. C. :
Sir : The General-in-Chief directs that you proceed to the State of Pennsylvania, to take charge of the arrangements for conducting to this city the quota of troops called for from that State and other troops en route hither. You will give particular attention to keeping open the railroad from Harrisburg to Baltimore, for the purpose of securing a free communication with the capital of the United States.
In pursuit of this object you will receive from his excellency the governor such aid as he may be pleased to give $ and, having accomifiished it, you will return to this city and report.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEKD, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Thomas A. Scott has been appointed to take charge of the railways and telegraphs between Washington City and Annapolis. Parties in charge thereof will place Mr. Scott in possession, and in future conform to his instructions in all matters pertaining to their management. Yours, respectfully,

their eyes to the existing state of affairs in the country. We have been without any response, except request for small matters of detail, while all my orders and wishes of the last week have been neglected. Until the day before yesterday we had not 2,500 men here under arms. Now we shall have enough in a day or two.
The railway from Annapolis to this place, under the direction of Scott, will be open by Monday for the whole amount of business of which it is capable. We shall want very few more troops by that route, but provisions, clothing, and munitions should be hurried here by it.
I have sent an engineer to reopen the Northern Central, and have ordered an able officer of this Department to take charge of the troops that may assemble at Harrisburg, and bring them in immediate connection with Baltimore, to be concentrated where the city can be reached. We must occupy it without delay. I will never consent, if the whole power of this Department can prevent it, that a rebel force shall prevent the passage of our fellow-citizens from coming here unmolested. The authorities of Baltimore have acted with bad faith, and one of the most painful acts I have witnessed was the order for the return of our troops from Cockeysville; but that is past, and now we will amend the error.
The President has given me full power to open this communication, and I will do it. To-day the President has ordered me to raise twenty-five regiments of regulars, and also ordered the erection of a manufactory for arms at Eock Island, 111. This shows you that there will be no lack of energy here. If the officers now in command will not act with energy, General Scott shall be authorized to find others that will.
SIMON CAMEEON,
Secretary of War.
Headquarters Annapolis, April 27,1861.
[General Scott :]
Sir : I had the honor to receive this morning your letter from headquarters, of April 25, detailing me to the command of this city. I am deeply sensible of the honor conferred, and will endeavor to hold it. I had taken the liberty to make dispositions for that purpose before I had the honor to receive your order. I had caused Professor Lockwood, a very competent person, fully acquainted with the locality, to make a survey of its environs. From that, aided by my own observations, I find a water battery, known as Fort Madison, without casemates, which commands the channel, and prepared to mount twenty-one guns, but none are mounted. Everything is ready for the reception of its armament, being left in that condition by the Engineer Department last season; but this in its turn is entirely commanded by a height, upon which there
is an old redoubt known by the soubriquet of Port Nonsense. This was built during the year 1812, and, so far as I can learn, has never been oc-cupied since. This also commands the town and the Naval Academy, where we have established our depots. An enemy there with a gun or two properly used would render our position entirely untenable. I have therefore detailed one hundred men from Colonel Pinckney’s regiment, the New York Sixth, which was here with a force of only about five hundred, to occupy Fort Nonsense, and also a company of fifty men from the same command to occupy Fort Madison and to keep up the communication between them, the distance being a short half mile.
During the past night, as I am informed by the very accurate report of the major in command, the troops were disturbed by signal-rockets being thrown up along the line of the interior road for some miles. Im-

pressed with the importance of the point, I have ordered an increased force from the same regiment, so that the detachment is now two hundred men, and have furnished them with signal-rockets, so that in case of attack we can immediately re-enforce them from the academy. I have directed Lieutenant Luce, acting quartermaster here, to organize a flotilla of boats so that we can send re-enforcements at, once.
We believe that we have entire command of the bay through the means of the iron steamers Maryland, mounting four 32-pounders, commanded by Captain Steadman, and the Philadelphia ice-boat, which had been put in the service of the United States, free of expense, by the city of Philadelphia, commanded by Captain Cliisson [?], of the Navy, which also mounts four guns.
My attention was next drawn to the rear of the town. The conformation of the ground there is peculiar, as will be seen from an examination of the maps. A creek runs up on each side of the point of land on which the town and the academy are situated, too broad and too deep to allow the passage of any considerable force, and in the rear of the town they approach each other within the space of less than two-thirds of a mile. Nearly in the center of this space runs the high road, and a little to the right of that the railway. The land is high, and presents natural means for a defense. I have caused Professor Lockwood to mark out a line of intrenchment there, and unless I am directed to the contrary, I shall proceed to throw up a field work to protect the rear of the town. I have detailed for the permanent occupation of this place the Third Battalion of,Rifles, of Massachusetts, Major Devens, 246 men; the Sixth New York Regiment, Colonel Pinckney, 500 men; the Boston Light Battery, six pieces, Major Cook, 100 men; and I propose to add to them the Thirteenth New York Regiment, Colonel Smith, about 500 men; making in all 1,300 men. I believe that I have thus stated the effective strength, and with this, unless better instructed when my intrenchments are complete, I think I shall be able to hold the city, especially as I shall be aided from time to time by troops arriving and necessarily delaying here. There is a distance of about a mile between the present railway depot and the wharf at the Naval Academy at the deepest water. I have caused Lieutenant Hopkins, assistant professor of engineering, and well experienced in the matter of railroads, to make a survey for a fine of railroad, and find it an easy and practicable route from the depot to the wharf. I have also sent to Philadelphia for rails, cars, and workmen, with which to build the roads between Annapolis and the Junction, and I doubt not, if my acts are approved at headquarters, to be able to make a railroad communication without other carriage between tidewater at Annapolis and the capital within five days.
Acting according to your letters of instruction, I have sent forward the Sixty-ninth Regiment of New York, Colonel Corcoran, with directions to occupy the railroad from a point near the depot in Annapolis to the Junction in the manner following: Three men are stationed together, each picket within sight of the other, and once in about a mile a squad of ten men, according to the nature of the ground and the proximity of bridges, culverts, and other valuable points, on which the pickets may rely. It is believed that this regiment,, being about 1,100 strong, will be able to protect the road and the telegraph lines from further depredations.
In order to the operation of the telegraph, as there is no operator here who can be trusted, I have caused my command to be examined, and I believe I shall be able to find therein a competent operator as soon as the wires are put in order. I have also detailed Lieutenant Billings and a squad of twenty-five men to be stationed at a place called Patapsco

Ford, where I am informed the foes of law and order are making some small head. I believe these dispositions will prevent further annoyance to the railroad, and I have received from Philadelphia a corps of competent track repairers, who are now putting a destroyed bridge in order, so that I trust hereafter our communications will not be obstructed, and the regular trains will pass over the road. Acting under what I believed were the instructions from headquarters, I have pushed forward all the troops possible with more celerity than I otherwise would have dictated to Washington. I expect the arrival to-morrow or during the night of upwards of three thousand New Jersey troops, some two thousand from New York and about a thousand from Pennsylvania. These are all of which I have authentic intelligence. I do myself the honor to inclose herewith a list of the troops which have arrived and departed.
I have received what I believe to be authentic intelligence from the information of Mr. [Purnell], of Baltimore, who had the honor to receive the nomination of postmaster of that city, and who is comptroller of the State of Maryland, and whom I believe to be a loyal and true man. He states, in a personal conversation with me, that he has positive information that scaling ladders are being prepared, and that a force is being organized for the purpose of throwing up batteries on the heights, with the intention of making an assault upon Fort McHenry. This information, if true, as I believe it to be, is important.
The steam gunboat of three guns Monticello has just reported to me, and I shall be able to send up re-enforcements or supplies. A list of the stores on board that vessel I have the honor to inclose.
Unless otherwise directed I shall continue to forward supplies with what celerity I may, and troops more slowly and with more comfort to themselves.
Since I commenced writing this dispatch I have received notice from the roadmaster that the track is in good running order, but we are deficient in engines and cars, which I hope to receive from Philadelphia tomorrow.
I had the honor also to receive the order* as to the course to be pur sued in the case of the secession of Maryland. I will endeavor to carry out the orders with firmness and moderation.
Yery respectfullv, your obedient servant,
B. F. BUTLER.
Office Pennsylvania Railroad Company,
Philadelphia, April 27,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Yours of the 24th is received.! Mr. Scott left Harrisburg on the 25th to go to Washington, and I presume is with you now, unless he has fallen by the way. I congratulate you upon having secured the safety of the capital, and trust that you will as soon as possible reduce Baltimore to her allegiance. This will not be a difficult matter when they know that you are strong. The Union men of that place should be courted, and made to lead in the restoration of the city to law and order.
*******
This war can be brought to a close in ninety days, if pushed with the vigor that the people now seem disposed to sustain it.
In haste, yours, very truly,
J. EDGAR THOMSON.
