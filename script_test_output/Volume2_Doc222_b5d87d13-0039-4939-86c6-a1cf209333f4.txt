Reports of Col. Thomas Morton, Twentieth Ohio Infantry, of operations
from July 13 to 15.
Headquarters Twentieth Regiment O. Y. M.,
Oakland, Mdv July 20,1861.
Sir : On Saturday, July 13, at 11 o’clock a. m., I received your order directing me to withdraw such of the forces under my command as I might deem jjrudent from the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad between Ben wood and Grafton, and join you at Oakland, Md. Accordingly I dispatched Major Lamison over the line of said road, with instructions to withdra w from said line Companies A, F, I, and K, and proceed with them to such point as he might learn I would occupy, unless otherwise instructed. On the afternoon of same day I proceeded, with a detachment of one company of the Virginia First, Captain Britt; one company of the Virginia Second; two pieces of artillery, under Captain Daum; and Companies B and E, of the Twentieth Regiment O. V. M., to Oakland, at which place I arrived at 10 o’clock p. m. of said day. Owing to a want of the means of transportation, I was delayed at Oakland until 10 o’clock on Sunday morning, when I marched forward to the Red House, at which point I arrived at 2 o’clock p. in.,'and thence proceeded in pursuit of the rebel forces over the Northwestern turnpike, until I met you with your forces returning. While at the Red House, Major Lamison arrived with the forces under his command, having made a most orderly and rapid march, for the particulars of which I refer you to his report, a copy of which I herewith transmit. The officers and men under my command conducted themselves in the most soldierlike manner, and to their hearty co-operation and energy I am

indebted for the promptness with which they appeared at the points intended to be occupied.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Colonel, Commanding Twentieth Regiment 0. V. M, Brig. Gen. C. W. Hill,
Commanding First Brigade, First Division, U, 8. Troops,
Headquarters Twentieth Regiment O. V. M.,
Grafton, Fa., July 21,1861.
Sir: On Monday, July 15, I received your order to proceed with Companies A, Captain Nichols; B, Captain Dodds; E, Captain Mott; E, Lieutenant Taylor; I, Captain Cable; K, Lieutenant Adams, quartermaster (detailed to this special duty), of the Twentieth Begiment Ohio Volunteer Militia, and Companies---of the Twenty second Reg-
iment Ohio Volunteer Militia, under Lieutenant-Colonel Turley; one detachment of a company of the Virginia First, Captain Britt; one company of the Virginia Second, Captain Ewing, and two pieces of artillery, under the command of Captain Daum, numbering in all about 900 men, to New Creek, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and thence strike the Northwestern Virginia turnpike for the purpose of cutting off the retreat of the rebel forces passing over that road from Laurel Hill. The advanced guard, with the artillery, left Oakland at 4 o’clock p. m., under command of Major Lamison, but on account of the want of telegraphic communication was delayed by the conductor of the train until 8 o’clock p. m. within one mile of Oakland.
At 2 o’clock a. m., July 16,1 arrived at New Creek, and at 3 a. m. put my command in motion, and for the want of means of transportation, and that my movements might not be delayed, I took no baggage, except one-third of the cooking utensils and one day’s rations. We breakfasted after a march of six miles, and proceeded to Ridgeville, having learned that the enemy were in force at that place. Finding no force at that point, I proceeded, over a most rugged and difficult road, almost impassable for the artillery, to Martin’s Gap, after a march of fifteen hours, making thirty-three miles, at which place your courier reached us, ordering us to join you at Greenland, two and a half miles distant, at which place we arrived at 11 o’clock a. m. on Wednesday, July 17. J oining your forces at Martin’s Gap, I learned that the advance of the enemy, about 1,000, had encamped at that place on Sunday, July 14, about 10 o’clock a. m., and that, learning of the approach of our forces, had hastily retreated on Saturday, at 6 o’clock p. m., for Petersburg. In their retreat they destroyed the bridge over Patterson’s Greek, making the road impassable for wagons, and was therefore compelled to send my artillery around over the Northwestern turnpike, a distance of seven miles farther than pursued by my command. Being without a baggage train and ambulance, with short rations, the march was a most trying one, and to the endurance of men and officers and their cheerfulness and hearty co-operation I am indebted for the celerity of my movements, and for which all deserve much praise.
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Colonel, Commanding Twentieth Regiment 0, V. M,
