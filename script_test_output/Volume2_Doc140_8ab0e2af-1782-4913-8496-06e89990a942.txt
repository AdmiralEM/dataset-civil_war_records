No. 6.
Memorial of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.
To the honorable the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States :
The mayor* and city council of Baltimore respectfully present this their memorial:
The recent suspension of the functions of the board of police of this city makes it the duty of your memorialists to call your attention to certain consequences of that action which affect every citizen in this community. The memorial of the board of police already presented to your honorable bodies has given you full information of the nature and extent of their powers. A brief reference to certain leading features of the law of Maryland under which they hold office, and with whose execution they are charged, will enable you to appreciate the embarrassments which now affect the due administration of the government of Baltimore.
The board of police is, under the laws of Maryland, the sole police authority of the city. It alone is competent to provide for the preservation of peace and order within our limits; to appoint subordinate police officers, to appoint judges of elections, and provide for the execution of the laws regulating elections; to enforce all ordinances of the mayor and city council of Baltimore for the preservation of health and the maintenance of peace and order.
By other provisions of the laws for the police government of this city, the organization of any permanent police force other than that organized by and acting under the orders of the board of police is distinctly prohibited.
To the due execution of the laws of their State for their local government, by legally-constituted officers, the free citizens of Baltimore have an unquestioned constitutional right. The manner in which that right has been respected will appear from the facts which we now recite:
The major-general commanding in the military department of which this city forms a part issued a proclamation, dated June 27, announcing the arrest of the marshal of police. With professions of respect for every municipal regulation and public statute, the proclamation further announces to the public that the official authority of the marshal of police and the board of police is superseded, and a u provost-marshal,1 an officer unknown to the civil law of Maryland, is appointed. No charge is preferred against the members of the board of police, nor is

any reason assigned for superseding them and depriving the citizens of Baltimore of their only legal police authority.
The board of police, yielding to the force which prevented their execution of the laws of this State, submitted to the practical suspension of their functions, and neither offered nor permitted any resistance te such action as the general in command saw fit to adopt.
The provost-marshal, appointed by the general in command to execute the police laws of Maryland for the government of the city of Baltimore, took possession of the offices belonging to the city, and removed certain officials not appointed by the board, but by the mayor and city council of Baltimore, appointing others in their place.
The memorial of the board of police has presented at length the considerations of official duty which made it impossible for them either themselves to aid, or to permit the officers under their command to aid, in violations of the law under which they hold office. A comparison of the reasons assigned by them, with the provisions of the police law, to which they direct your attention, will prove the correctness of their conclusions. Under date of July 1 appeared a third proclamation of the general in command, announcing the arrest of the members of the board of police. Again disclaiming for those under whose authority he acts any intention to interfere with the municipal affairs of Baltimore, he assigns certain reasons for the summary arrest of these gentlemen whom without complaint on oath or civil process he arrested and now holds in custody. Examined in connection with the law under which they were appointed, the pretended offenses charged against them amount together to the simple performance of their official duty. Had they aided or acquiesced in the establishment of any police authority other than their own, they would have plainly violated the law under which they hold office.
By a fourth proclamation, dated July 10, the major-general in command informs the public that he has removed the u provost-marshal/7 and has appointed a u marshal of police,” in all respects to administer every department of the police law in full freedom for the peace and prosperity of the city and the honor and perpetuity of the United States. This officer now affects to administer the law for the police government of Baltimore by means of a force organized under and acting by his direction.
Whatever professions of regard for our laws accompany these transactions the facts are too plain to be concealed. The local laws of the State of Maryland for the police government of the city of Baltimore, to which all officers of the Federal Government are bound to yield obedience within our limits, have been set aside. The only officers competent to administer those laws have been superseded and then imprisoned. The general in command, professing to act under instructions from the Federal Government, has marched large bodies of armed men into the city, planted cannon in the principal streets and public squares, and, by the law and authority of superior force, has established the present acting police force, has enabled its officers to take possession of the offices and buildings belonging to the city of Baltimore, to eject officers appointed by the mayor and city council, and to assume the function of executing laws whose fundamental provisions they daily violate by the exercise of police authority. Your memorialists need not dwell on the embarrassments which must certainly result from thus disorganizing the civil government of a city, nor on the sense of insecurity which affects citizens who reflect that the present police acts without legal warrant or authority. A community thus deprived of its lawful government is en-

titled to demand that those who assume so grave a responsibility shall furnish some sufficient reason for their action. It is impossible to believe that the Federal authority have wantonly disturbed the peace and good government of the city. Yo doubt statements have been made to which credit has been given, and on the faith of which the Government has acted. The proclamation of the general in command, issued immediately after the arrest of the members of the board* of police, vaguely charges that the board u hold, subject to their orders, now and hereafter, the old police force, a large body of armed men for some purpose unknown to the Government and inconsistent with its peace and secu-rity.?? Your memorialists are left in doubt as to the precise nature of the purpose referred to, but the suspension of their authority, and the subsequent imprisonment of the board of police, seems to have been the result of a belief that their authority would be used to the injury of the Government of the United States.
That this opinion has any foundation in facts your memorialists deny, and appeal to the history of the official acts of the police authority of this city.
For a detailed account of the unhappy occurrences of the 19th April you are referred to the statement of the mayor of the city, which is herewith submitted.* FTo evidence of failure of duty on the part of the police authority on that day can be produced. The mayor, ex officio a member of the board, shared the dangers to which the troops were exposed, and both he and the marshal of police risked their lives for their protection. The great excitement which ensued, and which was intensified by the wanton killing of a citizen at a distance from the scene of the riot, and who was shot from the window of the cars as the train passed out of the city, was represented to the President by the mayor of the city. The President and his Cabinet recognized the necessity of temporarily avoiding a passage through Baltimore, and gave repeated assurances that the troops should not be brought through the city.
Unauthorized persons declaring openly their intention to cut their way through Baltimore with or without the orders of the Government, the authorities of Baltimore, as well the police board as your memorialists, called their people to arms, procured such weapons as could be hastily gathered, and did all in their power to provide for the defense of their city from the threatened danger. This they did, and this they justify, In the then excited condition of the people a portion of our population may have entertained designs of active hostility to the Government.
If such designs existed they were frustrated by the precautions of the board of police. Fort McHenry, believed to be without either a sufficient garrison or armament, was nightly guarded by the military of the city, acting under the orders of the board of police. Other Government property received especial protection. Arms, supposed to belong to the United States and found in the hands of individuals, were taken possession of and preserved by the board of police, who gave notice to the Government agents of their action. The persons and property of all citizens received equal and sufficient protection. Whatever charges malice may suggest, the preservation of peace in the city, the prevention of conflict between citizens divided in opinion, the protection of life, limb, and property during a period of great popular excitement, is a monument to the zeal and good faith of our police authorities. When there no longer seemed any necessity for a military array, the arms placed in the hands of the people were recalled, and the city resumed

its ordinary condition of quiet. So Baltimore remained until May 14, when, it being ascertained that the people were disarmed, and that the movement could be made without serious danger, the general then in command in this department occupied a portion of the city with certain troops under his command. His arrival was announced by proclamation: and in the afternoon of May 14 he sent a detachment of troops into the city, who seized and carried off arms belonging to and in the custody of the authorities of the city of Baltimore. No resistance was offered or permitted by the authorities of the city. Two of our citizens, one of them a member of the legislature of Maryland, were by the orders of the same military officer summarily arrested, and after an imprisonment of a few days were released because there existed no sufficient cause for either arrest or detention.
Since the middle of May many thousand United States soldiers have passed through this city. There has been no single instance of opposition to their progress, nor any failure on the part of the city authorities to take proper precautions for their protection as well as preserving the peace of the city. The courts of the United States are and have been unimpeded in the performance of their duties, save when in a memorable instance the marshal of the United States was not permitted to enter Fort McHenry or to serve process issued by the highest judicial officer of the United States. The order of the city has been preserved; no resistance of any kind has been made, even to illegal and unconstitutional acts of military officers: No arrest that has been made by mere military authority but that could have been made by civil officers. Thus, without the existence of a single fact to justify an appeal to a supposed authority growing out of military necessity, citizens have been seized and imprisoned, their homes invaded and searched without warrant or complaint on oath, as required by law.
The protection afforded by constitutional guarantees of the liberty of the citizen and constitutional restraints imposed on the power of the Executive has been denied. Obedience to the courts is refused when they interfere for the protection of the citizen. Arms belonging to the city of Baltimore and rightfully in the custody of its authorities have been taken. The buildings of the city have been given into the custody of officers not known to its laws. Its court-house has been occupied by troops. Its civil authority has been disregarded, and a revolutionary government established by mere force of arms and against law.
Against these manifold wrongs your memorialists, for themselves and the free community which they represent, do most solemnly protest.
The State of Maryland has been and is subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States, and her citizens are of right entitled to the protection of that Constitution and of those laws. The civil authorities of this city have heretofore, and do now, render fitting obedience to the requirements of both. If disaffection is believed to exist, from which danger is apprehended, the guns of Fort McHenry turned on the homes of the women and children of an unarmed city, the Federal troops encamped around its limits, would seem an adequate protection to the Government. Whether that disaffection is weakened by depriving a whole community of the protection of its laws, whether the risk of disorder is diminished by establishing a police government which fails to command the respect accorded to undoubted lawful authority, you in your wisdom will determine.
But your memorialists respectfully, yet most earnestly, demand, as a matter of right, that their city may be governed according to the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Maryland.

They demand as a matter of right that citizens may be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and that they be not deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. They demand as a matter of right that the military render obedience to the civil authority, that our municipal laws be respected, that officers be released from imprisonment and restored to the lawful exercise of their functions, that the police government established by law be no longer impeded by armed force to the injury of peace and order. These their rightful demands your memorialists submit for the consideration of your honorable bodies.
