Reports of Brig. Gen. Benjamin Huger, C. 8. Army.
Headquarters Forces of Virginia,
Norfolk, Va., June 6,1861.
Sir : The steamer Harriet Lane was occupied yesterday in recon-noitering our battery at Pig Point, mouth of Nansemond Biver, and this morning took up a position and opened fire upon the battery, doing but little damage and injuring no one. * The battery replied, and, after firing some twenty shots, the steamer hauled off* suddenly and proceeded to Old Point.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. HUGER, Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee, Commanding Forces of Virginia.
P. S.—One gun, a 32-pounder, burst, without injuring any one. I have sent two to replace it.
Headquarters Forces Norfolk Harbor,
Norfolk, Fa., June 7, 1861.
Sir : I have received information that, on the 5th instant, the Harriet Lane was hit twice by the battery at Pig Point. One shot struck the water-ways, passed through a tub of musket-balls, damaged the foremast, and went out through the top of the rail. Six men were wounded by the scattering of the musket balls.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. HUGER, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Report of Commander R. B. Regram, C. S. Wavy.
Pig Point Battery. June 5,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the Federal steamer Harriet Lane stood within range of this battery at 9 a. m. to-day, and, tailing a position at the distance of one and a half miles, commenced firing upon us with shot and shell from her 11-inch shell-gun and 32-pounders. She fired about thirty-three shot and shell, many of them well directed, but no one of our party was hurt, nor did the fortifications sustain any injury. A 32-pounder shot struck the muzzle of one of our 8-inch shell-guns and cracked it from the face to the chase ring. The gun at the same time was run in for loading, and, although the shot was broken in three fragments in the midst of our men, no one sustained the slightest injury. A number of shells exploded near and around us, but all fell harmless to the ground. In return we fired twenty-three shot and shell 5 four or five were seen to take effect in the hull of the steamer, and, I am inclined to believe, did her some injury, from the manner in which she moved off.
For men who had never before been in action, the Portsmouth Bifles were remarkably cool and self-possessed, and, after a few rounds, got the range of the enemy and fired admirably well. Every officer and man behaved in the most spirited and creditable manner, and were so regardless of danger, that I had often to interpose my authority to prevent their exposing themselves unnecessarily to the enemy’s fire. The action lasted about fifteen or twenty minutes.
I am, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,
R. B. PEGRAM, Commander, Virginia Wavy.

JUNE 7, 1861.—Reconnaissance from Yorktown to Newport News, Va.
Report of Capt. W. RL. Werth, Chatham Grays, Virginia Cavalry.
Camp Yorktown, June 12,1861.
Sir : I beg leave to make the following report of a reconnaissance made by me of the enemy’s position at Hewport Hews on Friday, 7th June, 1861:
I had under my command twenty picked men and horses from the Old Dominion Dragoons, together with two men from my company. Captain Philips accompanied me, as did Lieutenant Cary and Lieutenant Harrison, the latter from the Charles City Cavalry. My object was to make a close examination of the enemy’s works at Hewport Hews, which I knew would be of service to you in your future movements. I did not start with the intention of pressing my men into certain ruin by an attack upon an overwhelming force, but simply to make a reliable reconnaissance. At about 1 o’clock I had approached the enemy’s position to within two miles. I, Captain Philips, and two men were in advance of the detachment some four hundred yards, whilst two men marched the same distance in rear.

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX
At this juncture I saw a squad of eight men on the bank of James River, and distant from me some distance, probably a mile and a half. I examined them with my glass, and knew them to be soldiers. They immediately fled toward their fortifications. I saw at once that if I allowed them to reach the works and give the alarm, my whole command might be cut off and my reconnaissance broken up, so I at once ordered a forward movement at speed so that J might cut them off. Our advance party of five being better mounted, and having so much the start, distanced the detachment in running the two miles, and placed them probably six hundred yards in the rear. When our little advance party had ridden to within seven hundred yards of Newport News fortifications, I ordered Captain Philips and the two men of the advance guard to change direction to the right, so that he might get between the eight fugitives and the works, whilst I continued my direct advance upon the works, thinking if Captain Philips failed to intercept these men that I should certainly meet them.
After I had approached the fortifications of the enemy to within four hundred yards, I turned to the right (the James River side) to head the eight men. I had gone in this direction probably two or three hundred yards, when suddenly I came up to within fifty yards of a party of the enemy engaged in cutting wood. I was then entirely alone. I halted and hid myself behind a thicket only twenty yards from the party. Here I remained long enough to count the number of men, distinguish the officers, &c. In about three minutes the eight men (whom Captain Philips had failed to intercept) raised the alarm in the Massachusetts regiment (which was encamped outside of the works, and not more than one hundred and sixty yards from the spot where I stood), and I at once saw that I must do quickly whatever I intended doing, so I reined my horse back, and walked him out into the clearing in plain view of the whole party, and not more than twenty paces from them, picked out the commissioned officer, and shot him dead in his tracks. The whole party then yelled, “Look out, look out for the d-^—d Virginia horsemen; they are down upon us,” &c., and at once threw down everything they had, and commenced a retreat at a double quick. I put the spurs to my horse and rode into them at full speed (giving at the same time a loud walla-walla war-whoop), and then delivered my second shot, which brought another man (a private) dead to the ground. (I shot the first one through the heart, and the last one under the right shoulder-blade.)
My horse by this time became totally unmanageable, and my third fire missed its aim, but killed a sorrel mule. I fired only these three shots. The party consisted of twenty-seven privates of infantry, two privates of artillery, one commissioned officer, and one non-commissioned officer of infantry—in all, thirty-one. Their uniform corresponded with mine—gray cloth with black trimming. Captain Philips and his party of two men had been joined in the mean time by the main party, and I soon crossed over to them. We then galloped after the retreating enemy, but saw one or two companies from the regiment running to the rescue, which induced me to apprehend an attack. In this I was mistaken, for instead of the party of thirty-one rallying in the two companies, the two companies partook of the panic, and rushed back towards the fortifications, yelling “Virginia horsemen” as long as I staid to hear them. The party of thirty-one had their arms stacked against a tree, whilst four of them were on guard with their muskets. I cannot say whether the guard fired or not. I did not pay much attention to them. The two companies which came to the rescue had their muskets, but forgot to fire. On the left wing of the encampment there was a field

battery of two brass 12-pounders, unlimbered, which were not over one hundred and fifty or one hundred and sixty yards from us, but the gunners had abandoned the battery. If I had not been so entirely at the mercy of the guns of the fortifications at Newport News (only about six hundred yards off), I should certainly have burned the whole encampment, for it is my firm impression the whole regiment ran into the works and abandoned everything.
Captain Philips, I must say, proved upon this occasion that he was a man of consummate coolness and bravery, and his men are of that kind of metal which can be relied upon under any and all circumstances. Lieutenants Cary and Harrison were prepared for anything, and I am convinced would have followed to any place where their horses could have leaped.
In making the approach I went by New Market Bridge and St. Clair’s Steam Mill, but upon returning I took a new road through the woods, fearing the troops from Hampton had formed an ambuscade for my reception. I returned to Bethel by 6 o’clock without damage, and then joined my command on Poquosin Biver.
