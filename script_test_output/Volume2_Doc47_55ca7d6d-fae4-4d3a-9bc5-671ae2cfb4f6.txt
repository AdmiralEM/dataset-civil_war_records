No. 1.
Reports of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, XI. S. Army.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Cincinnati, May 27, 1861.
Colonel: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the General-in-Chief’s letter of the 21st, * together with telegram of the 24th and 26th. My time has been so much occupied, both by day and night, that I have been unable to reply to the General’s letter, nor can I at the present moment do more than acknowledge its receipt.
I was engaged in maturing plans to carry out the General’s telegraphic instructions, when I learned by telegram that two bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, near Farmington Station, had been burned on Saturday night. I received this information late yesterday afternoon at Camp Dennison. I at once returned to the city. Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Volunteers, with his own regiment and four companies of the Second, are ordered by telegraph to move without delay from Wheeling towards Fairmont, guarding the bridges as they proceed. Colonel Irvine, Sixteenth Ohio, at Bellaire, was ordered to support the movement. Colonel Steedman, Fourteenth Ohio, supported by the Eighteenth and two light guns, was ordered to occupy Parkersburg and the lines of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, towards Grafton. I should premise that I had received information that the rebels intended to destroy the rest of the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.
* Letter not found. For telegrams see 1‘ Correspondence, etc.,’7 post.

I inclose copies of my telegraphic and written orders to these officers; also of a proclamation ordered to be distributed among the inhabitants as the troops advance, and of an address to be issued to the troops. These are very hurriedly prepared, but I hope they will meet the approval of the Lieutenant-General.
Colonel Kelley left Wheeling at about 7 a. m. to-day. Colonel Irvine crossed to Benwood at about 10 o’clock. Colonel Steedman moved to Parkersburg at about 10 o’clock. By telegraph this morning I directed the necessary supplies to re-establish the telegraphic communication, and to repair the bridges, &c., to be forwarded at once from Wheeling.
General Morris holds himself ready to move from Indianapolis, on receipt of telegraphic orders, with from two to live regiments, should it become necessary. The regiments at Camp Dennison are in the midst of the process of reorganization for three years’ service. By to-morrow night one fine regiment will be ready to move, and the others will soon be prepared. I hope, however, that the force already detailed towards Grafton will suffice for the end in view. I telegraphed this morning to Major Oakes, making him an acting aide-de-camp temporarily, that he might be able to interfere authoritatively should it prove necessary.
Hoping that my course will meet the approval of the General,
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. B. McCLELLAK,
Major-General, TI. 8. Army, Commanding Department.
Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—Kothing is yet known by the public of this movement. I have thus far succeeded in keeping it secret, and hope to do so until Grafton is occupied or the troops considerably advanced.
P. P. S.—Have this instant heard from Colonel Kelley, as follows:
Mannington, Ya.
Agreeably to your orders, I left my camp this morning at 5 o’clock with my regiment and Capt ain Hayes’ company of the Second Regiment. Just arrived here without accident or casualty. Found the road in good order. Bridges all safe, and guarded by the railroad-company men and loyal citizens. Will move forward four miles to the burned bridges. This town will be occupied by Colonel Irvine, who follows. We wiU repair bridges soon as possible.
I also hear that Parkersburg is occupied and all quiet.

Instructions to Col. B. F. Kelley, First Virginia Infantry.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Cincinnati, May 26,1861.
Col. B. E. Kelley, First Regiment Virginia Volunteers;
Colonel: I have telegraphed you this evening, instructing you to make a forward movement on Fairmont. The principal reason for this order was the burning of the bridges, which caused me to anticipate, by some two or three days, the more carefully-prepared measures I had contemplated, with the intention of not only securing the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad, but also of driving all the armed secessionists out of Western Virginia.
In your present movement you will be careful to run no unnecessary risk, for it is absolutely necessary that we should not meet even with a

partial check at the outset. If you find yourself in front of any hostile force that, either by superiority of numbers, position, or artillery, is likely to render an attack doubtful, you will remain in observation, and at once send for assistance, which can be promptly rendered to any desirable extent. The chief object of your advance is to prevent any further destruction of the railroad. You will not move on Grafton without restoring the bridges in your rear, unless you receive positive information that Colonel Steedman’s command has actually reached Grafton, or a neighboring point, where you can without doubt unite with him.
Colonel Steedman occupies Parkersburg to morrow morning with two regiments, and will then proceed to take possession of the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as far towards Grafton as he can with safety.
You will exercise the utmost vigilance in preserving the discipline of your men, see that the property and rights of the inhabitants are in every respect carefully protected, and use every effort to conciliate the people and strengthen the Union feeling. You will at once make a requisition upon the chief quartermaster of this department for such supplies as may be necessary for your command. In the mean time, make the best use you can of the means now in your possession. Colonel Irvine will be under your orders.
With every confidence that you will leave nothing undone to carry out the very delicate and important duty with which you are intrusted, I am, colonel, very respectfully,
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General) U. 8. Army, Commanding Department,
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Cincinnati) May 26, 1861.
Col. B. F. Kelley,
First Regiment Virginia Volunteers) Wheeling:
If you have reliable information that bridges of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad have been burned, you will at once procure transportation on that railroad, and move your whole command, including the separate companies of Virginia volunteers not attached to your regiment, as near to Fairmont as can be done without endangering the safety of your command. Leave a sufficient guard to protect the bridges and other structures most liable to destruction* Colonel Irvine, of the Sixteenth Ohio, is ordered to cross the river and support you. Telegraph me constantly as to the state of affairs, and how much support you need. Conduct the preliminaries of your movement with as much secrecy as possible, and see that the telegraph conveys no intimation of it in any direction. Consult Major Oakes freely. The move must be made with the greatest promptness to secure the bridges. Take at least one week’s rations. Accouterments will follow you to-morrow. I count on your prudence and courage. Preserve the strictest discipline. See that the rights and property of the people are respected, and repress all attempts at negro insurrection.
