[Chap. IX.
Notwithstanding a fatiguing march of seven to eight hours, we maintained the position assigned us, and the general commanding conceded to Rhode Island, upon the field, the honor of not only frustrating the attempts of a vastly superior force to outflank our left, but driving back in confusion their right flank.
In the retreat resulting from the turning of the right flank of our Army by the enemy, the regiment was brought off in good order, with the brigade to which it was attached, without further serious casualty other than the excessive fatigue arising from and natural to a march of some forty miles in fifteen to sixteen hours.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOS. P. BALOH,
Major, Commanding First Regiment Rhode Island Vols. Lieut. 0. H. Merriman,
Acting Asst. Adjt. Gen., Second Brigade, Second Division.
