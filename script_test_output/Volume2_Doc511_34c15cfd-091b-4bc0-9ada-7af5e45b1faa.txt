I.	In conformity with instructions from the headquarters of Virginia forces, volunteer companies of infantry and riflemen will be received into the service of the State for the period of one year from April 25, 1861, from the counties of Richmond, Northumberland, and Lancaster, preparatory to instruction, at or near the court-houses of the respective counties, or such other points as may be designated 5 and also companies of volunteers, organized and armed as above specified, will be received in the counties of Essex and Middlesex for the same period of service, for instruction, in the vicinity of Tappahannock and Urbana. Companies of volunteer artillery and cavalry already organized, armed, and equipped according to law will be reported by their captains in person or by mail directly to these headquarters for special instructions.
II.	The companies of volunteers presenting themselves are expressly enjoined to conform in every essential particular in their organization, armament, and equipment to the requirements stated in the instructions for mustering volunteers into service, from Inspector-General Baldwin, dated April 30, 1861, for which application may be made directly to the inspector-general of the State or to the inspector at these headquarters. As companies are reported organized by their captains at these headquarters, or at such other points as may be designated, an

inspector will be directed at an appointed time to muster them into the service of the State.
III. The policy of the State, as clearly indicated by the proclamation of the governor and the ordinances of the Convention, is to rely mainly on the organized and disciplined volunteer forces, in conjunction with the Provisional Army of Virginia. The readiness with which the people of this department have responded to the call for volunteers induces the hope that, save upon the emergency of actual invasion, the militia will not be called out; but, should that contingency arise before precise instructions are communicated, full reliance will "be placed on the bold hearts and stong arms of a united people to make each house a citadel, and every rock and tree positions of defense, thus efficiently aiding the organized forces, by communicating by telegraph and concentrating by railway at the endangered point in such numbers as to sweep from our borders the insolent invaders. Called to command a border district of Virginia, now threatened with invasion and subjugation by a lawless tyranny, which, over a violated Constitution, would march to conquest and carnage, it is esteemed not less the post of honor than of danger. Brave and loyal men of that district which has given to freedom a Washington, Madison, Monroe, Lee, Mercer, and others, whom, both in camp and council, the world has recognized as among the noblest defenders of constitutional liberty, you are called upon to rally for the defense of your homes and firesides $ your wives and children 5 the ashes of your mighty dead$ the freedom purchased by your fathers7 blood, and the soil and sovereignty of your proud old Commonwealth. Give force and efficiency to your patriotic ardor by the aid of discipline and organization 5 substitute prudence and policy for passion/ and by your devotion to liberty, regulated by law, vindicate before the nations your claim to exercise the inalienable right of self-government.

Headquarters,
Gloucester Point, Van May 11,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
General: I have the honor to report that the condition of the defenses at this place has greatly improved since my last communication. Two heavy 9-inch guns have been placed in position at the water battery at the extremity of the point, and we have the means of preventing a landing from boats, as the work and the shore line are protected by the field guns of Captains Cabell and Brown7s batteries. Two additional 9-inch guns have been sent here this morning, and will be placed in battery with all dispatch.
I have directed the quartermaster to erect huts on the most economical plan, for the accommodation of the troops, which work is making much progress, and I hope to be at least able to protect the whole command from the weather by this evening.
Major Page has mustered into the service two companies of infantry,, numbering one hundred and fifty-eight men, and one of artillery, numbering ninety men, which is the whole force yet mustered from the counties of King and Queen and Gloucester. Believing it necessary to concentrate as many men as possible here, on the evening of the 7th I ordered here a company of cavalry, and have retained them until this time. I have thought it advisable to direct Major Page to muster this

troop into service, as the character of the country to be defended renders it necessary to have the co-operation of a small cavalry force to act as scouts and vedettes, the more particularly to give confidence to the people along the shores and creeks, who are apprehensive of forays. This muster has not yet been completed, and, should you regard this force as unnecessary, they can be discharged frpm service, with but small loss for their support during the limited time they have served.
I would respectfully suggest that a force be stationed at Yorktown and batteries erected there. I understand that Major Ewell is in command of a battalion on that side of the river, and that my command is limited to this. I have not had any official communication with him, and desire to be advised of the fact of the extent of his command. I would suggest that his headquarters be established at Yorktown, so that we could co-operate.
I have, in conclusion, to say that I have not received from the head-quarters of the Army, or any other source, an order or official communication of any kind, with the exception of your letter of the 8th instant, and the order assigning me to duty, which was exhibited to me in Eichmond. I presume the derangement of the mails has been the cause of this, and I ask that copies be forwarded to me, via West Point.

Colonel : Yours of the 9th instant is at hand. Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne has been instructed to call out and muster into service five regiments of infantry or riflemen, and one of cavalry, from the counties for which Lynchburg was appointed the rendezvous by the governors proclamation of the 3d instant. One thousand percussion muskets, with equipments and ammunition, as far as they can be supplied, will be sent to Lynchburg for such companies as may come there unarmed. To the cavalry companies, which may offer themselves unarmed, it is recommended to provide themselves with double-barreled shot guns, buck-shot cartridges, and pistols. The supply of cavalry arms and equipments here is nearly exhausted. It is left with Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne to determine the proportion of companies to be drawn from the different counties of his district. If the cavalry companies cannot get arms, they will have to be mustered in as infantry or riflemen.

pared against any immediate attack, to review your lines of defense, strengthen, improve, and enlarge them, as necessity and opportunity may permit, and apply all your means and use every exertion to the instruction and discipline of your men, and prepare them for hard and active service. With this view, they should be placed at or near the points where their services will be required in case of an attack and be prepared and habituated to the necessities of service. Is the revetment of Fort Norfolk sufficiently protected by earthern-covered ways, and are the parapets of all your redoubts sufficiently thick and high to resist heavy shot and protect the men within ? If not, they had better be strengthened and every measure taken to give confidence and security
to the men.
In the fabrication of musket cartridges at this point we are now obliged to use coarse powder for want of musket powder. As you have a large amount of cartridges on hand, you are desired to send ten barrels of musket powder, as soon as possible, to Colonel Dimmock, at this place. Telegraphed to this effect to-day.

Col. T. J. Jackson,
Commanding, &c., Harper’s Ferry, Va. :
Colonel : I have just received your letter of the 11th instant, by Colonel Bennett. I am concerned at the feeling evinced in Maryland, and fear it may extend to other points, besides opposite Shepherdstown. It will be necessary, in order to allay it, that you confine yourself to a strictly defensive course. I presume the points occupied by you at Point of Bocks, Berlin, and Shepherdstown are on our side. I am glad to hear that volunteers are assembling. Over two thousand arms have already been sent to you, and one thousand more have been ordered this evening. If you only expect to receive sufficient volunteers to swell your force to four thousand five hundred men, I do not see how you can require five thousand arms, as you must now have nearly three thousand armed, besides the three thousand arms, above mentioned, ordered to you. We have no rifles or cavalry equipments. The latter may use double-barreled shot-guns and buck-shot, if no better arms can be procured. I will see to the quartermaster. I fear no field battery can be sent you besides that now preparing. The Fourth Begiment Alabama troops, from Lynchburg, have gone to you, and I have ordered two others from the same point. Ammunition has also been ordered to you. You know our limited resources, and must abstain from all provocation for attack as long as possible.

it refers. Your change of rank has resulted from the action of the Convention. Before the termination of its session an ordinance was passed requiring all appointments in the military service by the governor to be submitted to the Convention for confirmation. The Convention also determined, as I have understood, to reduce the number of the higher grades in the service, which resulted in the renomination by the governor, by and with the advice of the council, of several officers for appointments to grades one degree lower than those to which they had been originally appointed. General Gwynn’s, General Johnston’s, General Buggies’, yours, and others were of this number. Another ordinance of the Convention gave to officers of the Provisional Army rank above those of the volunteer forces of the same grade, and subjected them to duty with the volunteers until required for service with the Provisional Army. Colonel Buggies and Colonel Terrett having been appointed in the Provisional Army, it was incumbent on me to recognize their rank. It therefore became necessary to change your command, which I did with regret. Of the circumstances attending it I supposed you were cognizant, as the action of the Convention, I think, occurred before your last visit to this city.
When Colonel Jackson was sent to Harper’s Perry, it was to muster into service the companies there assembled, with a view of organizing a force as rapidly as possible to hold that point. Hence he was not directed to report in person to you on his route, as that would have occasioned delay, though it was well understood that Harper’s Perry was embraced within your command. At the present time, as well as for the reasons given in Special Orders, NTo. 39, it was deemed advisable to give to the commander at Harper’s Ferry command of that station, without reference to any other question. I hope you will perceive, from the foregoing explanation, which has been necessarily brief, that the change in your command was dictated by necessity and not by choice. In assigning the officers within your former district to their present posts, I was guided entirely by the convenience of the service and a desire to hasten the organization of the troops. It is temporary, and designed to meet the exigencies of the occasion. As to yourself, I desired to have the benefit of your knowledge of the troops and officers called from the extensive country assigned to you, in their organization and equipment, and hoped the service would be as agreeable to you as I believe it will be beneficial to the public. Becognizing as fully as I do your merit, patriotism, and devotion to the State, I do not consider that either rank or position are necessary to bestow upon you honor, but believe that you will confer honor on the position. In the present crisis of affairs, I know that your own feelings, better than any words of mine, will point out the best course for you to pursue to advance the cause in which you are engaged, and to promote the interests of the service, which you have so much at heart, and will leave to the voice of your fellow-citizens to assign to you the position you deserve.
I am, with high respect and esteem, your obedient servant,

Six hundred rifles, in addition to the four hundred of which you were already notified, have been ordered to be sent from Staunton to the care of Major Goff, Virginia volunteers, at Beverly, which will be subject to Colonel Porterfield’s orders. I regret to hear of the difficulties mentioned in your letter of mustering troops at and in the vicinity of Grafton, but hope that by perseverance you will overcome them. Major Goff has been directed to muster troops in Randolph and "adjacent counties, and it is hoped he will be enabled to obtain a sufficient number for the purposes mentioned in your letter, as it is deemed unadvisable to send troops from the east for the present.

General : Your letter of the 10th, requesting authority to call into service an additional cavalry company, has been received. It was supposed that four mounted companies would be sufficient for the service at Norfolk, as their duty would be mainly vedette. Your water communications and system of signals, it was hoped, would enable you to lighten that service. It is an expensive force, difficult in that region to forage, and should not be increased beyond the actual necessities of the service. Should another company, however, be indispensable, you are authorized to call it out. It may be proper for you to keep in mind that there are no cavalry arms here for issue; so, unless it be already provided with arms, it cannot be equipped.

Your field batteries should be provided with horses and a full equipment for field service, and the men thoroughly instructed.

Headquarters Potomac Department,
Culpeper Court-House, Fa., May 14,1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General:
Sir: I report, for the information of the General-in-Chief, that I returned to this place on Sunday morning, the 12th instant, from Manassas Junction, where I had gone to examine "the position and the country around, and to make arrangements for gathering a force there for the defense of the place. My observations of the country were mainly directed towards the Potomac, on the right flank, and I And the head of tide, at Occoquan, approached within eighteen miles of Manassas. Mr. John Grant, my acting engineer and topographical draughtsman^ was sent forward with a guide, to examine the roads towards Occoquan, while I myself rode over the most direct road, to a point where it crosses the Occoquan River, seven or eight miles to the right of Manassas Junction. Mr. Grant subsequently pursued this latter road to the village or landing of Occoquan, the head of tide, and I can report that the country upon these routes, covering the right flank of the position at Manassas Junction, is quite favorable for defensive operations, the same being broken or undulating, covered with dense forests of second-growth pines or of original oak, except here, and small fields or farms, the roads very narrow (mere ditches), and everywhere such as to render artillery and cavalry of our enemy on the march of little use to him, while the cover of forests, hills, and ravines make a fortress for brave men and riflemen in which to carry on the destructive guerrilla warfare upon any marching columns from that side. Nevertheless the proximity of the Potomac River, on that side, from Manassas Junction to Alexandria, will ever require extreme vigilance and precaution to cover the right of that line from flank attack at other points, where the ways may be more open and inviting.
The force that I have been enabled to assemble thus far at Manassas Junction consists of a detachment of artillery, under Capt. D. Kemper, with two 6-pounders,* Capt. W. H. Payne’s company, numbering 76 men; Capt. J. S. Green’s company, numbering 57 men; Captain Hamilton’s company, numbering about 60, and two Irish companies, numbering, respectively, 54 and 58, and Colonel Garland’s force, arrived Sunday, consisting of 490 men. Altogether, about 830 men. Also Captain Marr’s company, 88 Warren ton Riflemen. Total, 918. The Powhatan Troop, under Captain Lay, has been ordered back here, and will arrive to-day.
Should Colonel Terrett make Manassas his headquarters, he will doubtless go on to strengthen it with forces to be gathered within the large and populous district assigned to his immediate command. I have advised Colonel Terrett, through a letter yesterday, addressed to him, not to leave Alexandria himself until he shall be well satisfied that his next in command there will be a man of cool, firm, and otherwise able character, to hold that important outpost so long as it be possible for brave men to hold it.
The General-in-Chief may be assured that I will make all practicable eiforts to bring about the speedy assembling, mustering into service, organizing, drilling, and disciplining of the volunteers on my whole line, and to draw from this source as rapidly as possible, to strengthen the main positions on this line—a line which even now remains almost wholly open to the enemy, should he decide to march with any force upon it. Indeed, it would seem highly expedient, in view of the now openly acknowledged and accepted state of war on the part of the

S. guard, and demanded an explanation of the firing. He stated that it was not from his men. His orders were to stop supplies, suspicious persons, and to act upon the defensive. I then sent a messenger to the mayor of Georgetown, demanding an explanation of him. Received in reply, through superintendent of police, that the corporate authorities would punish

The officers directed to report to me are not present $ nor is there any volunteer or other force here. I will at once proceed to ascertain the whereabouts of Major Goff’s command, which I hope to find soon, and will then endeavor to unite with one or more companies, with which I will return and take position in or near this place. On account of the sparseness of the population here, it will be difficult to get the various companies to act in concert.
After my return I would desire as soon as possible to be re-enforced by a detachment of not less than two hundred and fifty men and a few pieces of artillery, if they can be spared from the command at Harper’s Ferry.

There are at this place three tenements, owned and inhabited by citizens ; these houses are necessary for the accommodation of the sick and for depots for quartermaster’s and commissary stores. These citizens refuse to leave them or to rent them to the government for any reasonable sum.
I have no hospital yet established, and there is no means of providing other hospital accommodations than those afforded by huts, and it is essential to have a ventilated building for this purpose, and it is important to have control of all the tenements within the limit of our lines. I believe an exorbitant rent would be charged, and perhaps a spirit of resistance to military interference would prevent the possibility of renting at any price.
I ask instructions as to the powers I possess under the law.
An armed vessel of the United States steamed into York River yesterday, and approached within some three miles of our works. She did not, however, venture to approach nearer, but seemed to be engaged in sounding the channel at the mouth of the river. No boats were sent out from her and no attempt made to land troops; other steamers of the enemy have been observed in Mobjack Bay and just without the mouth of York River.
Our water battery is now armed with three 9-inch guns, and the men have been constantly instructed in the working of the guns by Oapt. T. J. Page, of the Navy.
Should the enemy land in force on this side of York River, either on the York or the waters of Severn, it would be necessary to resist them with a much larger force of infantry than that now at this post.
There are but two infantry companies here, and the light batteries are without horses.
For so small a command as there now is here, and I see no probability of its being increased materially for some time, I beg to suggest the necessity of fortifying the land approaches in our rear, and I ask that, should it meet the approbation of the general commanding in chief, a military engineer be ordered here to plan and lay out the works.
I have found it entirely impossible, from the absence of all accommodations for the troops and from the constant detail of almost the entire strength every day for work in landing and placing in position the heavy guns, to effect a proper organization, or to devote much time to drill or instructions.
No blank forms have as yet been received, and I ask that you will forward them. I have no blank requisitions, and suppose it is unnecessary to forward a requisition. I will send receipt if necessary.

Sir : Having been appointed a brigadier-general in the Army of the Confederate States, you have been assigned by the War Department to the command of the troops near Harper’s Ferry. In proceeding to that point the Secretary of War directs that you take Lynchburg in your route, and make arrangements there for sending forward to Har-

Col. P. St. George Cocke,
Commanding, c6c., Culpeper Court-Rouse, Fa.;
Colonel : I have received your letter of the 14th instant, and am gratified at your arrangements for the defense of Manassas Junction, and the favorable account you give of the country towards the Potomac for defensive operations. I hope, by a judicious use of its natural obstacles, that the march of a hostile column will be much embarrassed. I have to request that you will endeavor to fill up Colonel Garland’s and Colonel Preston’s regiments from the companies that will report to you, as desired in my letter of the 10th instant, and as soon as you are able to form other regiments that you will send such re-enforcements to Manassas Junction as in your judgment may be necessary or as may be requested by Colonel Terrett. Please direct the troops you may send to the Junction to report to Colonel Garland, and place them under Colonel Terrett’s orders. I beg leave also to request that you will give to Colonel Terrett the benefit of your information and advice respecting the troops and country in which he is operating. It is desired to strengthen that whole line as rapidly as the organization of troops will admit, to resist any attack from the forces at Washington. Hitherto it was impossible to concentrate an adequate force for the defense of Alexandria, an abortive attempt at which would, in my opinion, have had no other effect than to hazard the destruction of the city. The posts at Norfolk and Harper’s Ferry, which seemed to be first threatened, being in some measure fortified, our resources can now be applied to your line of operations. Should an advance be made on Colonel Terrett, or an intention be manifested to seize the Manassas Junction, you are desired to sustain Colonel Terrett with your whole force. Respectfully, &c.,
E. E. LEE,
Major-General, Commanding.
Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Fl, May 15, 1861. Col. George H. Terrett, Alexandria, Va. :
Colonel: I have requested Colonel Cocke to fill up Colonel Garland’s regiment, stationed at Manassas Junction, from companies called by him into the service of the State, and, as soon as he can organize other regiments, to send such re-enforcements to that point as he may deem necessary or you require. It will be necessary for you to give particular attention to the defense of that point, and to organize your force in front of it, to oppose, as far as your means will allow, any advance into the country from Washington. It is not expected possible, with the troops at present under your command, that you will be able

to resist successfully any attempt to occupy Alexandria, but you may prevent tlie extension of marauders into the country and the advance of troops on the railroad. Should you discover an intention to seize the Manassas Junction, you will notify Colonel Cocke, who will advance to sustain you, and you will, with his and your whole force, oppose it. It will be necessary to watch the approaches on your right from the Potomac, as the distance from Occoquan, which point may be reached in boats, is not more than eighteen or twenty miles from Manassas Junction. You are again requested to urge forward the organization and equipment of your troops, and to see that your officers labor diligently at the instruction and discipline, and be prepared to take the field at any moment.
Respectfully, &c.,
R. E. LEE,
