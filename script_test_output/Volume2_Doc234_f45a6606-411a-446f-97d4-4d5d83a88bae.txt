No. 10.
Instructions from General Lee to General Jackson.
Headquarters of the Forces,
Richmond, Fa., July 16, 1861. Brig. Gen. H. B. Jackson, Monterey, Va.:
General: In the dispatch of the 14th instant yon were directed to take command of the available troops of the Northwestern Army, and oppose the advance of the enemy. I infer, from your dispatch from Monterey of this date, that our troops have retreated to that point. It is important that the passes of the Cheat Mountain, or at least those of the Alleghany, should, if practicable, be defended, to prevent the advance of the epemy by the road through Huntersville to Jacksonâ€™s Biver and Miilborough, where he would obtain command of the Virginia Central Baiiroad. Be-enforcements for the Northwest are collecting at Staunton, and I shall leave here on the 18th instant to join them.
Bespectfully,
B. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
