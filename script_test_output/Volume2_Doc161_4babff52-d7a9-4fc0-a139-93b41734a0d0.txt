Report of Lieut. D. D. Perkins, Fourth JJ. S. Artillery.
Camp near Martinsburo, Va., July 4,1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of my operations in the affair of the 2d instant. My battery of light artillery, Company F, of the Fourth Regiment, IT. S. Army, having been assigned by sections to the different columns, I remained with the center section (Lieutenant Martin’s), composed of two 6-pounder guns. A few miles after crossing the Potomac firing commenced on the right, with Colonel Abercrombie’s brigade, and by direction of Col. George H. Thomas, commanding brigade to which I had been assigned, I proceeded as rapidly as possible to the front, and took position in a wheat field on the left of the main road. Here, not finding any occasion to place my guns in battery, I passed on, inclining to the right through several fields, up to a thick wood, which afforded cover for a body of the enemy’s skirmishers. With the assistance of Colonel Dare and Colonel Ballier, commanding regiments, in support, this place was soon cleared, and I moved along the edge of the wood, when, by direction of Colonel Thomas, who vis-

itecl my section at that time, I struck into the main road, and continued in it thereafter.
A quarter of a mile beyond the point where I entered the road, I was informed at a farm-house that a considerable force of the rebels had passed about ten minutes before. Striking into a gallop, I took my section as far ahead of its support as I dared, and halted until I could get sight of its approach. Immediately I was visited by two officers of the enemy. I went out to meet them. We brought our horses together, and shook hands quite cordially, when they asked me what company I belonged to and how far u the boys ” were behind. I answered so as to allay any suspicion they might have that I was not one of their own party, and endeavored to detain them, for neither I nor my section were provided with small-arms. At first they appeared satisfied that my pieces formed a part of their own flying artillery. Suddenly they somehow discovered their error, and, bending, over their horses’ necks, ran away at the utmost speed. As soon as could be done in a narrow road, I put my pieces in battery and discharged some canister then some spherical case-shot, at them and their retreating friends, with what effect I do not know. I then returned to camp.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
D. D. PERKINS,
First Lieut. Fourth Artillery, Comdg. Co. F, Fourth Artillery.

Report of i!lay. Gen. W. H. Keim, Pennsylvania Militia.
Second Division Headquarters,
Camp Brown, Martinsburg, 7h., July 8, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to transmit to you the reports of the First Regiment Wisconsin Yolunteers, Col. John C. Starkweather, and the Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Yolunteers, Col. P. Jarrett, received through Col. J. J. Abercrombie, officer commanding Sixth Brigade, Second Division, U. S. Army. The details are given so clearly, it is not necessary to dilate upon that subject.
The enemy had the advantage of position and local information. Posted so as to command the approach of the brigade under Colonel Abercrombie, they opened fire near Hoke’s Run, beyond Falling Waters, six miles from Williamsport, Md. The Wisconsin regiment, in the advance, promptly responded to the attack, supported by the Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Yolunteers, until Captain Perkins’ battery was placed in position. When united, a galling fire was opened upon them. Captain McMullin’s Rangers, the First City Troop, Captain James, and Colonel Thomas’ command maintained a position under fire with great firmness.
Col. J. J. Abercrombie, commanding the brigade, deserves great credit for the skill and the masterly manner in which he handled the troops. I beg you will report him favorably to the War Department. The presence of the commanding general, Maj. Gen. Robert Patterson, and staff, was of essential service. It infused life and spirit into the different commands. With the eye of the commander upon them, they acted bravely and with great steadiness, considering the short time of service and with inexperienced volunteers.

Report of Col. J. J. Abercrombie, Seventh U. S. Infantry.
Headquarters Sixth Brigade, July 8,1861.
General : I have the honor to inclose the reports of Colonels Starkweather and Jarrett, of the First Wisconsin and Eleventh Pennsylvania Kegiments, relative to the combat of the 2d of this month. The troops composing the Sixth Brigade, including Captain McMullin’s Bangers, acquitted themselves with much credit, both to officers and men. Captain Hudson’s section of the Light Battery, and the City Troop, under Captain James, aided materially in driving the enemy from the field.
With trifling exceptions, much praise is due the Pennsylvania Eleventh, Colonel Jarrett, and Wisconsin First, Colonel Starkweather. The colonels of these regiments displayed great coolness and activity in getting and maintaining their positions in line to the close of the conflict.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Report of Col. John C. Starkweather, First Wisconsin Infantry.
Hdqrs. 1st Regt. Wis. Vols., 2d Div., 6th Brig., Martinsburg, Va.y July 4,1861.
Dear Sir : I have the honor of reporting for your information and that of the War Department, that on the 2d day of July, 1861, when en route for Martinsburg, within a short distance of Hoke’s Bun, at about 10 o’clock a. m. of that day, First Regiment WisconsmTolunteers being in advance of the column’s main body, I detailed Company B, Capt. H. A. Mitchell, to deploy to the right and left of the road as skirmishers in advance of the column, being sustained on the road by the cavalry. After such deployment had been made and an advance forward of about a quarter of a mile, firing was heard in continued long volleys from a large body of the enemy’s troops, which was well replied to by Company B and McMullin’s Bangers. The strength of the enemy being too great, however, for the skirmishers engaged, I deployed Company A, Capt. George B. Bingham, to their assistance, and kept them all in position, doing great execution, until ordered, to fall back slowly, so as to allow the artillery to work more effectually, who

had in the mean time been placed in position on the right. The companies rallied upon the center, and fell back slowly and in perfect order, keeping up their firing upon the enemy, and after reaching the head of column I deployed the whole right wing, Companies A, B, C, D, and E, assisted by Company F, of left wing, upon the enemy’s left front as skirmishers, sending at the same time the balance of the regiment by companies to the front by the road. The skirmishers, sustained by the left four companies, turned the right flank of the enemy, and with the assistance of the artillery, drove the enemy’s right flank in, and routed them from the woods. The whole regiment was then rallied on the color company, and deployed immediately to the front and in Advance of the column as skirmishers, sustaining such position until a halt was made by the whole column. My regiment was most handsomely sustained in the outset by the artillery and Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiment Volunteers, Colonel Jarrett, and afterwards by them and other troops in the column.
The field officers, Lieutenant-Colonel Harris, Major Lane, and Adjutant Poole, are entitled from me to great praise for their promptness and great efficiency in the skirmish. Officers and men all behaved with the utmost bravery, and are entitled to great credit as raw troops.
The casualties consist in the death of Private George Drake, of Company A; Sergeant W. M. Graham, Company B, dangerously wounded, being shot in three separate places$ Color Sergeant Fred. Hutching, wounded in the leg, belongs to Company E, color company$ Privates William Matthews, P. O. Pummer, and Henry Young, of Company G, wounded ,* first two in the legs, other in the head; and Sol. Wyse, of Company K, taken prisoner by the enemy’s cavalry on the extreme right of skirmishers, when deployed to the front, just as a halt was ordered and a rally being made on the center.
I have the honor to be, yours, to command,
JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,
Colonel, Comdg. First Regiment Wisconsin Volunteers.
Colonel Abercrombie, Commanding Brigade.
