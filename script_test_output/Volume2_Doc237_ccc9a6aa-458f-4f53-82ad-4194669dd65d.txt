Report of Mr, Jed. Hotchkiss, Topographical Engineer, Confederate service, of events from July 2 to 14.
Churchville, Augusta County, Va., January 18,1862.
I was appointed engineer at Camp Garnett, Rich Mountain, Randolph County, Virginia, by you, as commander of the post, on Tuesday, July 2, 1861, and on Wednesday morning, the 3d, I commenced my duties by initiating a survey of the camp and its vicinity, preparatory to the construction of an accurate topographical map of the locality; and by the aid of parties detailed for the purpose I had nearly completed the necessary triangulations and measurements for the purpose indicated, and had'also by barometrical observations ascertained the height of the points occupied by our forces, and had made considerable progress in the drawing of the map of the camp and vicinity, when (the enemy having made their appearance before our lines on the evening of July 9), by your order I spent a portion of the 10th in the breastworks on the hill to the left of your position, and the whole of the 11th, during which day the battle of Rich Mountain was fought and lost. I remained at the breastworks until midnight of that day, the enemy having occupied the parallel ridge in front of us during the day.
At midnight, by your order, I came down from the hill in company with the Augusta Lee Rifles, Capt. R. D. Lillev, of your regiment, and followed by the companies of Captains Moorman, Kiracofe, Smith, Hall, and Mullins, and marched with them to the turnpike between the center and right of our position, and was there informed by you that Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram, who had assumed the command on the morning of July 8—he having been ordered by General Garnett to report to you with his regiment, and then he claimed the command of the post as being of the same rank in the Confederate service that you were in the State, and therefore ranking you—had been injured by a fall from his horse on the 11th and had resigned the command to you, again ordering you to march to Laurel Hill, to General Garnett, through the forest on the right of our position. You directed me to lead the front of the column over the hill on the right through the breastworks there, and so on towards the top of Rich Mountain. All the forces left at Camp Garnett were at that time formed in the road. As before said, I was directed to proceed at once, as the enemy was closing down upon our lines in overwhelming numbers, and you told me that you would bring up the rear. I then proceeded to the head of the column, occupied by Captain Li]ley’s company, and the command to move forward having been passed, was proceeding up the road, intending to reach the top of the hill [by] its easy winding grade, and had proceeded some little distance, when you overtook me and informed me that the enemy occupied the turn of the road on the hill, and that we must go up along the hill and so over by the way of the breastworks on the right.
The column was then countermarched in single file, and the countersign, “Indian,” said to be the countersign of the enemy for the night,

was communicated to the men, and then I started up the hill, accompanied by Major Beger, of your regiment, and Major Stewart and Colonel Wilson, who happened to "be at our camp. When at the top of the hill, which is very steep and rough, we halted for the column to close up, and then struck into the forest. The rain pouring down in torrents and the night being very dark, the line of march could hardly be kept but by a constant effort on the part of the men to keep almost in contact with each other, and our line was often broken by the fallen trees, dense thickets, and precipices that we encountered. By the advice of Majors Beger and Stewart we took a course bearing to the left, but I soon found that that was bringing us too near the waters of Boaring Creek and the adjacent laurel swamps, as well as too near the position occupied by the camp of the enemy; therefore I protested against going farther in that direction, and was seconded in my views by Captain Lilley and others that were near; and as I had reconnoitered the ground on July 6, they yielded to my opinion and my guidance from that time. We then pushed on, bearing gradually to the right, that we might reach the gap to the north of Hart’s, suffering much from the cold, as we were all drenched, and many of us had not eaten since morning. We did not halt much, and one time, shortly after leaving the camp, a low whistle on our right arrested our attention, and most of the line halted. I replied to thfe whistle and passed the order quietly to press on, and I have since learned from a prisoner-taken from the enemy that a whole regiment was drawn up parallel to our line of march, and was only kept from firing upon us by the reply to their signal and our continued moving.
Daylight found us two-thirds of the way to the top of the mountain, and then and there, to our great surprise and regret, we found that, instead of the whole command, I was only followed by a portion of Captain Lilley’s company and some few others—some fifty men. We were sorely disappointed; but as there was no alternative for safety but rapid flight, as we were certain that the enemy would speedily occupy all the roads by which we could escape, therefore I urged upon the men the necessity for a prompt obedience of orders in marching forward, and they responded with cheerfulness and alacrity, and we pushed rapidly forward and across the summit of the mountain at sunrise through a notch, and following down a ravine we struck the Merritt road, much cut up by the passage of the Churchville cavalry and most of Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram’s regiment, which had passed over it the evening before, under the command of Maj. Nat. Tyler. We reached this road at about 8 a. m. of the 12th. Following down that road, we obtained a few mouthfuls of food at a house just on the edge of the valley, where Major Tyler and men had spent part of the night. Then we took across the fields and reached Beverly at about 11 a. in., where we found the people helping themselves to the abandoned commissary stores, and we were informed by Captain Stofer, who was seated on the porch of the hotel, that the enemy was expected every moment, and that our forces under Colonel Scott had gone to Huttonsville. We then helped ourselves to a supply of crackers, &c., from the stores and proceeded towards Hut-tonsville. Finding a large quantity of tents, blankets, socks, &c., abandoned by the roadside, just across Files Creek, we took each one a supply of these needful articles, and had started on when we met a team going to Beverly, which we impressed and sent back and loaded up, and then went on towards Huttonsville. Overtaking stragglers from various companies by the way, and it being rumored that the enemy was in rapid pursuit of us, we had our men fire off their guns and reload them, each one having held on to his gun, and then made all fall into

ranks and so march in order, and having overtaken a wagon loaded with provisions, we kept it along and guarded it. Eeaching Huttons-ville at about 3 p. in., where we confidently expected to find Colonel Scott, we found the bridge just falling down from its conflagration by his order, and were told that he had gone to Stipe’s.
We had already marched some twenty-two miles, but we went on to Stipe’s and there found that he had gone, it was said, to the foot of Cheat Mountain ; still pursuing, we reached the foot of Cheat Mountain, eight miles farther, and there, after eating a scanty supper, we disposed of ourselves upon the bluff commanding the road up the mountain and its approaches, and there spent the night, resting on our arms, for fugitives had reported that 1,200 of the enemy’s cavalry was in close pursuit ; but we decided that an encounter from an ambuscade was preferable to a further retreat in our exhausted condition, having spent a whole day and half the night on our feet in the breastworks, and then retreated thirty miles through dense thickets, over fallen timber and ledges of rocks, through water-courses and along muddy roads ; but every man had his arms and ammunition and was ready for an encounter.
On the morning of the 13th we proceeded to the top of Cheat Mountain, at White’s, and there found the Churchville and Bath cavalry companies and portions of many other companies collected there after the retreat. All agreed that we would stay there and keep back the enemy, and I was selected as a committee of one by those on the top of the mountain to see Governor Letcher, who we had learned was at Greenbrier Biver, and get his consent to let us remain there.
Dr. O. Butcher, of Huttonsville, took me down in his sulky, and I had an interview with the governor, whom I found at Yeager’s, where the regiment of Colonel Scott had encamped and Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram’s regiment, under the command of Major Tyler, and where the regiment of Colonel Johnson (the Twelfth Georgia) came up.
The governor consented to our staying, and we had started back a short distance when a messenger came up and ordered all the men down, and we came down and proceeded up the Alleghany Mountains. That night slept a few hours on the summit, at Yearger’s, and then went on Sunday to Monterey, where we encamped. Major Beger procured a horse and left us at Beverly and went on to Yearger’s, and got his family and sent them on to Staunton, and then joined us at Monterey on the 14th.
By your order I did not go to my tent on the night of the retreat, and therefore lost all my instruments, notes, maps, and baggage; therefore I am unable to report to you an accurate map of Camp Garnett; but I accompany this report with a map drawn from memory of the camp and surrounding country, showing the route of the enemy, and also the route of our retreat as far as Beverly.
After we had been some days in Monterey we were informed that shortly after we left Camp Garnett Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram resumed the command of the forces and sent some one of his staff forward to halt the column, and that owing to the darkness and steepness of the hill he was unable to reach the head of the column, and therefore he interposed himself and a musket into the midst of Captain Lilley’s company and so divided it. Private Brownlee Bell, who was at the head of the forces cut off, gave us this information.
As imputations have been cast upon you in reference to the management of the army, &c., at Bich Mountain, on the retreat, &c., I may be permitted, from the opportunity I had of knowing all the facts and cir-

cum stances of your situation, to state tliat to my personal knowledge you sent one that came to you with information in reference to the designs or operation of the enemy in turning our left flank to communicate the same to Lieutenant-Colonel Pegram the day before the battle, and I heard you offer to communicate to him all the information you had in reference to the camp and its surroundings, referring him to me in person as having a partially-prepared map of it, and he did not avail himself but to a very limited extent of the large fund of information you had with diligence collected in reference to your position and the movements of the enemy. Being ordered by General Garnett, as he himself said, to report himself and command to you, he at once arrogantly demanded the command of the post because of his superiority in rank before asking for it or you had refused to give it to him; and after you had expressed a willingness to give it up to him if you could be assured that such was the desire of General Garnett, and afterwards by his arbitrary and selfish direction of affairs, in the opinion of many concerned and engaged, brought about the disasters that attended and followed the battle of Rich Mountain, and led to the surrender of 600 brave men to the enemy.
My report has been delayed by pressing engagements in the army and sickness to this late day.
Most respectfully submitted.

Report of Lieut Cot John Pegram, G. 8. Army, of the engagement at Rich Mountain and the surrender of his forces.
Beverly, Ya., July 14,1861.
Hot knowing where a communication will find General Garnett, I have the honor to submit the following report of the fight at Rich Mountain, which occurred on the 11th instant:
The battle-field was immediately around the house of one Hart, situated at the highest point of the turnpike over the mountain and two miles in rear of my main line of trenches, the latter being at the foot of the western slope of the mountain.
The intricacies of the surrounding country seemed scarcely to demand the placing of any force at Hartfs, yet I had that morning placed Captain De Lagnel, of the Confederate artillery, with five companies of infantry and one piece of artillery, numbering in all about three hundred and ten men, with instructions to defend it to the last extremity against whatever force might be brought to the attack by the enemy, but also to give me timely notice of his need for re-enforcements. These orders had not been given two hours before General Rosecrans, who had been conducted up a distant ridge on my left flank and then along the top of the mountain by a man, attacked the small handful of troops under Captain De Lagnel with three thousand men. When from my camp I heard the firing becoming very rapid, without waiting to hear from Captain De Lagnel, I ordered up re-enforcements, and hurried on myself to the scene of action. When I arrived the piece of artillery was entirely unmanned, Captain De Lagnel having been severely wounded, after which his men had left their piece. The limber and

caisson were no longer visible, the horses having run away with them down the mountain, in doing which they met and upset the second piece of artillery, which had been ordered up to their assistance. Seeing the infantry deserting the slight breastworks hastily thrown up that morning by Captain Be Lagnel, I used all personal exertions to make them stand to their work until even I saw that the place was hopelessly lost. The last companies which left their posts were the Rockingham Lee Guard, commanded by Oapt. Carter H. Irving, and the Powhatan Rifles, commanded by Capt. William M. Skipwith. On my way back to my camp I found the re-enforcing force under command of Captain Anderson, of the artillery, in the greatest confusion, they having fired upon their retreating comrades. I hurried on to camp and ordered the remaining companies of my own regiment in camp to join them. This left my right front and right flank entirely unmanned. I then went back up the mountain, where I found the whole force, composed of five companies of the Twentieth and one company of Colonel Heck’s regiment, drawn up in line in ambuscade near the road, under command of Maj. Nat. Tyler, of the Twentieth Regiment. I called their attention and said a few encouraging words to the men, asking them if they would follow their officers to the attack, to which they responded by a cheer. I was here interrupted by Captain Anderson, who said to me, u Colonel Pegram, these men are completely demoralized, and will need you to lead them.- I took my place at the head of the column, which I marched in single file through laurel thickets and other almost impassable brushwood up a ridge to the top of the mountain.
This placed me about one-fourth of a mile on the right flank of the enemy, and which was exactly the point I had been making for. I had just gotten all the men up together and was about making my dispositions for the attack when Major Tyler came up and reported that during the march up the ridge one of the men in his fright had turned around and shot the first sergeant of one of the rear companies, which had caused nearly the whole of the company to run to the rear. He then said that the men were so intensely demoralized, that he considered it madness to attempt to do anything with them by leading them on to the attack. A mere glance at the frightened countenances around me convinced me that this distressing news was but too true, and it was confirmed by the opinion of the three or four company commanders around me. They all agreed with me that there was nothing left to do but to send the command under Major Tyler to effect a junction with either General Garnett at Laurel Hill or Col. William C. Scott, who was supposed to be with his regiment near Beverly. It was now 6J o'clock p. ni, when I retraced my steps with much difficulty back to camp, losing myself frequently on the way, and arriving there at 11J o’clock.
I immediately assembled a council of war, composed of the field officers and company commanders remaining, when it was unanimously agreed that, after spiking the two remaining pieces of artillery, we should attempt to join General Garnett by a march through the mountains to our right. This act was imperative, not only from our reduced numbers, now being about six hundred and our being placed between two large attacking armies, but also because at least three-fourths of my command had no rations left $ the other one fourth not having flour enough left for one meal. Having left directions for Sergeant Walke, and given directions to Assistant Surgeon Taylor to take charge of the sick and wounded in camp and to show a white flag at daylight, I then called the companies, G and H, of Twentieth Regiment, with which and

seven companies of Colonel Heck’s regiment I started at 1 o’clock a. m., and without a guide, to make my way, if possible, over the mountains, where there was not the sign of a path, towards General Garnett’s camp.
As I remained in camp to see the last company in column, by the time I reached the head of the column, wiiich was nearly one mile long, Captain Silly’s [Lilley’s] company, of Colonel Heck’s regiment, had disappeared and has not been since heard from. The difficulties attending my march with the remaining eight companies it would be impossible for me to exaggerate. We arrived at Tygart’s Valley River at 7 o’clock 1^. m., having made the distance of about twelve miles in eighteen hours. Here we were met by several country people, who appeared to be our friends, and who informed us that at Leadsville Church, distant three miles, and situated on the Beverly and Laurel Hill turnpike, there was a small camp, composed of a portion of General Garnett’s command. Leaving Colonel Heck with instructions to bring the command forward rapidly, I hired a horse and proceeded forward until within sight of Leadsville Church, when I stopped at a farm house, where were assembled a dozen men and women. They informed me that General Garnett had retreated that afternoon up the Leading Creek road, in Tucker County, and that he was being pursued by three thousand of the enemy, who had come from the direction of Laurel Hill as far as Leadsville Church, when they turned up the Leading Creek road in pursuit.
This of course rendered all chance of joining General Garnett, or of escape in that direction, utterly impossible. Hurrying back to my command I found them in much confusion, firing random shots in the dark, under the impression that the enemy was surrounding them. Reforming them, I hurried back to the point where we first struck the river, and persuaded a few of the country people to cook all the provisions they had, hoping it might go a little way toward satisfying the hunger of my almost famishing men.
I now found, on examining the men of the house, there was, if any, only one possible means of escape, and that w as by a road which, passing within three miles of the enemy's camp at Beverly, led over precipitous mountains into Pendleton County. Along this road there were represented to me to be but a few miserable habitations, where it would be utterly impossible for even one company of my men to get food, and as it was now 11 o’clock p. m. it would be necessary to leave at once, without allowing them to get a mouthful where they were. I now called a council of war, composed like the one of the preceding night, when it was agreed, almost unanimously (only tw~o members voting in the negative), there was left to us nothing but the sad determination of surrendering ourselves prisoners of war to the enemy at Beverly. The two members who voted in the negative, whilst they did so, stated that they considered our chances of escape very slim, to w hich I replied that if I thought them as good as slim I should certainly not entertain the idea of surrendering for one moment, and that I was perfectly convinced that an attempt on our part to escape w ould sacrifice by starvation a large number of the lives of the command. I now dispatched a messenger to Beverly, which was distant some six miles, with a note of which the following is the substance:
Headquarters at Mr. Kettle's Farm House, July 12, 1801.
To the Commanding Officer of the Northern Forces, Beverly, Va.:
Sir: Owing.to the reduced, and almost famished condition of the force nowhere under my command, I am compelled to offer to surrender them to you as prisoners of

war. I have only to ask that they receive at your hands such treatment as Northern prisoners have invariably received from the South.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,	JOHN PEGRAM,
Lieutenant-Colonel, P. A. C. S.} Commanding.
Between 7 and 8 o’clock next morning two officers of General McClellan's staff arrived with bis reply, of which the following is an exact copy •
Headquarters Department of th^i Ohio,
Beterly, Va., July 13, 1861.
John Pegram, Esq.,
Styling himself Lieutenant-Colonel, P. A. C. S. :
Sir : Your communication, dated yesterday, proposing to surrender as prisoners of war the force assembled under your command, has been delivered to me. As commander of this department I will receive you, your officers and men, as prisoners, and I will treat you and them with the kindness due to prisoners of war, but it is not in my power to relieve you or them from any disabilities incurred by taking arms against the United States.
Iam, verv respectfullv, your obedient servant,
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General3 U. S, Army, Commanding Department.
I replied to Major Williams, U. S. Army, the bearer of this letter, who told me that General McClellan had with him at Beverly a force of three thousand men, that I was in no condition to dictate terms, and was obliged to accept those of his general. I then formed the companies, and found that one officer and about forty men had left during the night. I now found my force to be twenty-two officers and three hundred and fifty-nine men of Colonel Heck’s regiment, and eight officers and one hundred and sixty-six men of my own (the Twentieth) regiment. With these I marched towards Beverly. On the way we were met by wagons containing hard bread for my men. On arriving at Beverly we stacked arms. Our men were at once put into comfortable quarters, under charge of a guard, and rations issued to them. The officers are on their parole, with the liberties of the town. I deem it my duty to return my thanks and the thanks of the officers here with me to "General McClellan for the kind treatment our men have received from his troops.
I have now to bring to your attention the gallantry of our troops at Hart’s. This is shown by the mere statement that they held their position for three hours in the face of a force ten times their own number, and did not retire until they had lost in killed and wounded nearly one-third of their number. Having been confined to a bed of illness ever since my arrival here, I have been unable to find out our exact loss in killed and wounded, but from what I can gather it is as follows : Killed, Capt. AVilliam M. Skipwith and Second Lieutenant Boyd, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, and between 40 and 45 men, names not known. Wounded, Capt. C. H. Irving, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, severely; Captains Curry and Higginbotham, Colonel Heck’s regiment, and Second Lieut. J. S. Dorset, Twentieth Virginia Volunteers, slightly; and about 20 men. Missing, Captain De Lagnel, C. S. Army, known to be badly wounded.
I, of course, lost all my baggage and camp equipage. I now wish to add that had I known the number of the enemy, and their means of getting to my rear, which all of my so-called reliable woodsmen informed me was impossible, I would have retreated on the night before, cutting down trees on both sides of the mountain, thus giving time to General Garnett to retreat by the way of Beverly and Huttonsville.
The loss of the enemy was not less than thirty killed and forty wounded.
When all so distinguished themselves by their gallantry it would be invidious to particularize, so I will only give a list of the companies engaged under the gallant De Lagnel: Company B, Twentieth Regi-

ment, Lieutenant Williams commanding; Company D, Twentieth Regi-ment, Captain Skip with and Lieutenant Dorset 5 Company E, Twentieth Regiment, Captain Irving; Company B, Colonel Heck’s regiment, Captain Curry; Company A, Colonel Heck’s regiment, Captain Higginbotham, besides a detachment of twenty-one men from the two regiments under Lieutenant Boyd, Twentieth Regiment Virginia Volunteers.
Of the officers with the companies sent to re-enforce Captain De Lagnel I particularly observed Lieutenant Brander’s conduct in his efforts to rush his men on to their duty.
Beverly, Va., July 15, 1861.
I find on examination that I have failed to mention my whole force at Rich Mountain on the 11th instant. It was about thirteen hundred men, of whom certainly not more than three hundred and fifty at the utmost were engaged in the battle at Hart’s house. As I placed them there myself, I am positive on this point. The whole force opposed to me was nearly ten thousand 5 their force engaged at Hart’s, as before mentioned, three thousand.
I have also failed to mention that very early on the morning of the 11th I made two most urgent appeals to the chief commissary stationed there for three days’ rations of hard bread and bacon.
I have now only to give you a list of all the officers who are prisoners here, and to urgently request you will have our exchange effected at the earliest possible day, as it is and always will be our most ardent wish to shed the last drop of our blood in the defense of our noble cause.
