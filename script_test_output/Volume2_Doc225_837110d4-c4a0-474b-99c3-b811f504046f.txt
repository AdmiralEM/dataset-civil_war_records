No. 14.
Report of Lieut. H. A. Myers, Ringgold Cavalry, of operations from
July 7 to 15.
Headquarters Ringgold Cavalry,
Grafton, Eh., July 21, 1861.
I was ordered by General Hill on the 7th of July to take twenty-five men of the Ringgold Cavalry to serve as mounted scouts under command of Colonel Irvine, of the Sixteenth Ohio, and reported my command to him on the same night. Colonel Irvine was then posted near Cheat River Bridge. I remained attached to his command until Monday, the 15th of July. On the morning of the 8th six men of my command were sent by order of Colonel Irvine out on the Saint George road, sometimes called the Horseshoe Run road, that intersects the Northwestern turnpike at Red House, to Rinehart’s School-House. They remained there until Saturday, the 13th, when they were ordered by Colonel Irvine to come into his camp at West Union, which they did the same afternoon. I had ascertained from persons living on the Saint George road before mentioned that the rebels were retreating, and would be through on that road from Saint George to Red House on Saturday night or Sunday, and reported the same to Colonel Irvine. I told him I thought it important that scouts should be sent out in that direction, and gave him the information I had received. He replied that there were other points of more importance.
About sundown on Saturday, the 13th, a man came up from the neighborhood of Rinehart’s School-House, and told me that he had heard that they were coming through on that road. I again went to Colonel Irvine and gave him this information, and told him that some of my boys were anxious to go out on that road. He said he would see about it, and walked away. I returned to my quarters, and remained there pursuant to his orders.
H. A. MYERS,
Second Lieutenant, Ringgold Cavalry.
