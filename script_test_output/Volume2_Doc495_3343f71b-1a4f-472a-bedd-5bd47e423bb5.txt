No. 37.
J	Centreville, July 20,1861.
The general commanding has learned with regret that the term of service of the Fourth Eegiment Pennsylvania Volunteers is about to expire. The services of this regiment have been so important, its good conduct so general, its patience under privations so constant, its state of efficiency so good, that the departure of the regiment at this time can only be considered an important loss to the Army.
Fully recognizing the right of the regiment to its discharge and payment at the time agreed upon when it was mustered into the service, and determined to carry out literally the agreement of the Government in this respect, the general commanding, nevertheless, requests the regiment to continue in service a few days longer, pledginghimself that the postponement of the date of muster out of service shall not exceed two weeks. Such members of the regiment as do not accede to this request will be placed under the command of proper officers to be marched to the rear, mustered out of service, and paid as soon as possible after the expiration of their terms of service.
By command of General McDowell :
JAMES B. FRY, Assistant Adjutant-General.
