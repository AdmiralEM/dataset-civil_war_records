panies of artillery, and a naval battery, amounting, in the aggregate, to about eight thousand men, of whom about seven thousand three hundred are able to go into combat, well armed. The five regiments of infantry from Virginia have good arms, but are very deficient in cartridge-boxes, belts, and ball-screws. The Alabama regiment is well appointed, has brought its tents and camp equipage, and is well clothed. Arms in good order. The two regiments from Mississippi have with them their tents and camp equipage, but are not satisfied with their arms, which are chiefly of the old flint-lock musket altered into percussion. As usual with troops of this description, they all want rifles. They were informed that, for the present, they must rest contented with such arms as it was in the power of the Government to give them. One of these regiments (the Eleventh), under the command of Colonel Moore, is very superior to the other (the Second), under Colonel Ealkner. The latter is badly clothed and very careless in its appointments. The officers are entirely without military knowledge of any description, and the men have a slovenly and unsoldier-like appearance. The other regiment seems to take much pride in its appearance, and is endeavoring to improve itself by military exercises. All the infantry regiments are drilled daily in the school of the soldier and company, and valuable assistance in this respect is received from the young men who have been instructed at the military school at Lexington. But there is no ground in the immediate vicinity upon which the maneuvers of a large battalion can take place, consequently there is a lamentable want of knowledge of the first principles of formation into line and the changes of front and breaking into column. There are no regular regimental parades established, upon which to form quickly, in case of alarm. The Virginia regiments are only partially supplied with tents, and the main body of them are quartered in houses in the towns of Harper’s Ferry and Bolivar. Crowded together, as they necessarily are, I fear that utter confusion must be the consequence of any sudden movement. I speak, of course, only of the present. Undoubtedly a proper course of instruction must produce its good effects, and it is to be hoped that a steady improvement will take place. The attention of General Johnston has been called to these important points.
The artillery companies are drilled in the school of the soldier, without arms. There are no artillery horses, and therefore there is no such thing on the ground as light artillery. There are but four light pieces with Captain Pendleton’s company at Bolivar, at which the men are instructed in the manual of the piece. There are six guns with Captain Imboden’s company at the Point of Bocks. At this place also Captain Ashby is stationed, with two companies of cavalry and two hundred infantry, his total force amounting to four hundred men, one hundred and thirty-three horses, and six guns. His two positions are immediately at the bridge crossing the Potomac from the Point of Rocks and at the Potomac Forge half a mile distant. His cavalry covers the country for twenty miles to his rear, while his attention is immediately given to the line of railroad from Baltimore, which passes the Point of Rocks on the Maryland side. I am quite confident that, with the vigilance which is exercised by Captain Ashby, no enemy can pass the point which he is directed to observe. Should he be assailed from his rear, say by way of Leesburg, he could easily cross the bridge and retreat upon Harper’s Ferry 5 and in doing so destroy the bridge, the piers of which are already mined for such a contingency.
The naval batteries, under Lieutenant Fauntleroy, are placed on the northern and southern salients of the village of Harper’s Ferry, and

envelope with their fire the whole of the town of Bolivar and the approaches by the immediate banks of the Potomac and Shenandoah Bivers. There are at this time but two 32-pounders in position in each battery on plain platforms, and the guns on ship’s carriages. It is intended to increase the number of guns in each battery to six. These batteries would be very formidable in resisting an attack upon the town of Harper’s Ferry.
The cavalry, under Lieut. Col. J. E. B. Stuart, is in very good condition, and quite effective. Their arms are a small-sized revolver and a saber; no carbines. The horses are good, and all the men ride well. They are made exceedingly useful in the duties of scouts and vedettes, covering a considerable extent of country to the front.
The hospital department is very deficient in every respect. There are a few beds in the general hospital, but there is no provision whatever made for the care of wounded men, in the event of an engagement taking place. Bequisitions for medicines and for hospital stores have been made on the surgeon-general at Bichmond, and he is now earnestly endeavoring to supply the wants of this department at Harper’s Ferry. The general state of health in the regiments was good, and there was no epidemic of any kind. Exposure to many cold, rainy nights had caused some severe colds among the men from the extreme South, and there were some cases of the ordinary camp diseases, but nothing very serious.
The clothing of the troops is not abundant, and, in the regiment from Mississippi, under Colonel Falkner, almost every necessary is wanting. They seem to have come away from home without making proper preparations in this respect, and, indeed, it would seem that they expected to receive on their arrival in Virginia all the appointments of a soldier. Fortunately the approach of warm weather will obviate the necessity of a full supply of clothing for these men; otherwise they could not enter upon a campaign in their present condition. I recommend an early attention on the part of the proper officers to this important subject of clothing.
In regard to camp and garrison equipage, so much is required that I do not consider it necessary to enter into particulars. From what I can learn of the deficiency of such articles in the adjacent country and even in Bichmond, it will be necessary for the Quartermaster’s Department to cause everything of the nature referred to to be made, and this should be done at once. The supplies of subsistence are abundant, except in the item of bacon. There is plenty of beef, and a large quantity of flour on hand, enough to last many months. In view of the defense of the immediate position at Harper’s Ferry, there is now there an ample force for that purpose. The enemy can make no successful attack, either by the way of the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad or by the Maryland Heights, both of which approaches can easily be defended. The principal direction by which an attacking force would move would be by crossing the Potomac from eight to fifteen miles above by fords which are known to be practicable, and then, moving circuitously, come in by the roads leading to the northwestern approach to the Ferry. The troops moving out could meet the enemy in several good positions, and, if forced back by superior numbers, could yet take up their lines on the edge of the town, and, with the assistance of the artillery, could defy and beat back five times their numbers with perfect ease.
Under the existing state of affairs, that is, with the means at hand, for offensive operations coming from Baltimore or Pennsylvania, Harper’s Ferry may be looked upon as perfectly safe. But if the war is to

assume much larger proportions, it might be possible for the enemy to shut up our force now assembled there, and, with superior numbers, X>ass on with a heavy force and occupy the valleys beyond, in Western Virginia. If this should ever be suspected to be the plans of the enemy, of what use would it be to hold on to Harper’s Ferry ? In such a state of affairs, it would be much better to abandon the Ferry altogether, remove the machinery, destroy the buildings, blow up the bridge, and move out into the valleys, and thus maneuver against the advancing enemy ; in addition to which a force should be sent at once up the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad to blow up the tunnels, and burn the bridges on Cheat Biver, and otherwise cause such damage to the road as to render impossible the passage of a force from Wheeling or Parkers^ burg.
I inclose a small sketch of the position at Harper’s Ferry, the various roads in the vicinity being marked by red lines.
The major-general commanding will understand that a report of this nature, being that of raw volunteers, just arrived (from long distances in several cases), is not of so minute a character as it would be with troops of better training and of more experience in war.
Bespectfully submitted.

Williamsburg, Va., May 24,1861. Major-General Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces :
Sir : The inclosed letter was received by me this morning from Major Cary. It seemed to be so important that I immediately started for this place. There has been a large accession of force at Old Point. (For the details see the inclosed report of Major Cary.)* Finding, on my arrival here, that Major Cary had gone to Old Point to see General Butler, and considering it better for me to be present at the interview, I followed, and was, after getting in proper form within the pickets of the Federal troops, unceremoniously dealt with ,• was taken prisoner and marched into the fort. By the kindness of Colonel Dimick a release was at once given, and I returned directly to Williamsburg. I thought it best to order the destruction of the bridge across Hampton Creek. I have given such general directions in other respects as conform to your orders.
Bespectfully,
BENTJ. S. EWELL, Lieutenant-Colonel, Virginia Volunteers.
May 24,1861—7.15 p. m.
[Col. J. B. Magruder :]
Sir : I regret to inform you that Lieutenant-Colonel Ewell was taken prisoner at Fort Monroe 5 under what plea I have not been able to understand. I had requested an interview with Major-General Butler (now in command) this morning, which was granted at 3.30 p. m. My main object was to ascertain how far he intended to take possession of Virginia soil, in order that I might act in such a manner as to avoid

collision between our scouts. I could only gather from him that it was u a military necessity” for him to occupy our land for an encampment, and that he could only say that, if he was not interfered with by bodies of armed troops, he would molest no one. He indicated his determination to take possession of anything which he might deem necessary for his use. In accordance with these principles he has taken three of Colonel Mallory’s negroes, which he has refused to give up on application. I dispatched to Colonel Ewell a detailed account of a reconnaissance which they made on yesterday to this place.* They marched a regiment of about eight hundred men, supported by a battery of six brass pieces, and perhaps a still further reserve. I presume Colonel Ewell has forwarded it to you. They are now encamping, or rather apparently selecting their ground, about three-fourths of one mile distant from this place. I demanded of General Butler that he should see into the reason of Colonel Ewell’s arrest, which he promised me, just as he left (when for the first time I heard of it), that the matter should be attended to. If he is not released in the morning I shall make a more formal demand under a flag of truce. As it will take my messenger nearly all night to reach the river connection in the morning, I must bring this to an abrupt close, craving your indulgence for its desultory character.
I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. B. CARY,
Major Artillery, Virginia Volunteers.
P. S.—Lieutenant Cutshaw will give detailed information in regard to the invasion yesterday.
