P. S.—I have carefully inspected the works at Jamestown Island, and ordered the erection of a redoubt, at the eastern point of it, to prevent a landing there, and to co-operate with the work on Spratley’s farm. I will write more at length to-night from Williamsburg.
Headquarters, Williamsburg, Fa., July 13,1831.
Sir : I have the pleasure of sending a report from Major Hood, the efficient cdmmander of the cavalry of my department, of a brilliant little affair with the enemy on the spot where the gallant Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux fell. Too much praise cannot be bestowed on Major Hood and the cavalry generally for their untiring industry in efforts to meet the enemy, and for the energy with which they have discharged their harassing and unusually laborious duties. I have directed the prisoners to be sent to Richmond, to headquarters.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGBUDER,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.
Colonel Deas, Assistant Adjutant- General.
P. S.—Two deserters have just come in from Fort Monroe. They will be examined to-morrow.
