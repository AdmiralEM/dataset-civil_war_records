No. 34.
j	Harper’s Ferry, Va., July 25,1861.
By virtue of orders received from the War Department, Maj. Gen. N. P. Banks hereby assumes command of this department.
By order of General Banks :
EOBT. WILLIAMS,
Assistant Adjutant- General.
Philadelphia, Pa., November 1,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, Washington :
Sir : Believing to the present moment that, on account of other persons, a public examination into the maimer in which the affairs of the Department of Pennsylvania while under my command were conducted, and that the publication of the correspondence with and orders to me of the General-in-Chief, especially connected with the late campaign in Maryland and Virginia, might be detrimental to the interests of the service, I have refrained from asking for an investigation or permission to publish the orders by which I was controlled. The same reason has caused me studiously to avoid verbal statements on the subject in reply to numerous inquiries.
Charges have been publicly made through the press and the impression created that the design of the campaign was not carried out by me, but rather deranged by my neglect or violation of orders. Intimations against my loyalty have been insidiously circulated. From the silence of my immediate commander I infer he does not design to relieve me from the odium attached to these reports and rumors. While I am willing, if the general good demand it, to suffer personally, and am desirous that no course on my part shall prove injurious to public interest, yet I believe the time has arrived when the question as to the manner in which I executed the duties intrusted to me may be safely investigated, so that the failure to accomplish certain results never anticipated of my command by the General-in-Chief, until he saw his defeat, may be ascribed to the real cause. Further silence, therefore, on my part would confirm the impression that I plead guilty to the charges that have been made against my honor, my loyalty, and my military capacity. I have a right at least to be relieved from the position in which my long silence, caused solely by an earnest desire for the success of our cause, has left me.
In presenting this my application for a court of inquiry, or permission to publish, my correspondence with the General-in-Chief, I claim and am ready to substantiate—
1st. That if the General-in-Chief ever designed my command to enter upon the soil of Virginia with prospects of success, he destroyed my power when greatest, and when that of the enemy was weakest, by recalling to Washington, after they had crossed the Potomac, all my regular troops, with the Ehode Island regiment and battery, leaving me but a single company of cavalry, which had not then been one month in service, and entirely destitute of artillery.
2d. That the General-in-Chief forbade my advance, and compelled me to recall to Maryland all the troops which, confident of success, had crossed the Potomac into Virginia in execution of a plan which had been submitted to him and had received his cordial approbation.
3d. That for a long time the General-in-Chief kept my command in a crippled condition, and demanded my advance after he had withdrawn

[Chap. IX
from me all my available artillery, and only after the enemy had had time to become vastly my superior in artillery, infantry, and cavalry, and was intrenched. In answer to my earnest appeals he re-enforced me only after the occasion for employing re-enforcements had passed
away.
4th. That if the General-in-Chief designed me to do more than threa ten the enemy at Winchester, he did not divulge his wish.
5th. That if the General-in-Chief expected me to follow to Manassas u close upon the heels of Johnston,77 he expected a physical impossibility; the enemy moving part of the way by rail from an intermediate point, while our army was on foot, entering an enetny7s country, and guarding a heavy train and a depot retained by him in an improper place.
0th. The General-in-Chief forbade pursuit of the enemy in the event that he should retire towards Manassas, fearing to press him on Washington.
7th. That I was informed by the General-in-Chief the attack on Manassas would be made on Tuesday, the 16th of July, instead of Sunday, the 21st; at which time he directed me to make such a demonstration upon Winchester as to keep the enemy at that place. I claim that the demonstration was made on that day, and that he did not avail himself of the fruits of that movement, as he had expected to do. All that was demanded of me, and more, was effected.
8th. That if the army I had commanded had attacked Winchester on Tuesday, the 16th of July, as it has since been alleged I was ordered to-do, two armies, instead of one, would have been demoralized, and the enemy would have turned with all the flush of victory to a triumph in front of Washington.
9th. That I have suffered additional injustice at the hands of the General-in-Chief, who sanctioned and fixed the impression that the enemy at Winchester was inferior to me in force in every arm of service, and yet has not corrected that report, although he knew two days after the battle of Bull Run that siege artillery heavier than mine, and three times as numerous, had been left by the enemy at Winchester,, while a greater number of guns had been carried away.
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON
Philadelphia, November 26,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir: I respectfully request that you will do me the justice to refer to my letter of the 1st instant, and give it your early attention. I cannot refrain from intimating a confident hope that my application for a court of inquiry will meet with your favorable consideration, and that an order for the detail will be made at the earliest moment consistent with the interests of the service.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON,
Major- General,.
War Department, November 30,1861. General R. Patterson, Philadelphia, Pa. :
General: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th instant, calling my attention to your communication of the 1st of

November, which contains a request for an inquiry into the late campaign in Virginia, in which you commanded a part of the United States forces. Your letter did not reach me until my return to this city, and subsequent to the departure of Lieutenant-General Scott to Europe.
There appears to be no precedent in our service for an investigation or trial of an officer’s conduct after he has received an honorable dis-eharge. The inquiry you desire to have instituted would equally concern the late General-in-Chief, and as it appears to me, injustice to him, should not be made in his absence. The respect I have always entertained for you, as well as the friendly relations which have long existed between us, would claim for any personal request from you the most prompt and favorable attention ; but in my public capacity, in the present condition of affairs, I cannot convince myself that my duty to the Government and to the country would justify me in acceding to your request. I must, therefore, reluctantly decline the* appointment of a court of inquiry at this time.
With much respect, your obedient servant,
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
In the Senate of the United States,
December 17, 1861.
Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested, if not incompatible with the public interest, to furnish the Senate with copies of the correspondence between Lieutenant-General Scott and Major-General Patterson, and with all orders from the former to the latter, from the 16th day of April, 1861, to the 25th day of July, inclusive.
Attest:	J. W. FORNEY, Secretary.
War Department, Washington, December 24, 1861. Hon. H. Hamlin, President of the Senate:
Sir: In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 17th instant, I have the honor to transmit herewith a report of the Adjutant-General, from which it will be perceived that it is not deemed compatible with the public interest at this time to furnish the correspondence between Generals Scott and Patterson, as called for.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.

Sir : In compliance with your instructions, I have the honor to report that, after due consideration, the General-in-Chief is of opinion it would be u incompatible with* the public interest to furnish the Senate with copies of the correspondence between Lieutenant-General Scott and Major-General Patterson, and with all orders from the former to the latter from the 16th day of April, 1861, to the 23d day of July, inclusive,” at this time, as called for in the resolution of December 17,1861.

New York, March 31,1862.
To the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War:
On the statement of Major-General Patterson, submitted by him as evidence to the honorable the Committee of the House of Representatives on the Conduct of the War, I beg leave to remark—
1.	That his statement, 148 long pages, closely and indistinctly written, has been before me about forty-eight hours, including a Sunday when I was too much indisposed to work or to go to church; that I cannot write or read at night, nor at any time except by short efforts, and that I have been entirely without help.
2.	That, consequently, I have read but little of the statement and voluminous documents appended, and have but about two hours left for comments on that little.
3.	The documents (mainly correspondence between General Patterson and myself) are badly copied, being hardly intelligible in some places from the omission and change of words.
4.	General Patterson was never ordered by me, as he seems to allege, to attack the enemy without a probability of success, but on several occasions he wrote as if he were assured of victory. For example, June 12 he says he is u resolved to conquer, and will risk nothing ;” and July 4, expecting supplies the next day, he adds, as soon as they u arrive I shall advance to Winchester, to drive the enemy from that place.’7 Accordingly, he issued orders for the movement on the 8th ; next called a council of war, and stood fast at Martinsburg.
5.	But although General Patterson was never specifically ordered to attack the enemy, he was certainly told and expected, even if with inferior numbers, to hold the rebel army in his front on the alert, and to prevent it from re-enforcing Manassas Junction by means of threatening maneuvers and demonstrations—results often obtained in war with half numbers.
6.	After a time General P. moved upon Bunker Hill, and then fell off upon Charlestown, whence he seems to have made no other demonstration that did not look like a retreat out of Virginia. From that movement Johnston was at liberty to join Beauregard with any part of the army of Winchester.
7.	General P. alludes with feeling to my recall from him back to Washington, after the enemy had evacuated Harper’s Ferry, of certain troops sent to enable him to take that place; but the recall was necessary to prevent the Government and capital from falling into the enemy’s hands. His inactivity, however, from that cause need not have been more than temporary, for he was soon re-enforced up to at least the enemy’s maximum number in the Winchester Valley, without leading to a battle or even a reconnaissance in force.
8.	He also often called for batteries and rifled cannon beyond our capacity to supply at the moment, and so in respect to regular troops, one or more regiments. He might as well have asked for a brigade of elephants. Till some time later we had for the defense of the Government in its capital but a few companies of regular foot and horse, and not half the number of troops, including all descriptions, if the enemy had chosen to attack us.
9.	As connected with this subject, I hope I may be permitted to notice the charge made against me on the floors of Congress, that I did not stop Brigadier-General McDowell’s movement upon Manassas Junction after I had been informed of the re-enforcement sent thither from Winchester, though urged to do so by one or more members of the Cabinet*

Now, it was at the reception of that news too late to call off the troops from the attack, and, besides, though opposed to the movement at first, we had all become animated and sanguine of success, and it is not true that I was urged by anybody in authority to stop the attack, which was commenced as early, I think, as the 18th of July.
10. I have but time to say that among the disadvantages under which I have been writing are these: I have not had within reach one of my own papers and not an officer who was with me at the period in question.
Eespectfullv submitted to the committee.
