Beverly, Va., July 23, 1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend :
I leave in the morning. Will reach the railroad (forty-eight miles) to-morrow, and thence per railroad without delay to Washington. I have given the necessary directions for the disposition of the troops in this region to fortify Cheat Mountain and Parkersburg and Winchester pike, in advance of Cheat Biver. Bosecrans is left in command and will at once go to Kanawha. I take it for granted that Johnston will move on Grafton, and provide accordingly.
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General.
Grafton, July 24, 1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant General:
Cheat Biver region is stripped of troops except one regiment. One, diverted from Huttonsville, went to Oakland last night. Two more, ordered from Beverly, will reach there to-morrow evening. A telegram from Governor Morton announced the Twelfth and Sixteenth Indiana has left Indianapolis for Washington without orders from the Department.
I have telegraphed Governor Morton troops are wanted here to clear Cheat Biver. You all see the necessity if the enemy is enterprising. Please reply as soon as possible.

eral Banks persuaded the Sixth Massachusetts to remain till August 2. I have been to the encampment of the Twenty-second Pennsylvania, whose term expired yesterday, and the men consent to continue in service a week longer. The Thirteenth New York resolved unanimously this morning to go home to-morrow. I have just returned from their camp, and by the most urgent remonstrances and by strong appeals have induced them to stay another week.
By August 2 there will not be one of the eight first-named regiments in the annexed list left. I shall have only the last three regiments on the list remaining. I must urge the immediate re-enforcement of the troops under my command. There ought to be ten thousand men here and at Annapolis. I would not venture to respond for the quietude of the department with a smaller number.
The late reverse at Manassas has brought out manifestations of a most hostile and vindictive feeling in Annapolis, as well as in Baltimore. Major-General Banks, on the evening of my arrival here, asked, at my suggestion, for four hundred cavalry. They would, for the special service required, be equal to a full regiment of infantry. I hope they may be furnished without delay. It is understood that a regiment of cavalry leaves New York to-morrow. Can I have a detachment of three or four companies from this regiment, with a field officer t
I will see to the immediate protection of the bridges in all directions.
The Sixth New York, at Annapolis and the Junction, has been in service more than three months. It was put on duty in detachments on its arrival at Annapolis, and was not mustered for a month afterwards. The men are dissatisfied, and to some extent demoralized. They might be willing to remain if they could be sent to Washington and another regiment substituted for them. They contend that their term of service is ended now.
I understand there is a Home Guard in Philadelphia. Gould it not be put on the bridges between that city and Baltimore ? It would, no doubt, be sent on at the request of the Secretary of War.
I am, very respectfully, yours,
JOHN A. DIX, Major-General, Commanding.

Chat. IX.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC,---UNION.
Headquarters Department of Maryland,
Fort McHenry, July 24, 1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : 1 received your confidential dispatch last evening, with the letter inclosed, concerning the u Winans arms.*7* Major-General Banks doubts the fact stated, and thinks that a search would excite a great deal of feeling among the Roman Catholics. I sent for a special agent of the police, and directed him to station policemen by night and day near the only two nunneries, as he thinks, in the city, and keep them in constant supervision. If they are entered by any unusual number of persons, or if any attempt is made to move the arms in case they are secreted there, as conjectured^ the whole police force, aided by the military, will be called out. In half an hour two regiments can be concentrated at either point. In the mean time, if any circumstance occurs to confirm suspicion, I will not hesitate a moment to institute a thorough examination of the premises.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
JOHN A. DIX.
