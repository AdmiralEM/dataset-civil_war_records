No. 45.
Report of Lieut. Edmund Kirby, First U. S. Artillery.
Washington, D. C., July 23,1861.
Sir : I submit the following report :
On Sunday, July 21, Capt. J. B. Ricketts was ordered to place his battery in position at about one thousand five hundred yards from the enemy. An order was afterwards received to advance about one thousand yards, which was executed at a trot, and where we remained in battery, firing as fast as possible, until obliged to retreat, leaving six rifled guns on the field.
Capt. J. B. Ricketts was severely wounded at this critical moment, and First Lieut. Douglas Ramsay was killed.
Lieut. W. A. Elderkin conducted the limbers and caissons to the rear, as I was separated from the battery at the moment the retreat became general. I joined the battery soon after and continued the retreat, but was obliged to abandon everything at Bull Run except three limbers and fifty-six horses.
The non-commissioned officers and privates acted with great bravery, and remained on the field as long as possible.
Our casualties are: Left on the field, 6 rifled guns and 49 horses; abandoned on the road, 6 caissons, 3 limbers, 1 battery-wagon, and 1 forge. Killed: 1 officer and 11 men: wounded, 1 officer and 14 men. Total, 27.t
