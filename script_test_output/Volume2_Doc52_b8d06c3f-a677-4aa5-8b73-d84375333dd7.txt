Address to the Soldiers of the Expedition.
Headquarters Department of the Ohio,
Cincinnati) May 26,1861.
Soldiers : You are ordered to cross the frontier and enter upon the soil of Virginia. Your mission is to restore peace and confidence, to protect the majesty of the law, and to rescue our brethren from the grasp of armed traitors. You are to act in concert with the Virginia troops, and to support their advance. I place under the safeguard of your honor the persons and property of the Virginians. I know that you will respect their feelings and all their rights. Preserve the strictest discipline; remember that each one of you holds in his keeping the honor of Ohio and of the Union.
If you are called upon to overcome armed opposition, I know that your courage is equal to the task; but remember that your only foes are the armed traitors, and show mercy even to them when they are in your power, for many of them are misguided. When under your protection the loyal men of Western Virginia have been enabled to organize and arm, they can protect themselves, and you can then return to your homes with the proud satisfaction of having preserved a gallant people from destruction.

Colonel : I have the honor to report the successful occupation of Grafton without the loss of a single life. My previous dispatches have informed you of the circumstances under which the movement was undertaken and the orders given for carrying it into effect. The movement was greatly delayed by the necessity of repairing the burned bridges. I constantly advised Colonel Kelley to use great caution, and I am happy to say that he has been able to combine it with unusual energy.
He promptly arrived at the burned bridge; at once set a working party at preparing timber for repairs, moved an advanced guard forward to the very important bridge over the Monongahela, at Fairmont, and seized all the secessionists he could find. At 11 o’clock this morning he moved forward, and reached Grafton at 2.30 p. m. The secessionists had evacuated the place before his arrival.
The colonel will pursue them on the Beverly road in the morning and endeavor to capture at least some arms that they sent away before they 4 R R—VOL II

retreated. I cannot commend too highly the prudence and energy displayed by Colonel Kelley in this movement. He has in every instance carried out his instructions, and has displayed very high military qualities. I beg to recommend to the General that he may be made a brigadier-general of the Virginia Volunteers.
It is a source of very great satisfaction to me that we have occupied Grafton without the sacrifice of a single life. Colonel Steedman’s advance from Parkersburg has not been so prompt as that of Colonel Kelley. He has met with many difficulties on his route.
I am happy to say that the movement has caused a very great increase of the Union feeling. I am now organizing a movement on the valley of the Great Kanawha; will go there in person, and endeavor to capture the occupants of the secession camp at Buffalo, then occupy the Gauley Bridge, and return in time to direct such movements on Kentucky and Tennessee as may become necessary.
I will make a more detailed report when I receive Colonel Kelley’s full report.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. B. McCLELLAH, Major-General, U. S. Army.

Reports of Col. C. Q. Tompkins, commanding Confederate forces in the
Kanawha Valley.
Stacjnton, Va., May 29,1861.
Troops are rapidly gathering along the Ohio border, several hundred at Gallipolis, and a large camp at Oak Hill. David Kirkpatrick, bearer of above to Staunton, will be in Bichmond to-morrow, with letters from Colonel Tompkins.

Kanawha Court-House, Va., May 30, 1861.
Sir : The threatening aspect of affairs in this quarter induces me to send Lieutenant-Colonel McCausland to explain in detail matters that could not be discussed by letter. He will inform you of the disaffection of this population and the difficulty of procuring reliable troops for the emergency. There can be no doubt now that it is the intention of the enemy to occupy as much of this country as he may find open to invasion, and your attention is specially called to the necessity of sending, as e&rly as practicable, a force at ieast sufficient to hold this valley in security. I have now under my command here three hundred and forty men, and when the companies now in process of formation in this valley shall have been completed it is probable their numbers will not exceed one thousand men. It is doubtful, in my mind, whether the militia will obey a call to the field. For these reasons it would seem proper that re-enforcements should be sent from such sources as you may deem proper. I beg leave, respectfully, to urge the importance of sending us rifles, with

suitable ammunition, and I again request that staff officers for this department may be drawn from the troops comprising this command. Yery respectfully,
C. Q. TOMPKINS,
Colonel, Virginia Volunteers, Commanding. His Excellency Governor Letcher.
[Inclosnre.]
Charleston, Kanawha County, Ya., May 30,1801. Men of Virginia ! Men of Kanawha ! To Arms !
The enemy has invaded your soil and threatens to overrun your country under the pretext of protection. You cannot serve two masters. You have not the right to repudiate allegiance to your own State. Be not seduced by his sophistry or intimidated by his threats. Rise and strike for your firesides and altars. Repel the aggressors and preserve your honor and your rights. Rally in every neighborhood with or without arms. Organize and unite with the sons of the soil to defend it. Report yourselves without delay to those nearest to you in military position. Come to the aid of your fathers, brothers, and comrades in arms at this place, who are here for the jirdtection of your mothers, wives, and sisters. Let every man who would uphold his rights turn out with such arms as he may get and drive the invader back.
C. Q. TOMPKINS,
Colonel, Virginia Volunteers, Commanding.
