No. 5.
]
Petersburg, Va., July 16,1861.
Colonel Johnson:
My command is here, marching to Harrisonburg. We have suffered awfully. Not many men were killed by the enemy, but there are hundreds missing. We were near starvation. The cavalry scouts still hang on our rear, but I do not think they are pursuing in force. What is left of this army will not be fit for service in a month.
Very respectfullv,
J. N. RAMSEY,
Colonel, Commanding.
P. S.â€”Let me know if you are threatened by the enemy.
