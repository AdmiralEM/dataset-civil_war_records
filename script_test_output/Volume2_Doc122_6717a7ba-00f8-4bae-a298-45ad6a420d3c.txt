parries from his own and two companies from the Thirteenth Virginia Regiment, and at 8 p. m. to proceed to New Creek Depot, eighteen miles west of Cumberland, on the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and disperse the force there collected, bring away the two pieces of artillery, and burn the railroad bridges. The directions, 1 am happy to assure you, were carried out to the letter, and the march of thirty -six miles accomplished between 8 p. m. and 12 the next day. Some 250 of the Federal troops, after a slight stand, retired in disorder, with a loss of a few men. The bridge was then burned and Colonel Vaughn retired, bringing with him the two pieces of artillery and a stand of colors.
To Colonel Vaughn and his officers and men I am much indebted for the handsome manner in which my orders were carried out.
Inclosed you will find the report of Colonel Vaughn.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
A. P. HILL,
Colonel Thirteenth Regiment, Commanding Brigade. Col. E. K. Smith,
Assistant Adjutant-General.
