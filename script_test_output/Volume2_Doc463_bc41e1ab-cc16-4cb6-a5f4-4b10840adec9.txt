No. 106.
Report of Capt. John 8. Langhorne, Thirtieth Virginia Cavalry.
Camp near Centreville, July 25, 1861.
Sir : I have to report at the battle of the 21st July my company was detailed as a support to the first section of the Loudoun Artillery, when they were exposed to the heavy fire (cross-fire) from the enemy’s batteries.

tenant-Colonel Munford, of Radford’s regiment, we were ordered to intercept and charge the retreating column of the enemy. This was done with spirit and alacrity by my command, and resulted in the capture of thirty-two prisoners, ten horses, three wagons, one wagon of ammunition, a large and valuable assortment of surgical instruments, thirty-six muskets, a number of pistols, all of which, with the exception of the pistols, one wagon, and two horses have been delivered to the proper authorities at Manassas.
My command lost two horses, and two men wounded from the accidental discharge of their own guns ; also six shot-guns in the charge.
I hope some effort will be made to remount my men and supply those with arms who have lost them through an order given by the commander of the squadron when the charge was made.
Respectfully,
JOHN S. LANGHORNE, Captain Company B, Radford?s Regiment.
Mem.—As to the number killed by my command I decline speaking. I know it was very considerable.

Col. P. St. George Cocke,
Commanding Fifth Brigade, Virginia Volunteers.
