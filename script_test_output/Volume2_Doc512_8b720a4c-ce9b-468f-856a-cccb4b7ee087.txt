f	Richmond, Fh., May 15,1861.
The following order from the governor and council (having been communicated to the commanding general of the Virginia forces, with his excellency’s instructions to carry it into effect) is published for the information and guidance of the Virginia troops, viz:
In Council, May 15, 1861.

Culpeper Court-House, VatJ May 15,1861. General R. E. Lee, Commander-in- Chief:
Sir : I. In my dispatch, which I had the honor to make on yesterday, I addressed myself to the consideration of the great importance of this my central line of operations through Culpeper, Manassas, Alexandria, &c. I endeavored to impress upon the mind of the General-in-Chief

﻿Chap. IX.]	CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—CONFEDERATE.	847
the exceedingly feeble means of defense as yet gathered upon this line* notwithstanding the exertions that have been and that are being made. I showed how easy it would be to take Alexandria in reverse, thus to paralyze and capture the little force there, to advance upon Manassas, where there are at present scarcely a thousand men, seize the whole section of railroad, and thus be able to pour their masses like an avalanche over this fine region, and by using the Manassas Gap Road to turn the positions of Harper’s Ferry and Winchester, take them in rear, and isolate them effectually. In order to prevent results so disastrous, the General-in-Chief will pardon me if I urge upon his consideration what I conceive to be the great importance of immediately massing troops, first at Manassas and next at Winchester, in support of Harper’s Ferry. If at this moment we had eight or ten thousand well-appointed men of all arms at those points, respectively, they would not be too many to enable us to play an equal game with the enemy, who at this moment doubtless has forty thousand men in and about Washington and from fifteen to twenty thousand at Harrisburg and Carlisle $ all to be concentrated upon Harper’s Ferry or to be precipitated along this line whenever he shall decide to commence invasion. It is obvious, sir, with a strong corps Warmee at Manassas, and at least a division at Winchester, these two bodies being connected by a continuous railway through Manassas Gap, there should be kept all times upon that road ample means of transportation. These two columns—one at Manassas and one at Winchester—could readily co-operate and concentrate upon the one point or the other, either to make head against the enemy’s columns,, advancing down the valley, should he force Harper’s Ferry, or, in case we repulse him at Harper’s Ferry, the Winchester supporting column could throw itself on this side of the mountains, to co-operate with the column at Manassas and all that can come up in the rear of this line, to hurl back the invader, should he attempt to march beyond the Potomac upon Virginia’s soil.
II. I have every reason to believe that the officers recently appointed and assigned to the work of enlisting and mustering into the service volunteers in the geographical bounds of this central line of the Potomac Department, are exerting themselves with great zeal and energy* and that in the course of a few weeks they will raise and send forward a large portion, if not all, of the ten regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery I was authorized to raise within these limits* In the mean time it may be well for the General-in-Chief to consider what other means, more immediately available, he can throw upon this line, to provide against a possible early invasion of our Potomac border* I remain, general, very respectfully, your most obedient,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE,
Colonel, Commanding Potomac Department.
Staunton, May 15,1861.
Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee :
Sir : I reached here this afternoon in charge of three hundred troops from Monroe, Greenbrier, and Alleghany, forming two infantry and two rifle companies. Three of the companies are entirely without arms, and the other, an infantry company, has only some fifty-five flint-lock muskets, in bad order. The companies are not yet fully uniformed and I will have to detain them here for three or four days for the purpose of completing their equipment, which is to be done at the expense of their

respective counties. In the mean time I shall be glad to know if I must send on to Harper’s Ferry those companies which are entirely unarmed. Three of the companies are raw and undisciplined, although the material of which they are composed is very fine.

His Excellency John Letcher, Governor of Virginia:
Dear Sir : By direction of Major-General Lee, I will start to-day the arms, &c., intended for the Northwest, under escort of Capt. F. F. Sterrett’s company of cavalry. I have also, in furtherance of the plan concurred in by Col. F. H. Smith, ordered Capt. Felix H. Hull, who is now here, to proceed at once to Highland and gather two hundred men, including his company, to accompany Captain Sterrett’s command. I have further issued the following orders: to Captain Moorman, of Pendleton, to repair at once to Monterey with two hundred men, if possible, including his company; to Captains Stover and McNeil, of Pocahontas, to repair to Huttonsville, each with one hundred and fifty men, if possible, including his company) they severally to unite their commands with Captain Sterrett’s and proceed to Beverly. I have ordered Colonel Goff, of the last-named place, to collect the volunteer forces of Randolph and such other force of men as he can gather, and I have directed each and all of these officers to bring with them such supply of arms and ammunition as they could without delay procure. I now respectfully invite you to issue at once to Colonel Goff, or such other person as may seem good to you, such orders and directions, with regard to this expedition in aid of the Northwest, as may appear expedient. My aim is that it shall reach its destination (Grafton, if thought proper) at least by the day of election; at this last point it will be in communication by rail with Harper’s Ferry and may from thence be re-enforced or vice versa.
I shall also send with the expedition at least a wagon load of bacon, to avoid a possibility of a want of provisions.
Hoping that my action in this matter may meet with your approval, I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. G. HARMAN.

Winchester, Ya, May 15,1861. General Robert E. Lee, Richmond, Va.:
Dear Sir: I returned yesterday from Harper’s Ferry, where I spent two days, as a deeply interested, however unskilled, observer of military affairs in this quarter. I am glad to say, so far as I could tell,

## p. 849 (#865) ############################################

that things appeared to be fast assuming the aspect of good military organization, and officers and men cheerful and buoyant. I spent the evening and night at Colonel Jackson’s headquarters, and even my limited observation there confirmed the general tone of all around him, that all were in good hands under his command. You will doubtless have better sources of information than could be opened to a wayfarer, but the immediate and daily intercourse between Harper’s Ferry and Baltimore, although the pregnant source of countless rumors, yet there are occasional items of intelligence which, when put together, may not be unworthy of consideration; and although you are doubtless kept fully advised by Colonel Jackson, yet I venture to throw in my mite.
The Federal troops being now in full possession of Baltimore, with the railroads leading to it, north and east, from Pennsylvania, and the spirit of resistance in Maryland overpowered, for the time at least, it is considered that the Federal Army will be gradually extended, and in force, westward along the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad. It has been said in the papers, I know not whether on authority, that Governor Letcher has some scruple or doubt about occupying the mountain heights in Maryland opposite to Harper’s Ferry. Of course I did not inquire of Colonel Jackson, nor do I know, what counsels prevail on this point. I learned at the Ferry, in general conversation, that some four or five hundred Virginia troops occupied those heights, and it was said that preparation was making to fortify or intrench them. That whichever power holds those heights commands the town of Harper’s Ferry none can doubt; and there is as little doubt that a small body intrenched and fortified there, well and appropriately armed, could hold it against a far superior force. All this, however, is better known to you than to me. I want to speak only of our right to fortify and hold those heights, whether Maryland protest or no, putting aside the law of necessity and its sanctions. If Maryland were suo jure, and a friendly contiguous power, the occupation of her territory by forces hostile and menacing to Virginia give the clear right in public law to Virginia to occupy her territory too, so far as necessary for self-protection; a right not to be questioned under existing circumstances by Maryland or any other power. But Maryland is not suo jure; she remains one of the United States, a power now foreign to Virginia, and in open and avowed hostility to us. Occupying her territory, therefore, is only occupying territory of the enemy; nor is it invasion in the j)roper sense of that term, because the occupation is defensive and precautionary only, and not for aggression, and will cease as soon as the enemy withdraw from Maryland.
I have another suggestion to make, because of the disaffected condition of portions of the northwestern part of Virginia pervaded by the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad, a highway owned and controlled by Marylanders, who are now in complete subjection to the Federal power. It seems important to me that a sufficient military force of our State should be exhibited and retained along that road, at important points west of Harper’s Ferry, and at least as far as the western slopes of the Alleghany Mountains; and as two such points I would indicate Piedmont, in Hampshire County, and Graiton, in Taylor County. The preservation of this road, I should presume, will be all important to the Federal power, and of correlative importance to us to have it in our power—if unable to hold it, to break it up at points, where it will be impracticable to restore or repair it in any convenient time. The numerous tunnels through the mountains, the numerous bridges across the rivers and streams, and especially the exjmnsive and complicated 51 R R—VOL II

viaduct along the Cheat River, in the Alleghany Mountains, furnish abundant places for such irremediable damage, provided we are in advance of the invaders, Nor would any large force be required, provided it was well distributed and under competent commanders.

Headquarters,
Fredericksburg, Van May 15, 1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Sir : In reply to the inquiry of the General-in-Chief of the 14th instant I have the honor to report that I have given the subject of the defenses of the river counties particular attention, and that the following points embrace my conclusions, viz :
1st. That those counties are greatly exposed to predatory inroads, and constitute an important portion of our line of defense.
2d. That there is a deficiency of arms and ammunition in those counties generally, for purposes of local defense.
3d. That the best method of supply and distribution is to arm such volunteer companies as may be thoroughly organized and mustered into the service of the State. (Please see General Orders, No. 9, of the 11th instant, and copy of a letter, of this date, to a committee of gentlemen from Lancaster County, Virginia, connected with this subject.) To insure proper accountability, receipts of captains of companies mustered into service should be taken for all arms and accouterments.
4th. The establishment of camps of instruction at one point in each county, and, as nearly as practicable, in exposed districts.
5th. I also respectfully recommend that the militia be ordered to hold themselves in readiness for service, in their own defense, at all times, while engaged in their own avocations, and without expense to the State.
6th. I have furnished sixty muskets, one thousand ball-cartridges, and one hundred and twenty flints, on the requisition of the committee from Lancaster County, for Captain Kobinson’s company, which will soon be mustered into the service of the State.
I have deemed it expedient to muster in two companies in that county, as a basis on which the militia may rally, in the event of invasion, as well as to preserve the tranquillity of the community.
These companies, and an equal number from each of the neighboring counties, will probably be required to make up two regiments of infantry and riflemen in the district I command, for the active service of the field.
Should the plan thus far pursued (supposed to be in conformity with the commanding generals views) not correspond with the existing policy, I shall hope to receive early information, so as to adopt an approved rule of action.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
DANIEL RUGGLES,
Colonel, Provisional Army, Commanding Forces.

General E. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
In obedience to your order of Saturday evening last, my attention has been given to the defense of this city.
Three topographical parties are now in the field, and by Thursday I expect the examination will be sufficiently advanced to enable me to locate and lay out such defensive works as will give employment to all the laboring force at the disposal of the city authorities.
The examinations made in person have brought me to the conclusion that four or five strong redoubts on points to be selected well in advance of the city limits will afford all the protection required at this time, and be fully within its means to construct and of the State to defend them.

Lynchburg, Va., May 16, 1861. Col. E. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General, Virginia Forces:
Colonel : I arrived here this morning, and have assumed command of the Virginia volunteers mustered into the service of the State at this place. It was not possible for me to get here sooner, as I was compelled to make some preparation to enable me to go into the service. I find that Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne has mustered into the service two companies of cavalry, one from Lynchburg and the other from Bedford; also, seven companies of infantry, two from Lynchburg, two from Bedford, two from Botetourt, and one from Floyd. Two companies reached here this evening from Roanoke, and will be mustered into the service to-morrow. The company of cavalry from Lynchburg, commanded by Capt. John S. Langhorne, has sabers, but no other arms. The company of cavalry from Bedford, commanded by Capt. William E. Terry, has about fifty sabers, leaving twenty odd without any arms, and those having sabers have no other arms. Three companies, belonging to the Twelfth Brigade of Militia, were reported by the adjutant-general of the militia as armed. The infantry companies have no arms whatever, and I imagine that there are no companies in the counties for which this place is the rendezvous which are armed. I know such

﻿852	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
is the case in the Twelfth Brigade, composed of the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Franklin, Henry, and Patrick. All the armed companies were ordered into the service by the governor some time since. If, therefore, five regiments of infantry and riflemen and one of cavalry are mustered into the service at this place, and they are armed here, it w ill be necessary to have sent here near five thousand stand of muskets and rifles, and the same number of sets of accouterments, and about one thousand arms for cavalry, and the like number of sets of accouterments. Some of the companies already here have knapsacks, but most of them are without them, and those likely to come hereafter will be entirely unprovided in that particular. There are not quite enough tents, of an inferior quality and make, for the troops that are here, and no suitable material is to be found at this place for making more. There are not enough mess-pans and camp-kettles for the troops that have been mustered into service, and the assistant quartermaster, Captain Gilmer, informs me that he has orders from the head of the Quartermaster’s Department to make no contract for the manufacture of any articles without orders from headquarters. There are several establishments here in which mess-pans, camp-kettles, and canteens can be manufactured, and I suggest that orders be given to that effect. If knapsacks cannot be furnished from Richmond, the men can make out pretty well by rolling up their clothes in their blankets and wrapping pieces of coarse cloth around them ; and there are several large tobacco factories, which are idle, and can be procured as quarters for the troops, so that if arms can be furnished we can get along. If there are plenty of good flint-lock muskets they wflll do very well if percussion muskets cannot be furnished to all.
I find matters here in quite a confused state, owing to the inexperience of the officers of all the departments. Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne has made no apportionment of troops among the counties to rendezvous here, and, in fact, has made no call, specifying the number to be received at this place. He has merely given notice, in the papers, that he would muster into service volunteer companies from the counties designated. This has produced a good deal of uncertainty and confusion. I do not wish this to be considered as a complaint against Colonel Langhorne. It results from his entire want of experience in such matters. I am satisfied he has been endeavoring to discharge his duty faithfully; but I would very respectfully suggest that it is rather out of the usual course to intrust to a mustering officer, of interior rank, so large a discretion in regard to calling out volunteers. It strikes me that a call stating the number of regiments to be received here and the number and kind of companies to be raised in each county would facilitate the business very much. Some of the counties, as, for instance, Henry, Patrick, Carroll, Giles, Mercer, Tazewell, Wise, Buchanan, and McDowell, are remote from the lines of railroad, and cannot be communicated with very expeditiously; and, therefore, it is important that the call upon them should be definite. I would also suggest that it is not likely that there will be more cavalry companies from the counties east of the mountains except the two already mustered and one from Franklin unless, perhaps, one may be raised in Campbell. The counties west of the Alleghany must be relied on to furnish the remainder of the companies required to make out a regiment. Colonel Radford has reported, and he would prefer having command of the regiment of cavalry, and I think it would be better to give it to him, as he will, in all likelihood, be the only colonel that will be available who has had experience as a cavalry officer. I do not understand exactly the

﻿Chap. IX.] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC----------CONFEDERATE.	853
last orders in regard to tlie troops from Campbell, Bedford, Botetourt, Boanoke, and Craig (letter from Major-General Lee, of May 9). Am I to organize a regiment out of said troops, and give Colonel Badford the command of it, or shall I give him command of the whole, including the cavalry companies, and order him to report with them to Colonel Cocke ? Shall I send off said troops before they are armed, or wait for their arms %
Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne informs me that he received instructions to send Captain Moorman’s company (called the Beauregard Bifles) to Richmond, to be armed. The order, however, has been mislaid, and, as he may have misunderstood its tenor, and the instructions are inconsistent with the orders to me to send the troops from Campbell, &e., to Colonel Cocke, I have thought proper to wait for further orders, which, for dispatch, can be sent by telegraph, if the company is to be sent to Bichmond.
A Mr. Eugene Carrington has exhibited to me an order from Major Ficklin, quartermaster, appointing him transportation agent here, and directing all orders for transporting troops, &c., from this place to emanate from him. I had thought that the quartermaster here would have control of the arrangements for transportation from this point, but I confess I am little acquainted with such matters, and I submit whether the appointment by Major Ficklin of a transportation agent here (while there is a quartermaster here) is regular.
I hardly think much can be done in the way of arming cavalry companies with double-barreled guns in this region. A number of the men have not got them, and have not the means of purchasing them if they were to be had.
You will pardon the length of this letter, but I thought it better to embrace all the matters about which I want instructions, and about which it is necessary to communicate with you, in one letter than several.
Yerv respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. A. EABLY,
Colonel, Volunteers, Commanding at Lynchburg, Va.
Williamsburg, Va., May 16,1861. Maj. Gen. B. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
Sir : A reply to your communication of the 14th instant, as well as to the reference to me of Colonel Mallory’s letter of the 13th, directed to Governor Letcher, is contained in the following statement: Immediately on my return here, learning that Yorktown had been threatened by a U. S.' steamer, and that a creek, a short distance below, had been entered by a barge, filled with men, with as little delay as practicable I sent the Irwin Guard, to protect, to the extent their strength would allow, the citizens of the town and county near5 and, on the same day, went there myself. After careful inquiry, I came to the conclusion that no landing was contemplated or had been, and that the alarm was groundless.
From Yorktown I went to Hampton, for the purpose of calling into service the volunteer force in the vicinity. On the road I was informed of the demonstrations (alluded to in the letter of Colonel Mallory) by the garrison of Fort Monroe, and, in consequence, determined to see Colonel Dimick, at present commandant of the fort, and ascertain, if possible, the cause of the encroachment. On the 14th (Thursday) I requested

﻿854	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
and obtained an interview with him. He informed me that in taking possession of the spring west of Mill Creek he had no other object than to get water for his garrison, and that unless the safety (health) of his troops required an expansion of the area within the Government limits, for encampments, &c., he had no idea, under existing circumstances, of an aggressive movement. He frankly told me at the same time that he did not know in how short or long a time these circumstances might be changed. He laughed at the idea of violence being contemplated towards Hampton. He expressed great regret at the present state of things, and was kind and conciliatory. We agreed it would be better for the guards not to approach too close together. Accordingly I gave orders to the guards from Hamilton not to go within half a mile of the fort. Judging from the means of information within my reach, and from wiiat I saw and heard near the fort (I was not admitted beyond a point near the gate, on the outside), I have no hesitation in asserting that no mules or horses have been landed there in any numbers, and that the force is not sufficient, in any respect, to warrant the supposition of an invasion from that quarter. I shall endeavor to keep you informed of any important changes in the state of things around Fort Monroe.
While in Hampton I directed the formation of a camp of instruction and observation, within about three miles of the town, to be commanded by Major Gary. This camp will be the rendezvous of five companies, numbering about three hundred and twenty men. It is as well to say that this camp will not cost the State anything, the material being furnished by the county. The same is true of the camp near Williamsburg. Major Cary is instructed to maintain a system of patrols, and to keep pickets at the most important points and landings 5 also, to obstruct the roads, as far as is compatible with their use by the neighborhood.
In addition to the five companies, there are seven foot and one horse company (about 500 men) ready, or very nearly so, to be mustered into service. Of these 820 volunteers not more than 300 are armed, and of the 300, at least 150 have only flint-lock muskets. There ought to be four hundred percussion-lock muskets sent at once. As yet I have received but two hundred and fifty flint-lock guns, and a part of them cannot be used, being imperfect.
No further orders have been received by me respecting the militia. Colonel Mallory wishes to know who has the control of his regiment. The question as to my power to call them out ought to be settled. The post at Yorktown, I infer, is not under my jurisdiction. I shall, with pleasure, afford to the officer in command there all the aid I can. Are the approaches below Yorktown to be under the supervision of Major Montague, also ?
As the quartermaster for this district has declined, allow me to remind you of Mr. Saunders, better qualified than any one else I know.
The adjunct professor of mathematics at William and Mary College has, for several weeks, been engaged in examining and surveying the county here for the defense, and it would be proper to give him an appointment in the civil engineering department of the State. The name of the gentleman is Snead.
A half a dozen cadets could be most usefully employed in the camp of instruction here, and I respectfully ask that this number be sent.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
BENJ. S. EWELL,
Active Virginia Volunteers.

Grafton, Ya., May 16, 1861.
Col. R. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General Virginia Army, Richmond, Va.:
Colonel : In my last report I stated that I would first get possession of the arms consigned to Major Goff, and then try to collect a force and occupy this jdace. I accordingly sent a messenger to Major Goff, at Beverly, about fifty miles distant, and proceeded to ascertain what force I could get, its condition, and the sentiment of the people in the counties of Taylor, Barbour, and Harrison. I also sent orders to the captains of companies, supposed to be armed, in the surrounding counties, to bring their companies immediately to a designated point, near Grafton, and there await my orders. The messenger from Beverly returned with the reply that nothing had been heard of the rifles, nor had Major Goff* been informed that they were to be sent to him. This is a serious disappointment. Several companies in this vicinity are organizing and expecting to be furnished at once with arms and ammunition. I found a company organizing at Pruntytown, in this county, which will be ready to receive arms in a day or so. There is another at Philippi, in Barbour County, awaiting arms, and another in Clarksburg which will soon be ready. I have seen the officers of these companies. There are other companies forming in the surrounding counties, but all without arms and ununiformed. This force, when received, will not for some months be more effective than undisciplined militia. There are but two companies in this vicinity known to be armed. One of these, Captain Bogges?, at Weston, about forty-five miles distant, has the old flint lock musket, in bad order, and no ammunition. The other, Captain Thomi> son’s, at Fairmont, twenty miles from this place, has a better gun, and some ammunition. These companies are now marching towards this point; are ordered to do so, at least. This is the only force on which I have to depend, and it is very weak, compared with the strength of those in this section who, I am assured, are ready to oppose me.
I have found great diversity of opinion and much bitterness of feeling among the people of this region. They are apparently upon the verge of civil war. A few bad men have done much mischief by stirring up rebellion among the people, and representing to them the weakness of the State, and its inability or indisposition to protect them, the power of the Government at Washington, and their willingness to give any aid required to resist the State authorities. I am too credibly informed to entertain doubt that they have been and will be supplied with the means of resistance. They and their accoiniffices have also threatened the property and persons of law-abiding citizens with fire and the sword. Their efforts to intimidate have had their effect, both to dishearten one party and encourage the other. Many good citizens have been dispirited, while traitors have seized the guns and ammunition of the State, to be used against its authority. Arms in the hands of disbanded volunteer companies have been retained for the same avowed purpose. The force in this section will need the best rifles. Those at Harper’s Ferry, which were injured by the fire,if fitted up, will do very well, as there will not be the same use for the bayonet in these hills as elsewhere, and the movements should be of light infantry and rifle, although the bayonet, of course, would be desirable.
I have the honor to be, yours, very respectfully,
GEORGE A. PORTERFIELD,
Colonel, Virginia Volunteers.

to Major Goff and Lieutenant Clienoweth at Beverly, for the use of the troops under your command. Several hundred arms have also been sent, for the use of your command, to Colonel Jackson, at Harper’s Ferry. Several companies have been directed to go with the arms from Staunton to Beverly, and to gather strength as they passed along. It is hoped that a considerable force has, by this means, been gathered together, which will be increased by the arrangements which you have made.

Sir : Your letter of the 15th instant is in hand. The engineers who examined York Biver considered Gloucester Point the lowest available position for a battery for the defense of the entrance of that river. It is difficult to procure men enough to man the battery already erected, and, by increasing posts, this difficulty would be enhanced.
Colonel Taliaferro has been previously directed to muster the troops from the county of King and Queen into the service of the State, and to form a regiment at Gloucester Point of the troops from the three counties of Gloucester, Matthews, and King and Queen. It is hoped that sufficient troops from those counties will be obtained for the defense of their homes.

Commanding, (be., Gloucester Point, Fa.:
Colonel : Your letter of the 14th instant is in hand. I regret to learn that your force is so small, and request you to use every exertion to increase it. Under the authority of the governor, by his proclamation of the 3d instant, you are authorized to extend your call for volunteers to the county of Matthews. It is hoped that you will collect troops enough from the counties of Gloucester, King and Queen, and Matthews to form at least a regiment, to which your force should be extended. It is not desired to take private houses, unless the exigencies of the service imperatively require it. A proper hut can be erected for a hospital. There are no military engineers available for laying off* the rear defenses you desire, and it is hoped that the naval officers and others with you will be able to perform the duty. It is probable that the laboring force in the neighborhood will be sufficient to perform the work required on these lines of defense. Blank forms, &c., have been directed to be forwarded to you from the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments.

Commanding at Alexandria, Va.:
Colonel : Major-General Lee instructs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 16.# It is very important to secure the rolling stock of the Loudoun and Hampshire Eailroad, but General Lee thinks it would be quite as much exposed to seizure by the enemy at any point on that road near Alexandria as in the town itself. If taken up that road for safety, it should be taken to Leesburg or its vicinity. General Lee thinks it would be better (if practicable) to obtain the co-operation of the Alexandria, Loudoun and Hampshire and the Alexandria and Orange Eailroad Companies in the construction of a temporary track connecting the two roads, to run the cars of the Loudoun and Hampshire Eoad out on the track of the Orange and Alexandria Eoad at night, as a precautionary measure.

Lieut. Col. B. S. Ewell, Commanding, cfee., Williamsburg, Va.:
Colonel : I have received your letter of the 16th instant, in relation to your visit to Hampton, for the purpose of calling into the service of the State the volunteers from that region. Your report, in reference to affairs at Fort Monroe, is satisfactory, and it is hoped your arrangements for procuring information will be sufficient to secure intelligence of what transpires.
You will give orders to Major Cary, commanding the camp of instruction and observation, to attend rigidly to the instruction and discipline of the troops, to keep a strict watch on all military movements, and to keep you advised. He will endeavor to quiet the apprehension of the citizens, act strictly on the defensive, and be ready at all times to take the field, under such orders as he may receive from you. Four hundred percussion muskets, with a supply of ammunition, have been ordered to King’s Mill for you.
The battery at Yorktown, with those of Gloucester Point and West Point, is under the general charge of Captain Whittle, of the ISTavy. Major Montague is in command of the troops stationed there for their protection, &c. The troops and operations below Yorktown are under your control and direction. There are no cadets available for duty with you. It is hoped that some young officers, acquainted with military instruction, may be sent you. The general decides, as you will perceive by the inclosed paper, that no question of rank can arise between yourself and Colonel Mallory, who is not on service. You are in command of the Sixty-eighth and One hundred and fifteenth Begiments of Militia, and invested with authority to call out such portions of those regiments as you may judge necessary to support the volunteer force.

Sir : I have been gratified at the reception of your letter of the 15th instant, giving an account of your visit to Harper’s Ferry. I had hoped that the Maryland people would relieve us of the necessity of occupying the Maryland Heights. Colonel Jackson was directed to give to their occupation the appearance of its being done by the people of that State, and not to take possession himself till necessary; but the time has been left to his discretion which I am sure will be wisely exercised. There is no doubt, under the circumstances, of our right to occupy these heights.
Measures have been taken, more than three weeks ago, for securing the control of both branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Eailroad and for throwing a force into the disaffected region of the State; to carry out which Major Loring has been sent to Wheeling to protect the terminus of the main road, and Colonel Porterfield has been sent to Grafton, with instructions to concentrate there three regiments, at Parkersburg one regiment, and at Mo.undsville one regiment. These measures having in part failed, several companies have been sent from Staunton to Beverly, with instructions to gather strength as they passed through the country for Colonel Porterfield’s command. By these means it is hoped that a considerable force has been concentrated at Grafton by this time, and loyalty in some degree engendered in the disaffected region of which you speak.

see troops. As soon as they arrive he desires that they be forwarded to this place, where they will be issued to the troops for whom they are intended.
I am, &c.,
E. S. GARNETT,
Adjutant- General.
Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 21,1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : The force now assembled at this place and its outposts consists of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Virginia Regiments; the Fourth Regiment from Alabama; two regiments from Mississippi; five companies of Virginia Artillery; eight companies of Virginia Cavalry ; lour companies of Kentucky Infantry, and some small detachments, amounting to seven thousand seven hundred men, of whom it may be said that seven thousand are available for active service in the field, well armed.
On Sunday, the 19th, I inspected the Alabama regiment and the Third and Fourth Virginia. Yesterday it rained so continuously that nothing could be done. In the evening I visited the position opposite the Point of Rocks, distant twelve miles from this point, where Captain Ashby, of the Virginia cavalry, an excellent officer, is stationed, with two companies of cavalry, six pieces of light artillery, and a company of riflemen, together with some men from Maryland, only a part of whom are armed. His cavalry is employed in active reconnaissance of the surrounding country, and his artillery has complete command of the bridge crossing the Potomac, the piers of which are mined, and can be instantly destroyed, in case of necessity; in addition to which, he holds possession of the road at the Point of Rocks in such manner as to prevent the passage of a train.
I have not yet visited the Maryland Heights, where redoubts are now going up; but, from frequent conversations which I have had with Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan, the officer in charge of the work, I am convinced that but little more is necessary to render that part of the ground quite secure. Of this, however, and other subjects, I shall be able to give more definite information in a more detailed report.
The Maryland Heights being out of the question, the most probable line of approach would be by Hagerstown and Shepherdstown, making the attack from the northwest. But the precautions of Colonel Jackson have rendered such an approach a matter of great risk. At Shepherdstown we have the bridge, and the conformation of the ground is, I understand, all in favor of the resisting force.
The troops here are all raw and inexperienced—wanting even in the first elements of the school of the soldier—and there is a great scarcity of proper instructors. Many of the captains are singularly ignorant of their duties. Guard duty is very loosely done; and, indeed, there is apparent on every side the mere elements of men and arms, without the discipline and organization of an army. There is a sad deficiency in clothing and in camp and garrison equipage; and I fear that the exposure to which the troops have recently been subjected in the cold, rainy weather will swell the list of sick, already large. To make up, however, for this loose state of things, so striking to the professional eye, it must not be forgotten that a fierce spirit animates those rough-looking meir; and, if called upon, even now, to meet their enemy, I have no fear of the result of battle. There is a determination abroad among men

who have collected from far and near to give a summary chastisement to any force which may have the hardihood to invade the soil of Virginia. This spirit is invincible.
This afternoon I shall endeavor to reach the Maryland Heights. Tomorrow I shall finish my inspection of the troops, and will muster into the service of the Confederate States nine companies of Maryland volunteers, who are exiled from their State, and are here drawing rations, and are anxious to serve for the war.
On Friday or Saturday I will return to Eichmond, visiting General Cocke’s command en route, and will then submit my report in full to Major General Lee.
I have not asked Colonel Jackson his opinion on the subject, but my own is that there is force enough here to hold this place against any attack which, under the existing state of affairs, may be contemplated.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. DEAS,
Lieutenant-Colonel and Inspector-General, (7. 8. Army.
Williamsburg!, Va., May 21,1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
Sir : The receipt of your communication of the 20th instant is hereby respectfully acknowledged. In a letter received to-day from Major Cary, there is the following: u It is evidently the purpose of Colonel Dimick to take possession of a portion of Virginia soil.” I think so too, if his garrison requires more space. I have prohibited a useless and hopeless resistance to this until Colonel Dimick is at least out of the range of the Old Point guns with the force that may accompany him. It is difficult to manage Hampton. The people are excitable and brave even to rashness, and are unwilling to seem to give way. It (Hampton) might, on the approach in force of the Federal troops, be evacuated by the military, and the remaining citizens ought to make terms, unless, indeed, it is made a second Saragossa. I doubt if, from the nature of the buildings, this could be done. For the adjutant of the battalion here, I wish to appoint Prof. E. Taliaferro. He has not much military experience, but has great intelligence, is firm and cool, has industry and activity, and is to be depended upon. I prefer him to any one I know here, and ask authority to appoint him from the ranks, or else to have him elected a supernumerary officer of a volunteer company, that I may appoint him. There are no field pieces here yet. Excuse me for calling your special attention to this fact. Before knowing your intention to order troops to Yorktown, with Captain Meade’s assistance I adopted a line of defense on the land side, covering the road from Old Point, the Poquosin Eiver, and, in fact, from every landing on the York Eiver below Yorktown. The plan was to repair the redoubt built by the British for the defense of this or these roads, and to erect another small redoubt ; both to be defended with field pieces. The two hundred and forty men now in Yorktown, for the defense of the battery of two guns, could not hold the place against a field battery, muskets not being able to cope in an open country with a well-appointed battery. This fact, or advice, is not stated to inform you, but as a mode of making known the necessities of the force at Yorktown. Major Montague and myself are on the most friendly terms, and, if you approve of it, I am perfectly willing to aid him in the repairing and

construction of the field works in question or to point out the plan. It is beyond doubt that the land approach to Yorktown is in greater need of protection than the water. If the defense of Yorktown had not been within my control, as it was before Major Montague was sent there, it would not be proper for me to write of it as I have done. Under the circumstances there is, I hope, no impropriety in addressing you on the subject.

Troops in large numbers are arriving at Fort Monroe. In order to man and properly protect the batteries, so many men are required, and so many points of attack are threatened, that I feel it my duty to call at once for an additional force of not less than four thousand men.

Headquarters,
Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 21, 1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
General: Since this place has been strengthened by additional troops and artillery, so as to give confidence to our people, there has been a manifest improvement in public sentiment in this county; but I regret to say that in Berkeley things are growing worse, and that the threats from Union men are calculated to curb the expression of Southern feeling. While I have been unwilling to diminish the force here, yet, for the purpose of checking the disloyalty there, I have ordered the regiment from Jefferson opposite to Williamsport. You speak of concern at the want of alacrity on the part of companies west of here. This is partly due to their unarmed condition and want of a secure place of rendezvous. If no better plan is practicable, I would suggest that a force destined for the northwest be assembled, ostensibly for the defense of this part of the State, at Winchester, or some point near here, and that the moment that the governor’s proclamation announces the ratification by the people of the ordinance of secession, such troops be put in the cars, as though they were coming to this place, but that they be immediately thrown into the northwest, and at once crush out opposition. This force need remain there only for a short time, until the local ones could be armed. You will pardon me for urging promptness in what is to be done for that section of the State. Any want of this may be disastrous.
I send herewith a letter from Captain Shriver, of Wheeling, who has been on a visit here. I wrote to Colonel Garnett that Colonel Huger had gone on to Eichmond, for the purpose of procuring whatever may be necessary for the efficiency of the heavy batteries $ but I regret to learn that he has been delayed by sickness on his way. Should he not reach Eichmond before this letter, please forward a large supply of ammunition for ten 24-pounder guns, if it can be spared. Should Colonel

Harper’s Ferry, Va., May 19,1861. Colonel Jackson, Commandant, Harpers Ferry, Va,:
At this time there is between three and four hundred Federal troops stationed upon the fair grounds on Wheeling Island, Ohio County, Virginia. They have been regularly sworn into the service of the U. S. Government by Colonel Oakes, who has been in the city of Wheeling for some time past expressly for that purpose. These troops have been furnished with arms by the U. S. Government at the request of citizens of the counties of Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, and Marshall, for the express purpose of resisting the authorities of the State of Virginia. At this time A. W. Campbell, of the city of Wheeling, by a published authority from Governor Dennison, of Ohio, will not permit citizens of Wheeling to ship provisions in any quantities over the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

Engineer’s Office, Richmond, Fa., May 21,18G1. Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee, Commanding Virginia Forces:
Sir: The examinations preparatory to commencing work for the defense of this city are far enough advanced to enable me to select the sites for two redoubts on the cordon it is proposed to occupy. The first will be on the eastern side of Marion Hill, commanding the road leading up the river, and the country generally to the eastward; the second will be on high ground, near Tuder & Co.’s nursery, and quite near to the ravine of Gillies Creek. It is proposed to make the redoubts of sufficient capacity to contain garrisons of six hundred men. For a more perfect defense of the tongue of land between James River and Gillies Creek some two or three small redoubts are needed, in consequence of the irregularities of the ground, which is much cut by abrupt ravines. I do not propose commencing them immediately. The two principal redoubts may be ready for a laboring force on Thursday next, if you approve the foregoing suggestion. On the accompanying tracing the locations are indicated by the letter R in red. As soon as the lines of the works are traced on the ground, a requisition will be made for the ordnance required for arming them. The topographical examination between Gillies and Shockoe Creeks is not sufficiently advanced for continuing the cordon around that section, but it is believed that works can now be laid out, so as to give full employment to all the available labor at the disposal of the city authorities.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
