Reports of GoL Charles P. Stone, Fourteenth U. S. Infantry, commanding
expedition.
Headquarters Rockville Expedition,
Tennallytown, June 11, 1861.
Captain : I have the honor to report my arrival at this place with Captain Owen’s company of volunteer cavalry, and the Second, Third, Fifth, and Eighth Battalions District of Columbia Volunteers. We got into camp here yesterday at 11 o’clock a. m., with the exception of the Third Battalion, which was a little later, owing to the double duty of its commandA, who performs the duties of A. Q. M. and A. C. S. to the expedition, as well as those of commander of battalion. The section of Griffin’s battery and Captain Magruder’s cavalry arrived at Rockville about 11 o’clock a. m. yesterday, and at the same hour two canal-boats at the Chain Bridge, where they await a battalion for the expedition along the canal. I propose to detach for the latter service Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, with the Fifth Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, and have encamped him conveniently for the purpose.
The movement will be made as soon as the regiments at Rockville are sufficiently refreshed to move rapidly in the direction of Edwards Ferry.
The people in this immediate region are for the Government almost to a man. Those at Rockville are reported to me as being about one-half rabid secessionists, calling themselves u States-rights ” men.
Couriers are said to have been started immediately on the arrival of the first troops at Rockville, to give notice to the enemy at Harper’s Ferry of our advance. Exaggerated reports of our numbep have gone forward. No difficulty has been experienced in obtaining forage so far, and the A. C. S. will be able to purchase plenty of fresh beef. The small rations and bread for the command will have to come from Washington or Georgetown.
Very respectfully, I am, captain, your most obedient servant,

Colonel Fourteenth Infantry, Commanding Expedition.

Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt at 5 p. m. yesterday of your letter of the day previous, the contents of which are duly noted, and my movements will be governed thereby. Yesterday afternoon at 4.10 o’clock Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, moving along the canal in boats with his battalion, occupied the aqueduct at Seneca Creek, placed guards, and established patrols. At 4 p. m. Major Jewell, with

his battalion, moving by the river road, occupied Seneca Mills, one-half mile north of Lieutenant-Colonel Everett. At the same time Colonel Stiles, moving with his regiment along the upper road, occupied the village of Darnestown, three miles from Jewell. There was but ten k minutes7 time difference in the occupation of the points designated, the i ■ three corps moving on different lines—one a distance of twenty-five v - miles} another twenty-two miles; the third nine miles5 an exactitude unusual in volunteer troops. The arrival of the troops here was most opportune. The loyal citizens were under most uncomfortable pressure, and doubtless would have had difficulty in casting unbiased votes at the election to-day. The conduct of the men in Eockville has been admirable. Not a complaint has been made to me of depredation on private property, and the soldiers are most kindly received and are very popular with the people.
Yesterday I sent forward Lieutenant Piper, of the artillery, to recon-noiter beyond our positions. He reports the roads good; beef and forage plenty. He reports also that the enemy crossed the river in small force yesterday morning near Edwards Ferry, and attempted to break the canal, but the lock-keeper drew off the water at that point, which satisfied them, and at the same time makes the destruction of the embankments more difficult. Sufficient water can at any time be let in to float out canal-boats in case of our desiring it. We ha^e now secured the canal to within six miles of Edwards Ferry, thus securing water transportation that far at least.
The impression has been produced (by my making reconnaissance and minute inquiries) that I move immediately on Frederick.
The troops of the expedition are now posted as follows: The Eighth Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, Captain Gerhard* at Ten-nallytown, keeping open communication at Washington and the rear of the three lines of advance. The Fifth Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, at the aqueduct, on canal, seven or eight miles from Edwards Ferry, one company of eighty-five of this battalion having been left at Great Falls to watch the ferries. The Second Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, Major Jewell, at Seneca Mills, three hundred and three strong, one-half mile north of Lieutenant-Colonel Everett. The Ninth Regiment New York troops at Darnestown, three miles north of Major Jewell, a good road connecting the last three-named positions. The First Pennsylvania and First New Hampshire Regiments, Third Battalion (Smead’s) District of Columbia Volunteers, are encamped here. The section of Griffin’s battery and the cavalry are encamped one mile from this, in the direction of Darnestown.
A fine spirit seems to be general in the command, and it is well supplied with everything, except medical attendance in the District of Columbia Volunteers. Only one assistant surgeon is present with all the battalions, and he comes simply as a volunteer. No provision has been made for them, although I have long since and repeatedly made the proper representations on the subject. I fear there will be suffering from this deficiency whenever the battalions are separated from the regiments, and in case of action there would be unnecessary loss of life. At present the health of the whole command is good.
Very respectfully, I am, colonel, your most obedient servant,
CHAS. P. STONE,
Colonel Fourteenth Infantry, Commanding Expedition.

Rockville, June 14,1861—8 o’clock a. m.
Colonel: The First Regiment Pennsylvania was pushed forward early this morning two miles beyond the position of the New York Ninth Regiment, on the road to the two ferries. The section of Griffin’s battery has gone to the same point. The First New Hampshire will leave this evening, bivouac nine miles from this, and, in the cool of the morning, proceed to Poolesville. I leave within the hour, taking the cavalry force to make a reconnaissance beyond Poolesville, towards the ferries, where there are said to be 300 to 400 of the enemy. I do not credit the report, but, if true, it will not be difficult to capture them.
From Poolesville it will be easy to march either on the ferries or to the Point of Rocks, as may be deemed most advisable.
The command is in good health and fine spirits.
I inclose returns of elections in this region, showing a large majority for the Union candidate for Congress.

Poolesville, June 15,1861.
Colonel: I have the honor to report that the troops of the expedition have to-night occupied Edwards Ferry and Conrad’s Ferry, the two approaches to Leesburg. The former is held by a portion of the Pennsylvania regiment, a piece of artillery under Lieutenant Hasbrouck, and twenty cavalry. The latter is held by a portion of the First New Hampshire Regiment.
It is believed here that Harper’s Ferry has been evacuated, and that the garrison has retired, by way of Winchester, towards Manassas Junction. I shall send scouts out to-morrow. Ascertain, if practicable, the truth or falsity of the story.
Lieutenant-Colonel Everett reports that he thinks the enemy are erecting works nearly opposite his position, on the canal, at the mouth of the Seneca Creek. The enemy at Leesburg were frightened, it is said, on Thursday evening, and burned the Goose Creek Bridge (railroad), tore up track, burned cars, &c. They have not, however, yet evacuated the place. The command is well and doing well.

Poolesville, June 16,1861.
Colonel : 1 reported last night the occupation of the two nearpst ferries across the Potomac. One hour after that report was written there was a very large fire some miles to the westward of our position here, on the Yirginia side. Those who know the country well state that it must have been the destruction of the turnpike bridge over Goose Creek.
The enemy occupy with small (visible) force the Yirginia landing of Edwards Ferry, and it is my impression that they have four pieces of

artillery on the south side of Goose Creek, about two hundred yards south of the ferry landing.
If I become satisfied that Harper’s Ferry has been evacuated, and that a general retreat has been made, via Winchester, I shall cross the river by the upper ferry and ford, capture the force, whatever it may be, at the lower ferry, occupy Leesburg, and open means of communication, as rapidly as possible, with General Patterson on the one hand and General McDowell on the other, taking especial care to restore, as rapidly as practicable, the transportation routes on both sides of the river down. The canal on this side will require but -a handful of men, and should General Patterson be in possession of Harper’s Ferry, the whole canal from that point to Washington can be put in working order in one day.
I am just sending out an officer to inspect the canal above, and I think that water can be thrown into it a few miles north of this, which would relieve all this part of the State from the great inconvenience which now exists in getting supplies to and from Washington or other markets. Great convenience would also result to the Government in forwarding supplies along the river. Should such work interfere with the main objects of the expedition, it will not, of course, be attempted.

Poolesville, June 16, 1861—p. m.
Colonel : The enemy have appeared opposite the two ferries in force, probably part of the late Harper’s Ferry force, and dispute our passage towards Leesburg. They are throwing up a battery on the road between Edwards Ferry and Leesburg. Lieutenant Abert is reconnoitering along the river above their upper position. Captain Magruder is doing the same up the Monocacy road. My weakness for attack is want of artillery. Had I a full battery the approaches might be guarded by part to advantage, while another portion could be used in turning them. My impression is that these are Harper’s Ferry troops, but that their main body has taken the road to Manassas Junction.

Colonel : I have the honor to report that the enemy opened fire on the guard at Conrad’s Ferry (five miles above Edwards Ferry) this morning about 10 o’clock. The point was and is occupied on our side by five companies of the Kew Hampshire First Infantry. The enemy were reported to have three cannon, but in a careful examination I was unable to discover more than one 6-pounder field piece. They amused themselves by firing some twenty shots, apparently at the staff on which the Kew Hampshire troops had raised the national colors. Ko damage whatever was done to our men by the firing, and it appeared so object-

less, that I conjectured it must have been intended to cover an advance at some other point. I therefore made dispositions for watching the fords above and below, and threw out scouting parties to intercept any possible movement from the mouth of the Monocacy Eiver.
It is very necessary to hold these ferries and protect the canal, for the enemy seem disposed to destroy everything they do not control, and the canal is absolutely necessary to the well-being of this neighborhood—one of the best small-grain districts in the State. It is now suffering for want of means of transportation, and the appearance of troops here has had an excellent effect.
I shall for the present hold the main body of troops here, keeping a strong guard at each of the ferries and pickets up and down the river at the fords. I have this evening strengthened the posts at Seneca Mills and the aqueduct by two companies of the Ninth New York, and have moved the remainder of that regiment to a point near Dawson-ville, to watch the roads leading toward Washington from the upper fords and ferries near the Point of Eocks.
It seems to be universally conceded here by the people along the river that Harper’s Ferry has been abandoned, but it appears to me strange that no communication has come from General Patterson, who, if at Harper’s Ferry, could communicate with me in four hours. I do not feel at liberty to detach a force so directly off* my necessary line of operations.
From the above rough sketch [diagram on the original copy] you will perceive that I cannot with safety trust my command immediately at the ferries, without exposing the route to Washington to any force which might have crossed above, near the Monocacy, and at the same time getting my troops into a horseshoe, with the rear exposed to the same force and a river in front. As at present arranged, they can all maintain their positions until relieved, and if attacked by an over: whelming force, all can withdraw towards Georgetown through defiles easily defended.
On the other hand, if all, or nearly all, the forces lately at Harper’s Ferry have retired toward Manassas, so that there remain none in sufficient numbers to make a demonstration by this route toward Washington, we are in a position here to be assembled and thrown into Leesburg at any moment.
I feel greatly the want of artillery, and should be glad if more pieces could be spared to me.

My Dear General : Your two notes of yesterday were both received by me this afternoon at Conrad’s Ferry, where I had gone to make an examination of the position of the enemy, who opened fire on our guards there this morning with one or more 6 pounder guns. The force on the opposite side of the river does not appear to be large, probably in the immediate vicinity of the Ferry not more than 800 men; I could not see 100. We have there five companies of the New Hampshire regiment, with pickets thrown out above and below the Ferry to watch the fords. I could see no other object for the firing

than an attempt to amuse us, to allow a large force to cross somewhere above and attack our flank and rear, for the purpose of cutting us off from Washington and marching in that direction. My dispositions were made accordingly.
The New York Ninth was ordered to the entrance of the Darnestown road, the Pennsylvania regiment and half of the New Hampshire, with one piece of artillery, disposed here for approach of the enemy from the north, and I strengthened Conrad’s Ferry only by twenty marksmen from the Pennsylvania First Eegiment. The New Hampshire troops have the old musket, which has not power enough to do mischief across the river. A chance ball from one of the Pennsylvania muskets is said to have disabled a man at the enemy’s gun this morning.
While writing this I hear the firing recommenced by the enemy.
I have no reliable news from General Patterson’s command. Eurnor here says Harper’s Ferry is occupied by U. S. troops.
Two companies are detached from the Ninth Eegiment to strengthen the force on the river near the mouth of the Seneca, where Colonel Everett and Major Jewell are stationed.
As your messengers do not seem to understand the roads near this point, and have letters from you to deliver at Seneca Falls, I send this to Captain Mead, at Eockville, with orders to send it forward immediately. I write also to Colonel Townsend by same route. All your kind hints will be carefully remembered.
I remain, dear general, very respectfully and truly, yours,

General: Your letter of this date has just been handed me.* As 1 have conflicting reports about the strength of the enemy now firing on the front of my position, and no positive assurance that there is not a force above, I do not feel authorized to weaken the force here by a withdrawal of a regiment, as I might thereby expose Washington to an attack from this direction, and at the same time put my command in a desperate condition.
I hope to have reliable information by morning, and, if favorable, will send down the nearest regiment—the Ninth New York or the First Pennsylvania.

estimated by the officer in command of the guard there at from 800 to 1)00 men. They made use of the ferry-boat, which they had withdrawn from the Potomac. I had given orders that on any attempt to move the boat fire should be opened on it, and in-compliance with these orders Lieutenant Hasbrouck fired from his 12-pounder field howitzer a spherical case shot, which burst directly in range, and covered the boat with a shower of bullets and fragments. The effect was excellent. The horse of a mounted officer leaped overboard, and the boat was rapidly drawn back to the shore. The enemy then formed line along the crest of the bank and commenced firing, but a few well-directed spherical case shot dispersed them, and sent them flying towards Leesburg. I deemed it important to prevent communication along the river between these forces and those opposite Lieutenant-Colonel Everett’s position.
To-night I shall order up Captain Smead’s battalion to within supporting distance of both Colonel Everett and Colonel Stiles, and to-mor row morning shall be able to open communication with General Patterson by a trusty hired messenger.
I respectfully request that orders may issue to the proper departments to send to-morrow by canal, in boats of light draught, 18,000 complete rations, excepting the meat ration, of which only 9,000 will be necessary; also, 15,000 ball cartridges, elongated bullet, cal. .58; 15,000 ditto, elongated bullet, cal. .69, and 15,000 ditto, round ball, cal. .69, all consigned to Capt. John R. Smead, acting assistant quartermaster of this expedition. These stores can come by canal as far as the aqueduct, occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Everett, and can be thence transported in wagons.
In addition to the before-mentioned ordnance stores, I request that there may be forwarded 140 6-pounder spherical case shot, fixed, and 144 12-pounder spherical case shot, fixed.
I can now at any time, with very small loss, occupy Leesburg, but can see no advantage which would justify even the small loss which would be sustained, and the slight risk to my line which would necessarily result.

Colone l : I have the honor to report that a gentleman has just arrived in my camp from Martinsburg, Berkeley County, Virginia, where he was a major of militia. He fled from Martinsburg on the 9th instant, because three companies of Confederate troops arrived there for the purpose of impressing into service all the militia. These three companies were commanded by Captain Letcher, he believes a brother of the governor. This gentleman concealed himself, and escaped with some two hundred others, and made their way through the mountains, away from the roads, out of the State. He states that two regiments have been impressed in Berkeley County, most of them strong Union men, who are determined to shoot their officers and go over to the Government troops the first opportunity; that these men carry, many of them, little United States flags concealed about their persons, and intend to

stick them in their musket boxes and join the United States forces whenever they can; that some of the impressed men are so obstinate that arms were not given to them, but they were carried away and made to do police duty in the camps. The troops at II aider’s Ferry were badly fed and badly clothed$ had very poor shoes, and few of them.
There is nothing new to be communicated from this command.

Colonel : I sent a trusty messenger up the river yesterday as far as opposite Harper’s Ferry. He reports that there were no troops of the United States at or near that place. Harper’s Ferry was completely deserted, except by a few poor families.
An action between our forces and those of the enemy at Martinsburg was vaguely reported as a complete defeat of the enemy.
I find it necessary to occupy the ferry and fords at Monocacy, and for this purpose order up the Ninth New York this evening. I go myself in a few minutes to take possession, hoping to capture the ferry boat, which the enemy were trying to raise last night. More artillery is needed, and I hope may be furnished me.
It is difficult to restrain the New Hampshire troops from crossing the river, but the officers seem disposed to do their duty in carrying out orders.
The people in the neighborhood seem to gain confidence in the Government day by day, and the troops, especially the Pennsylvania First, are very popular with them. I find that the women and children had been taught by the Virginians and active secessionists here to expect every species of outrage and horror on the arrival of the United States troops. The reaction is very strong, and the troops are now looked to for protection.
I am informed that repairs will be immediately commenced on the canal, and that the line will be in order in nine or ten days’ time. It will require careful guarding at present.

sent back to Washington, and having permitted the battalion evidently to become demoralized, I have issued an order directing its return to Washington, where I recommend that it be mustered out of service.
If practicable, a small regiment should be ordered to the post (Seneca Mills) lately occupied by that battalion.

Poolesville, June 22, 1861.
Colonel : I had the honor to report yesterday some dissatisfaction in the Second Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers, in my zeal, and that I had ordered that corps to Washington. Later in the day such urgent appeals were made to me by all the officers of the battalion, that I consented to suspend the order directing its return, and it will hold the same position as before—Seneca Mills. I consider that part of the line of the Potomac so important, that I recommend its being strengthened by a small regiment or a strong battalion, which I cannot spare from this region.
The Ninth New York now occupies the mouth of the Monocacy and the line of the river Potomac as far as Noland’s Ferry.
The wheat crops of this region are now within a few days of harvest, and are very abundant. Loudoun County, Virginia, is exceedingly productive, and next week will commence one of the richest harvests ever made there. I deem it very important that that county should be occupied, so as to save the crops of the many loyal citizens there, and prevent the enemy seizing them and gaining advantage of the supplies.
I was this morning applied to for security for a crop immediately opposite, belonging to a Union man, but do not feel at liberty to cross until some communication comes from General Patterson, showing his dispositions and those of the enemy. I have sent messengers as far as eight miles above the Point of Eocks, but they were unable to learn anything concerning the position of troops of either force.
I respectfully renew my application for more held pieces or mountain howitzers; and if a small portion of the force now with General Patterson can be caused to join me Loudoun County can be secured and the enemy made very uneasy on his left flank while he faces General McDowell.

As stated in my letter of yesterday, I deem it important that Londonn County should be occupied immediately; but much, very much, has been already lost by a failure of some troops to occupy Harper’s Ferry and Point of Eocks.
My pickets extend to within three miles of the Point of Eocks, but with my present force I cannot advance them a mile with safety, and can only justify my present position by constant activity aM watchfulness, and by keeping these troops under my command worked as constantly as troops can bear.
Half a regiment at Point of Eocks, and the same force at a point opposite Harper’s Ferry (if it be not deemed advisable by the general in command at Williamsport to occupy the Ferry itself), would relieve me from great anxiety, and would have saved much uncertainty among the citizens of Virginia and Maryland.
When I pushed forward my posts to Monocacy and Noland’s Ferry I supposed that United States troops in some force had certainly occupied the abandoned important points within twenty-five miles of them. We cannot control the Potomac without holding all the points I do, and not with safety and certainty without occupying those of Harper’s Ferry or Knoxville and Point of Eocks.
The inclosed appeal of a Virginian I believe to be genuine, and I have no doubt many have been forced into the ranks of the enemy since my arrival here.
Yesterday the opposing pickets at Conrad’s Ferry met in the middle of the river, shook hands, and drank each other’s health. The Virginia picket men said they did not wish to fight, but u wanted to go home.”
With a little more force, and a slight co-operation on the part of General Cadwalader or General Patterson, I could move forward with safety and success. I cannot do so, however, until Harper’s Ferry is occupied by somebody and its position understood.
The health of the command remains excellent and the spirits good. An order to cross the river would be received with enthusiasm.

Colonel: I left camp at midnight last night on a reconnaissance up the river Potomac, accompanied by Capt. Wm. S. Abert, A. A. A. G., and Captain Stewart, A. D. C., with an escort of a dozen cavalry, having communicated all my plans of operations up to that time to Col. F. E.

As you are already aware, the bridge across the Potomac has been burned by the enemy. I found that the enemy had a picket of five men watching at the Virginia end of the burned bridge. At Point of Eocks I learned that there were no troops on this side of the river above, and dispatched Captain Abert, with two men on a hand-car, to a point opposite Harper’s Ferry. Captain Abert returned at 1.45 p. in., and reported that he had visited Sandy Hook, opposite Harper’s Ferry, where he was

received by the inhabitants with the greatest enthusiasm, and questioned with much earnestness and anxiety as to when they would be relieved from their present painful position by the presence of United States troops. He made a careful personal examination of the ground in the neighborhood, which he found had been occupied in the most absurd manner by the enemy during their recent presence there. He met Captain Newton, Engineer Corps, reconnoitering the position, and gave him, for the information of General Patterson, an account of the numbers and positions of the troops composing this expedition. Captain Abert learned from good authority that General Johnston was this morning at Winchester with about 10,000 to 12,000 troops, and that he had broken up his camp, and was preparing for a hasty march to-day in some direction, supposed to be Cumberland.
I had an interview at Point of Rocks with a man just from Leesburg, who informed me that he saw about 950 South Carolina troops arrive at Leesburg last night. This would make the force there about 1,600, with supporting troops nine miles off.
The enemy destroyed to-dav a large number of locomotives belonging to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, together with a train of cars, said to be more than half a mile long. General Johnston might reach Leesburg by to-morrow afternoon, and either attempt the passage of the river or move towards Arlington. Should he come to Leesburg, my impression is that it will be with a view to make a demonstration on General McDowell’s right. In my opinion the Point of Rocks and Sandy Hook should be immediately occupied; the first, because it is now used as a crossing place to and from Virginia ; the second, because of the justly-founded alarm pervading the community, and the right of those loyal citizens who have faithfully stood by the flag under circumstances of difficulty and danger to protection at the first moment possible.
Had I one regiment more, and more artillery, I should occupy Sandy Hook to-morrow, and should I find that the enemy neglect my positions, I shall certainly occupy the Point of Rocks, for the purposes above indicated, and also for securing my right flank.

Colonel : From informers, and what can be seen from our positions, I feel assured that there has been a considerable increase of force in Leesburg and its vicinity. Yesterday morning General Johnston was at Winchester, as reported by me last night, and some of his forces may be those which have been seen this morning opposite us. I believe some have passed south of Goose Creek in the direction of Arlington, but there were undoubtedly nearly one thousand South Carolina troops opposite us yesterday.
The destruction of locomotives and railroad cars noticed in my letter of last night took place at Martinsburg. The number of locomotives is said to be thirty-five, and the line of cars was said to be more than half a mile long.
An eye-witness reported General Johnston’s force at Winchester to

have been yesterday morning at least ten thousand, and this informer said that he saw all baggage packed and the force ready to move at a moment’s notice.
I am not in a position to relieve the loyal people up the Potomac, but am impressed with the absolute necessity of relief being promptly afforded.
I respectfully request again, with the risk of being deemed importunate, an additional force of artillery of some class be sent me, and that the cavalry force may be increased by the remainder of Company H, Second Cavalry, now in Washington, if it can be possibly afforded. I am much cramped for pickets of mounted men and escorts for recon-n offering purposes.
The health of the command continues good.
Very respectfully, colonel, your most obedient servant,

Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of copy of letter to General Patterson of 25th instant. Nothing of importance has occurred since my last report. The Virginia guards at the ferries seem to have been replaced by South Carolina troops, who recommenced the unsoldierlike practice of firing at pickets across the river. The fire was carefully returned, and nothing of the kind has taken place for twenty-four hours past.
Colonel Patterson reports that the South Carolina troops, who passed Goose Creek the day before yesterday, are said to have encamped about two to two and one-half miles south of that creek, a mile or two back irom the Potomac. I respectfully repeat my application for more cavalry for reconnoitering purposes, and additional field pieces. This command can properly man four more pieces if they can be furnished, as on£ of the companies of the Pennsylvania regiment has been well drilled at a battery in Philadelphia (Cadwalader’s old battery), and I have with me three officers of the regular artillery. Guns in position would enable me to dispose of a more considerable portion of the infantry force for the watching of the fords, always numerous, and daily becoming more so as the dry weather continues. The health of the command remains excellent, the sick report not averaging three per centum of the force.
Considering the circumstances of the District of Columbia Volunteers, I respectfully recommend that said infantry force be replaced by a regiment of State troops, and if an additional regiment can be spared, it would greatly facilitate my operations.
Very respeetfullv, I am, colonel, your most obedient servant,
CHAS. P. STOKE,

Camp near Poolesville, June 28,1861.
Colonel : The following reports of the force and position of the enemy opposite my positions are from negro scouts, and from appearances are nearly accurate. There is a gradual strengthening of force near Edwards Ferry—two regiments (not Virginians) at Leesburg, about 1,200; 400 having been detached from the 1,600 previously reported as a guard at Conrad’s Ferry.
Four pieces of artillery are to-day reported opposite Edwards. One thousand additional troops were to arrive at Leesburg overnight.
Considering the ease with which their forces can be suddenly increased from the direction of Winchester, and the extended line of posts which I am obliged to occupy, I deem it only prudent that this command should be re-enforced, so that I may be enabled to complete my line of posts to above the Point of Eocks, and have a disposable force to move to any position which may be attacked, and be able to take advantage of any indiscretion on the part of the enemy. I deem it highly important to occupy the Point of Eocks, and guard the ferries and fords there, and a little above and below. Communication is constantly going on there, and the enemy can at any time cross and destroy the canal and railway track.
No communication has yet come to me from Major-General Patterson or any of his command. The only intercourse between us has been the meeting of our reconnoitering parties opposite Harper’s Ferry. I do not dare to weaken my force by further detachments, and there seems to be great delay in occupying the space between us by General Patterson.
All letters which pass from Maryland into Virginia now go between the Point of Eocks and Harper’s Ferry, a communication which could be entirely cut off by one regiment, which would at the same time give great impetus to the Union feeling in Frederick County, Maryland, and Loudoun and Berkeley, Virginia.
The disposition shown by the enemy to burn and destroy private property makes me solicitous about that strong Union district. Hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of property could be destroyed in a few hours there by a small force, the telegraph wires cut, and the canal made useless to us for months.

General : I have this afternoon received your letter of yesterday’s date,* and have sent orders to Colonel Cake to bring his battalion to this point as rapidly as the well-being of his troops will permit.
I yesterday reported an increase of the enemy’s force opposite my position, and am very desirous of showing them a strong front, and at the same time to occupy more ground on my right.
At present, with Harper’s Ferry unoccupied, the disaffected in Maryland have tree communication with Virginia across the Potomac above the Point of Eocks, and information and supplies go daily to the enemy.
Not found.

The railroad and canal are not safe for a single night, and yet I cannot with anything like prudence detach a force fpr guarding the line unless strengthened for the purpose.
I suppose Major-General Patterson must have weighty reasons for leaving the point opposite Harper’s Ferry without guard, for I feel that each night risks an immense amount of private property and wearies the loyal people, while it encourages the sympathizers of the enemy.
With two regiments more I can occupy the entire line from Georgetown to Harper’s Ferry, and with three more do not only that, but operate between General Johnston and General McDowell.

Colonel: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Special Orders, No. 109, which came to hand this morning.
The advance towards General Patterson’s supposed position will commence this afternoon. I propose to occupy Point of Rocks to-night with six companies of the Ninth Regiment New York, to send forward the First Pennsylvania to-night as far as the Monocacy, which will enable the last-named regiment to join the Ninth New York fresh tomorrow forenoon. The rear will be covered by the First New Hampshire Regiment, which will, until the last moment possible, guard the fords and ferries near this place. To-morrow evening I shall hope to occupy the Maryland Heights, opposite Harper’s Ferry, with the First Pennsylvania and six companies of the Ninth New York, having four companies of the Ninth New York at Point of Rocks, and the New Hampshire First and battalion of Pennsylvania Twenty-fifth at the Monocacy.
It will be with serious misgivings that I leave this horseshoe of the river unguarded, for I shall expect to learn that the enemy have crossed immediately on my leaving, and doubtless the canal will be destroyed, as well as large amounts of grain of the old and new crop. To guard as far as possible against such a result, I shall post 100 of the returning District of Columbia Volunteers at Edwards Ferry, with two days’ rations, and shall send their baggage to the canal at Seneca, giving them orders to hold the ferry while their supplies last, and then fall back on the river road, or the tow-path, to their baggage, with which they will return by canal to Washington. The force at Seneca, being composed entirely of District of Columbia Volunteers, will hold their position until the arrival of the former, and return to Washington with them.
I regret greatly the necessity which exists for leaving this village and vicinity without troops, as I have said before, and hope that these troops may be replaced before any evil results. The position and crops deserve occupation, if it be in any way practicable.
The time required to retire the volunteers carefully will give opportunity to send other troops, if it be deemed advisable.

Colonel : The six companies of the Ninth New York advanced yesterday afternoon to Point of Bocks; First Pennsylvania Artillery (Colonel Patterson) started for Licksville, but the heavy rain which came on rendered the roads impassable, and he was obliged to halt this side the Monocacy. The battalion Twenty-fifth Pennsylvania Begiment arrived last night. The provision train with much difficulty reached here from Seneca this morning.
Captain Magruder has started on his march to Washington with Company H, Second Cavalry. The President’s Mounted Guard is at Edwards Ferry, and will march for Washington, via Seneca, to-morrow morning, with the Third Battalion District of Columbia Volunteers. Piper’s section of artillery will await the assembling of the District of Columbia Volunteer battalions at Seneca, and then proceed to Washington, accompanied by the President’s Mounted Guard.
The movement of the First New Hampshire Begiment from this place will necessarily depend on the progress of the trains. I hope to see Harper’s Ferry to-night.

I have just returned from Sandy Hook, opposite Harper’s Ferry, to which point a division of the New York Ninth and the First Pennsylvania Artillery have been advanced. A messenger came in to me there from Sharpsburg, bringing intelligence that there was an affair at Falling Waters yesterday, in which the Government troops captured five hundred prisoners and six pieces of artillery. Our loss three killed and some wounded.
The messenger states that there is a battle going on to-day on the road between Falling Waters and Winchester. Harper’s Ferry appears to be deserted. I could see but half a dozen people in the town without my glass. Shall I have any further instructions'?

There are now at that point the Pennsylvania First Begiment, part of the New York Ninth, and Colonel Cake’s command. The train of provisions and ammunition has been detained on the road, but will be up tonight.
I have no news from General Patterson since my telegram of last night. Had I only a little artillery and cavalry a good advance could be made, co-operating with General Patterson. I hope to occupy the town of Harper’s Ferry to-night or to-morrow morning, in spite of the want of artillery.

The last companies of the Kintli New York go up to the Ferry this afternoon, and will be followed by part of the New Hampshire.
It will be necessary to leave two or more companies at this place to keep up our communications for supplies. Captain Abert is engaged now in reconnoitering the fords above Harper’s Ferry and securing boats in which part of the passage can be effected.

Opposite Harper’s Ferry, July 5,1861.
Colonel : Yesterday afternoon, while I was engaged in bringing up more troops from the Point of Bocks, Harper’s Ferry was suddenly occupied by a few of the enemy, who opened fire on our pickets. The latter were re-enforced by a company of the Kinth Kew York Begiment, and firing was kept up for about half an hour, resulting in a slight loss on both sides ; on ours one private killed and three wounded. As far as now known the loss of the enemy was two killed and two severely wounded, but there are reports that his loss was greater. The enemy retired to the rear of the town.
I have this morning received a letter from Major Porter, assistant adjutant-general, Department of Pennsylvania, of which a copy is inclosed herewith.
The movement directed to be made by infantry alone, in a country occupied by hostile cavalry, will be somewhat hazardous.

move up towards Charlestown and effect a junction in that direction. As soon as provisions arrive he will advance to Winchester, if the foe have not evacuated that place. At present only small parties are known to be in our vicinity, hovering about to pick up stragglers and careless pickets.
If you have information which, in your judgment, renders the movement directed above injudicious or hazardous, you are desired to communicate your information and act upon it till you hear from him again.

I have to leave two companies here to guard baggage and look out for the railroad, so that the communication may not be cut off with the baggage and provisions above. It was necessary to lighten the wagons much to make a quick march.
I regard it of great importance to re-enforce those small guards, and would respectfully recommend that a regiment be sent to Sandy Hook. Two wounded and a few sick men have to be left there.
The New Hampshire regiment’s train will overtake it this evening, and it (now opposite Harper’s Ferry) will push on to be at Williamsport to-morrow morning. I shall get there (Williamsport) to-night or early in the morning.

JUNE 13, 1861.—Descent of Union Troops on Romney, W. Va.
Report of Col. Lew. Wallace, Eleventh Indiana Infantry.
Headquarters Eleventh Regiment Indiana,
Camp McGinnis, June 14,1861.
Dear Sir : Having been notified that several hundred rebel troops were quartered at Romney, Hampshire County, Virginia, drilling there, impressing Union men, and in other ways oppressing loyal citizens, I determined to disperse them, if possible. For that purpose I left Cumberland at 10 o’clock on the night of the 12th instant, with eight companies, in all about five hundred men, and by railway went to Kew Creek Station, twenty-one miles distant.
A little after 4 o’clock I started my men across the mountains, twenty-three miles off, intending to reach the town by 6 o’clock in the morniug. The road was very fatiguing and rough, leading along high bluffs and narrow passes, which required great caution in passing; so much so, indeed, that with the utmost industry I did not get near Romney until about 8 o’clock. In a pass a mile and a half this side the town my advance guard was fired upon by a mounted picket of the enemy, who dashed ahead and alarmed the rebels. In fact, I afterwards learned that they had notice of my coming full an hour before my arrival.
In approaching the place it was necessary for me to cross a bridge over the South Branch of the Potomac. A reconnaissance satisfied me that the passage of the bridge would be the chief obstacle in my way, although I could distinctly see the enemy drawn up on the bluff, which is the town site, supporting a battery of two guns, xilanted so as to sweep the road completely. I directed my advance guard to cross the bridge on the run, leap down an embankment at the farther entrance, and observe the windows of a large brick house not farther off than seventy-five yards. Their appearance was the signal for an assault. A warm fire opened from the house, which the guard returned, with no other loss than the wounding of a sergeant. The firing continued several minutes. I led a second company across the bridge, and by following up a ravine got them into a position that soon drove the enemy from the house and into a mountain to its rear.
My attention was then turned to the battery on the hill. Instead of following the road, as the rebels expected, I pushed five companies in skirmishing order, and at double-quick time, up a hill to the right, intending to get around the left flank of the enemy, and cut off their retreat. Hardly had my companies deployed and started forward, and got within rifle range, before the rebels limbered up and put off over

the bluff in hottest haste. Between their position and that of my men was a deep, precipitous gorge, the crossing of which occupied about ten minutes. When the opposite ridge was gained we discovered the rebels indiscriminately blent, with a mass of women and children, flying as for life from the town. Having no horse, pursuit of the cannoneers was impossible. They went off under whip and spur. After that I quietly marched into the place, and took possession of the empty houses and a legion of negroes, who alone seemed unscared by our presence. After searching the towTn for arms, camp equipage, &c., I returned to Cumberland by the same road, reaching camp at 11 o7clock at night. My return was forced, owing to the fact that there was not a mile on the road that did not offer half a dozen positions for the ruin or rout of my regiment by a much smaller force.
The loss of the rebels we have not been able to accurately ascertain. A citizen of Bomney admitted two killed. My own surgeon dressed the wound of one man. A number of tents were taken. Quite a number of rifles were destroyed, and, among others, I have a Maj. Isaac Yan-dever prisoner, a gentleman who, from accounts, has been very active in exciting rebellion, organizing troops, and impressing loyal citizens. I have also an excellent assortment of surgical stores, which, with the tents, I have taken the liberty to convert.
My regiment behaved admirably, attacking coolly and in excellent order. Where all behaved gallantly, I cannot single out officers for praise. Sufficient to say they conducted themselves like veterans, and in such a manner as to entitle them to your confidence in any field.
I I beg to call your attention to the length of our march—eighty-seven jmiles in all, forty-six of which was on foot, over a continuous succession lof mountains, made in twenty-four hours, without rest, and varied by a brisk engagement—made, too, without leaving a man behind, and, what is more, my men are ready to repeat it to-morrow.
I have already received your approval of my enterprise, for which I am very much obliged. One good result has come of it: the loyal men in that region have taken heart. Yery shortly I think you will hear of another Union company from that district. Moreover, it has brought home to the insolent “chivalry” a wholesome respect for Northern prowess.
Yery truly, sir, your obedient servant,
