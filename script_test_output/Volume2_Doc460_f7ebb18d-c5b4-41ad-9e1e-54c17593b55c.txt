time successfully repelled a body of skirmishers deployed against him. At the several points observed by Captain Herbert there were posted two batteries and a large reserve of infantry to sustain them. During the morning the regiment was ordered to cross the ford, which order was promptly executed by officers and men, and the regiment formed in column at the head of the ravine, on the enemy’s bank, near their batteries. Shot and shell were incessantly poured over their heads, but without any damage, and the regiment under order retired to their original position.
The only loss sustained was by Company H—one killed and three wounded. Officers and men displayed a good deal of coolness and bravery.
I have, general, the honor to be, yonr obedient servant,
