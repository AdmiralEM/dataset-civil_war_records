Col. J. B. MAGrRUDER, Commanding, &c., Yorhtown, Va. :
General : I have .been gratified by your report of the 30th ultimo, of your advance with Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux’s command to the vicinity of Newport News, and of the measures taken by you to repress the marauding parties of the enemy and to restrain them within their limits. It is hoped that your letter to Colonel Phelps will have the effect of preventing the barbarous treatment of our citizens, and it is believed that it cannot be in consonance with the feelings of the officers. In the expeditions sent to the neighborhood of the enemy you are desired to take every precaution to prevent being surprised or cut off. Yery respectfully, yours,

Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes, Commanding, Fredericksburg, Va.:
General : General Lee directs me to say that he entirely approves of your views, as expressed in your communication of yesterday, in regard to the erection of a battery at Mathias Point. They coiucide exactly with what he has expressed at various times. To erect a battery there would be for the purpose of preventing the passage of the enemy’s vessels up the Potomac$ which, so long as we hold our present positions above, and can continue to hold them, is a matter of very little consequence. Nevertheless, the enemy must never be permitted to occupy and fortify the point themselves 5 and therefore, to prevent this, it will be necessary for you to keep a vigilant eye upon his movements, and to repel any attempt of the kind.

The occupation of Gray’s Point, however, on the Bappahannock, is of great importance, and Colonel Taleott has been directed to proceed there, for the purpose of establishing a battery. The three heavy guns which have gone to Fredericksburg you will send to him, on his requisition to that effect. The general approves of the organization which you have made of the Virginia regiment.

Col. Georgke Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir: I have the honor to report that, while fortifying Young’s Mills and the mouth of Warwick Biver, on July 2, reports reached me that the enemy at Newport News Point, having been re-enforced from Fort Monroe, in consequence of our advance, would probably attack the position before I could make it secure, it being only eleven miles distant by land and an hour’s voyage by water. I therefore ordered down the Fifth Louisiana and Sixth Georgia Begiments, and placed them in reserve at and near Warwick Court-House, about two miles in the rear of Young’s Mills. I strengthened this place then by erecting intrench-men ts for guns and breastworks for men both at the mouth of Warwick Biver and in rear of the marsh connecting Young’s Mills with the mouth of the river.
On the 3d, late in the day, I received positive information that the enemy was passing large bodies of troops, with an extensive park of artillery, over Hampton Creek, and, as I had made Young’s Mills quite strong, 1 ordered several regiments to move, by a flank, to Harrod’s Mills, on the York road, placing the Georgia and Alabama battalions in a deep forest between the two positions, so as to render support to either.
I left Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux in command at Young’s Mills, with his own battalion of five hundred men, one company of rifles, two pieces of artillery, and one troop of cavalry, with written instructions as to the course he should pursue in any case that could occur. I proceeded then to Harrod’s Mills and commenced fortifying it. At 9 o’clock I heard that Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux had determined to go in person down on the Warwick road, near Newport News, to cut off parties of the enemy that might come out the next morning. I regretted to hear it, as I left him in charge of the important post at Young’s Mills. However, it was too late to prevent it, and early the next morning I received the intelligence that he had been killed in a skirmish with an advance party of the enemy, who, after one or two fires, fled, leaving our men in possession of the field, with a loss of two killed and one wounded on our side; that of the enemy not known precisely, but supposed to be four killed and wounded.*
Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux was a gallant officer and accomplished gentleman. His loss is much lamented by all the regimental officers as well as myself, and is deplored by his battalion. His remains were buried, with religious ceremonies and military honors, to-day, as well as those of Private Hackett. Subsequently metallic coffins arrived from Bichmond, and they were forwarded in them to Louisiana, at-

tended by six of his battalion. I mention these circumstances, as they may be of interest to his friends, should they inquire concerning him at the Adjutant-General’s Office.
I received to-night the inclosed letter. It is written by a negro who is perfectly reliable, and whose information has been very correct heretofore. His master, who is on my staff, and who is himself a man of great firmness of character and entirely reliable, believes the statement fully.
I go to Williamsburg to-morrow, and take with me fifteen hundred men. There will be then in and about Williamsburg only thirty-five hundred men, and five thousand here. There should be here at least seven thousand effective men, and at Williamsburg at least five thousand. The ground in front of Williamsburg affords a fine field for the play of guns of great range, and some long-range guns should be placed there if practicable. The place is very weak. There are very few guns, and they are of an inferior character. Altogether its weakness invites attack. I shall write from there to-morrow; but, in the mean time, ask for four more strong regiments, a battery of artillery, 12-pounders preferable, horsed and drilled. If there are no such batteries, then one of light artillery, well mounted and drilled. The road from Williamsburg to Richmond is plain and easy. The landing below is easy, and can be prevented only by the means pointed out by Captain Rives, who presented his views to Colonel Talcott on the subject. These recommendations involve two large guns, one at Spratley’s farm, on James River, to enfilade the landing, as far as or nearly to Grove Landing, and the other below the Grove, to enfilade it as far as Skiff Creek. Below this it is difficult and tedious, and involves a longer march. I am very uneasy about Williamsburg. If the enemy get that strong position between College and Queen’s Creeks, they will fortify it well, will mask their work, and march up to Richmond. Nothing is easier, unless these guns are sent. As to those brought from Gloucester Point to this place, I approve of it, because it was represented by me by Major Randolph (at least I so understood it) that the 9-inch columbiad in question was so placed as to fire up the York River. As the field in front of the old English fort affords a range of a mile and a half to two miles, such a gun was necessary here. Another was absolutely necessary to command the apple orchard, which itself commands all the rest of our position; therefore the enemy must not be allowed at any time to fortify it. This place taken, Gloucester Point falls. These are my convictions. The columbiads were put up in my absence. I respectfully ask to be informed if I shall have them dismounted. I am told there are two columbiads or 32-pounders at West Point not mounted. If so, I would like to have one sent to Gloucester Point. This would save the necessity of dismounting one here. I omitted to mention that I fortified Harrod’s Mills, on the York road, and then, on the 6th instant, I brought back the command, with the exception of Major Hood’s cavalry and one piece of artillery, which I left with him, and at his request sent the two companies of cavalry just arrived from Ashland to report to him. He has gone down the country to-night to try and surprise some of the enemy. After sending in the troops yesterday, I visited the Poquosin River and laid off, with Captain Meade, positions for batteries on the west side of this river, which I will have fortified if the enemy gives me time. I shall inspect at Gloucester Point to-morrow, and then proceed to Williamsburg, from which place I shall write again. While I shall

Dear Gentlemen of Yorktown: It is with much pleasure that I have taken this opportunity this morning to address you all with a few lines, in order to let you all know what I heard yesterday from a black man from our free town, Hampton. He says the Yankee guard is on the road from Fox Hill to town. They will not let any person pass nor repass, white nor black, on the account bf bringing news out of Hampton. All that is in have to stay in, and all that is out have to stay out. Lincoln’s and Butler’s white and black negroes are preparing for York and Williamsburg. They have two thousand negroes in Hampton. They report that their time is up; that they are getting ready to go home. But I heard that this is only a blind; so you all must be on a lookout, night and day, for Yankee negroes. They may make their appearance before my letter reaches you all. Agreeable to what I heard, I heard Samuel and William belong to Mr. Samuel Latimere; John Smith belongs to Mr. Thomas Latimere; Jack Allen belongs to Mr. G. Mears. These four boys are at the Point; so I heard. They ran away from Williamsburg. Jack, so I heard, came down by land, with a chain around him. He says he stole by the men on post while they were asleep with their blankets over their heads. These other three men came on the east side of James Biver until they came to a boat, then came down to Newport News Fort. They were taken there that night, and they put them in one of those tug-boats and carried to Old Point. They were taken before General B. F. Butler. He asked them where they were from. Williamsburg, sir. What have you all been doing there'? Working on batteries, sir. Good! You all are the boys for me; you all are the very boys; you all are worth money. Men, take good care of these boys, particularly; they are not to want for nothing. I will give you three passes to go and come when you please. You all three appear before me to-morrow morning again. You all must not be out the way. We all are going up to York, in short, and we want you all to pilot us up there, and show us how to get in the bateries, so we can go right to Bichmond. So you all and generals cannot be too particular and on a bright lookout. George Scott will be in the band too. Please do not tell this to wives nor servants. Burn this letter up.

General S. Cooper,
Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va. :
General: Since I forwarded to you Colonel Jackson’s report* from Darkesville nothing has occurred worth mentioning. I waited in that position until yesterday, hoping that the enemy might, by leaving his strong post at Martinsburg, give us an opportunity to light. Becoming convinced that he had no such intention, I returned to this place last night, and am now having a few slight field works thrown up, under Major Whiting’s directions, to cover our cannon and militia. The latter are assembling; two brigades were called out, the commanders of which expect to have 2,200 men by evening.
General Patterson received two regiments day before yesterday, and several others are said to be approaching Martinsburg by Williamsport.
The service here requires a few more regular officers in quartermaster and commissary departments $ two more competent to command brigades, and one for adjutant-general.

He cannot reach Martinsburg before to-morrow evening. Colonel Stone has left Noland’s Ferry, just before Point of Bocks, pushing forward his men to be at Martinsburg. The First Pennsylvania Begiment marched from Frederick City by way of Shep-herdstown yesterday about 6 o’clock. This regiment had four pieces of artillery.

General: Understanding that some difference of opinion exists with regard to the distribution of heavy ordnance between this place and Gloucester Point, and that the recent transfer to this post of a 9-inch shell gun has given rise to some dissatisfaction, I beg leave to submit my reasons for advising that transfer: The lines on the land side of this post are from a mile and a half to two miles in extent. For the distance of about one thousand yards from the point of intersection with the river east of the town to the marsh on the south of it the

[Chap. IX.
country is cleared to a distance of a mile in front of our works. Through this cleared space the roads from Hampton and Worm ley's Creek approach the line, and the ranges are a mile and more in extent. It was along these roads, and through ravines di verging from them, that Washington made his approaches and planted his batteries. Should the enemy bring a siege train from Old Point, or land guns from their vessels, which they may do within a few miles of us, they may erect heavy batteries between the roads from Hampton and Wormley’s Creek and for some distance west of the Hampton Eoads, which will destroy our works unless we have guns of equal metal on our side. I have ascertained that there are two ravines running from WormleVs Creek and the Hampton Eoads, wdiich unite eight hundred yards in front of our lines, and send out two branches, one to our left and the other two or three hundred yards farther to our right, affording a perfect protection to the enemy until within four hundred yards of our lines. They may make their approaches through these ravines without being seen, and at night might construct a parallel which light pieces of artillery could not destroy. To guard this portion of our lines, I made a requisition for eight 30-pounder navy guns of the class weighing 27 cwt., and submitted it to General Lee for his approval. He approved of it, and also of a requisition for four 42-pounder carronades, intended for the line along the march where the ranges are short. Only two of the 32-pounders were sent, and we were then informed that the remainder had been sent to General Beauregard, and that we could get no more of them. I then proposed to substitute for the six 30-pounders of 27 cwt. two 9-inch shell guns and a long 32-pounder of 61 cwt., intending to mount the latter on the old English redoubt in the center of our defenses, and to fire solid shot over the heads of our own men. The advantage of this position is that it commands the entire country around, and affords a very extensive field of fire for a gun of long range. We obtained one shell gun which had just arrived at Gloucester Point, and, hearing subsequently that two others had arrived, I went over during your absence, at Colonel HilPs request, to get another. I found that it was intended for an embrasuie in the water battery not yet opened, and designed to afford the means of firing on a fleet after it had passed the batteries of Yorktown and Gloucester Point and anchored above; and also to sweep the beach for a short distance, not exceeding two hundred yards, above the battery. Considering these rear defenses of the water battery of less importance than our lines on the land side, I advised the transfer of the gun. It is right to add that there were two shell guns at Gloucester Point not mounted, one of them intended for an elevated platform in the rear of the water battery, from which the beach below the battery is completely commanded, and the other to fire up the river, as above stated. The barbette gun is mounted, I am informed, making the tenth or eleventh heavy gun, I believe, in the water battery. The land defenses of Gloucester Point have two 32-pounders, and the ground admits of a cross-fire from these guns through most of its extent. I do not know the length of their line, but suppose it not to exceed one thousand yards. Our lines are certainly not less than one and a half miles, admit of very little eross-fiie, and are defended by two shell guns and two 32-pounders. We have five field pieces stationed here. Three are at Gloucester Point two iron 6-pounders and CabelPs battery of four pieces, which, having no field service to perform, should be counted as a part of the artillery at that post.

G. W. EANDOLPH.

General : I have just been informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, commanding our cavalry, that he has reason to believe that the enemy intends to advance upon us to-night (the distance is but twenty-two miles). The evidences are that it is the belief of the people living near the town, ascertained by his pickets, and that three days’ provisions were issued to-day, and that a United States lieutenant had mentioned it.
We are not prepared beyond the readiness of our men to fight. The field works have not been progressed with far enough to make them useful, and the militia is not provided with fixed ammunition, having received but powder and lead.

[General Cooper ?]
General : I was so unwell yesterday as to be unable to write fully, and therefore trusted to the information contained in the note from Colonel Edmundson,* of the correctness of which, in the main, I have no doubt. Similar information from other sources gives me the impression that the re-enforcements arriving at Martinsburg amount to seven or eight thousand. I have estimated the enemy’s force hitherto, you may remember, at 18,000. Additional artillery has also been received. They were greatly superior to us in that arm before.
The object of re-enforcing General Patterson must be an advance upon this place. Fighting here against great odds seems to me more prudent than retreat.
I have not asked for re-enforcements, because I supposed that the War Department, informed of the state of affairs everywhere, could best judge where the troops at its disposal are most required. The arms ordered by Colonel Thomas for the militia are not here yet. The two generals expect some 2,200, but at present we cannot arm them all, and they have their own ammunition to fix, being furnished with powder and lead.
Most of the regiments which have joined since my arrival have incompetent officers, and are therefore still uninstructed.

Williamsburg, Va., July 9, 1861.
Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I inspected Gloucester Point yesterday afternoon, and found everything in good order; but am of opinion that more infantry is needed there. The enemy can land within five miles of this place, and bring against it a great force. If the land defenses are carried, the navy or water battery falls into their hands, and this battery, though commanded by that at Yorktown, is far the most effective against shipping. I have written Captain Whitt]e to send down the two 32-pounders now at West Point and not mounted, and will send one or both to Gloucester Point. Captain Cabell has only 6-pounder guns. He ought to have a howitzer 12-pounder, to assist in defending the land side. I have also to represent that the enemy can approach by the beach on York Biver in rear of the naval battery, and carry, or rather turn, completely the land defenses. To prevent this, and to properly man the works, there should, be sent to Gloucester Point another regiment, with these additions. I think Colonel Crump will hold the place against an immensely superior force. The 32-pounders I have ordered myself, but desire the 12-pounder howitzers and the additional regiment.
The extreme importance of the place, I think, fully justifies this disposition of means, if they can possibly be spared from other places equally exposed, and among these there are none so exposed as Williamsburg. I have collected, however, a considerable number of spades from private persons in Gloucester, and, after having used them to fortify, in some degree, positions of strength below Yorktown, I brought them with me last night, arriving here at 3 o’clock this morning, and turned them over to Colonel McLaws, who commands here. The Second Louisiana Begiment arrived here last night, and is now at work.
I have carefully examined the line of defense, as established before my arrival here, of which the redoubt, which was being erected when Major-General Lee was here, constitutes the center and main work. The line from College to Queen’s Creek, indicated in the full distance by Colonel Ewell as being only one and three-quarter miles in length, is represented to me by Captain Bives as being three and a quarter miles long. It cuts the city of Williamsburg at about its center, and it would be necessary to destroy more than half the town in front of it; besides, it would require more work to erect defenses on that line than to render formidable the line in front of it, where the redoubt is already finished. I have therefore decided, with the countenance of Captains Meade and Bives, of Colonel Ewell and Colonel McLaws, to erect four smaller redoubts on the advanced line, and these are now being erected, and rapidly.
1 inclose a report of Captains Bives and Meade as to the armament necessary for these works, and beg that the guns and ammunition for the same be sent as soon as possible. The enemy will advance as soon as he is prepared, and that will probably be soon. I ask for the smallest means, to enable me to defend this line with any reasonable certainty of success. The field guns ought to be furnished with horses

or mules, to enable me to advance with them, and to carry them oft* in case the force here should be compelled to fall back. I should be mortified to lose them, but could not help it if the means were wanting to remove them. I know the men can carry off some of them, but cannot depend upon such means for any distance. It is proper to prepare for advancing, for defending, and for retreating. Should we fail here, these guns would or might be wanted in Eichmond. We may not fail, but I am of opinion we have a long war before us, and cannot afford to lose any material.
The work contemplated at Mulberry Island, if that point is geographically situated as represented, would be of the greatest importance in defending this place and Richmond. If the enemy was forced, by such a work, to march up the Peninsula, there are several lines which would at once be fortified, where he would meet with very rough treatment or be repulsed. I think he would be entirely defeated. At present, and without this work, these lines can easily be turned, and landing made above them on James River. If it be decided to fortify at Mulberry Island, no time should be lost, and I would like to be informed of it, in order that I might give my attention to the lines spoken of.
I know the immense demands necessarily made on the resources of the country, and sincerely sympathize with those who desire (as I believe all do) to grant what is asked, but have not the power. Yet in justice to the common good, as well as to myself, I am constrained to add to these demands.

Sir: In accordance with your instructions, we have the honor to submit the following report on the number of guns required for the defenses in the vicinity of Williamsburg:
The number of guns “on hand at this place is two 12-pounders, in working order, with ammunition; eight 6-pounders, in working order, with ammunition; two 6-pounders, to be mounted in a few days. For the works now in course of construction at a minimum armament of two guns to each redoubt, there are required, in addition, eight pieces (12 or 24 pounder howitzers) for redoubts, and three heavy 8-inch colum-biads or 9-inch Daklgren navy guns for shore defense, viz, two at Spratley’s and one near Grove Wharf. Of the eight light pieces required, it is very desirable that four should constitute a mounted battery to be used in operating at favorable points beyond the works and to prevent a landing on the shore in the vicinity. Besides, it wrould be indispensable to protect any retreat that might be necessary to be made.

There are no troops with which you can be re-enforced at present. Two long 32-pounders, with a supply of ammunition, have been sent to you to-day, which you can apply to the defenses of Yorktown or Williamsburg, as you may think proper, and two 12-pounders will go lo you to-morrow, with a supply of ammunition, which you can dispose of in the same way. The facility of the enemy’s landing in the vicinity of the Grove Wharf, with a view either of attacking Williamsburg or Yorktown, is much lessened since the establishment of a battery at Day’s Point, which I hope will prevent their ascending the river. Watchfulness, however, on your part and every precaution must be continued. You can use your judgment as to applying the 32-pounders above mentioned at Spratley’s farm and below the Grove to defend that landing or to Yorktown and Williamsburg.

Assistant Adjutant- General, Richmond, Va. :
Colonel : If it is the settled policy of the general commanding to defer the establishment of a battery at Mathias Point, I beg respectfully to suggest that it will be better for me to withdraw the troops from there entirely and at once. The enemy can have no object in landing there, except to prevent our occupancy ;. and, if we withdraw our troops, it will be to them of no more importance than any other point on the river; whereas if we continue our forces there it will keep them constantly on the alert, and give to the point a fictitious importance which, in a military point of view, it does not deserve. We have now there some fifteen hundred men and a battery of artillery, all raw and almost entirely uninstructed. This force should not be reduced if the place is to be held; and, as they have a coast of seven or eight miles to guard, picket duties occupy them so constantly, that they have very little time and less disposition to drill. My wish is to bring them here, where they will be available for service, without having to perform a march of thirty-five miles, and where, under my supervision, the raw material can be converted into soldiers.

My Dear Sir : General Gist, the adjutant-general of South Carolina, goes to your headquarters to make himself useful to you in any way he can serve you, and it gives me pleasure to commend him to your polite attention.
Your letter found me trying by every method to hasten re-enforcements to you, but small as our force is, the want of transportation does not allow me to send such as we have except at a rate which makes me heartsick. I am still endeavoring to induce an increase of transportation, and hope, if not too late, to be able in a few days materially to increase your force. Everybody disappoints me in their answers to my requisitions for troops, and the last hope of a large force of militia coming to your aid seems doomed to add another to past disappointments.

I know you will [do] whatever is possible, and that you will only follow the dictates of your own good judgment and true patriotism. The anxiety of the reckless and the short-sighted policy of the selfish may urge you to fight when your judgment decides otherwise. The responsibility is great. I have tried for a week to get off and join you, but have not been able to do so, without having arrangements for procuring and forwarding troops to be delayed if not deranged.
I have ordered two officers of experience to go to you to-morrow; Colonel Forney’s regiment, will, I suppose, get off in the morning, if not this evening, and more shall go as fast as the railroad will permit. General Beauregard is expecting an attack, and asks for ten thousand men. Magruder wants four thousand. Garnett is lamentably weak, but with re-enforcements now on the way will, I hope, prevent a junction of McClellan and Patterson. Mansfield was reported to be in Washington on yesterday.
May God bless and direct you in this critical hour of our national existence.

General : Your letter of the 10th instant has just been received. It is not the intention at present to establish a battery at Mathias Point, nor until everything is prepared, guns, troops, &c., for its speedy erection. It is, therefore, desirable, as you have already been advised, to allay the enemy’s anxiety in reference to that point. Had troops never been posted there, I think it probable, as you state, that it would be viewed as of no more importance than other points on the river. But their attention having been attracted to it, and as it must be known to exercise a command over the rivef, I now fear, if not held by us, it will be seized by them and defended by intrenchments which it might be difficult for us to capture. If it was known that there was no intention of constructing batteries there, their apprehensions on this subject might be allayed and the troops withdrawn for the present; and perhaps, by keeping the troops put of sight, and setting a vigilant watch, prepared at any time to prevent its occupation and intrenchment, it might be all that was necessary. But upon this point you must exercise your own judgment, taking especial care to retain the point in our own possession.

authorized in your instructions, the President deems it unnecessary to extend the time suggested by you for the transportation of your volunteers, more especially as there are now here some companies yet to be sent forward to you under the previous arrangement, besides a regiment of North Carolina volunteers, two companies of which are now here and the balance expected in a few days. This regiment is understood to be armed and equipped. You are, however, notwithstanding the increase beyond your original numbers, authorized to cause to be mustered and incorporated into your legion all the volunteers that have been organized and have reported to you, including those yet to be forwarded.

Brig. Gen. J. B. Magkruder, Commanding, <fee., Yorhtown, Va.: General : I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 9th instant. I am gratified to learn, from your inspection at Gloucester Point, of the good order that exists there. The facility for landing a large force by the enemy, for the purpose of carrying the water battery, has kept me anxious for the safety of that position, and I am glad you concur in the importance of holding and strengthening it. If possessed by the enemy, the navigation of York Eiver will be open to him. 1 had hoped that you would have been able to have re-enforced its garrision by troops drawn from the surrounding counties. Though anxious to do so, I am without the means of sending there more troops at present. In case of an attack on that point it will be necessary for you to re-enforce it from Yorktown. The last two 12-pounders that are mounted have been sent to you, and two 24-pounder howitzers will be sent to you next Tuesday, and some 42-pounder carronades as soon as carriages can be provided for them. I hope you will urge forward the completion of all the earthworks for the defense of that place, and arm them as well as you can. I will send an additional regiment as soon as one is available. As regards the defenses of Williamsburg, I hope you will push forward their completion on the plan adopted by you, and use in its armament such guns as you now have. The eight 24-x>ounder howitzers which you require will be forwarded to you as soon as carriages for them can be completed. I cannot now say whether the columbiads desired by you can be provided, unless they can be spared from other points, where they are now in position. I do not consider the guns proposed at Spratley’s and Grove Wharf so important now, since the battery at Day’s Point, on James Eiver, has been established, as stated in a previous letter. It will be necessary for you to make a requisition for such horses or mules as you may require to move the field guns. In reference to the proposed work at Mulberry Point, it will be commenced as soon as its necessity is ascertained, for which surveys are now being made, and, in connection with it, if found necessary, a battery is proposed for the opposite point.

General: I cannot, take the responsibility of withdrawing the troops from Mathias Point on the condition that the enemy will not be permitted to land there, although I believe that if he does so it will be with an overwhelming force that cannot be successfully resisted by the command now there 5 and as it is too remote to be re-enforced from here and is not a favorable point from which the enemy can begin an invasive march, I cannot see why any importance should be attached to its possession, and this opinion is strengthened by the report of Captain Kennedy, C. S. Navy, that Evansport is quite as convenient a point for stopping the navigation of the river. But why think of the navigation at all ? If we invade it will be ours, as a necessary consequence ; if not, the stoppage of it would not materially affect the strength of our enemies.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Richmond, July 13,1861.
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston:
My Dear General : I have just received yours of yesterday, and am surprised at the extreme inaccuracy of the young officer who reported to you that about 15,000 volunteers, extremely well armed and equipped, were assembled in North Carolina, but were not accepted because they offered to serve for but twelve months. The truth is, that about ten days ago it was reported to me that three regiments for twelve months and five for the war were ready for service; they were all ordered to proceed immediately ; one of the twelve-month’s regiments arrived about three days ago, with a special request that, as they were mountaineers, they should be sent to General Garnett; they were imperfectly equipped, but as soon as ready were sent forward. Another, for the war, came yesterday; it was fully equipped, and to-day has gone to your column. Another, imperfectly armed and equipped, two days since was reported as subject to my orders at Danville 5 it is on its way here by my order. I have written and telegrajihed to hasten the movement of the troops promised and the organization of others, and have asked if they could not be raised that arms would be sent to me for troops who would promptly respond. So much for the fiction of the 15,000 men. The same story with variations has been circulated here, and you will not be surprised if, weary and heart-sick from fruitless exertions to obtain the troops necessary to re-enforce our different columns, I have come to speak harshly of men who circulate stories so destitute of truth. From Mississippi I could get 20,000 men, who impatiently wait for notice that they can be armed. In Georgia numerous tenders are made to serve for any time at any place, and to these and other offers I am still constrained to answer, a I have not arms to supply you.?? I have seen the opportunity which the incapacity of the enemy offered to beat his columns in detail, but have neither had the men nor the transportation to avail of the occasion. From day to day have sought such arrangements as would secure the more steady and rapid advance of the troops and then to leave here to share the fortunes of the Army in the field, but have never seen the occasion when I might go away without leav-

ing everything behind me in such condition as would cause my absence to be injuriously felt.
I will not weary you with details of delay and mismanagement, but I could not permit you to suppose that I had allowed any rule to stand in the way of the one great object of giving to our columns capacity to take the offensive and prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces. I recollect Captain Pendleton well, and when we were all younger esteemed him highly as a soldier and a gentleman. I some days since directed that he should have rank as a colonel and be put in command of the batteries of your army. General Lee’s attention has been called to your remarks about intrenching tools and the muskets which had been promised. He will endeavor to supply your wants. I realize the difficulty to which you refer of a retreat, and feel that it would expose Virginia to temporary, if not permanent, disintegration; it is therefore only to be contemplated as a necessity, and the evil consequences only to be repaired by such a vigorous attack upon the enemy east of the mountains as would drive them across the Potomac, and, by threatening the capital, to compel the withdrawal of Patterson within the strong in-trenchments from Alexandria to Arlington Heights; the results would certainly be doubtful, and if it failed nothing would remain to prevent the enemy from occupying the valley and cutting off the communication between our army and Eichmond. I have therefore resorted to a call for the militia in all the counties north of James Eiver from the Alleghany to the Atlantic. If they come with promptitude and spirit and the sixteen regiments which I hope for from the cotton States should arrive in time, we may yet drive the invaders from Virginia and teach our insolent foe some lessons which will incline him to seek for a speedy peace. I need not assure you that my confidence and interest in you both as an officer and as a friend cause me to turn constantly to your position with deepest solicitude.
I recollect but imperfectly the country about Winchester, and have feared that the position had but little natural strength if the enemy can turn it. He will not hazard an attack upon your intrenchments if he has the little sagacity which would be necessary to show him the advantage of pressing to the rear to seize the Manassas Eailroad, and occupy the strong places in the mountains through which it passes.*

Headquarters,
Jamestown Island, Vu., July 13, 1861.
[General E. E. Lee :]
Sir: After a careful examination of the defenses here, I have directed the immediate erection of a redoubt for two guns at the eastern point of this island, so as to prevent a landing there and to defend the mouth of the creek, as well as to sweep the space between the redoubt, half way down the island, and that about to be erected at the point. In addition to this, the battery about to be erected will afford assistance to that on Spratley’s farm, so as to prevent a landing, if possible, on the beach on the mainland, between the mouth of the creek and King’s Mill. To furnish the work at the point with guns, I have directed the withdrawal of two of the four heavy guns now in the square redoubt in the middle of the island, leaving there two heavy guns, which will

do as well to prevent a landing in front of this middle redoubt as the four guns now mounted there. Captain Jones, of the Navy, and Captains Myers and Nichols, of the Engineers, concur with me in the opinion that this disposition of the guns and the erection of the work at the point are advisable. With this concurrence, I have ordered it to be done, to save time, there being but two 32-pounders (57 cwt.) sent to me, to be used either at Williamsburg or at Yorktown, in which I include Gloucester Point. I have but one of these with which to defend the landing at or near Spratley’s, and as a landing there would turn all the defensive works about Williamsburg, it is of the utmost importance that it should be prevented. I therefore propose the following distribution of guns, which do not seem to me to be of much use here, or whose places can be supplied by guns of inferior caliber, viz: 1st, one heavy gun, 8-inch columbiad (now mounted to defend the bridge and causeway lately made to the mainland), to be removed to the work at Spratley’s, and as the field of fire of this gun can be covered by a 6-pounder, to replace this with the latter. The work at Spratley’s will thus be furnished with two heavy guns. The two 32-pounders, mounted on the main work, look up the river, and could be much more strongly placed; one to defend the mouth of the creek, where Sprat-ley’s house is situated, just opposite the point of this island, and the other at a point below King’s Mill. If ships should pass all the batteries the fire of the two guns against them would be less important than if directed to prevent a passage) and it matters not whether this preventing a passage be at the work on Jamestown Island or at some lower point easily defensible, which, if carried, would enable the enemy to disregard and turn the defenses of the island. I therefore strongly recommend that these two guns also be turned over to Captain Rives, who is in charge of the defenses at and near Williamsburg, to use as I may direct. I do not know that Captain Jones, of the Navy, and Captain Myers, of the Army, the engineers in charge, entertain different views from mine on this subject. I do not think it proper, however, to withdraw any pieces from the island without referring the subject to the General-in-Chief, particularly as it will not probably cause more than twenty-four hours’ delay. I consider Jamestown Island as safer than any other place on the line of defense, even after the withdrawal of these guns.

It will be necessary to keep your preparations secret, and do nothing to attract the attention of the enemy to Gray’s Point. Troops will be required to cover the Point and to aid in the construction of the works. I have thought it probable that you could send down Major Ward, with two or more

companies from Tappahannock, and any companies collected in the adjoining counties may be used for the same end. Should you be able to spare a couple of field pieces, they would add very much to the protection of the battery, until its construction might be completed. They could then be withdrawn. Colonel Talcott will take Fredericksburg in his route, to concert with you the necessary measures. I hope you will give him all the facilities in your power.

General : Your letter of the 13th, in reference to the defenses on Jamestown Island, has been received. I hope the additional redoubt which you have directed to be constructed at the east end of the island and the division of the guns in the midway redoubt maybe advantageous. I do not consider it advisable, however, to diffuse your force over too large a space, and it was this consideration that induced the location of the midway redoubt on its present site. I have only to repeat, in relation to the landing at Spratley’s, King’s Mill, &c., that the construction of the battery at Day’s Point and the projected batteries at Mulberry Point, and the one opposite, will render them more secure, and diminish the danger of an attempt upon Williamsburg by that route. NTo means, however, must be neglected to prevent such an attempt or to secure the line of defenses across the Peninsula. We have not, however, guns sufficient to place at every vulnerable point on the Peninsula, and they must be posted only on the most important, and, if carried, the guns must be removed to other points of defense. Upon the completion of the defenses a more advantageous disposition of the guns may be made; but until that time I do not wish the guns for the defense of the channel to be removed from their present positions.
