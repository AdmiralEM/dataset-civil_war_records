Brigade Headquarters,
Camp near Monterey, Va., July 17, 1861.
J. N. Ramsey, Colonel, Commanding, <ftc.:
Sir : Your note of yesterday is at hand. I am surprised and pained to learn by it that you may not be on the road to this point. If so, you will at once change your line of march, and, with all practicable dispatch, join me here. You will send forward, with directions to move as rapidly as possible, the artillery and cavalry attached to your command; also the engineer officers, and Lieutenants Washington and Humphries, of the C. S. Army.
Respectfully,
H. R. JACKSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding, &c.
