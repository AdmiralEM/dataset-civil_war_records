I. By order of the Secretary of War, the original Military Department of Washington has been broken up, and the States of Pennsylvania and Delaware and that portion of Maryland east of Bladensburg, exclusive of the country twelve miles on each side of the railroad from Annapolis to the city of Washington, formed into a new military department, called the Department of Pennsylvania, under command of Major-General Robert Patterson, headquarters Philadelphia, Pa.

Assistant Adjutant* General.
Washington, April 30,1861. Brig. Gen. B. F. Butler, &e., cfee., &c.:
Sir : In a telegram from your staff officer, Major Hamilton, it is said that no more troops would be sent from Annapolis to Washington for the present. I have suggested that I wished the regiments sent here should be provided with equipments, particularly with camp equipage— tents, camp-kettles, mess-pans, &c. But we want at least eight additional regiments to give security to the capital, besides a surplus for the expedition against Baltimore. This surplus, with camp equipage, might be halted near the Junction, at the Laurel factory, with a guard at the Junction. There is, however, some hope that that expedition may not be needed to open hence the direct railroad communication, through Baltimore, with the North, as Maryland may do that voluntarily for us.
With high respect, yours, truly,

Col. J. Dimick, U. S. A.,
Headquarters, April 30,1861.
Commanding Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort, Va.:
Colonel : Your letter of the 28th instant* was received this morning, and Colonel Keyes7 notes of the 22d# are also before the General, who directs me to give you a statement of the measures known to have been taken to strengthen your command. Ex-Governor Boutwell, of Massachusetts, states that the steamer Cambridge will sail this day from Boston with about 350 volunteers, to complete one of the regiments now at Fort Monroe. The same vessel will take one month7s rations for 4,000 men, and camp equipage for the Massachusetts troops. It is known that you have already a large amount of army subsistence stores now on hand ; the General therefore desires that you continue the charter of the Cambridge, or make a new one, so as to send her here with such of the Massachusetts supplies and camp equipage as are not necessary at Fort Monroe, that the Massachusetts troops here may have the advantage of them.
Your several requisitions have been acted on as soon as received, and the supplies have been ordered, and in some cases increased. Fourteen 10-inch columbiad barbette carriages have been ordered to be sent forthwith from Watertown Arsenal5 and, if possible, twelve 8-inch co lumbiad barbette and twenty-eight 42-pounder barbette carriages will be sent from Washington Arsenal to-day. Captain Dyer reports that he will soon have ready several 8-inch iron gun-carriages, which of course are at your disposal. If powder and cartridges have not already been ordered from New York, they will be furnished as soon as possible. There is no ordnance officer who can be ordered to report to you.
The Secretary of War has been urged to procure from the Navy Department an armed steamer, to insure your supply of water and to guard the approaches from Hampton.
The Quartermaster-General ordered camp equipage, bed-sacks, spades, axes, &c., the 19th April, from Philadelphia.
The Engineer Department ordered from New York, by steamer, the 24th instant, all the supplies required by Colonel De Bussy, with additions, including a large number of sand bags. There should now be three Engineer officers, at Fort Monroe, who can certainly secure the magazine and other works against any such batteries as you apprehend may be erected.
The General-in-Chief directs me to say, in conclusion, that he believes all the supplies you have required are either now at Fort Monroe or will very soon be landed there 5 and he is satisfied that with the force—soon to be increased from Boston—and means at your command, Fort Monroe is by far the most secure post now in possession of the United States against any attack that can possibly be made upon it, independent of the war vessels, the Cumberland and the Niagara, at hand and approaching you.
I am, &c.,
E. D. TOWNSEND, A. A. G.
P. S.—The General says, beg the commander of the naval forces to do his best to prevent the erection of batteries within reach of Fort Monroe.
Respectfully,

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Executive Dep’t, Council Chamber, Boston, April 30, 1861.
Brigadier-General Butler :
General : The propeller Cambridge, Capt. S. H. Matthews, owned and fitted jointly by the State of Massachusetts and the underwriters of Boston, is loading as a transport for the purpose of taking out supplies for the Massachusetts troops (of which a memorandum will be hereto appended), provided at the expense of the State, and intended to be charged to the General Government, which charge will be allowed or not, as the General Government may decide.
You will note that in addition to the ordinary rations we have added a few articles which may be necessary lor the comfort of the troops, for officers’ use, or for hospital purposes. The largest item among these is preserved meats in tin, which ought to be carefully used as a reserve. They will keep for years, are already cooked, and being the most concentrated form of carrying food, may be useful for camp service. I learn this morning that Colonel Jones’ Sixth Massachusetts Kegiment is in great need of these at Washington and the vegetables now put on board. We have added a small quantity of pipes and tobacco. '
The ship will probably have fifty to eighty men to fill up Colonel Packard’s regiment at Fort Monroe, and a small quantity of supplies for our troops there. After landing there she is ordered to proceed to Annapolis, and there land her stores and the company sent to guard them, subject to your orders, and immediately to return here. She can bring any sick or discharged soldiers. Should any change of circumstances arise, Captain Matthews will be directed to use his discretion, and to give weight to any recommendation from you. It is possible that there may be a prospect of opening the Potomac route for transporting stores and troops. Upon hearing from you to that effect at Fort Monroe, Captain Matthews will either await further advice there or land his stores and men there, subject to your orders.
It is desirable to have him back early, as we have more troops getting ready, and wish, if possible, to send them by water. In about five days we shall probably dispatch a small iron propeller, well armed, with further stores, with the contributions that are pouring in for the men dtf* clothing and other things.
The Cambridge has two 8-inch guns forward on main deck and two light guns for her hurricane deck; has a full crew, including thirteen marines, with a good supply of small-arms, and can take care of herself against any pirates on her way back. She will have coal enough on board to get her back here. She ought to reach Fort Monroe some time Friday, if she gets off to-morrow ; the doubt being as to delay in getting her big guns from the navy-yard. She will be considered in the transport service until she reaches Boston on her return.
When sending Colonel Wardrop’s regiment by the propeller Spaulding we put on board an invoice of provisions, estimated sufficient for eight hundred men for thirty days, with orders to use as a reserve. If the United States supply the troops at the fort or your troops with rations, it will only be necessary to have these reserve stores taken care of. They have been carefully bought, and will be worth just about what they cost.
The Cambridge has a quantity of private baggage and contributions for the troops at Fort Monroe, and probably some of your troops, in charge of a special agent. From present appearances there will be much more. It is our present plan to keep two armed propellers (Cambridge, of eight hundred and sixty, and the Pembroke, of two hundred and sixty

[Chap. IX.
tons) running between here and the Chesapeake. It would be great economy if you could get the General Government to form a depot of coal at Fort Monroe for transports to buy there at cost.
Since ordering the above we hear that the Potomac is open and also that our troops at Washington are suffering for certain supplies. In view of the difficulty of getting stores across from Annapolis, we have decided, unless we get other information before she sails, to give the captain sealed orders to go directly up the Potomac after landing at Fort Monroe, with or without convoy of a war ship, unless she gets at Fort Monroe or on the way up other orders from General Scott, whom we inform of her movements.
Should you have reason to suppose that there is very great hazard in going up the Potomac, or have any information bearing on the subject that requires action, please call General Scott’s attention to the subject. You may also be able to send down to Fort Monroe by return transport any important information which would justify Captain Matthews to await at Fort Monroe or at the mouth of the Potomac further orders from General Scott.
Please note that we intend to clear her for Annapolis here, in order to avoid publishing through the telegraph that we are sending Massachusetts troops up the Potomac. The Pembroke, being of iron and more vulnerable than this ship, will be less suitable to go up the Potomac, where she might be exposed to a land battery.
The Cambridge ought to reach Fort Monroe between Friday at sundown and Saturday morning.
Yours, faithfully,
JOHN A. ANDBEW,
Governor.

Maj. Irvin McDowell, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Dispatch immediately two companies of Pennsylvania volunteers to the navy-yard, with instructions they be sent forthwith in a steamer to re-enforce Fort Washington. Let them take their to-day’s provisions in their haversacks.
J. K. F. MANSFIELD,
Colonel, Commanding.
Washington, May 1,1861.
Major-General Patterson, TT. S. A., Commanding, &c.:
Sir : I am glad to learn that Brigadier-General Butler has re-enforced Fort McHenry, and hope that Maj. W. W. Morris may be soon sent there to command.
We still need eight or nine additional regiments of volunteers to give to this capital a reasonable security against a threatened attack. All the troops which have arrived here have been and are, with the exception of the Seventh New York Begiment, without camp equipage, and several regiments without accouterments.
In those essentials, we are here, and everywhere else, most deficient, although I gave orders to the Quartermaster-General five weeks ago on the subject of camp equipage, and to the Ordnance Department at the same time on the subject of the accouterments, and each order has been often repeated since.

But even witli the same deficiencies, we must have here the additional regiments, some of which, it is supposed, may be spared from those already at Annapolis. To save time in writing, I put this letter (open) under cover to Brigadier-General Butler, to be read and forwarded.
The governor of Maryland writes that it is reported a new regiment from New York, called the Zouaves, threatens to force its way to Washington through Baltimore. This is not fully credited. That operation, if it become necessary, must be duly authorized and methodized in the manner I have heretofore indicated in my letters to you.
With high respect, yours, very respectfully,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Baltimore, May 1,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Yesterday sent our master of transportation to Washington to wait upon Mr. Scott and yourself about arranging for the reopening of business and intercourse between Baltimore and Washington. He conferred fully with Mr. Scott, who advised that he would represent our views and wishes to you, under which Mr. Smith considered it unnecessary to trouble you directly with the subject. We have not as yet received any response. For more than ten years past we have run four regular passenger trains daily each way between Baltimore and Washington, and at least one freight train. We now ask the privilege of running two passenger and mail trains and one freight train each way daily, subject to such supervision as you may deem desirable, and not to interfere with the movements of the Government trains. The interests and convenience of numerous parties in Washington and Baltimore, and we hope of the Government, can be greatly served if you can gratify these requests.
J. W. GARRETT,
'	President.
Philadelphia, Pa., May 1,1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the Army, Washington City:
Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from the General-in-Chief of two communications, dated April 28 and 29, relating to moving troops upon Baltimore via York and Havre de Grace.
Anticipating the wishes of the General-in-Chief, I have, since the withdrawal by the President of troops placed at Cockeysville, given attention to the demonstrations designed, and have posted unequipped regiments in camps of instruction at points from which they can be easily withdrawn and distributed on these lines of communication, viz: At York, 6 regiments; Chambersburg, 2 ; Lancaster, 6; Harrisburg, number unknown, but probably 65 and in this vicinity, 6.
The impoverished condition of the quartermaster’s department here in regard to tents, canteens, and other camp and garrison equipage and the depleted arsenals, will prevent the execution at an early day of any plan of operations. The troops are not fully armed, and are very incompletely equipped, having but few cartridge-boxes, no canteens, tents, or cooking utensils. Articles ordered for troops in advance will exhaust the supply for the next three days. I have directed these commands to be drilled and made efficient, and by the time they are equipped I hope

[Chap. IX.
to be able to move on Baltimore with an effective force of six thousand men via York and six thousand via Havre de Grace, and have sufficient to guard the road as they advance.
To effect this I request my requisitions may be filled as rapidly as forwarded, or the depot quartermaster here and the arsenal at Frank-ford be directed to fill them direct from me. 1 will keep you informed of my progress and my probable advance in time for concerted action. I shall lose no time, but for success take care not to be too fast.
I have authority to draw good volunteers from this State, but I desire, if regular artillery companies are en route to Washington City, to obtain one to serve as artillery with the column from York.
The railroad companies here, and also via York to Baltimore, are now ready to repair their roads, but the troops cannot advance. As soon as the men are equipped they will be thrown to the front, and in a few days the lines will be in working order. Col. Andrew Porter has gone to York to hasten the organization of that column.
Major Porter, governed by the prospect of being able to use for our purposes the bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Road, deferred arranging for their destruction, and sent parties to examine the bridges and a portion of the road. He is informed that the large bridges are each guarded by about two hundred men, and so carefully that they cannot be injured. The road, however, will, under his plans, be rendered impassable for our opponents as soon as desired, and he will act when convinced that the present hopes of submission in Maryland prove delusive.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Philadelphia, May 1,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron,
Secretary of War, Washington :
Dear Sir : You will have learned from others that General Patterson forbids the sale of passenger tickets by the military line. I have given Mr. Scott some reasons why I think he cannot work this line successfully for a passenger route. Mr. Felton tells me that he thinks he could now repair his road from Havre de Grace to Baltimore in four or five days if you would protect it as the work progresses. As this work has to be done, would it not be well to have it done at once ? General Patterson, T learn, thinks it would require one thousand men to protect it. In a few days I think a much less number would answer. He has the men, but needs arms and ammunition.
Looking at the large fleet of steamers at Annapolis and Havre de Grace, with the confusion at the former place, I believe it would save the Government a large—a very large—amount to transport directly by rail from here to Washington. I presume there would now be no difficulty with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. Mr. Scott could soon ascertain this. By the time the road is repaired I think there will be no difficulty about going through Baltimore, but if there is to be, I know of no reason why that question cannot be settled as well now as at any time—perhaps the sooner the better, and before an opposition can be organized or aid obtained elsewhere. Just now the North seems to be spoiling fora fight with Baltimore, and if there is to be one, I repeat the sooner it comes off the better, in my judgment. If you concur in

these views, instructions given to General Patterson to protect the road will set Mr. Felton at work with great energy. Would it not be well for me to secure all the powder Du Pont has for sale if to be had at fair prices ?
Yours, respectfully and truly,
JOHN. TUCKER.
Washington, May 2,1861.
J. W. Garrett, Baltimore, Md.:
In reply to your dispatch of yesterday I beg leave to say that this Department will consent to your proposal whenever the railroad lines running into Baltimore from the North and East are placed in such a condition as to admit free and uninterrupted travel over them, and when the U. S. Government can be assured that satisfactory arrangements have been made to enable it to transport through Baltimore, unmolested and without interruption, such troops, arms, ammunition, supplies, &c., as it may deem necessary or desire.
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
Fort McHenry, Md., May 2, 1861.
Col. L. Thomas,
Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that I have made an examination of the means of defense of this post to-day, and that. I consider them inadequate to a successful defense against a night attack or escalade. The top of the scarp wall is within easy reach of ladders of not more than ordinary length. There are no ditches or other obstacles to prevent the march of a hostile force up to the walls of the fort. There are not carriages enough to mount all the guns. There is not one round of grape, and only a few rounds of canister, at the post. More than half the command is composed of recruits who have not been drilled sufficiently to be relied upon in a night attack. I therefore respectfully request that at least two companies of regular soldiers (artillery) may be sent as early as practicable to re-enforce my command ; and I urgently request that a supply of ammunition may be furnished as soon as possible.
I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
W. W. MORRIS,
Major, Fourth Artillery, Commanding Post.
Washington, May 3,1861.
John Tucker:
Dear Sir: Your favor of May 1 from Philadelphia is received. General Patterson has been directed to remove military restrictions from the movements of passengers, and to give prompt facilities at Perry-ville and Annapolis for their transfer. Messrs. Felton and Scott now have on the line the steamers Ariel and Warner, both of which are comfortable, quick vessels. In my judgment the sooner the line via Annapolis is perfected the better, it will have a good effect in bringing our Maryland friends to terms.

[Chap. IX.
The administration cannot afford to temporize with Baltimore. They (the people of Baltimore and Maryland at large) mast agree to restore the property they have destroyed, and make reparation for damages, before we can open communication by their city. They must also agree that the Federal Government shall have the absolute right to move troops through their city, or quarter them in it or any part of the State of Maryland. Northern sentiment on this question is overwhelming and just in every respeet. In a very few days Baltimore will be at work reconstructing the works destroyed by authority under color of mob violence. In the mean time see Felton, perfect the line via Annapolis, which will be useful in the future, even after route through Baltimore is opened. The large fleet of vessels should be dispensed with as rapidly as our wants for transportation will admit.
The transshipping arrangements at both points should be well looked after, and be in charge of men that are practical and accustomed to the business. Give your attention to everything in regard to vessels. See General Patterson in regard to powder. It should be purchased.
Yours, respectfully,
SIMON CAMERON,
Secretary of War.
Headquarters, May 3,1861. Lieutenant-Colonel Scott, Aide-de-Camp:
Colonel : The General desires that the headquarters and five companies of the Third Infantry, now at Fort Hamilton, be sent to this city, as soon as they are equipped, by the route through Baltimore. They are to be filled up with recruits, and to bring their camp equipage with them 5 their arms, and the usual number of rounds of ammunition to be in serviceable order. The authorities of Baltimore, having proclaimed that the transit shall be open for troops to this place, have requested that the first body that comes through shall be headed by regulars. Please inform Major-General Patterson beforehand at Philadelphia when they will arrive there, and he will be instructed by the General in relation to forwarding them. The General wishes their movement to be hastened.
Yery respectfully, &c.,

Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott, Commanding the U. S. Army;
Sir : Agreeably to the deliberations of last evening I now submit to you the following on the defenses of this city:
1st. On the side of the navy-yard and bounded by the Anacostia Biver, I have simply to say that with ample troops in the city at command there can be no difficulty in crowning the heights on the opposite shore, and affording a complete defense from an enemy approaching from that quarter to attack the city or the navy-yard.
2d. That part of the city between the Anacostia River and the Potomac can readily be fortified at any time by a system of redoubts encircling the city. This is always in our power.
3d. We now come to the city and Georgetown and arsenal, exposed

to the Virginia shore. Here I must remark that the President’s House and Department buildings in its vicinity are but two and a half miles across the river from Arlington high ground, where a battery of bombs and heavy guns, if established, could destroy the city with comparatively a small force after destroying the bridges. The Capitol is only three and a half miles from the same height at Arlington, and at the Aqueduct the summits of the heights on the opposite shore are not over one mile from Georgetown.
With this view of the condition of our position, it is clear to my mind that the city is liable to be bombarded at the will of an enemy, unless we occupy the ground which he certainly would occupy if he had any such intention. I therefore recommend that the heights above mentioned be seized and secured by at least two strong redoubts, one commanding the Long Bridge and the other the Aqueduct, and that a body of men be there encamped to sustain the redoubts and give battle to the enemy if necessary. I have engineers maturing plans and recon-noitering further. It is quite probable that our troops assembled at Arlington would create much excitement in Virginia, yet, at the same time, if the enemy were to occupy the ground there a greater excitement would take place on our side, and it might be necessary to fight a battle to disadvantage.
I know not exactly how many troops we have at command. I presume the enemy might bring 10,000 troops into the field in a short time ou such an occasion. I would not urge any premature movement in this quarter, yet one taken too late might cause much bloodshed.
All which is respectfully submitted.
JOS. K. F. MANSFIELD,
Colonel, Commanding Department.
P. S.—I should have said in the body of this report that I have been in consultation with my chief engineer, Major Barnard, in all these views, and his services have been and are very valuable to me.
