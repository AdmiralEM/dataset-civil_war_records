No. 13.
Report of Col. Q. W. Andrews, Fifteenth Ohio Infantry, of operations
from July 13 to 15.
Headquarters Fifteenth Regiment O. Y. M.,
Oakland, Md., July 19, 1861.
In answer to your order, directing me to report to you the steps taken by me to intercept the rebels in their late flight from Laurel Hill, the force I had to march against them, &c., I have to say: On Saturday, 13th instant, at about 4 o’clock p. m., immediately after receiving your orders to move all my available forces up Cheat River from Rowles-burg, so as to take position near the bridge of the river, some four miles south of Rowlesburg, I moved what forces I could spare, making, with what I already had at that camp (Cheat River), about four hundred and fifty.
Before going to the bridge I sent for the late sheriff of Preston County, Yirginia, knowing him to be a loyal man, and very intelligent and useful in describing the geography of the country. I directed him to summon to his aid four other citizens in whom we could fully confide, and report them to me at Cheat River forthwith. He did all I required with great promptitude. After this preparation I marched to Cheat River Bridge, and arrived there about 8J o’clock p. m. same day. Mr. Shaffer sat down with me in my tent, and made a rough and hasty draught of the

country between Laurel Hill and Oakland and the Eed House, showing a main road running from a northward point from Laurel Hill to the N Northwestern turnpike, intersecting the same at the Eed House5 also showing many roads approaching the same5 also a road leading to Saint George northward to my camp, with various approaches. In the opinion of Mr. Shaffer, and those who were in attendance with him, awaiting orders to act as scouts, the rebels must pass along the first-mentioned road, leading to the Northwestern turnpike, so as to strike the turnpike at the Eed House. With the light I had before me I concurred in this opinion, and was about to take the available force of my command w ith the two companies of the First Virginia Eegiment, and immediately march to the road described as running from Laurel Hill to the Northwestern turnpike, so as to take position on the said road south westward from West Union about seven miles—about the same distance from the Eed House and some fifteen miles from my camp. But, reflecting on my instructions, I thought you had scarcely authorized me so to do. 1 abandoned the contemplated march, and concluded to send out mounted scouts, well armed, in the direction last mentioned, as well as in and around Saint George. Accordingly, at about 10 o’clock p. m., I dispatched four scouts, well armed and mounted, with directions to reach the Laurel Hill and Northwestern turnpike road as soon as possible westward from West Union, and to reconnoiter then the approaches thereto. This duty would take them over a very rough road (most of the way) some sixteen or eighteen miles. I directed them to first report to Colonel Irvine’s command, then at West Union, if they should make important discoveries nearer to him than to me, then hasten on to me. I also sent a scout in disguise to take observations about Saint George and the road leading from that point to my camp; also many scouts not mounted in various directions.
The first-named mounted scouts reached the road they desired at about 1 o’clock a. m. Sunday morning, and soon discovered the enemy in large numbers, and to get out of his reach they were obliged to secrete themselves for a short time. This was southwestward from West Union about seven or eight miles, of course much nearer Colonel Irvine’s than to my own command, and so, in obedience to my orders, he was notified before the messengers came to me. This notice, lam informed, was given between 3 and 4 o’clock a. m. same day. The horses of these scouts gave out, by which means I did not receive the report until 10 o’clock a. m. Little before 11 o’clock a. m. I started with all the force I could spare, with one day’s cooked rations, together with parts of the two Virginia companies, making altogether about 450, and arrived at the Eed House, passing through West Union, at 3£ o’clock p. m., a distance of eighteen or nineteen miles. When I arrived I found Colonel Irvine’s force, part of Colonel Depuy’s (Eighth Ohio), and a few of the Twentieth Ohio, under your own personal command, with two pieces of ordnance, that had been in hot pursuit several hours before me. Not gaining on the enemy, and our forces being considerably out of strength, and without any provision, and it plainly appearing that further immediate pursuit would be futile, under your order all our forces turned back and encamped at Eed House. Leaving my force, I returned to Cheat Eiver to order provisions and transportation forward.
On the next day (Monday) I received from you an order to join a forward movement from the Eed House, with all the forces of my command I could spare from the duties already assigned me.
At about 8 o’clock p. m. on Monday, 15th instant, I joined the column

under your command with about same force I took to the Eed House (450), and moved eastwardly on the Northwestern turnpike in imrsuit of the enemy. I left with two days7 rations, and ordered more to be sent. I had no transportation facilities, and could take little baggage of any kind. With some difficulty my quartermaster impressed two teams, which served to transport a few cooking utensils and the scanty provisions I took along. We pursued the enemy under your personal command little over two days, and seemed to gradually near him, when on Wednesday, the 17th, the column was turned back. The whole command marched back to this point in two days, somewhat fatigued, but in the best of order, and in very good spirits. * My own I know to be particularly so.
All of which is respectfully submitted.
