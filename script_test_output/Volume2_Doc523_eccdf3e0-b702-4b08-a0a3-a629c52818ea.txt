Headquarters First Infantry,
Camp Johnston, Van May 31, 1861.
Brigadier-General Johnston:
Sir : I have the honor to report the following information, just obtained :
The Federal troops concentrated at Chambersburg number thirteen thousand. The advance guard, of three thousand, left there at lp.m. for Hagerstown, where they will encamp to-night, from which force vedettes are to be thrown into Williamsport. Two companies are said to have been sent towards the river above (point not known), supposed to be at a ford. From the accompanying map you will see our position. The ford northwest of camp is susceptible of good defense. The one opposite Williamsport can be protected without difficulty by the enemy, if they have artillery.
The communication in pencil is from a perfectly reliable source. I would wish positive instructions, and, if to make a stand, re-enforcements. My line of defense is too extended for my present force. Owing to disaffection in Captain Whiteâ€™s cavalry, they are not as efficient as they should be, and incompetent to guard the river.
Your most obedient servant,
J. W. ALLEN, Colonel, First Infantry.
