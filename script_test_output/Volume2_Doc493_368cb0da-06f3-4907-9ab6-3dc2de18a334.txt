No. 1.
)	Huttonsville, Fa., July 15, 1861.
The commanding general has experienced much embarrassment during the progress of this campaign from the want of early information regarding the movements of distant detachments within his command.
The success of the operations of the main column are in a great degree intimately connected with and dependent upon the subordinate auxiliary detachments, and unless the commanding general is kept constantly advised of the exact condition of those commands the service must suffer.
In view of this it is directed that all commanders of detachments and posts in Western Virginia make daily reports to these headquarters, showing the true state of their commands, all movements of the enemy, and such other information as it may be important for the commanding general to know.
These daily reports will be forwarded by the most expeditious methods of communication.
By order of Major-General McClellan :
S. WILLIAMS,
Assistant Adjutant-General.
Headquarters near Beverly, July 16, 1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Assistant Adjutant-General:
In view of the large call of the President for troops, and of the probable demands for operations in my department, I would respectfully urge upon the General-in-Chief the propriety of accepting for three years’ service the Ninth Regiment of Ohio State troops now in this department, instead of forming four regiments from among them, as is now contemplated by existing orders. Much valuable time and a great deal of annoyance and ill-feeling would be saved by this course, by which also I think the mass of the men may be retained for the three-years’ service. I also ask the authority to send recruiting parties to fill these regiments to the maximum standard. I am emboldened to make this request by the necessities of the service. I also ask authority to muster into the three-years’ service Burdsal’s company of Ohio Cavalry, now serving with me under the State organization. An early reply by telegraph is requested.
geo. b. McClellan,
Major-General, Commanding.
[Indorsement.]
The Secretary says take the cavalry company. As for the other proposition, please talk with Secretary and send over word to General Scott as early as convenient.

General McDowell :
In case of emergency, a reserve is held ready for you in Washington.

Beverly, July 17 [186TJ.
Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott:
Will a movement of mine on Staunton facilitate your plans f If so, I can probably take that position. I do not know your plans of operation, but can move on Staunton if you desire.
Please reply at once.
GEO. B. McCLELLAN, Major-General, Commanding.
Headquarters of the Army, July 18, 1861. General McClellan, Beverly, Va.:
Your suggestions in respect to Staunton would be admirable, like your other conceptions and acts, with support. McDowell yesterday drove the enemy beyond Fairfax Court-House. He will attack the intrenched camp at the Manassas Junction to-day. Beaten there, the enemy may retreat both upon Richmond and the Shenandoah Yalley, where Patterson is doing nothing. He will lose eighteen regiments by discharges in about a week. I may re-enforce him in that time sufficiently to enable you, with him, to bag Johnston in that valley if the latter has not been permitted to send his principal force to Beauregard. If you come to Staunton, and McDowell’s victory at the Junction be complete, he may, with Patterson, give you a hand about Winchester. I will telegraph you again to-day.
WESTFIELD SCOTT.
War Department, July 18, 1861. Governor Curtin, Harrisburg, Pa.:
The Pennsylvania troops were expected to have joined the forces going into battle this week. I trust there will be no delay to prevent them sharing the honors of the expected battles this week. Hasten them forward.
