IY. Brigadier-General Holmes will hold himself in readiness to advance with three regiments and one field battery of his command to the support of Brigadier-General Beauregard upon notice to that effect from the latter general. He will take care to make arrangements for the security of the position which he now holds, and will replace the troops he withdraws therefrom by the militia of the county which has been called into service. He will keep in mind that the movement herein indicated is not to jeopardize the security of the military district under his command, to which, in case of necessity, he will return, and, in any event, after the service upon which he may be detailed shall have been accomplished.

General J. B. Floyd, Wytheville, Va. :
Information of the disaster to General Garnett’s command has been received, and McClellan is at Huttonsville. To oppose his seizure of the Yirginia Central Railroad, a junction of > our command and that of General Garnett, now probably at Monterey, is desired. You will advance with your brigade by railroad to Salem, thence to Jackson’s River, if your transportation will permit. If not, to Staunton.

Brig. Gen. EL A. Wise, Charleston, Kanawha County, Va. :
General : Information has been received of the disastrous retreat of Garnett’s command to Monterey and the advance of McClellan’s to Huttonsville. The aid of your force and that of General Floyd becomes important. If your command is not now essential in Kanawha, move up toward Covington. Communicate with General Floyd, who is ordered to proceed in that direction.

Headquarters, Winchester, July 18,1861.
General : I have had the honor to receive your telegram of yesterday.
General Patterson, who had been at Bunker Hill since Monday, seems to have moved yesterday to Charlestown, twenty-three miles to the east of Winchester.
Unless he prevents it, we shall move toward General Beauregard today. I am compelled to leave the sick and most of the baggage for want of means of transportation. There are wagons enough to carry but four days’ provisions, but the urgency of the case seems to me to justify a risk of hunger. I am delayed by provision for the care of the sick.
I leave General Carson here with two brigades of Virginia militia, with orders to fall back if the enemy should approach in force.

Col. S. S. Anderson,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Udqrs. Forces, Norfolk Harbor, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to report that I yesterday completed a personal examination of the country embraced within the limits of this brigade, the neighborhood of Suffolk excepted. Commencing eastward, I find the battery at Cedar Point unfinished. The guns, implements, and ammunition were hourly expected, but, in consequence of changes made in the plan for carriages, several of the platforms now finished must be taken up, and others more complex laid. This seems to me an unnecessary delay, when the guns may at any hour be needed. The battery at Barrel Point still needs at least one 9-inch shell gun, which will render it much more effective. The neck on which these batteries are located is very thickly wooded, and susceptible of defense by a comparatively small force.
I have placed one company of infantry (and a cavalry picket advanced) near the causeway connecting Ragged Island with the mainland. Another cavalry vedette patrols from Soddin’s Point eastward. The headquarters of this company (Captain Gillett’s) is near the post marked u Store.” Seven companies of Colonel Pender’s regiment, with headquarters, are, I think, well located at the cross-roads marked “Isle of Wight Church.” It affords support to Old Town battery, on Jones’ Creek, which was previously entirely isolated. All the roads towards

the shore from the church are good, and no distance exceeding six miles. A road opened by Colonel Pryor brings it within seven or seven and a half miles of his headquarters. The battery at Old Town (four short 32s) is in good condition, and served by two companies of Colonel Pender’s regiment, under the lieutenant-colonel. One long 32 or a shell gun would be valuable at this point. I have directed one of these companies to be relieved every fortnight, that all may be instructed in battalion drill. Colonel Pryor’s headquarters, with seven companies, is on Day’s Neck, one-half a mile or less from the Back Wharf battery. Of six 32s, weighing 6,000 pounds, live only were mounted on the occasion of my visit. The sixth carriage was, however, at hand. Lieutenant Poindexter, in charge of this battery, has gone to Norfolk for the complete equipment of this battery. It is served by companies of Colonel Pryor’s regiment near by. This battery commands the inner channel only. Burwell’s Bay may be reached by the outer channel. I have stationed a company of Colonel Pryor’s regiment at the Stone-house Wharf Landing, and have directed a breastwork to be thrown up, which will command the shore, accessible on either side of the wharf. I think it very desirable that one or two field pieces (two of the old iron ones in the old custom-house at Norfolk or the iron gun on navy carriage in the same yard, would answer) be sent to this point. Another company of Colonel Pryor’s regiment guards two landings near by, both of which are only available by narrow causeways. Two companies of cavalry guard and patrol the coast to Day’s Point. The roads in this neighborhood are very numerous, and all have strong, defensible posts. I consider it absolutely necessary that a stronger force be posted in this vicinity, and urgently request either that Daniel’s regiment be advanced or that another regiment be sent forward. I understand that Colonel Daniel’s regiment is to be held in reserve at Suffolk. It is of little or no use to me there, unless to fall back on, which I hope not to be compelled to do.
I request authority to establish a quartermaster and commissary depot at this point or near by. The troops here have not been supplied with fresh meat for six weeks. On the representation of the surgeon of Colonel Pryor’s regiment, I have to-day ordered mutton or other meat to be supplied.

Col. George Deas,
Assistant Adjutant-General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : Our present position in this village, the only one in the vicinage fit for a depot of supplies, is exposed and wholly untenable, unless the routes approaching it from the west be guarded at considerable distances 5 and I have been restless in the consciousness that, were the enemy apprised of our real condition, a comparatively small body of cavalry might make sad havoc among us and at least destroy what they might not be able to hold. The trains bringing supplies from Staunton are daily coming up, and as the wagons are needed below, must be unloaded. The debris of General Garnett’s command are constantly pouring in, and what of it is left in anything like organized form will be here on to-morrow or the day following in a most forlorn condition. I fear that, while they must be cared for, they will be almost useless for any military purpose; yet, even under these circumstances, I have not felt authorized to beat a further retreat, thus substituting distances for regiments against the enemy’s advance.
With a view mainly to guarding this point, hoping at the same time to relieve somewhat the panic-stricken people of the country and to revive the spirit of troops depressed by retreat, I am to-day making a forward movement, looking of course to the protection of our rear. The Twelfth Georgia Begiment, under the direction of Major Williams, of the Engineer Corps, who has joined this command, with an artillery company three pieces strong, which I have organized from the elements at hand, will take position to day somewhere upon, or immediately beyond, the Alleghany Bidge. I have also formed a composite command of the Churchville Cavalry, the remnants of the Bockbridge Cavalry, and a company of riflemen, made up from the militia, to which I have assigned Major Jones, of the Forty-fourth Yirginia Begiment of Volunteers, an officer who has inspired me with great confidence. They will constitute an advance guard and will be thrown along the turnpike

road as near to tlie enemy as may be safe, to watch his movements, to intercept marauding parties, and the riflemen, who are familiar with the country, to annoy the enemy from the hills and bushes. This rifle corps, some eighty strong, are the picked men of one hundred and eighty militia who reported for duty; but who, on account of the state of their crops, were exceedingly reluctant to leave home. I offered, upon condition that they would make up this company well armed and provided for, to allow the others to go home for the purpose of reaping the crops of all. This proposition was cheerfully acceded to, and I am really in hopes that an efficient corps has been thus put in the field.
Should this force be deemed sufficient to hold for the present the turnpike pass in the Alleghany Mountains, our entire attention may be directed to the Huttonsville and Huntersville road.
Unless some point can be held upon it with a view to resisting the advance of the enemy, the entire country in that direction will be thrown open and our rear protected alone by the distance over which his column must pass. The people in that region, who are supposed generally to be loyal, are naturally alarmed and calling for protection. I inclose herewith the copy of a note received late last night from a gentleman of high character and great influence, as I understand, relating to that subject.
It is hardly necessary to add that, with but two regiments which have not been seriously demoralized by the disasters of the late conflicts with the enemy, the force here is altogether too weak for the necessities of the time.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. E. JACKSON, Brigadier- General, Commanding.
P. S.—If it be proposed to defend the pass into Pocahontas over the Elk Mountain, it would be most practicable to send troops to the Mill-borough Station on the railroad, as the distance over which wagon transportation must be made would be much less.

General: You are assigned to the command of the Northwestern Army, and it is important that you join it without delay. Brig. Gen. H. R. Jackson, now in command of the forces, was at Monterey when last heard from, and he will give you all the information relative to previous operations, the state of the troops, country, &c. You will perceive the necessity of preventing the advance of the enemy, and the importance of restraining him the other side of the Alleghany Ridge. For this purpose you will occupy such passes as in your judgment will effect the object, and your attention is particularly called to the defense of the road leading from Huttonsville (where the enemy is said to be now stationed), through Mailing’s Bottom to Huntersville, and the Warm Springs to Millborough, on the Virginia Central Railroad. In addition to the force you will find at Monterey and on the march from Staunton, Brigadier-General Floyd has been directed to move with his brigade upon Covington. Brigadier-General Wise, operating in the valley of the Kanawha, has been directed to move up towards the same point, and Col. Angus W. McDonald, on the South Branch of the Potomac, to Staunton. A union of all the forces in the West can thus be effected for a decisive blow, and, when in your judgment proper, it will be made. Such supplies as you cannot procure in your vicinity will be forwarded from Staunton and this place.

Manassas, July 21,1861. General S. Cooper, Adjutant-General, Richmond:
Night has closed upon a hard-fought field. Our forces have won a glorious victory. The enemy was routed and fled precipitately, abandoning a very large amount of arms, munitions, knapsacks, and baggage. The ground was strewn for miles with those killed, and the farm-houses and the ground around were filled with his wounded. The pursuit was continued along several routes towards Leesburg and Centreville, until darkness covered the fugitives. We have captured several field batteries and regimental standards, and one U. S. flag. Many prisoners have been taken. Too high praise cannot be bestowed, whether for the skill of the principal officers or for the gallantry of all the troops. The battle was mainly fought on our left, several miles from our field works. Our force engaged them not exceeding fifteen thousand 5 that of the enemy estimated at thirty-five thousand.

The selection of those passes is, of course, left to your judgment; but, should General McClellan not have advanced beyond the Tygart’s River Valley, the occupation of the Cheat Mountain, on the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike, and the Middle Mountain, on the Huttonsville and Huntersville Turnpike, will hold those roads, from such information as I am able to get, against a large force. The route to Middle Mountain, I am told, is best by Millborough Depot, Pocahontas Court-House, &c., and you are authorized to call upon Pocahontas and Greenbrier Counties for volunteers to hold Middle Mountain, or other passes, and to aid you in driving back the invaders.

His Excellency the Governor,
Through Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir: I have the honor to state that I have called into service, by proclamation (nearly a month previous to the governor’s proclamation), the militia of James City, York, Warwick, and Elizabeth City Counties, these four counties embracing the One-hundred-and-fifteenth and Sixty-eighth Regiments. This proclamation was prompted by the exigencies of the service, and in consequence of the fact that I thought it but just that the people of these counties should assist in the defense of their property and houses, and not leave such defense entirely to the few who had volunteered and those who had come forward from a great distance. This was the only means in my power to reach those who evidently intended neither to suffer in person or property during the war, unless forced to do their part. I have in every case stationed these men in the immediate vicinity of their homes, and only required them to meet three times a week, to organize, drill, and be ready in case of an emergency, and in order, also, to ascertain what arms they had, and to know how far they could be relied on in an emergency. In view of these facts, I would request his excellency the governor to officially approve of my act. I shall retain these men in service until otherwise directed, as they are of great use.
I am, sir, very resnectfully, your obedient servant,

Sir : Unless a considerable force be at once put upon the road from Millborough, through Huntersville, towards Huttonsville, the enemy will overrun Pocahontas and get possession of the Central Railroad. There is good reason for believing that he is now upon Middle Mountain, twenty-five miles only beyond Huntersville, and we have but one regiment (Colonel Lee’s) on the road to meet him. I shall do what I possibly can to support Colonel Lee from this point; but Monterey is equidistant with Millborough from Huntersville. It is unfortunate that one of the regiments, with the artillery, now in motion from Staunton, had not been sent, in accordance with my suggestion, up to Millborough. I have dispatched Captain Cole, C. S. Army, to Huntersville, for the purpose of collecting and reporting reliable information, and of providing for transporting and provisioning the forces which may be sent in that direction, although the prospect of obtaining provisions or transportation there is very limited.

maintaining our position in Northwestern Virginia, by learning this afternoon that attention has been effectively directed to the line from Huttonsville to the Central Railroad at Millborough. In justice to myself I inclose herewith copies of correspondence,* to show that from the first my eye has been fixed upon this necessity, and to refer to the fact that, when I was here with but two regiments, upon which any reliance whatsoever could be placed, and before I was joined even by the shattered wrecks of General Garnett’s command, I dispatched one of those regiments to operate alone upon that line.
The copy of my order to Capt. Robert G. Cole will show that I have already dispatched him, with as plenary power as I could give, to make arrangements at Huntersville for the transportation and provisioning of the troops which may be put in motion from Millborough.
While the information contained in the letter of Mr. Skeen, as to the occupancy of Middle Mountain by the enemy, may be premature, it cannot be questioned, I think, that such is now the destination of the main body of his forces; whether with an eye to the Central Railroad, or to taking General Wise in the rear, remains still to be seen.
A very intelligent officer, Captain Hall, one of our recently released prisoners, while in the enemy’s camp, had intimate intercourse with General Rosecrans, who told him that by means of telegraphic and railroad facilities General McClellan could at any time concentrate troops, even to the amount of fifty thousand, in Northwestern Virginia. Rosecrans also said that they were on the lookout for Wise.
The Fourteenth Indiana Regiment, with one thousand and ten men, occupy the top of Cheat Mountain, with two regiments at its western base. The enemy have in all five hundred cavalry, armed with sabers, carbines, and navy revolvers, and twenty-six pieces of artillery, comprising a battery from the old Regular Army. All of his troops are admirably armed and equipped. The time of service of the Eighth and Tenth Indiana Regiments expires this month, and they are all going home, saying that they have had enough of it, and apparently shocked by the carnage on Rich Mountain.
I regret to say that the condition of the command of the late General Garnett is improving but slowly, if at all, the weather being far from propitious. I am greatly embarrassed by the sick and discontented. In fact, I must say that I scarcely know what disposition to make of them. From this remark, however, the regiments of Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson and Fulkerson (Thirty-seventh Virginia Volunteers) are to be excepted, and, while they are undoubtedly suffering to a very great extent, those able officers keep them up to their duty, maintaining their organization intact, and I am troubled with but few complaints from the men.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

tonsville, turnpike. Send in tlie same direction all other available forces, with full supplies of ammunition. If the enemy should intend to attempt to take possession of the railroad, he will descend by that route, and, if all our energies be not at once thrown out, he will effect it.
I have sent Colonel Lee upon that line. He will be in Huntersville to-day, and must be supported, or all in that direction is lost. It is unfortunate that my idea of sending in that direction at least one of the regiments now on the road to this point had not been adopted. But it may not be too late, if any reliance whatever can be placed upon the people of the country and we can act with sufficient promptness.
I send Captain Cole to-day to Huntersville to look to the transportation and provisioning of the column which should move on that line ; but the prospect of obtaining an adequate supply is slight indeed.
Send a courier back to me at once, with a statement of what can be done and upon what I can rely in the premises; and you had best direct energetic attention to Millborough as a grand base of operations.

Sir : In response to your favor of this day, I would simply refer you to my previous correspondence in reference to the propriety of starting a column upon the Huntersville and Huttonsville turnpike from Millborough, Central Railroad as its base of supplies, and I had inferred from your favor of July 20 that you concurred with me in that opinion, and had already urged it by telegraph upon the President. Grieved to find that my suggestion had not been adopted, and that no regiment had been sent by the way of Millborough to support Colonel Lee, and confirmed in the correctness of my judgment by the recent reported movements of the enemy, I forwarded to you a telegraphic dispatch to-day, looking to the same end, addressed to headquarters, and desired that you should send all available forces at Staunton at once to Millborough. This would seem to make my response to your letter of this date unnecessary. But I am apprehensive that not to respond at once may possibly occasion some delay in a movement which appears to me to be all-important. I must beg, therefore, to insist that any troops designed for military operations in Northwestern Virginia shall be sent, until further notice, by the way of Millborough to their destination. In answer to your inquiry as to what disposition is to be made of the stragglers from the regiments which have suffered so greatly in the retreat from Laurel Hill, I must refer you for instruction to the Commander-in-Chief.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HENRY R. JACKSON, Brigadier-General, Commanding.

lery. With this force I desire you to repress marauding parties of the* enemy $ to sweep the country of negroes from Back Biver and near Newport News to Harrod’s and Young’s Mills, below which line no negroes, unless attached to the Army, shall be allowed to go. I wish also to destroy or capture all parties of the enemy which may venture far from their posts and works. If the negroes in the Back Biver region and on the James Biver can be surprised and captured at night or by day by small parties of troops who know the country, and they are willing to undertake it, let them do it, supported by cavalry, infantry, or both, stationed at proper distances.
The instructions as to the disposition, in Order No. 179, herewith,* you need not regard as rigorous, but only intimations of my views.
Should you divide your column, I desire that Colonel Gumming should command that on James Biver, accompanied by some of the best of the Old Dominion Dragoons and Curtis’ company of Warwick Beauregards, retaining for yourself Sinclair’s Company of York infantry. It is desirable that your movements should be as prompt and secret as possible, as in consequence of the two great victories we have achieved at Manassas and the information I have received from the naval officer stationed at Dene [Green] Point, I am under the impression that the number of troops has been considerably diminished at Fort Monroe, Hampton, and Newport News. Indeed, Captain Fitzgerald, of our Navy, who has just come over, informs me that no tents are to be seen at the latter post, and it is stated that it is abandoned. I can scarcely think this, but wish you to send skillful scouts to ascertain it, and other soldiers who know the country, or reliable negroes, to ascertain the state of things at Hampton, and be guided by the results, informing me if these reports be true by swift express. I do not give you detailed instructions, but request you to confer with Major Hood, Captain Phillips, and others who know the country perfectly.
Should you at any time occupy a position at Young’s Mills, remember, at all times, to keep a strong force at the head of the mill-dam, on your left flank, near M. Wall’s house, and concealed in the wood which skirts his farm. Also to keep vedettes on Young’s farm, on your right flank, or James Biver, to inform you of any attempt of the enemy to land there, which is not at all improbable. Kit Curtis’ lane is considered a safe position for troops on the York road, and I was informed by a negro of M. Wall’s that the road from Curtis’ to his master’s house was a straight one, and only about two miles from thence.
Should, upon this expedition (which I do not anticipate), or at any other time during your service in the lower part of the Peninsula, your troops stationed at Young’s Mills be attacked, and you have troops stationed in Curtis’ lane, a march by the latter through the road leading to M. Wall’s would enable you to fall upon his right flank and rear, and thus secure an easy and complete victory; or should you ever be attacked at Harrod’s Mills, and have troops stationed at Young’s Mills, a march from the latter to the former, by Mr. John Patrick’s, would enable you to accomplish the same results.
I state also, for your information, that Colonel Mallory has completed the works at Ship Point, on the Poquosin Biver; that Captain Smith, of the artillery, has probably already planted two guns in them. Mallory’s force consists of Smith’s company of artillery, and he informs me of two hundred and thirty militia.

Rightor’s) tlie post of honor, in order that they may have every opportunity to avenge the death of their late gallant commander.
Inform me constantly of your proceedings, and should you desire re-enforcements, General Hill has orders to send them. Should you find yourself at any time at Bethel, strengthen the fortifications by a free use of the spade and ax, clearing out the woods to the left and rear of that position, and particularly strengthening the work to the extreme right and point of the ravine, making traverses also near and parallel to the intrenched lines, to prevent the men from being taken in reverse. Also strengthen the works at Young’s and Harrod’s Mills, and at Young’s farm, if you have leisure. At Young’s Mills be careful of the road leading down to the ravine, nearly opposite the saw-mill, and station a gun on our side to command it. Before every fight, if you have time, pack your wagons and get them out of the way of the infantry and artillery.
I have heard that the enemy is in force in the woods and ravine just above Captain Smith’s house, on the James River. I heard since that it was not so. Direct the commanding officer who may have charge of the column on the Warwick road to examine it well before approaching it, and have every piece of woods carefully examined before passing over the roads leading through it.

At Huntersville, Va., July 22, 1861—1 p. m. General Jackson, Commanding at Monterey, Va. ;
Dear General : We have reached this place, but can make no calculation to proceed farther to-day, as the rain has been incessant from the time we struck our tents this morning. Our horses failed so much that it may be night before all our wagons arrive. In the mean time, such companies as have not their wagons up take shelter in the public houses of the town. Our forward movement must depend in a great measure on the ability of our horses to transport baggage. The men, too, suffer greatly from coughs and colds. Our sick embarrass us much, in the absence of ambulances, that might have been used for their help, until applied to their legitimate use.
Mr. Skeen, the intelligent and patriotic citizen to whom you referred me, has aided me very much; and, moreover, has promised to make me a correct map of our route and the adjoining country. He, with others, urge the policy of occupying what is called Middle Mountain, fifteen miles in advance of Elk Mountain. Without doing this, a large number of men, loyal to our cause, as well as much property, will be at the mercy of the enemy. Middle Mountain is a branch of the Cheat, and, as far as my information extends, is to be approached by only one road, the one that we may defend. The Bath Cavalry will scout, before tomorrow, as far as the farther base of Elk Mountain.
We shall probably soon feel the want of artillery, and respectfully urge you to send it on as soon as practicable ; also an engineer, as you proposed. Our depot is not yet determined on 5 as soon as it is, I shall have the honor of again communicating with you.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
STEPHEN LEE.
P. S.—I had written the above before the arrival of Major Byrd, who handed me your letter. Mr. Skeen expressed decidedly the opinion

that the enemy will advance by our route, other movements being mere artifices to conceal, if possible, their real course. I fear that I shall lose the services of the Bath Cavalry, as it seems to be almost in a mutinous state, on account of their dislike to their captain. Captain Gammon, however, of the Pocahontas Bescues, will fill his place, as far as infantry can. Our principal danger seems to be from Huttonsville, by a rough and circuitous route, impracticable to wagons, unless the enemy have recently worked upon it, along the Elk Biver, to our rear. Such, however, is the terror of the enemy at meeting our sharpshooters, that I think we can keep them from this approach. The militia of Bath and Pocahontas will need five hundred guns, and I wish they could be sent immediately. I shall employ such as have rifles immediately. Major Byrd, who rode forward last night, is satisfied that we may anticipate the enemy in the occupation of Middle Mountain. I respectfully suggest that the army be brought from McDowell, and be ready at Monterey when the wagons arrive, which will be preceded by Lieutenant Williams, of the Bath militia. You must determine as to ammunition.
With great respect, your obedient servant,
STEPHEN LEE.

General : I have received your two letters of the 20th,# reporting the state of military operations in the northwest. You have done all under the circumstances that was proper, and all will yet be well.
Our brave troops must bear up against misfortune. Beverses must happen, but they ought only to stimulate us to greater efforts. I regret my inability to repair to your assistance, but events occurring in our front prevented. I am sure the glorious victory there achieved will cheer the hearts of your troops.
At the first report of the retreat from Beverly, anticipating your wants, I ordered ammunition, tents, blankets, cooking utensils, and shoes to be sent to you. But, unfortunately, they were sent, by mistake, to General T. J. Jackson, at Winchester. A duplicate supply of the articles have been forwarded to Staunton. General Loring, an officer of experience, has been assigned to the command of the Army of the Northwest, and he is accompanied by officers who have served years on the frontier.
Four Virginia regiments, one Arkansas, three Tennessee, and two Georgia regiments, and two field batteries are ordered to join the Northwestern Army. This force, with what ought to be organized from the hardy mountaineers, will be sufficient to drive back the invaders. There is a necessity for repelling them, and it must be done. Every assistance will be afforded in this quarter.

This was the position of the army yesterday at 4 p. in., when Major Tyler left Monterey. I would suggest that our forces are now so much scattered that the three Tennessee regiments be sent to Monterey.

Headquarters, Monterey, Fa., July 23, 1861. Maj. M. G. Harman, Quartermaster, Staunton, Va.:
Dear Sir : Yours of yesterday has just been placed in my hands (about 7 a. m.), and it will consequently be impossible for me to get the courier back to you by 10 o’clock this morning.
I must still continue to press upon you the importance of sending troops, with supplies and ammunition, as rapidly as possible, by the way of Millborough, to the Huttonsville turnpike. As I have already written and telegraphed to yourself and to headquarters, this point is equidistant from Huntersville and the Millborough Station, and the road thither is a common country road and very rough. Until further notice do not send any more troops to this point.
I do not think that Captain Marye’s artillery will be in any danger whatsoever bet ween Millborough and Huntersville. Colonel Lee’s command will be on the road in advance of him, and between himself and the enemy. At Huntersville he will see Captain Cole, with whom he can confer as to any danger beyond that point. I cannot weaken Colonel Lee’s command, already quite too small for the end to be accomplished, in order to guard against the possibility of danger, and I have no cavalry with me fit to be sent to the Warm Springs who are not upon necessary and arduous duty.
Very respectfully, yours,
H. E. JACKSON.

General : I respectfully inclose herewith a note just received from Colonel Stuart. The President knows the person from whom the colonel received the information and the value of his statements. He came with a Mr. Magraw to ask permission to come within our lines to look for the body of a friend; taking this course, they said, because a rule established by their authorities forbids flags of truce in such cases. Colonel Stuart is directed to treat them as prisoners. Should they be permitted to go to the North from Eichmond, I suggest that the sea furnishes their best route.

General H. A. Wise,
Commanding, &c., Kanawha Valley, Va.:
General : Your letter of the 17th has just been received and communicated to the President.* He is much gratified at your success, and particularly at the handsome repulse given to the enemy at Scarey Creek and his subsequent ejection to the Pocotaligo. You will have learned of the disastrous retreat of General Garnett’s command, and the death of that gallant officer. It is reported that General McClellan occupies Cheat Mountain Pass, on the road to Monterey, and the Middle Mountain, on the road to Huntersville. Should he reach the latter point, the road is open to him to Lewisburg, to turn upon you or to seize at Mill-borough the Virginia Central Eailroad. An effort is making to prevent his advance, and troops are being forwarded to occupy Elk Mountain, north of Huntersville, and the Alleghany Ridge, on the routes from Hutton sville to Staunton. General W. W. Loring has been ordered to the command of the Army of the Northwest, and it is hoped he will be able to check the advance of the enemy. A concentration of all the forces in that region may be necessary for that purpose, and it becomes necessary that you should look to the security of your rear. Keep your command concentrated, and be prepared to unite with General Loring or operate as circumstances on your line of communication may dictate. You have been already written on this subject by the Adjutant and Inspector General of the Army. There is no objection to your increasing the strength of the Legion, but you will perceive that at this time re-enforcements cannot be sent to you from here, from the necessity of restricting the operations of the enemy, if possible, north of Pocahontas, and of strengthening the armies of the Potomac, which have won a glorious victory in front of Manassas. It was hoped that the good citizens of Kanawha Valley would by this time have rallied under your standard and given you the force you desired. The late proclamation of the governor, authorizing the mobilization of the militia of the State, a copy of which is inclosed, will, I trust, yet give you the troops you desire. Ammunition has been sent you. More will be forwarded. Arms cannot be forwarded except under an escort of troops and on requisitions. The inventory you refer to in your letter was not inclosed. The difficulties that surround you are fully appreciated, but great reliance is placed on your wisdom, energy, and valor. At this time there are no 12-pounder howitzers for issue. If any can be procured they will be forwarded, with a supply of ammunition.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

tion to encourage a landing. I have heard from Major Ramseur that his battery of six pieces will leave Raleigh to-morrow for Suffolk, where he will report to General Pemberton for duty with his brigade along James River, west of Nansemond. Four other field batteries, of four pieces each, are now nearly equipped. These have been got up by great exertions by General Pemberton, and the caissons and harness will soon be done. One battery is on the coast, west of Craney Island, and the other three still at a camp of instruction, on Tanner’s Creek; and, being fitted up, I can now use them, if necessary. 1 am moving the regiments down, to guard the beach on Eastern Peninsula and the passes on the roads beyond the intrenched camp; and what I want to say to you is, that now I will soon be ready, if we have been able to make any rifled cannon of large caliber, to place a battery, properly guarded, on the point nearest to Old Point—distance to wharf at Old Point just three miles. Their fire will be dangerous to shipping, and will make the landing of steamboats at the wharves there a troublesome operation. Guns might have been established there before, but other than rifled cannon would have had little or no effect, and only provoked an attack, for which we were not then prepared. Hereafter I shall be glad to receive one. Will you please let me know if a battery of, say, four rifled guns, heavy caliber, can be had ? I have heard Mr. Anderson was making some. I make this private, as I do not wish it spoken of. I impress on every one that I have a great contempt for firing at long range, and order no battery to fire until they are sure to hit; but, when I am all ready, I know good rifled guns can damage shipping (not batteries) at three miles, elevation from 16° to 20°) a columbiad would require 35°. Let me have your views.
Yours, truly,
BENJ. HUGER, Brigadier- General.
Hdqrs. Army of Northwestern Virginia,
Monterey, Va., July 24, 1861. Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : The Arkansas regiment, Colonel Rust commanding, reached this point the day before yesterday, and was sent forward yesterday, upon this road, to the support of Colonel Johnson’s command, seven miles in the rear of which they are now stationed. The absolute want of water rendered it impossible that these commands could be brought nearer together, and we are destined to encounter the same difficulty along the entire road from Monterey to the Alleghany. While this may seem to be a cause of serious weakness, giving the enemy an opportunity of taking our forces in detail, yet, on the other hand, the character of the road is such as to render it utterly impossible for any body of men larger than a regiment to operate effectively at the same time. I have no doubt, therefore, that the intervening mountains can be defended by our force, small as it is, against any regular approach of the enemy. My great cause of uneasiness is, that a part of them may possibly be turned and cut off. This is to be guarded against, of course, by vigilance and by scouting; and I am sorry to say that the troops upon which we must rely for the discharge of that duty are sadly inefficient. They are all, both cavalry and infantry, volunteers and militia from this region of Virginia, and, from the perpetual applications made to me for the furlough, not simply of officers and privates, but of compa-

nies and entire commands, I feel assured that nearly the whole would retire from the field if they were permitted to do so.
At Monterey we now have left the commands of Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson, Colonel Fulkerson, Colonel Scott, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hansborough, Captain Jackson’s three companies of cavalry, and Captain Shumaker’s and Captain Eice’s artillery, with three guns between them, the aggregate strength being some eighteen hundred men. It is to be hoped that this will be daily increased by the restoration to health of the sick and the return to duty of the absent. Without tents or camp equipage, and with but the clothing upon their backs, the horses of the artillery and cavalry jaded and galled, this force is far from efficient.
Twelve miles in the rear of us are stationed what is left of the First Georgia Regiment, Twenty-third Virginia (Colonel Taliaferro’s), and Colonel Pegram’s regiment. As they become fit for duty, or, in case of urgent necessity, they will be ordered again to advance. I am sorry to say th°jt the Georgia regiment seems to have been almost wholly disorganized, and that what I said in praise of their conduct upon the retreat of General Garnett was not warranted by the facts.
Despite the weakness of our column upon this line, as compared with the strength of the enemy, I have not hesitated to order Colonel Gil-ham, with two regiments and a battalion of four companies (who arrived on yesterday), to proceed at once to Huntersville, to the support of Colonel Lee, upon the Huttonsville turnpike. You will perceive, from the letter of that most efficient officer of the 22d instant, that he had arrived at Huntersville, took up his line of march yesterday, and, it is to be hoped, may be to day in the vicinity of Middle Mountain. I must confess that I feel no little anxiety about him, and would have been happy, indeed, if Colonel Gilham’s command had joined him at Huntersville, which might have been accomplished had they started, in accordance with my suggestion, from the Millborough Station, on the Central Railroad. Being assured that Colonel Gilham’s commission was older than that of Colonel Lee, I have assigned him to the command of all the forces upon that line.
Constant applications are made to me to furnish horses to such of the cavalry as have lost theirs in the field. I will be grateful to know what course I am to pursue in reference to them.
I trust that I shall be excused for writing so frequently and so much ; but I have felt it to be due to all concerned that a full picture of our actual situation and condition should be regularly presented to the commanding general.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HENRY R. JACKSON, Brigadier General, Commanding.

Monterey, Va., July 25,1861.
Col. George Deas,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report that, upon reaching here, I found the command very much scattered, and I am now endeavoring to concentrate it at points of strength near the Alleghany and on the turnpike from Millborough to Huntersville. Before my arrival General Jackson had forwarded two regiments of infantry in the direction of Elk Mountain. We have no positive information of their reaching it, but we have heard indirectly that Colonel Lee had succeeded in getting to Middle Mountain, and was in position. I shaii push forward re-enforcements to him, and thus secure the turnpike and Central Bailroad in that direction. I shall also re-enforce Colonel Johnson, who is in position on the Alleghany Mountains, which is not thought to be a very strong one.
No information has been received from Generals Wise or Eloyd, except a rumor that the former had been victorious in a fight with the enemy, and that McClellan had sent Colonel McCook, with one regiment of infantry and a battery of artillery, to meet General Wise. Should Generals Wise and Floyd be delayed, it will be very necessary to send additional forces to this point and Huntersville, in order to secure beyond doubt the pass of the Alleghany and the turnpike leading to the Central Boad. This is rendered more necessary in consequence of the utter demoralization of Colonel Bamsey’s regiment of Georgia volunteers. Two other regiments are somewhat in the same condition. Upon my arrival at Staunton, day before yesterday, I there found a large number of officers and several hundred men belonging to Colonel Bamsey’s and to other regiments, with leaves of absence to visit Georgia and other places. I immediately countermanded all of the furloughs, and ordered a competent officer stationed there to take charge of them, and to permit neither officer nor man to leave without authority from me. En route from Staunton I passed large numbers on the road, and was told that the farm houses on the road were filled with them. This is in consequence of Colonel Bamsey—stationed by General Jackson some ten miles below this point—having given his entire regiment leaves of absence. I have directed that every effort be made to concentrate them, but it may now be impossible to do so. I have ordered the arrest of Colonel Bamsey. At the latest dates neither the Tennessee nor Georgia regiments of infantry, nor the Georgia battery of artillery, which were assigned to this army, had reached Staunton.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,
