Hdqrs. Confederate Army in Northwestern Virginia,
July 16, 1861.
Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, Comdg. 77. 8. Forces:
Sir : Your letter of tlie 15th instant, with its anomalous address, has been received. In response, I have simply to say that I am as yet wholly unapprised that a different policy in regard to the arrests of suspected persons, or the protection of private property from the line you have so naturally proposed for yourself, has been pursued by the chief of the division of the Confederate Army. Hence your suggestion as to the propriety of abandoning any other would seem to be uncalled-for. Begging to remind you that any information you may receive as to the absence of sufficient grounds for the arrest and^ detention of the persons you name (or any others) may, to say the least of it, be quite as unreliable as the evidence upon which such persons are held, I will conclude by saying to you that justice will be duly regarded by me in the treatment of all persons whatsoever.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
H. R. JACKSON, Brigadier-General, G. 8. Army.
