in.which nobody was hurt on our side. The enemy fired with great accuracy, several balls passing through the embrasures of the fort, one striking a 32-pounder within the battery, and one shell bursting in the fort. From three to five shots from our battery took effect, we think,* others struck around the steamer. The troops acted with great bravery, and I had to restrain them in their enthusiasm. The flag of Georgia was hoisted over the fort in the absence of the Confederate flag. Our firing was less frequent than that of the enemy, as our ammunition was scarce; Only two rounds left after the engagement. Your aides, Maj. William E. Taylor, R. R. Collier, and Col. Thomas Newton, were present and aided in the struggle.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
PEYTON H. COLQUITT.
Major-General Gwynn, Commanding forces, Norfolk Harbor.
P. S.—Two members of the City Light Guards (Georgia) dug awa y the sand in front of one of the port-holes during the hottest of the fire.
