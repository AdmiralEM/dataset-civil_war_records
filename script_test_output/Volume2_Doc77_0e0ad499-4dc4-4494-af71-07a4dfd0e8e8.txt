No. 2.
Report of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris) Indiana Militia.
Headquarters IT. S. Volunteers,
Grafton) W. Ya., June 7, 1861.
General : I have the honor to report that I arrived at Grafton on the evening of the 1st day of June, and found that Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Regiment, had organized an expedition for that night against the enemy at Philippi. The available forces then at his command consisted of six companies of his own regiment and nine companies of the Ninth Indiana Volunteers, commanded by Colonel Milroy. After a full conference with Colonel Kelley as to the position of the enemy, his strength, and the character of the approaches to his position, I deemed it advisable to postpone the attack until the succeeding night.
Having satisfied myself during the evening that we were in the midst of spies, who readily obtained every information in regard to our movements, I endeavored to arrange the expedition so as to give a false impression, and thereby secure the advantage of a surprise of the enemy. With this view the following order was given to Colonel Kelley:
Headquarters U. S. Volunteers.
Grafton, W. Va., June 2, 1861.
Col. B. F. Kelley,
Commanding First Eegiment Virginia Volunteers:
Colonel : With six companies of your regiment, nine companies of Colonel Milroy’s Ninth Indiana, and six companies of Colonel Irvine’s Sixteenth Ohio, you will proceed this morning to a point about six miles eastward from this place on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and march by the shortest and most practicable route towards Philippi. You must regulate your march according to your own discretion, and your bivouac or rest at night in such manner that you are sure of coming before the town of Philippi as near 4 o’clock to-morrow morning as possible. Should you this evening receive certain information that the rebels have retreated eastward from Philippi you will make the resting time of your troops as short as possible, in order to follow them up with all the speed the strength of your troops will allow. In such case you will as early as possible inform Colonel Dumont on the other bank of the river, and direct his co-operation with you in the pursuit, which, if in your discretion you are in sufficient force, you will continue until they are beyond Beverly, and you will also apprise these headquarters, in order that supplies may be forwarded to you.
By command of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris:
JOHN A. STEIN,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
This column (the left of the attack) moved by railroad train on the 2d at 9 o’clock a. m. towards, and was generally understood to be an advance on, Harper’s Ferry.
After leaving the cars the distance to Philippi was about twenty-five miles, on a road but little traveled. The instructions required a rapid

march during the day and early part of the night to a point from which, after a sufficient rest, Philippi could be certainly reached at 4 o’clock next morning.
My information induced me to believe that two attacking columns, one on the left, the other on the right side of Philippi, would secure every exit which the enemy could use m retreat. I therefore organized the right column, under Colonel Dumont, in conformity with the following order:
Headquarters U. S. Volunteers,
Grafton, W. Fa., June 2, 1861.
Colonel Dumont,
Comdg. Seventh Regiment Indiana Volunteers, near Grafton, Va.:
Colonel : You will proceed by railroad this evening at 8.30 o’clock to Webster, with eight companies of your regiment. At Webster you will be joined by Colonel Steed-man, with five companies of his regiment and rwo field pieces, also by Colonel Crittenden, with six companies of his regiment. From Webster you will, with this command, march on Philippi, using your own discretion in the conduct of the march, keeping in view that you should arrive in front of the town at 4 o’clock precisely tomorrow morning.
Information is received that the rebels are in some force at Philippi.
The object of your column will be to divert attention until the attack is made by Colonel Kelley, and should resistance be offered you are to aid him to the extent of your ability. In the conduct of your column you must use your discretion, being governed by such circumstances as may occur. When joined by Colonel Kelley, the whole force will be under his command.
The companies of your regiment will take two full days’ rations. Should you receive instructions from Colonel Kelley that the rebels have retreated, you will join him at once, and act under his command.
By command' of Brig. Gen. T. A. Morris:
JOHN A. STEIN,
Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
This force, in leaving Grafton after dark, had reasonable assurance of reaching the enemy in advance of any information from their friends, and, as events proved, did so. The enemy was entirely off his guard, and was completely surprised, as the reports of those engaged in the attack attest.
The failure to capture the entire rebel force can only be attributed to the storm during the night. This unforeseen misfortune served to call forth an endurance seldom exhibited, and I feel that the heroism of officers and men was as truly displayed in a march of fifteen miles in pitchy darkness, drenching rain, and over a mountainous country as in the irresistible attack and hot pursuit of the discomfited enemy. The last five miles of Colonel Dumont’s column was made in one hour and a quarter. Many men fainted, and were left on the road. Others threw away their haversacks and provisions to keep up, rushing forward with a determination that showed what spirit animated the command. I regard it as remarkable that under such circumstances the two columns were but fifteen minutes apart at the time assigned for their meeting. An able reconnaissance in advance of Colonel Dumont’s column was made by Col. F. W. Lander, whose voluntary aid I gladly accepted, and to whose advice and assistance I am greatly indebted. The immediate direction of the artillery was confided to him. After the bridge was taken he pressed forward and joined Colonel Kelley, rode into the enemy’s ranks, and captured the prisoner reported to have shot Colonel Kelley. He had great difficulty in restraining the Virginia Volunteers from summarily dispatching the man, who is a noted secessionist and a quartermaster of the rebel forces.
From the reports of Colonel Dumont (who, by the fall of Colonel Kelley, had command) you will perceive there is much difficulty in an accurate statement of the enemy’s losses. His killed is estimated from

fifteen to forty, which were carried off, supposed by friends, during the confusion incident to the pursuit of the enemy. A large amount of camp equipage, provisions, arms, wagons, horses, and medical stores were captured, an inventory of which will be made as soon as possible.
Whilst I am happy to state that we have none killed, I am extremely sorry to report that the gallant Colonel Kelley, of the First Virginia Kegiment, whilst leading the attack of his column, fell severely wounded by a pistol-shot in the right breast. The wound, supposed at first to be mortal, I am glad to know will only deprive us of his valuable counsels and assistance for a few weeks. Although he still suffers, his ultimate recovery may be now regarded as certain. Much of the success of our attack is due to him. His thorough knowledge of the country, his skill in rendering that knowledge available, his cool and unflinching courage, will deprive us for the time of a great support in our enterprise. [Sic.]
To Colonel Dumont, who led the column on the right, too much praise can scarcely be given. For his energy, tact, and cool daring we are greatly indebted.
I feel it would be a trespass upon your patience to enumerate all who deserve especial praise, and would refer you to the report herewith forwarded for minute information, both as respects individuals and the various commanders engaged. I cannot, however, conclude without expressing my obligations to Capt. H. W. Benham, IJ. S. Engineers, for the valuable aid he has afforded me. Indeed, his great knowledge and experience are invaluable to me at ail times, and particularly on this occasion.
Immediately after the action, knowing the exhausted condition of the officers and men, I dispatched Captain Benham to the scene of action, gave him full command, and have the satisfaction to state that he restored order, and placed all in position to repel an attack with a promptness that exhibited his consummate ability and unbounded energy.
Justice obliges me, iu conclusion, to say, that of my staff, brigade inspector, Major Love; my aide-de-camp, Captain Hascall, and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General John A. Stein deserve all the encomiums that a deep sense of my dependene upon them obliges me to express. They are all thorough in their knowledge and untiring in their duties, and I feel sure that their services in my command will be duly appreciated by you, and be remembered gratefully by all.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Messrs. Spalding and Cook have just reached here, leaving Philippi on Monday morning. The Federal troops surprised Colonel Porterfield’s command, opening fire upon the town with artillery, and drove us out, with a reported loss of about six killed and a considerable quantity of arms, baggage, and provisions. Much heavier loss to the enemy in men. McClellan led the Federal forces. Our forces retreated to Beverly.

ACTION AT PHILIPPI, W. YA.
The expedition under Colonel Heck leaves here on Friday for the Northwest. We urge you will send by express train two thousand men, with arms and ammunition, to drive the vandals out, or else give up our border. These gentlemen were in the engagement; say Colonel Porterfield had but little ammunition of any kind. Send an officer of experience to command our forces, or a battery and five thousand arms, if possible.
