It is with the deepest mortification the general commanding finds it necessary to reiterate his orders for the preservation of the property of the iuhabitants of the district occupied by the troops under his command.

engaged in these acts. This is of bnt little moment$ since the individuals are not found out, we are all alike disgraced.
Commanders of regiments will select a commissioned officer as regimental provost-marshal, and ten men as a permanent police force under him, whose special and sole duty it shall be to preserve the property from depredation, and arrest all wrong doers, of whatever regiment or corps they may be. Any one found committing the slightest depredations, killing pigs or poultry, or trespassing on the property of the inhabitants, will be reported to headquarters, and the least that will be done to them will be to send them to the Alexandria jail.
It is again ordered that no one shall arrest or attempt to arrest any citizen not in arms at this time, or search or attempt to search any house, or even to enter the same, without permission.
The troops must behave themselves with as much forbearance and propriety as if they were at their own homes. They are here to fight the enemies of the country, not to judge and punish the unarmed and helpless, however guilty they may be. When necessary, that will be done by the proper persons.
By command of Brigadier-General McDowell:

Nothing new to-day except confirmation of Cox’s check.* I am gathering a column to accompany me via Summersville; it is slow work, and the distance is great. What news from Manassas ? I anxiously await it.
