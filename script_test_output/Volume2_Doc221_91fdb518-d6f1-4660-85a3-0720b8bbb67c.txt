Report of Col. H. G. Depuy, Eighth Ohio Infantry, of operations July 13
and 14.
Red House Camp,
Udqrs. Eighth Regiment 0. F. M. July 22, 1861. Sir : In compliance with your order, dated July 19, 1861, requiring me to transmit you a full account of my proceedings with my command to pursue and intercept the rebel forces retreating from Laurel Hill, by way of Saint George and Red House Corners, on Sunday, July 14, 1861, with the number of my forces, the amount of provisions on hand, and means of transportation, herewith I present the following report:
I arrived at West Union from Oakland with four companies of my command on Saturday morning, July 13, at 1 a. m., in a violent rain storm, having been compelled to leave two companies at Chisholm’s Mill to guard all of my teams which had given out. They arrived at West Union at 9 a. m., making my force six companies, of 578 men. At 9 a. m., July 13, I waited on Colonel Irvine, of the Sixteenth Ohio Regiment, and we proceeded to examine the country for five miles in the different directions which we supposed the enemy would take. On our return Colonel Irvine received a dispatch from you, informing him that the enemy were retreating by way of Saint George. As yet not knowing but that West Union would be the route they would be compelled to take, owing to the impassable state of the other roads leading from Saint George across the country and intercepting the western turnpike, I, with Colonel Irvine and Major Bailey, immediately selected two positions, one south of West Union one-half mile, and the other one mile west, either of them strong enough to have defended us from any numbers. I ordered my men to lay upon their arms in readiness to take position at a moment’s warning.

CAMPAIGN IN WEST VIRGINIA
231
At 5J a. m. Sunday morning Colonel Irvine’s scouts came in, and in-formedlne that the enemy were retreating by way of Red House Corners. We immediately got under way and gave chase, arriving at the Corners at 7 a. m., a distance of seven miles. Here we learned they had passed at 5 a. m., with the exception of a regiment or two still back. We immediately selected two companies of rifles—one from the Eighth, Captain Daggett, and one from the Sixteenth—and ordered them to proceed southward toward Texas Corners, and meet them if possible upon advantageous grounds, the main body, supposed to be, from what we learned from prisoners, about 5,000 strong, having got two and a half [hours] the start. We continued the chase until we were within eight miles of them, having traveled six miles. We halted to make reconnaissance, when we were overtaken by General Hill. The balance of our march was made under the supervision of the commanding general.
When I started on Sunday morning in pursuit many of my command had taken no breakfast, and made the entire march of that day with but half a biscuit. We had not one day’s provisions on hand, and our means of transportation were so limited as to cut off the hope of an immediate supply. My command had at that time received no horses or wagons from the Government, and my only means of transportation were teams pressed into service from farmers in and about Oakland.
