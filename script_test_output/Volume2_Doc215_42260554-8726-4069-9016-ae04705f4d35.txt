yesterday. Thirty-five men first attacked and fired upon our pickets without injuring them. They returned the fire effectually, and got safely into camp. All of our pickets got safely in during the night. The advance of the enemy was composed of about 160 well-armed and disciplined men, and by dark last night our little force was surrounded, the enemy covering the three roads leading past the Court-House.
He brings no definite information as to number of enemy; thinks at least 2,500, 1,000 of whom are an Eastern Virginia regiment, well armed and equipped and disciplined, the rest militia.
Irregular firing was kept up during the night. At daybreak, in the language of the scout, “ Both sides were firing like hell,” our men holding good their position. Tyler’s two companies stopped last night ten miles this side of Glenville, for what reason God only knows. But the delay has probably occasioned the cutting off of my brave boys.
Colonel Tyler himself at 10 o’clock this morning was not a mile and a half from Weston. If our men at Glenville cannot hold out till to-morrow morning Tyler and Lytle will not reach Wise at all.
The scout reports that our men are behaving nobly, determined to hold their position.
Respectfully,
J. M. COKNELL, Seventeenth Ohio Volunteers.

Reports of Brig. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, U. S. Army, of preliminary operations from June 27 to July 3.
June 29,1861.
[General:] On the receipt of your instructions by telegraph to proceed to Elk Camp, after midnight of the 27th I took my staff and sixty-five Chicago dragoons, under Captain Barker, and arrived at 6 a. m. I found it about ten miles below Clarksburg, in the woods, in a bend of the Elk, and about one mile and a half above the bridge. They were sent to cover in the position marked A on the sketch herewith.* Spending two or three hours in reducing things to order and reconnoitering the locality, I found there was no room for any one of the regiments, and some had not even room for a company roll-call. Meanwhile I received your dispatch by messenger, announcing the departure of General Sehleieh and of Colonel McCook for the same spot. I had the long-roll beat, and the troops assembled from the woods, fields, and ravines, where they were roaming. Those were arrested who did not obey the call, and experienced its meaning. Having given them this lesson I dismissed them for dinner, and gave orders that after they should prepare for a march. I then went forward to examine the country for a suitable camp. The valley in which is the Buckhannon turnpike is narrow, winding along through high hills, covered with timothy and clover, and offers no sufficient space for an encampment until you reach Duncan’s Bottom. Arriving there, the citizens of the vicinity told me I could find a good camping ground in a valley beyond Matty Mountain $ it proved a mistake, and I returned to this place, where I met the head of the column, and ordered them to encamp for the night.
It was then 8 o’clock, and 1 proceeded to Schleich’s camp and wrote you the dispatch sent last evening. On my way I found McCook’s regi-

ment on the only ground fit for the camp at the bridge, which the Eighth and Tenth were sent to cover at the point marked 0. Schleich had gone into camp at the Elk Camp at A on the sketch. I returned home at 12.30 o’clock last night, and this morning read your letter of the 27th. Yesterday intelligence of the non-occupation of Buckhannon was confirmed this morning by a scout of the Nineteenth, who slept there last night, and found no secession forces. As telegraphed you last night, I am more and more afraid we shall be compelled to hunt rather than fight.
After these details of my movements and position I have only to add that, according to the tenor of your instructions to occupy Buckhannon with one regiment when I deemed it safe, I have sent the Ninth Ohio, under Colonel McCook, who will probably reach there by 6 o’clock this evening.
No one, my dear general, among your general friends, has more disinterested and earnest wishes for the success of your efforts than the writer of this letter. None under your command are more loyally, cheerfully ready to conform to the duties of a subordinate position, and I even flatter myself I understand the position as well as most of your brigadiers. Review, if you please, that letter which you have put on record, and say whether, after you receive this, both private feelings and public interest are likely to be the better for it.

Sir : I send this by special messenger to open communication with you. By order of Major-General McClellan, after a night’s march I occupied this place with my brigade—the Eighth and Tenth Indiana and Nineteenth Ohio—this morning at 7 o’clock amid the cheers and congratulations of the citizens. The Beverly and Weston roads are occupied in peace, and patrols will be established to scour the country in all directions. Let me know how you are situated, and advise me of anything relating to the movements of the secessionists in our region and elsewhere.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General : Of the matters on which I wished to consult was the order to be given to the detached portion of the Seventeenth Ohio Regiment. Colonel Connell, with Lieutenant-Colonel Pond and four companies of the regiment, was detached and landed at Petroleum on the 26th ultimo, with orders to proceed to Hughes’ River, and take position to command the Staunton road and the road from Glenville through Burning Springs

to Parkersburg, and await orders. Subsequently be received an additional supply of provisions, and directions to x>roceed to Glenville, and thence to Weston, unless unforeseen circumstances should require other action. Since then Colonel Tyler informed me that he was thirty-seven miles west of Glenwood. I wrote Colonel Tyler to communicate with him, and gave no further orders, until I knew your views of the forces in that direction.
One company, under Captain Stinchcomb, of Colonel Silks [Connell’s] regiment, was detailed as a train guard during the 24th to 28th ultimo, when I was removed from the opportunity of communicating with them. Three companies, under Major Steele, a very enterprising officer of that regiment, was detached at Clarksburg on the 27th to proceed to Parkersburg, and there take boats for Bipley, Bavenswood, and Belleville.
The major arrived in Parkersburg on Friday, the 28th. On the same evening he embarked on two steamboats, commanded by Captain Kountz, and reached a landing two miles below Bavenswood with two companies, leaving the other steamboat to land above Belleville, and march down and take it while the two landed at Bavenswood.
The major proceeded to Bipley, which he reached at 4 a. m. of the 29th. He x>laced his advance guard hidden from sight, and having surrounded the place, completely surprised it, cajAuring the x>ostmaster and some eighty other secessionists. He administered the oatlrof allegiance to the captives ; installed the postmaster newly ax)pointed by the Government; took the captive postmaster with him to Bavenswood, where they captured all they could, and swore them in as at Bixdey. The other company landed and cleared Belleville. Major Steele deemed it prudent to leave two companies (D and I) at Bavenswood, and brought the other
one to Clarksburg, which he reached on the morning of the-. One
conq^any remains in Parkersburg. This being the position of the detachment of the Seventeenth, the question arises, what shall be done with them ?
Will you send down all the companies of the Twenty-second to Parkersburg, to enable Gilmore to test the three years’ question, and return the three companies of the Seventeenth, that they may rejoin this brigade? What orders will you give for Colonel Connell % An answer to these questions seems necessary before I can give orders to Major Steele. I send this with him to expedite the matter.
Bespectfully, your obedient servant,
W. S. BOSECBANS.
