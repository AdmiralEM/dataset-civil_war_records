Martinsburu, Va.,--------------, 1861.
According to the best information to be obtained here, Colonel Porterfield left Grafton last Monday, with his command, of about one thousand five hundred men. He went to Philippi, in Barbour County, where he probably awaits re-enforcements, expected from the valley. The U. S. troops from Wheeling, to the number of about two thousand, arrived at Mannington (forty miles west of Grafton) last Monday, and stopped to repair two small railroad bridges which had been destroyed near there. The repair of the bridges could not detain them over three or four days. Nothing definite is known here about the U. S. force advancing from Parkersburg to Grafton, but some of the railroad bridges on that line are believed to have been destroyed. There was no military force of either side at Grafton on Wednesday at 4p. m.; but some of the Union men of the neighborhood were gathering there, with such arms as they could get at home.
The above information, meager as it is, is all that we have, and is reliable as far as it goes. The bridges between this and Cumberland should by all means be burned (especially the bridge over the Potomac proper). Small bridges are but a small hinderance, in point of time, to an army, and recollect the railroad is to be the means of precipitating the immense body of men from Ohio and west of Ohio, who are to occupy our Virginia. Only important bridges will present obstacles, as to time, of any material value. West of Cumberland there are also important bridges, but I fear they are in the hands of Union men, and a little force would be required.

I am instructed by General Lee to inform you that there will be sent to Jamestown Island to-morrow eight field guns (6 and 12 pounders) for the works now being constructed under your superintendence below Williamsburg. The commanding officer at Jamestown has been instructed to transport these guns at once to the neck of land, from which place you will remove them to the works for which they are intended. I suppose you will have no difficulty in this matter, the destruction of the wood trade, in which I learn your people have been largely engaged, having caused a large number of idle teams.

Army and of the Provisional Army of Virginia, under your orders, I am instructed to say, as to the latter, that they were sent to you to be entirely at your disposal, and you are authorized to employ them in any manner in which you may think they can be made useful to the service. You will receive information respecting the officers of the 0. S. Army as soon as it can be referred to the proper authority.

[Col. Garnett f]:
Sir : I have just returned from a reconnaissance of the country between this point and the neighborhood of Hampton and Newport News, and have received the most accurate information. There are about nine thousand troops at both places. They are generally in a most disorganized state. Troops are, however, arriving daily. Dr. Cuyler informs Col. Carly S. Jones that no movement would be made until there were fifteen thousand troops at Fort Monroe and Newport News together. This, he supposed, would be within ten days. I am pushing forward the defenses here, and hope to be fully prepared.
I designed an expedition to dislodge the Federal troops from Newport News, which I was informed was almost in a defenseless state as to fortifications; but the regiment from Virginia, under Colonel August, was not ready to take the field, for want of shoes and other necessaries, and I ascertained at the last moment that the position of the troops at Newport News was much stronger than I had been led to believe. I therefore gave it up, and substituted for it one of reconnaissance, and to afford some relief to the frightened people of the country near Hampton. I found that the country was rich in supplies for horses, and that the presence there of two companies of cavalry and one of sharpshooters with a small gun would afford all the protection necessary to induce the

farmers to remain and finisli the cultivation of tlieir crops. I shall send three companies there very soon.
There is some difference of opinion here as to the rank of Colonel Hill, of the North Carolina regiment, and myself. I think I rank him, but am of the impression that it is a subject of some feeling on his part. He has, however, obeyed my orders so far, and I presume will continue to do so. I have been obliged to do almost all the duties of the staff myself until now, when I have the services of Captain Cosby and Captain Lambert, assistant quartermaster 5 the latter wholly without experience. I hope in a few days to have a more perfect organization.
I do not think we shall be attacked by troops coming from Fort Monroe by land over the Peninsula, but that if attacked it will be by sea and by land (from Grove Landing) at the same time. The steamer is waiting. I hope to be able to write more fully to-morrow.
I am, very respectfully,

Commanding, dec., Harper’s Ferry, Va.:
Sir : I have received your letter of the 1st, inclosing report from Colonel Allen and a paper in relation to affairs near Grafton. In reference to the last, the latest reports received from Colonel Porterlield are more favorable than the report from Colonel Allen. A party has been ordered to secure the road at Cheat River and east of it, which I hope will effectually prevent its use. As regards Harper’s Ferry, its abandonment would be depressing to the cause of the South, and I have thought it possible that you might detach a portion of your force towTards Martinsburg, the occupation of which, or a point on the Opequan, would strengthen your posts in front of Williamsport and at Shepherds-town. In addition to the First Tennessee Regiment, a regiment from Georgia has been ordered to join you.

Department of Alexandria, Va., Provisional Army Confederate States,
Camp Pickens, Va., June 3, 1861. His Excellency President Jefferson Davis, Richmond, Va.:
Dear Sir : I arrived here on the 1st, at 2 p. m., and immediately examined the site of this encampment and the place of its proposed defenses. The former is an open country, traversed by good roads in every direction, without any strong natural features for the purposes of defense, and without running water nearer than three miles, except a few small springs at half that distance. The plans of the works are good, but too extensive to be finished in less than two or three weeks, and cannot be garrisoned with less than from three to four thousand men. As this position can be turned in every direction by an enemy, for the purpose of destroying the railroads intended to be defended by

it, it becomes a question whether these works could be held more than a few days when thus isolated.
I have reconnoitered closely several of the fords on Bull Hun and one on Occoquan Run (about three miles from here), which offer strong natural features of defense j but they are so numorous and far apart that only a much larger force than I have here at my command (say not less than from ten to fifteen thousand men) could hope to defend +hem all against a well-organized enemy of about twenty thousand men, who could select his point of attack. I must therefore either be re-enforced at once, as I have not more than about six thousand effective men, or I must be prepared to retire, on the approach of the enemy, in the direction of Richmond, with the intention of arresting him whenever and wherever the opportunity shall present itself, or I must march to meet him at one of said fords, to sell our lives as dearly as practicable. Badly armed and badly equipped as my command is at present, with several of its regiments having but one or two field officers, and having hardly any means of transportation, it would be expecting too much that I could meet with success the Northern foes that are preparing to attack us within a few days with all the advantages of arms, numbers, and discipline. I beg, however, to remark that my troops are not only willing, but are anxious, to meet the enemies of our country under all circumstances.
I remain, dear sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
G. T. BEAUREGARD.
Headquarters Yorktown, Va., June 3,1861.
Colonel Garnett :
Sir : There are now here, at this post, including officers and men, sick and extra duty, about three thousand four hundred. Colonel Ewell has only about four hundred. I shall station at or near Grove Landing two companies, to fall back upon Colonel EwelPs command, and at Blow’s Mill, four miles this side of Grove Landing, and on the road to this place also two companies, both infantry. I shall also detach a company of rifles from Hampton to that part of the country, and two companies of cavalry, as I stated yesterday. This will make our force about three thousand here, but will leave Colonel Ewell much exposed. As to calling out the militia, this country is so thinly populated that it cannot be depended on. Colonel Ewell, who is with me now, thinks that it will amount to one hundred and fifty men, all told, and these not effective, and not to be relied on. The reason of this, Colonel Ewell says, is that there are many disaffected men in Elizabeth City and the lower part of York County 5 many also being obliged to stay at home on account of the occupation of the country by Federal troops. A large accession of force of infantry and artillery ought, therefore, to be made to this command, in order to secure the line from Jamestown Island and to York River—at least four thousand more. Our lines here are very extended. Our outward right flank defenses are nearly completed. We have a breastwork connecting the old English fort with the head of the ravine, which latter is in front of our position. The old fort protects our left. The navy battery has three guns mounted 5 a fourth will be in position in a day or two. The work itself has been inclosed. I think it labor thrown away upon it, as, if our other positions were carried, we could not find shelter in this inclosed work for one-third of our men. As the plan was arranged before

I came down, I did not interfere. It is intended to strengthen our left by making works which will require regular approaches, if we have time. When once strongly fortified, I shall always be able to defend this work, at least until an army from the interior can raise the siege by beating the besiegers. We expect to be very strong by the end of this week. While this is going on, abattis will be thrown across many of the roads leading to this place, only two being left open for public use, and defenses will be thrown up at all favorable points. The axemen, to make the abattis for exterior defense, go out to-morrow.
I have directed Captain Meade to state how many additional guns he considers necessary for the defenses about to be erected and those now in existence, and how many men will be required to man the various works. I will forward it to the General-in-Chief as soon as made out. I shall be able to supply corn and hay to all the cavalry from this part of the country, if wagons can be sent to me. There are very few about here. I have made a requisition for fifty. Instead of waiting for the whole number, I request that as many as can be obtained be sent, with drivers and teams of course. Tents are absolutely necessary for troops acting in the field. The cavalry, with the exception of Douthat’s company, have no tents, and the houses here are all occupied. I have directed the assistant quartermaster to-day to get boards from a steam saw-mill about seven miles above this place, with which to build sheds for mules and horses. Requisitions for tents for the Third Virginia Regiment are in the hands of the Quartermaster’s Department, and approved, but they have none. Not more than one-third of the force works on the defenses; the rest are drilling. Colonel Ewell has been directed by me to cause the men under his command to work at the defenses intrusted to him, and also to employ, or impress, if necessary, as many negroes as he requires for this purpose.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hdqrs. Department of Fredericksburg,
Fredericksburg, Va., June 3, 1861. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces :
Sir: I received last evening the General’s views respecting my telegram to Governor Letcher of the 31st ultimo. The views expressed are admitted, on general principles, as correct The General is not probably aware of the return through my office, on the morning in question, if my memory serves me, of the requisition of Captain Walker for ammunition, made some days previously, without having been filled, on the ground of an omission to state the amount of ammunition on hand. I have been informed also that the General was then absent at Manassas Junction. As I approached the scene of action that morning the firing had become rapid and heavy, and there was reason to believe that a crisis was rapidly approaching. Under these circumstances I wrote the telegram, and instructed a clerk, sent to Fredericksburg for that purpose, to send it to the governor, and also to your office. I had been authorized, on entering on duty, immediately on the secession of the State, to communicate directly with the governor on matters deemed by me of material importance. The effort to sustain our cause and to supply Captain Walker’s rifled guns was thus accomplished, enabling me to carry under my personal charge a full supply of ammunition for it upon the field in the midst of the action on Saturday.

[Chap. IX.
Military commanders, I have found from an experience not very limited (and to which the General has been pleased to refer), sometimes sacrifice forms to impending necessities. On the subject of the expenditure of ammunition, the General has not been more solicitous as to its economical use than I have constantly been. Thus far it is well known that the naval batteries are under the exclusive command of the naval officers, and I have had only to assist in locating them, to furnish the men and most of the materials to build them, and (when erected) toman and protect them at all times, much to the prejudice of my volunteer organization, and have never ordered the firing of a single gun from one of them.
I have reason to regret that the General should have, apparently, judged as to* the character of our operations from information possibly derived from irresponsible sources. I trust that the General will believe that, so far as depends upon myself personally, I shall make the best use of such force and material as may be furnished me and as I can raise and collect.
It is to be observed that, although our forces have not suffered, I should not be willing, trusting to rumor and observation, to assure the enemy so readily for loss sustained.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General Johnston :
Sir : I have intelligence from the other side up to 3 p. m. yesterday. No Federal troops at Hagerstown, Boonsborough, or at any other point in the valley. At Chambersburg there are said to be some ten or twelve thousand men, though my informant believed that their number was exaggerated.
A true friend from Maryland, living three miles from this post, came over last night with information that on Sunday a prominent Eepublican, of Washington County, Maryland, named Cook, accompanied by a Pennsylvanian, in citizen’s dress, wrere at Mercersville, about three and a half miles above this place, and at other points along the canal above that point, engaging boats and scows, to be used in passing the river. Cook said to one of the persons, from whom he obtained a ferry-boat, that, in the course of the next week, there would be twenty or twenty-five thousand rqen thrown into Virginia upon this line; that they proposed to cross the river at three points, viz, Mercersville, Slackwater Ham No. 4, about six miles above this, and at Williamsport 5 and that the three columns would concentrate at a point on the railroad not far from Kerneysville. There is a great congregation of canal and ferry boats at Slackwater Ham No. 4, with which they could speedily bridge the river at that point. I have a large ferry-boat secured on our side in Ham No. 4, with which I can cross over twenty-five or thirty men at a time. The enemy’s boats have no other guard than their hands on board and some canal hands, perhaps one hundred and twenty men in all. I think, with my company, I could, if desirable, destroy all of the boats by crossing the river in the night and burning them.
I obtained two kegs (twenty-five pounds each) of powder from Maryland on yesterday. I have more of the article now than I have immediate use for. I shall, however, continue to procure all that I can. Please direct me where tQ send it. If desired, I can forward it to Winchester. There is a good macadamized road from here to that place. If not already known to you, allow me to call your attention to a ford across the river at (just below) the mouth of Antietam Creek, four and a quarter miles below this point. It is a good ford, and is now passable, and the approaches on either side very good. My force of cavalry is too small to enable me to guard it.
Respectfully, your obedient servant,

A telegram from Dublin Depot was received here last night by Lieutenant-Colonel Langhorne, by a person just from Parisburg, Giles County, stating that a large force from the northwest was advancing on Lewisburg. This morning the following telegram was received by him from the same place:
Last night’s dispatch is confirmed hy special messenger this morning. Ten thousand Northern troops and twelve hundred horse are now in Fayette County, making forced marches for the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. We want assistance. From their position they can reach the road in three days.

I send the dispatch for what it is worth. I cannot believe there is any truth in it. The country from which it comes has been very much stampeded with false rumors of insurrection on the line of the Virginia and Tennessee Eoad.
