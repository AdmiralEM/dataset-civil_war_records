No. 12.
Report of Maj. Charles N. Lamison, Twentieth Ohio Infantry, of operations
July 13 and 14.
Headquarters Twentieth Regiment O. Y. M.,
Oakland, Md., July 20, 1861.
Sir : At 1J a. m., Saturday, July 13,1 received your order directing me to proceed over the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and with Companies A, F, I, and K, then stationed at different points on said line, with them to join you at Oakland, Md., or at si\ch other point as I might learn you might then occupy. Accordingly, I at once ordered transportation from Wheeling, and dispatched Adjutant Evans over the line from Fairmont, who brought the several detachments to Grafton, at which place we arrived at 2 a. m. Sunday. Owing to delays on the road, occasioned by trains on the road and the unwillingness of conductors to proceed, I did not arrive at Oakland until 12 o’clock m. Sunday. On my arrival, learning that you had proceeded to Chisholm’s Mill, I at once, without taking any baggage, put my detachment in motion, and at 3 o’clock reached the Red House, on the Northwestern turnpike, at which place I met you returning with the forces under General Hill. The conduct of the men and officers under my command is deserving of much credit, and to their energy and hearty co-operation I am indebted for rapidity of my movements.
Respectfully, I am, yours,
CHARLES N. LAMISON, Major Twentieth Regiment 0. V. M.
Thomas Morton,
Colonel, Commanding Twentieth Regiment 0. F. M.
