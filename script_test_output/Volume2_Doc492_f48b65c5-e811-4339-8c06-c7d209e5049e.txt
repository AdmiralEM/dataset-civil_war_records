No. 2.
f	Fort Monroe, U<x., May 28, 1861.
The general in command lias heard with pain that there are instances of despoliation of private property by some perspns who have smuggled themselves among the soldiers of his command. This must not and shall not be. The rights of private property and of peaceable citizens must be respected. When the exigencies of the service require that private property be taken for public use, it must be done by proper officers, giving suitable vouchers therefor. It is made the special duty of every officer in command of any post, or of any troops on detached service or in camp, to cause all offenders in the matter of this order to be sent to headquarters for punishment, and such measure of justice will be meted out to them as is due to thieves and plunderers. If any corps shall conceal or aid in receiving plundered property or plunderers, such corps will be dealt with in its organization in such a manner as to check such practices.
This order will be promulgated by being three times read with distinctness to each battalion at evening parade.
Any citizen, at peace with the United States, despoiled in his person or property by any of the troops of this department, will confer a favor by forthwith reporting the outrage to the nearest officer.
By command of Major-General B. F. Butler:

Hdqrs. Department N. E. Virginia,
Arlington, June 4,1861. Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen.,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. G.:
Colonel : I have the honor to report as follows, in compliance with your telegram of the 3d instant requiring me to submit u an estimate of the number and composition of a column to be pushed towards Manassas Junction, and perhaps the gap, say in four or five days, to favor Patterson’s attack on Harper’s Ferry.”
In view of the number of the enemy supposed to be at Manassas Junction, at Centreville, Fairfax Station, Fairfax Court-House, and other places this side of Manassas, and of that at places beyond Manassas, but within a few hours of it by rail, and of the possibility of troops coming from the valley through the gap, I think the actual entire force at the head of the column should, for the purpose of carrying the position at Manassas and of occupying both the road to Culpeper and the one to the gap, be as much as 12,000 infantry, two batteries of regular artillery, and from six to eight companies of cavalry, with an available reserve ready to move forward from Alexandria by rail of 5,000 infantry and one heavy field battery, rifled if possible; these numbers to be increased or diminished as events may indicate. I propose that this force, composed mostly of new troops, shall be organized into field brigades, under active and experienced colonels of the Army, whilst their regiments are being recruited, aided by a few regular officers. This is made the more necessary from the fact that the presence on this side of some corps indifferently commanded has led to numerous acts of petty depredations, pillage, &c., which have exasperated the inhabitants and chilled the hopes of the Union men. and show that these regiments should

all of them he restrained as well as led; and where, as is the case with many, they are not so by their officers, they must have some one immediately over them who can and will. I do not propose to have a supply train of wagons for the main body, but to use the railroad, which makes it necessary that every bridge or other important point be guarded, and have either a block-house or field-work. This will require several Engineer officers, and a full supply of intrenching tools, axes, &c.
I have now, perhaps, done all that the General-in-Chief desires of me, but I will take the liberty of adding a few remarks, if not even some suggestions. As soon as we commence to move they will do the same, and as their communications with their position at Harper’s Ferry, which they evidently cherish, will be threatened, they will do as they did when we first came over—hurry forward from all the stations at the South—and the question arises as to the best point or line it is advisable to hold, even for defensive purposes. This, it seems to me, is the line of the Eappahannock, which, if occupied in force, will effectually free all Northeastern Virginia, without coming in contact with the inhabitants, and also free the Potomac. It will be necessary to hold the Aquia Creek Eailroad, which, if done in large numbers, would make a powerful diversion in General Butler’s favor. It is true the foregoing is not directly in answer to the question of the General-in-Chief, but I think it flows from it. In relation to the number of troops to be used, I have only to say—what, perhaps, is evident enough, however—that in proportion to the numbers used will be the lives saved 5 and as we have such numbers pressing to be allowed to serve, might it not be well to overwhelm and conquer as much by the show of force as by the use of it?
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, colonel, your most obedient servant,

Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Washington, June 4,1861. Gen. E. Patterson, Chambersburg, Pa.:
General Scott says do not make a move forward until you are joined by a battery of the Fourth Artillery and a battalion of five companies Third U. S. Infantry, to leave here the 6th instant for Carlisle. Company F, Fourth Artillery, is the one to be mounted. Orders have been given to purchase horses and collect the guns, equipments, &c., as soon as possible, at Carlisle. It will require some days, but the General considers this addition to your force indispensable. If two Ohio regiments come to you, retain them. Also halt the first two regiments that may pass through Harrisburg from the North to this city, and add them to your force. You will receive a letter from the General before you move.

I have it from a most reliable source that there are 20,000 men at Manassas Junction, Lee’s Station, Fairfax Court-House, and Centreville.

Recent developments show that it is absolutely necessary to muster in Virginia troops between Grafton and Parkersburg for service in that State. This cannot be delayed, and every motive of policy requires it to be done at once. I am so urgently solicited by Carlile and other reliable Unionists to take this step, that I feel forced to do so, unless I hear from you to the contrary. The case requires prompt action.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
Sir : I have the honor to report the arrival of Colonel Townsend with the Third New York Regiment of Volunteers, 800 strong, so that now the aggregate effective force under my command, including the regulars, may be set down at 6,750 men. As yet, however, we have not a single piece of artillery for the field. I received some artillery harness, however, and will ask leave to enlist from the three-months7 men for three years two companies of artillerists. We have no horses even sufficient for the quartermaster’s service yet. May I have permission to cause to be bought horses for the guns % I have thought that, as the quartermaster’s service is so pressed in New York, if I had authority to order purchases in Boston, which is substantially an untried market, it might be done with advantage and economy to the Government. My military secretary, Major Fay, is now in Boston arranging his private affairs. He is a thorough business man, and would cause an inspection of the animals before delivery.
The intrenchments at Newport News will be completed by the time

this report reaches you, and the place is really very strong. A battery of four 8-inch columbiads will command the channel of the James River upon one side, but still leaves open the channel on the Nanse-mond side.
On this side, as you will perceive, is Pig Point, upon which the rebels have erected batteries, which they are striving now to finish, mounting some seven guns of 32-pounders and 42-pounders. If we Were in possession of Pig Point the James and Nansemond would both be under our control, and the services of one blockading vessel might be dispensed with, which are now required to prevent water communication between Richmond and Williamsburg and Norfolk and Suffolk. My proposition is, therefore, to make a combined naval and land attack upon Pig Point, and endeavor to carry the batteries both by turning them and by direct attack from the naval force $ if we succeed, then to intrench ourselves there with what speed we may, and re-establish the battery; but at the same time to push on with the same flotilla of boats with which we land up the Nansemond, which is navigable for boats and I believe light-draught steamers, to Suffolk, a distance of twelve miles. When once there, tlie Commanding GeneraPs familiarity with the country or a glance at the map will show that we are in possession of all the railroad communications between Richmond, Petersburg, and Norfolk, and also of the Great Shore Line, connecting Virginia with North Carolina via Weldon, by which the guns taken at the navy-yard will be sent South whenever the operation in that direction demands.
By going eight and a half miles farther, by Jericho Canal we enter Drummond Lake, a sheet of water some four by six miles. From the lake the feeder of the Dismal Swamp Canal might be cut off, and that means of transport cut off. Once at Suffolk in position, with these lines of communication of the enemy cut off, Norfolk must fall with her own weight. Starvation, to be brought on by simply gathering up the provisions of Princess Anne County, will make her batteries and the theft of the navy-yard guns substantially valueless, and will save many lives to be spent otherwise in their reduction. I am not insensible to the disadvantages and difficulties of this project, which I may have painted with too much couleur de rose. I do not recognize as among the most formidable the reduction of Pig Point Battery—that is, there is plenty of depth of water within point-blank range to float the Cumberland 5 but, the battery once* reduced, there must be a pretty active march on Suffolk to prevent trouble; some fortifications there, which I believe have not yet been undertaken.
If I am right in the importance which I attach to this position, then I must expect all the force of the rebels both from Norfolk and Richmond, brought there by the railroads, to be precipitated upon me, and be prepared to meet it in the open field. Could they do otherwise f Norfolk would be hemmed in. Am I able to withstand such an attack between two forces which may act in conjunction, with the necessary drafts from my force to keep open the line of communication by the Nansemond with Newport News, which would then be the right flank of my base of operations %
All these questions, much more readily and easily comprehended by the General-in-Chief than by myself, with the thousand suggestions that will at once present themselves to his mind, are most respectfully submitted. May I ask for full and explicit instructions upon this matter ? I have adopted the suggestions of the Lieutenant-General upon the subject of arming the flank companies of Colonel Duryea’s com-

Col. Lewis Wallace,
Eleventh Indiana Regiment, Cumberland, Md.:
Sir : I am instructed by Major-General Patterson to direct you to halt your forces at Cumberland, securing the bridges over the Potomac and Green Spring Run, respectively, five and fifteen miles upon this side, and there to await further orders from him. He also instructs me to add in his name, as follows: Gather as much reliable information as possible of the disposition of the people of Maryland and Virginia in that vicinity, and extend your inquiries by secret agents south into Virginia and east along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Encourage the Unionists in disaffected regions to band together for self-defense, and to take heart from the support the Government has already given and the protection now given to them. By a kind, yet firm, course on your part, and by the good deportment of your troops, secure the confidence and good-will of the community in which you may be located. Let the inhabitants feel you are in their midst as friends and protectors. Should you gain information of the gathering, for offensive movements, of armed bodies of men not too powerful to be overcome by a force you can safely detach, capture or rout them by surprise, if possible, and seize and hold as prisoners of war all parties injuring the lines of communication, or arrayed or plotting against the peace of the United States; ascertain the resources of the country, with a view of subsisting your command (perhaps to be largely increased), and drawing as little as possible provisions and stores from this or other distant regions.
The commanding general desires you to report in full your operations and any information gained on matters of importance, and from time to time, as occasion may offer, he would be pleased to hear from you on such topics as you may deem of interest.

I desire in a few days to occupy the roads beyond Hagerstown, and to establish my headquarters in that town, but do not, in face of the order of the General-in-Chief not to make a forward movement, like to advance beyond Greencastle, to which point Colonel Thomas7 brigade moved to-day. I can in a few days hence throw with wagons eight thousand men beyond that point, and by rail at the same time two thousand more.
While the river is high from recent rains, I wish to establish my depots and to intrench my left flank on the Boonsborough road, placing there the force with which I can threaten the Maryland Heights, and, should a favorable occasion offer, storm them. This force will be that which I will not be able to provide with sufficient transportation at present. The approaches to Harper’s Ferry are so well guarded, and the sympathizers with the rebels in the immediate vicinity so numerous, that no spy can approach their works. The little information I can gain assures me that they are fortifying west of Harper’s Ferry as well as at the Maryland Heights, and design on this field to make a desperate struggle for supremacy.
Independent of the regular force with Colonel Thomas, I have now in this vicinity seventeen regiments, all the force which is to join me, except the New York and Ohio regiments, of which I know nothing.

Sir : On the 24th ultimo I was notified by the General-in-Chief to make use of the New Jersey quota on this line. I called upon the governor of that State to ascertain when they would be ready, and was informed that they would, at the request of the Secretary, go to Washington.
Before daybreak this morning a New York regiment passed through Harrisburg, claiming orders of later date than the 4th instant from the General-in-Chief to move to Washington. I have ordered it to return, unless their last order from the General-in-Chief is subsequent to the one to me.
To-day I commenced placing on the road to Hagerstown the brigades as prepared, Colonel Thomas, Second Cavalry, leading off with five companies of horse; a battalion of two companies of the First Artillery; one of Eighth Infantry, and one of volunteers; the Sixth, Twenty-first, and Twenty-third Regiments Pennsylvania Volunteers. He will encamp near Greencastle, and hold himself ready to move at any moment.
To-morrow morning Brigadier-General Williams, commanding the Seventh, Eighth, Tenth, and Twentieth Regiments, will encamp near him. If Colonel Miles arrives by the time wagons will be prepared, he will be assigned to the command of a brigade, and placed in close proximity to General Williams. The baggage train comes in slowly, but every one is working hard, intelligently, and cheerfully to be prepared at the earliest moment, and I expect that by the arrival of the Third

On your prudence and judgment he relies to maintain the present status.
Appeals may be made to cross into Virginia to protect Union people under assurance that a small force only is required to present itself for disunion to hide its head and loyal people to flock to your banners. They must not be heeded. If, however, inroads are made into Maryland within your reach, the commanding general desires you to meet the invaders with a force which will ride down all opposition, and in all cases to return to your present camp. When practicable, the surprise of armed parties will be effected. Brigadier-General Williams will be immediately in your rear, and is directed to sustain you in all cases.

I request that you will not allow yourself to be hampered by the fear of trespassing on my department.

must be no reverse. Hence I have given you the best re-enforcements within my reach, and have just ordered Colonel Burnside’s fine Khode Island regiment of infantry, with its battery (about 1,200 strong), to proceed to Carlisle, and there receive your orders. A company of the Fourth Artillery (to receive its horses and battery at Carlisle) with the battalion of the Third Infantry took the same route and with the same instructions yesterday. This battery may not be ready for you in time, though these heavy rains must swell the Potomac and delay your passage some days.
I am organizing, to aid you, a small secondary expedition under Colonel Stone. He will have about 2,500 men, including two troops of cavalry and a section (two pieces) of artillery.
The movements by road and canal will commence the 10th instant, and passing up the country, touching at Bockville, be directed upon the ferry opposite to Leesburg. This may be but a diversion in your favor, but possibly it may be turned into an effective co-operation. Colonel Stone will be instructed to open a communication with you if practicable, and you will make a corresponding effort on your part.
I do not distinctly foresee that we shall be able to make any diversion in your behalf on the other side of the Potomac beyond repairing the lower part of the railroad leading from Alexandria towards the Manassas Gap.
I have said that we must sustain no reverse; but this is not enough, a check or a drawn battle would be a victory to the enemy, filling his heart with joy, his ranks with men, and his magazines with voluntary contributions.
Take your measures, therefore, circumspectly; make a good use of your engineers and other experienced staff officers and generals, and attempt nothing without a clear prospect of success, as you will find the enemy strongly posted and not inferior to you in numbers.
With entire confidence in your valor and judgment, I remain, your brother soldier,

Whereas Lieutenant-General Scott has authorized me, by an accredited messenger, to make a requisition upon you for a detachment of troops, to be sent to Frederick City, if in my discretion I deem it necessary for the public welfare; and whereas the city of Frederick is at any moment liable to attack by the rebels at Harper’s Ferry and vicinity; and whereas stores and provisions are daily sent from this city and vicinity to Virginia, in aid and comfort of the enemy, I having no means at my disposal of preventing said transportation of stores and provisions:
Xow, therefore, I, Thomas H.

Sir : Your letters of the 4th and 6th instant are received.
The General-in-Chief desires me to say in reply, that he highly commends your zeal and activity, which oblige the enemy to strengthen his camp and posts in your vicinity and hold him constantly on the alert. The principal value of your movement upon Suffolk is, that it would be the easiest route to the Gosport navy-yard, and the objects (including many ships of war) which our people on the former occasion left undestroyed. The possession of Norfolk within itself is of no importance whilst we blockade Hampton Roads; but the destruction of the railroads leading from that city, as far as you may find it practicable, would be a valuable coercive measure.
The naval commander should aid you in the collection of boats for joint expeditions, and the Secretary of War has said that he would cause some eighty horses to be bought and shipped to you for a light battery.

Chambersburg, June 10,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Dear General : I have your note, and thank you for the attention. There is no use in telegraphing General Scott or the Department to stop troops at Harrisburg. Under authority from General Scott I have ordered from New York regiments in succession to proceed from Harrisburg to this place, and in each case the colonels have refused to obey. If the Department will send orders to their camps to come here, they will probably obey; not else.
Remember, I beseech you, that Harper’s Ferry is (as I have said from the first)the place where the first great battle will be fought, and the result will be decisive of the future. The insurgents are strongly intrenched, have an immense number of guns, and will contest every inch of ground. Under these circumstances I earnestly and urgently request that you order the regiments expected in Harrisburg and the three New Jersey regiments to proceed to this place with all dispatch. The commander of the Jersey regiments has served with me, and I can rely on him. The Jersey troops were put under my command by General Scott, but Governor Olden says you have ordered them to go to Washington, not being aware, I suppose, that they had been assigned to me by the General-in-Chief. Pardon me for pressing this subject. The importance of victory at Harper’s Ferry cannot be estimated. I cannot sleep for thinking about it. Remember, my dear general, that my reputation and the reputation of our dear old State is at stake in this issue. I beseech you, therefore, by our ancient friendship, give me the means of success. You have the means; place them at my disposal, and shoot me if I do not use them to advantage.
With great regard, trulv yours,

Lieut. Gen. W. Scott :
Immediately upon receipt of your telegram of the 6th I gave orders to muster in Yirginia troops for defense of the State. Counter order of Secretary of War received yesterday, and at once transmitted to General Morris at Grafton. Just received from him the following telegram:
If we don't muster Virginians into service according to proclamation and arm them, we must quit the territory or prepare to hold it with Federal troops. The strong motive of the move here is gone unless their volunteers are received. Such as volunteer for the service will not enter unconditionally, having not State aid. Small force of rebels can control numbers. Have already mustered some informally. When a regiment is ready it will not do to disband. The effect would be disastrous. It is the cheapest way to defend Western Virginia. It is the only way to unite her citizens. Other methods will fail.
I fully concur with General Morris and the leading men in Yirginia, and think it would be impolitic to make further movements in Western Yirginia at present unless we can follow it up by raising Yirginia troops for their own defense. If decision cannot be reversed, shall troops now mustered in be disbanded ? I beg and trust not.

Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General:
Colonel: I sent by telegraph to-day General Morris’ telegram in relation to troops in Western Virginia. It is long, but of such importance, that I felt it necessary to transmit it as it was. I cannot urge too strongly the importance of this matter, on which hinges, I think, the fate of Western Virginia. I regard the position of Western Virginia as very different from that of Maryland. The anxiety in regard to this condition arises, I think, not from any unwillingness to fight the battles of the Union on any battle-field, but from the natural solicitude of a simple people for their own homes and families. We have it in our power to unite that people firmly to us forever. I hope the opportunity may not be permitted to pass by. I ask the efforts of the Lieutenant-General in my support.
General Morris informs me to-day by telegram that one of his parties has dispersed another small camp at St. George, capturing a lieutenant and two secession flags. If secession flags are not too plenty with you I will forward that taken at Philippi in fair fight.
I have been prevented from a forward movement on Beverly by the want of transportation and cavalry. The first defect is by this time remedied, and I am trying to secure the second by inducing the governor to raise State cavalry. I know the slender force of regulars on hand, and dislike asking for them, but if I could have the six companies of Pirst Cavalry now at Fort Leavenworth, I could make excellent use of them.
I have been obliged to defer the Kanawha movement for a few days. I hope before I am ready to make it to have received authority to muster in Virginia troops for the defense of that valley. I learned to-day, from authority apparently reliable, that two regiments of Tennessee troops had orders to move last night from Camp Cheatham (near Nashville) to Union City, and thence, when re-enforced, to take possession of Island Ho. 1, some six miles south of Cairo. I at once sent to General Buckner a telegram, of which I inclose a copy, also one to Governor Magoffin, and had them repeated to Hon. J. J. Crittenden and Hon. James Guthrie for their information. General Buckner came to see me on Friday last. We sat up all night, talking about matters of common interest. Buckner gave me his word that should any Tennessee troops cross the frontier of Kentucky he would use all the force at his disposal to drive them out, and, failing in that, would call on me for assistance. He went to Tennessee after leaving here to present that view to Governor Harris.
Great trouble is being experienced in reorganizing the regiments at Camp Dennison. It is very necessary that money should be provided at once to pay off the three-months’ men and get them out of the way, say $120,000 at a rough calculation.

Asst. Adjt. Gen., TJ. S. Army, Washington City:
Sir : I yesterday notified you of the occupation of Cumberland by the Indiana regiment under Colonel Wallace, and the fact of secession militia being in his vicinity, upon whom he designed to call. I now inclose for the information of the General-in-Chief the satisfactory report of his journey through Yirginia.
I have reason to believe that with few exceptions the people of Maryland are loyal, and wherever a Federal force will appear disloyalty will hide its head and the Government receive powerful auxiliaries. The Unionists now present a bold front and call for aid, which, as I cannot now give and properly sustain, would invite attack and perhaps cause* defeat.
In the counties bordering the Potomac are many Union-loving people,, but the secessionists are so powerful and violent and well armed, that our friends dare not express open sympathy, and are often forced to array themselves against us. For this reason and to sustain the command at Cumberland, which can gradually work its way east, repairing bridges, I would respectfully suggest two regiments at least, if they could be devoted to that purpose, be designated to protect the road in the rear and permit Colonel Wallace to approach. Supplies must also*

be sent by rail from Wheeling, and require protection. I regret my command is not in condition and sufficiently strong in face of a powerful foe to detach at present a force towards Cumberland. I am resolved to conquer and risk nothing.
On Saturday my depot will be established in Hagerstown, and immediately thereafter my headquarters will be transferred to that place. The want of wagons and the difficulty of procuring teams rapidly enough has trammeled me and does so yet, but on Saturday night I shall have in front of Hagerstown over ten thousand men, strongly posted. With depot there established the different commands will be litted with expedition and pushed towards the river. The Fourth Artillery battery will not receive its horses before Saturday. The heavy battery will arrive in Hagerstown after me. Before being prepared to advance from that point the troops will be well drilled and disciplined. A marked improvement is daily manifested in their military exercises, and the regiments lately arrived are in excellent condition and drill. Their successes ere long will, I hope, prove we have gained by delay.

Major-General Patterson :
Sir : Your dispatches, by hand of Jerome Closson, were delivered to me by him this morning, shortly after my arrival. At this time I have only to say that your instructions shall be carried out to the best of my ability. It gives me pleasure to add that my command has been most kindly and hospitably received by the citizens of Cumberland, who appear from their demonstrations to be most loyal and Union. I may also say that I reached this point by way of Grafton, and along my route through Virginia was met with a feeling of good-will amounting to enthusiasm. Although my march was considerably in advance of General McClellan’s troops, and through what is called a disaffected region, there was not a single act of hostility to disturb my progress or interrupt communication with General Morris’ command at Grafton.
By every available opportunity I will forward you reports of the positions and strength of my detachments and the condition of my regiment. At this time I have over eight hundred effective men, keen for the contest, uniformed and very perfectly equipped for the field. If there is impropriety in the remark, general, I hope you will excuse it, but I cannot help concluding with an earnest expression of the hope that you will not forget me when you advance upon Harper’s Ferry and Eichmond, if such be your aim. Through special favor of General Scott (God bless him) we are in the East and under your command, probably the only stranger regiment in a division of gallant soldiers. I hail from a State which, since Buena Vista, has been under a cloud of slander. Do not, I beg you, withhold from us the only chance we may ever have to show the people of the East that Indiana has as much courage as loyalty, and can and will fight to the last man to crush out treason and vindicate her lost honor. General, I will go to the duty you have assigned me, confidently relying upon your generosity and judgment.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your servant,

Paris, Ky., April [June?] 8, 1861. General George B. McClellan :
Dear Sir : It will probably be unnecessary and superfluous, but still I feel impelled to address you this note:
An intelligent friend was with me last evening who had left the State of Mississippi three days before, and traveled through a section of Tennessee and from Nashville to Louisville by the railroad. He informed me that the insurgents claimed to have eight thousand troops at Corinth, in Mississippi, and about twenty thousand along the railroad between Nashville and the Kentucky line and along that line. He understood from an officer high in command in one of their camps that there was a perfect understanding between their leaders and our governor that if Colonel Anderson moved with any troops to Louisville or the authorities of the United States proceeded to take possession of Louisville and of the railroad, or to violate the neutrality of Kentucky as laid down in the governor’s proclamation, the Tennesseeans had his express permission to take possession of the road in Kentucky and also of Louisville, and that they, with the secessionists in that part of Kentucky, would advance upon Louisville with twenty thousand troops.
My informant further said that the same officer had disclosed to him this as the general plan of the campaign by the Confederate leaders in Virginia: Beauregard was to make a movement on Alexandria and a feint attack on Mansfield’s lines, and then fall rapidly back on the interior of Virginia, with a view to draw Mansfield after him in rapid pursuit, and in this way he was to be drawn deeply in the pursuit, when all the Confederate forces that could in the interval be assembled in Virginia and all that could be got together in that State were to move rapidly upon him, intercept his retreat, and capture or annihilate his army. The gentleman told me that the whole Southern people were animated by the most intense hatred against the Northern States and Lincoln’s administration, and felt the greatest confidence that their forces would be victorious wherever they fought on anything like equal terms. He also expressed his own belief that the Southern men had much greater skill in the use of small arms, superiority in horsemanship, and were more alert and spirited than Northern men, and that when they were anything like equal in numbers they would be victorious, especially in the early battles.

I do not believe we can much longer escape trouble in Kentucky. The sympathy for the South and the inclination to secession among our people is much stronger in the southwestern corner of the State than it is in any other part, and as you proceed towards the upper section of the Ohio Kiver and our Virginia line it gradually becomes weaker until it is almost wholly lost. The vote for our delegates to the Border State Convention was not a true test of the strength of parties in our State, though I doubt not that two-thirds of our people are unconditionally for the Union. The timid and quiet are for it, and they shrink from convulsion and civil war, whilst all the bold, the reckless, and the bankrupt are for secession. They think that if they could have a large body of their partisans armed as the Knights of the Golden Cross, the State Guards, &c., they could strike a startling blow, establish extensively over the State a reign of terror, and force Kentucky out as Virginia and Tennessee were taken. Such au attempt would have been much more apt to have succeeded before the distribution of the arms that we obtained through Lieutenant Kelson. Since the Union men got them they have organized companies and have been actively drilling, and they feel much more confidence in their ability to defend themselves and a growing disposition to uphold the Union at all hazards; but all the efforts of our governor and of our inspector-general have been to arm the secessionists and to keep arms from the Union men. The consequence is that the secessionists have the largest number of armed men.
We have placed the 5,000 muskets in the hands of the Union men, of whom about one-lialf would use. them in defense of the Union in their particular localities and the others anywhere in the State. We have something like one hundred companies organized widely over the State who have applied for arms since we distributed our whole stock, and we have not been able to furnish them with a gun. We were promised 5,000 more of muskets and 8,000 Sharp’s and Enfield rifles. It has been unfortunate that they were withheld, for we could by this time have had them all distributed to good men, which would have made the Union strength in the State invincible. There is a great difference between Union men armed and unarmed. We ought to be putting many more guns in the hands of our friends, and particularly in the northern and eastern sections of the State, for there the largest body of its most faithful friends is to be found. About the latter part of this month or first of July the ball will very probably open. You will have to move on Paducah and Columbus, in this State, and Memphis, in Tennessee, and if we now had the arms that were promised us we would have ready three times as large a movable force to aid you as we could now bring in the field. We will find our governor a declared and active rebel, and we would have ample numbers to drive him from the State.

The commanding general directs the following movements to take place on Saturday morning:
The First Brigade, Colonel Thomas commanding, will march by the Williamsport and Greencastle road, leaving Hagerstown to the left, and establish its camp near Williamsport, but far enough from the river to be free from the enemy’s shot. He will hold Williamsport and protect the ford by artillery.
The Fourth Brigade, Colonel Miles commanding, will follow the First Brigade, and locate its camp temporarily on stream in the rear and on the right of First Brigade.
The Third Brigade, Brigadier-General Williams commanding, will take the Hagerstown turnpike and the direct road to Sharpsburg, and establish its camp near head of stream. This brigade will throw a large picket towards Sharpsburg.
The Second Brigade, Brigadier-General Wynkoop commanding, will proceed by rail to Hagerstown and march on the Frederick turnpike to vicinity of Funkstown.
The Fifth Brigade, Brigadier-General Negley commanding, will move by rail as rapidly as possible, and be established on the Hagerstown and Williamsport turnpike.
The quartermaster will provide wagon transportation in Hagerstown for this and the preceding column.
Each brigade will post its guards and sentinels so as to secure a continuous line from camp to camp, and place its pickets far enough in advance and on the flanks to secure against surprise.
Each brigade will protect the adjoining one, and in case of attack go to its assistance.
The Fifth Brigade will, in addition to being the reserve, provide the guards for the store-houses, hospitals, &c., in the vicinity of Hagerstown.
In selecting camps, the commanding officers will have a regard for defense and drill and healthy locations.
General Gadwalader will see to the location of the camp of each brigade and administration of affairs.
General Keirn will see to the execution of orders in this vicinity, until the departure of his division, when he will join it in front of Hagerstown.
Immediately on arrival of a train in Hagerstown the regiments will be formed and marched through town and be located on its ground in line of battle, its pickets thrown out and guards established.
The men must be kept in camp ready at all times for instant action, and be drilled in the school of the company and regiment.

In pursuance of this authority no soldier will be permitted to leave his post or enter the city during this day without positive orders from the general in command, except those who are voters under the constitution and laws of Maryland, and whose rights as voters, as I understand, have been recognized in a communication addressed by you to my predecessor in command of this department.
I earnestly desire to co-operate with you in all measures that may tend to promote the peace of the city. The large police force, wisely controlled, I think, if impartial and vigilant, will have strength to suppress ordinary election tumults and preserve order. If they fail to do this, or if any considerable portion of the people of Baltimore avail themselves of the difficulties of the occasion to organize anarchy and overthrow all forms of government, the responsibility for the results, whatever they are, will fall upon them.

I will accept the exchange for Private Carter. The two citizens Whiting and Sively were taken with arms in their hands, one of which was discharged from the house of Whiting upon the column of our troops when all resistance was useless and when his attack was simply assassination, and when no offense had been committed against him.
The house from which the shot was fired and a building which formed a part of your outposts are the only conflagrations caused by the troops under my command, and the light of these had ceased hours before your men ventured out from under their earthworks and ditches to do us the courtesy of burying our dead, for which act you have my sincere thanks.
After our troops returned from the field—hours after—a building was burned which furnished our wounded some shelter, and from which we had removed them, but was not burned by our men.
For your kind treatment of any wounded you may have, please to accept my assurances of deep obligations, and with the certainty that at any and every opportunity such courtesy and kindness will be reciprocated.
I am sorry that an officer so distinguished in the service of the United States as yourself could for a moment suppose that the wanton destruction of private property could in any way be authorized or tolerated by the Federal Government and its officers, many of whom are your late associates. Even now, while y our letter is being answered, and this is on its way to you, a most ignominious and severe punishment, in the presence of all the troops near this post, is being inflicted upon men who have enlisted in the service of the United States—not soldiers—for plundering private property, which could not, by the strictest construction, be considered contraband of war or means of feeding or aiding the enemy. That which has been brought within my lines, or in any way has come into the hands of my troops and been discovered, with the strictest examination, has been taken account of, collected together, to be given up to those peaceable citizens who have come forward to make claim for it. A board of survey has been organized and has already reported indemnity for the property of peaceable citizens necessarily destroyed. In order to convince you that no wrong has been done to private property by any one in authority in the service of the United States, I do myself the honor to inclose a copy of general orders from this department,* which will sufficiently explain itself, and the most active measures have been taken to rigidly enforce it, and to punish violation's thereof. That there have been too many sporadic acts of wrong to private property committed by bad men under my command I admit and most sincerely regret, and believe they will in the future be substantially prevented, and I mean they shall be repaired in favor of all loyal citizens, so far as lies in my power.
You have done me the honor to inform me that the vedette Carter is not a prisoner taken in battle. That is quite true. He was asleep on his post, and informs me that his three companions left in such haste that they neglected to wake him up, and, they being mounted and my men on foot, the race was a difficult one. If it is hot the intention of your authorities to treat the citizens of Virginia, taken in actual conflict with the United States, as soldiers, in what light shall they be considered t Please inform me in what light you regard them. If not soldiers, must they not be assassins ?
A sergeant of Captain Davies’ command will be charged to meet your sergeant at 4 o’clock at the village of Hampton, for the purpose of the exchange of Private Carter.

I need not call your attention to the fact that there will be unauthorized acts of violence committed by those who are not sufficiently under the restraint of their commanding officers. My men complain that the ambulance having the wounded was fired into by your cavalry, and I am informed that if you have any prisoners they were taken while engaged in the pious duty to their wounded comrades, and not in battle. It has never occurred to my mind that either firing into the ambulance or capturing persons in charge of the wounded men was an act authorized, recognized, or sanctioned by any gentleman in command of the forces in Virginia. Before this unhappy strife I had not been so accustomed to regard the acts of my late associate citizens of the United States, and I have seen nothing in the course of this contest in the acts of those in authority to lead me to a different conclusion.

[Colonel Townsend :]
Dear Colonel: To morrow morning onr force will be in Hagerstown, located as indicated in the accompanying map. Every effort has been made to press forward, and the move to-morrow is a strained one. Every wagon we could get is engaged with the front column, except twelve employed here taking baggage to the trains. We could not hire teams here, and as far as I see here the people are just as willing to be employed by the foe as by us if it would be safe and would pay. Our one-horse railroad does not permit much work. By Sunday night I hope the main work will be over and the force in Hagerstown, and the track open to the trains coming in with supplies.
To-day many reports have come to us to the effect that the enemy is evacuating Harper’s Ferry. Persons sometimes circulate such to induce us to press on to the trap. Our own spies do not confirm them. Though I have been engaged night and day in the office, and have no intelligent assistants in a military point of view or cognizant of the workings of the staff, I have succeeded in inspecting the regiments here, and to so organize the brigades as to make them the most effective. In each are some riflemen, good marksmen, though the regiments are mainly armed with smooth bore muskets. Till I came here I could not get from any one of them the kind of arm in possession, nor the caliber, nor a solitary requisition for anything. I have had to order each individual article generally before I came here, and to push the articles forward. I have had to play ordnance officer, assistant adjutant-general, commander of the forces, inspector, quartermaster—everything. Now all branches have got to working well, except that part of the quartermaster’s department embraced in transportation. A kingdom for a few horses or mules would be my cry if I had a kingdom. I do wish our force to be the first to enter Harper’s Ferry, but rather than make a false step and lose by it or be checked, I shall be content to be last. Our force is an imposing one to all else outside the ring.
The heavy battery will probably be here on Sunday night or in Hagerstown. The Fourth Artillery battery has not yet arrived at Carlisle, though believed to be on the way. Harness not heard from or of. By the time that battery reaches Hagerstown we will be ready. Our force will be advanced immediately, and a position assumed which will permit the camps to be abandoned to a guard and the force move on. We will soon have a telegraph established to Hagerstown this way. The one through Frederick cannot be trusted. We will soon see other work.
Write to Stone to-night, telling him what we will do, and that at the proper time we wish him to move up, according to his judgment and information, either towards Frederick or Leesburg. You think us slow, but if you and the General were here you would think otherwise, and that we have accomplished much. The enemy have cut off all avenues of approach. The deserters give various accounts, and I believe in some cases they have been sent here to deceive. They gained no information.
I send you sketches of Berkeley County. Cannot get one of Jeff erson. The Maryland Heights were re-enforced on Wednesday by about 3,000 men; whether to coerce the Kentuckians or not, can’t say, or to cover a movement in rear. They have tried several times to induce us to cross and get whipped.

Commanding First Division, Greencastle7 Pa,:
General : The commanding general desires me to inform you that in operating against the forces which occupy and surround Harper’s Ferry his design is, in general terms, as follows:	.
First. To threaten an attack of the Maryland Heights.
Second. To turn the enemy by their left, through or near Martins-burg, with a strong column of mixed arms of service (cavalry mainly in reserve for critical moments, either to launch upon the enemy, to sustain our columns, or hasten the movements of a retreating enemy), cut their line of communication, and attack them in position.
Third. To sustain the advance column by a force strong enough to resist an effort to cut off* the advance, maintain the line of communication, and give the necessary aid to sustain the movement.
A reconnaissance of the enemy’s position may cause a change in this plan, but it is not likely to any material degree. The commanding general, therefore, desires you, while he is preparing his forces, to mature your plans for executing so much of the design as will fall to the lot of your division, that of taking the advance and breaking the enemy’s lines. The commanding general has every reason to believe that a determined stand will be made at Harper’s Ferry—a desperate struggle for supremacy; and so momentous are the interests of our country, involved in the undoubted success of our arms, that all plans must be matured with great prudence; the agents selected and so well disciplined as to render victory certain. While in position near Williamsport, the sustaining force being unprepared, the commanding general desires you to avoid bringing on a collision of any extent by entering Virginia, or attempting anything the success of which is doubtful. Many efforts will be made to induce you to cross the river, but heed them not or give them your careful consideration, and, whatever you undertake, move with great caution. When our forces cross the river he does not wish to withdraw, but to be able to sustain them and to advance. This, of course, is not designed to restrict you in regard to parties who may annoy you or be destroying property or the dams or cross the river into Maryland. They must be quickly met by an overpowering force.

My cavalry was never ahead of your column, whose retreat was so rapid as to cause many of your wounded to be left on the field, while others were carried off in the rear, instead of in the front of your column, as they ought to have been, and over bridges, which were immediately taken down to prevent pursuit.
You say the citizens, who defended their homes, must either be considered soldiers or assassins. They are neither, but brave men, defending their firesides against piratical invasion, and are entitled to the respect of all good men. Messrs. Whiting and Sively, whose certificate you have obtained while in duress, were captured before Whiting’s house was burned. I stated that they knew the depredations which had been committed on their neighbors. These depredations are acknowledged by you both in your order and in your letter to me. The last paragraph of your order, guaranteeing protection only to citizens at peace with the United States, that is, only to persons who think as you think, destroys whatever merit there may have been in the previous clauses. With respect to the vedette, Private Carter, I desire to inform you that when a picket of four is placed out for twenty-four hours, as in this case, at least one is permitted to sleep. This picket had orders to retreat before a large force of the enemy. Four men against five thousand constituted, however, such great odds, as to have justified the retreat of the picket even without orders. Had Private Carter been awake, perhaps a retreat would not have been necessary.
Eeciprocating the kind expressions contained in your letter, I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGEUDEE,
Colonel, Commanding.

General Cadwalader is ordered to exercise the greatest caution, feeling his way under careful reconnaissance under Captain Newton. Eeports from Captain Newton are that Harper’s Ferry is abandoned and destroyed. I believe it designed for a decoy.

Capt. John Newton,
Engineer Corps, en route to Williamsport :
Captain : In reply to your note of this elate, I have, by direction of the commanding general, hastily addressed a letter to General Cadwalader authorizing him to throw a force beyond Williamsport, and to send in advance towards Martinsburg parties to secure against surprise, provided the report you send that Harper's Ferry is vacated be true. He is advised to send you to reconnoiter carefully, and as you know the wishes of the commanding general and the momentous interests at stake, which would suffer even from a check, which would be construed into a victory, to take your advice into consideration and act upon it, knowing, as does the commanding general, that he can rely upon your judgment and prudence not to compromise our present position. You understand the condition of the Army and the impossibility of advancing far with any large portion of our force, and the danger of having a portion cut off. If the enemy has abandoned Harper’s Ferry, the commanding general wishes it occupied as soon as it can be done safely.
I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Maj. Gen. George Cadwalader,
Commanding First Division, en route to Williamsport:
General : The commanding general desires you to give Captain Newton the necessary aid to carefully reconnoiter the position of the enemy beyond Williamsport, to ascertain if he is really vacating the borders of the Potomac in your vicinity. If he has vacated, the commanding general wishes you to throw a portion, if not the whole, of your division over the river, and send parts well in advance to secure against surprise, and, if it can safely be done, to annoy their retreat. Captain Newton will advise you of the wishes of the commanding general, and his advice you are desired to take into careful consideration for the purpose of acting upon. If you find the enemy gone, the general wishes General Wynkoop placed as soon as possible near the river, on your line, and General Williams advanced towards Shepherdstown.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
F. J. PORTER, Assistant Adjutant-General.
P. S.—If Harper’s Ferry is abandoned, send a force there. Keep the general well advised by expresses. If it be possible, the general will be at Hagerstown to-night.

abandoned the right bank of the Potomac and cannot injure you in any possible manner, the commanding general desires you to detail towards Cumberland, as assistance, a section of artillery, a squadron of cavalry, and three regiments of infantry, using for the purpose the transportation of other regiments. No risk, however, must be run to endanger your own force, lest you be cut up in detail. The burning of Harper’s Ferry may be a decoy, and hence the general enjoins the utmost caution upon you and Captain Newton and every officer. Just at*this time, when a movement is made, the danger is the greatest. If you can hire a man to go to Cumberland and tell Colonel Wallace what you have decided to do, the general desires it.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Williamsport, Md., June 15, 1861. Maj. F. J. Porter, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Major: I wrote to you, directed to Chambersburg, in reply to your letter as to sending forward assistance to Cumberland. It is impossible for us to send the force you speak of for many reasons, as we are without sufficient transportation, and we shall have to send to-morrow evening or Monday morning to Hagerstown for subsistence. Moreover, in the absence of more reliable information in regard to Harper’s Ferry, and the country between this and Winchester, and hence to Martins-burg, the hazard would be too great, even if we were in condition to move. I have no doubt my letter will reach you at Hagerstown, although it was addressed to Chambersburg, as it was sent to Captain Holabird, at Hagerstown, to be forwarded to you, and he, no doubt, is aware of your intended arrival at Hagerstown, and will retain my little note, or memorandum, to hand to you. My present object is to repeat this, and, further, to add that I have taken measures to be possessed of information of a definite description as to Harper’s Ferry, and as to the neighborhood in our front on the opposite side of the river, including Martins-burg, to be reported to the commanding general to-morrow as early as possible at Hagerstown.
I will be happy to learn the views of the commanding general and to receive his instructions. I have also taken measures to have information from Winchester and from Cumberland as speedily as possible. It is said that the fire of about thirty rounds of artillery was distinctly heard this morning near Winchester; this, however, may be incorrect. In consequence of what has transpired Captain Newton does not send your message to Colonel Stone.

The sword bayonet and rifle cartridges is what I want, with a supply of percussion caps. General Morris has acted very strangely towards me. I would fight them in some of the mountain passes on the other side of the river if he had done the fair thing. It is useless to depend for help on him or General McClellan. I have positive information that there will be four thousand rebel troops at or in Eomney to-night, who swear they will follow me to hell but what they will have me.

If possible, assistance will go from Hagerstown, but I may be able only to hold my own for a few days, fearing to be cut up in detail. The destruction of Harper’s Ferry is a decoy, I fear. I have ordered him, if hard pressed, to come this way or to return towards Bedford. The force of enemy at Harper’s Ferry exceeds mine at Hagerstown. Do not know the kind of arms Wallace has.

Headquarters Department Annapolis,
Fort McHenry, June 16,1861. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War:
Sir : The election passed without disorder, but the fact is not a just indication of the spirit of the city. Active demonstrations on the part of secessionists can only be suppressed by constant readiness of our forces. We need greatly some assistance here.
1st. Authority to establish a home guard. There are many good Union men here, who are ready to enter the service, and we have arms for them, which have been taken from ill-disposed persons. They can be deposited at the custom-house under guard of our troops, so as to make secure their possession. This will give occupation to the Union men and confidence to the loyal portion of the city. I think it will be prudently and safely managed.
2d. We need a corps of cavalry to suppress the contraband trade on the back roads leading southward. We have not now a mounted orderly by whom to send a message even to the city. Some assistance of this kind is indispensable. The infantry can well command the railways. I have written to Mr. Secretary Chase to loan us the service of a revenue cutter for a brief period, by which we could control this trade upon the river and bay. To cut off the contraband is to deprive Baltimore of the support now given publicly to the secession spirit and strip the rebel army of its most useful supplies. I beg you to think of this subject, and give us prompt aid.
3d. Baltimore would afford most excellent camps of instruction for raw troops. They can be easily and cheaply supported here in healthy and convenient locations, well drilled and disciplined, and their presence would afford support to the Government against the rebel elements in the city. In a short time you could safely withdraw the best troops for service elsewhere, leaving the new levies in possession here.
With respect I submit these considerations to you, and remain your obliged and obedient servant,
NATH. P. BANKS, General, Commanding.

Have sent squadron of cavalry, section of artillery, and Rhode Island regiment towards Cumberland to sustain Colonel Wallace, threatened by a large force and demanding aid, and who may be forced to Hancock.

R. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Hagerstown, Md., June 16,1861. Col. E. D. Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. of the Army ;
Colonel : I have the honor to report, for the information of the General-in-Chief, my arrival last evening in this place.
From time to time I have notified you of the condition of the command to move, and my intention soon to advance to this place with a force which could maintain any position it might take. With our own transportation, aided by every wagon and team which could be hired contiguous to our camps, in Pennsylvania and in this place, I advanced yesterday (the earliest moment) General Cadwalader’s division, and sent the largest portion of General Keim’s by rail. The remainder, with the supplies, are now rapidly coming in. General Cadwalader encamped last evening near Williamsport; to-day, under my instructions, he will cross the river and occupy the bend to Falling Waters, and will be prepared to push on to Martinsburg, to which place he sends an exploring force. He will be sustained by Generals Wynkoop and Negiey, whose brigades are posted for the purpose.
Early yesterday morning I received simultaneously reliable information of the evacuation of Harper’s Ferry, and a threatened attack upon Colonel Wallace at Cumberland, with a call for aid, which General Morris, in rear, had refused. I directed Colonel Wallace to hire transportation, maintain a bold front to the last moment, and, if hard pressed, to move towards Hancock, in which direction horse, foot, and artillery would be sent, with orders to push on to him; or, at his discretion, to fall back upon Bedford, communicating the fact to the column on this side. With the spirit of a true soldier he has prudently determined to stand, and retire contesting the ground, unless he will have to sacrifice his men.
Confident the enemy had retired and was in rapid retreat from Harper’s Ferry, I ordered a force to be detached to Cumberland. Owing, as will be seen by the accompanying letters, to the want of the means of transportation and the fagged condition of the command, the march being long and the day oppressively hot, the command could not be put in motion.
Major Porter late at midnight visited General Cadwalader at Williamsport, and arranged to send to-day a section of artillery, a squadron of cavalry, and the Rhode Island regiment, Colonel Burnside—a gallant soldier and a gallant command—to support the noble Indiana regiment, similarly commanded. The transportation for that command exhausted all available wagons and checked, had I been able and it been prudent, further advance to push on a fleeing enemy. On the approach, suddenly on their rear of this well-organized force, and the steadily advancing column under Colonel Stone, the enemy appear to have hastily decided to evacuate the position they had openly declared should be held at all hazards. They have fled, and in confusion. Their retreat is as

693
demoralizing as a defeat; and as the leaders will never be caught, more beneficial to our cause. Harper’s Ferry has been retaken without firing a gun. The moral force of a just cause, sustained by a strong and equable Government, has conquered.
I am prevented from advancing rapidly by want of transportation. The interests of the Government are too momentous to risk a defeat or even a check, and hence I send out no inferior force. To-day and to-morrow about nine thousand men cross to Yirginia, there to await transportation, and to be sent forward in detachments well sustained. In the mean time I propose and submit for the consideration of the General-in-Chief—
First. To transfer to Harper’s Ferry my base of operations, depot, headquarters, &c.
Second. To open and maintain free communication east and west along the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad.
Third. To hold at Harper’s Ferry, Martinsburg, Charlestown, &c., a strong force, gradually and securely advancing as they are prepared, portions towards Winchester, Strasburg, &c.
Fourth. To re-enforce Cumberland and move south to Bomney, More-head [Moorefield], &c., and operate with the column in the third proposition towards Woodstock, and cut off communications with the west.
We will thus force the enemy to retire, and recover, without a struggle, a conquered country.
To carry out this plan time is required, and that, with a strong, firm hand, will restore peace and unity to our distracted country.
To effect what I propose requires the co-operation of General McClellan, and the force from him to be under my control at Cumberland, both to secure the road as far as Grafton and to advance to Bomney, &c.
With Harper’s Ferry in possession, Baltimore falls. Maryland will be a quiet spectator, awaiting the result of the campaign, with her interests developing a feeling in favor of a permanent Federal Government.
If this proposition be adopted I shall continue my present operations, which have been directed to this end, and shall, as soon as I am prepared, occupy Harper’s Ferry and Martinsburg; secure the railroad, &c., thence, and canal to Cumberland; use the railroad thence to Harrisburg, as accessory only.
In connection with this I respectfully request (presuming Baltimore to be so far peaceable that the safety of the railroad can be relied upon) permission to take from the Philadelphia and Baltimore Bailroad and the Northern Central road the regiments now guarding them. The latter I should at once transfer to the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad; the former to the line of operations.
If I am permitted to carry out this plan, the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad and the canal will be in operation in a week, and a free line of communication to Saint Louis established.
I shall continue to carry out these views until checked; but if my course be approved, I wish to be informed. I am advancing into another department, but so essential is it, that for the instant I do not consider the sanction of the General-in-Chief requisite.
The telegram of the General-in-Chief recalling regulars is at hand. My reply is the substance of this communication, with the request that the regulars be permitted to remain for the present. Until Harper’s Ferry is occupied and fortified I should fear the return of the rebels. This force is a good one, but the General-in-Chief has, by the regular

General-in-Chief for all the regulars with my column, and the Ehode Island regiment and battery, the force which the commanding general had ordered to you. It was too late to send another regiment, and transportation could not be obtained till some time after your telegram confirmed the suspicion of the ruse attempted. It is evident the design was to draw off force from here which would be most available for relief to the capital, now threatened by all the power of the enemy. Fortunately you did not require it, and it had not gone so far as to be out of reach. It is now on its way to Washington. Cartridges will not be here until to-morrow, nor caps. In the mean time transportation is being gathered, and as soon as practicable a regiment will be sent to you. I wish you to give me by telegram the caliber of your guns, whether .69, .58, or .54-inch.
No communication from you gives information of the supplies to be procured at your place. If provisions are required be pleased to inform Col. E. G. Beckwith, U. S. Army, at this place, by telegraph, that it may be sent by first wagon train.

Major: I have the most extraordinary rumors here within the last half hour. It is said by many persons here, the most reliable apparently that are around us, that General Johnston is this evening with a very large force at Martinsburg. It is said he has 15,000 men, and that he is marching upon this place at this time. Mr. Pendleton, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Lamon, and others assure me the information is reliable. The best troops have left here and I have no artillery to defend the ford. Something must be done at once. It will require all my efforts to collect the remnant of this demoralized command now scattered everywhere. I have no means of accounting for this unexpected movement. I hear nothing of Colonel Wallace, and it seems impossible to obtain any one to cross the river. It appears to me the troops should all return here. This information is confirmed by several parties, and no one is willing to cross the river. I am entirely unable to account for this movement, but there appears to be every reason to think it is true. Unless it is impossible I would advise that all the troops should be returned here and concentrated, or wherever we are to assume our strongest position. Colonel Burnside might be reached and the Wisconsin regiment should be sent for. I have not one moment to lose and have no one to rely upon but myself. I would like to have some officer or two upon whom I can rely. I do not think I can defend this ford without artillery. Send me word if the troops sent to-day are within your reach, and what you would wish me to do.
I am, very respectfully, yours,

From General Cadwalader’s report apprehensions existed of serious attack at Williamsport from force of fifteen thousand men. On that returned to him Colonel Miles, about to take rail, and Thomas marching by me, and telegraphed Doubleday to bring his artillery from Harrisburg, and protected Cadwalader with the whole command. His division had not then recrossed the Potomac. The command now are this side; one man shot. Captain Doubleday just arrived with battery and fitting it out. Miles ordered at once to join you. Eeliably informed that about fifteen thousand, exaggerated to thirty-five thousand, dotted from Mar-tinsburg to Winchester.

Hagerstown, Md., June 18,1861.
Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst Adjt. Gen. U. 8. Army, Washington City:
Colonel : Finding, on my arrival here on the 15th instant, the enemy still in the vicinity of Martinsburg, I directed, in order to be able to carry out the original plan approved by the General-in-Chief, General Cadwalader, strongly supported, to cross the river at Williamsport and establish himself within the bend opposite and intrench himself. This was executed before I received the call for the regular troops with this column. It had, I think, the happy effect of causing the troops threatening Cumberland to retire.
That night, on receipt of the order from the General-in-Chief and direction to u keep within your [my] present limits,’71 ordered the regular troops to be put in motion for Washington, and the volunteers brought back to this side, and in time for all to have returned by daylight. The execution of the order was deferred by the volunteers, and at night the inclosed report (No. 1)# was received from General Cadwalader. Presuming the enemy, who knows all our movements, had taken advantage of the withdrawal of the regulars to attack the remnant of two brigades, I at once turned Colonels Thomas and Miles, then here, to the support of General Cadwalader, and provided ample force to drive back any enemy in this vicinity. As soon as the force was on this side I detached the regular infantry, in compliance with the original order, for Washington. This fact I telegraphed to-day, and asked permission of the General-in-Chief to retain Thomas and Doubleday, the former too fagged to march, except under great necessity. The delay in returning that force to the General-in-Chief was at the time a necessity, and I feel confident he will pardon it.
The telegrams of the General-in-Chief indicate a desire for me not to advance beyond the Potomac. At present I cannot advance with any large force, as my means of transportation are so limited. I should be

forced to halt every two days to send for supplies. To remedy many inconveniences, and to reopen the line of communication, and to protect the channels of trade, I propose what I consider a military necessity— the rebuilding of Harper’s Ferry Bridge, protected by a force from this side, and the reoccupation of Harper’s Ferry. For this purpose, and to fortify the heights in its vicinity, I wish the artillery under Doubleday. I would approach from this side, and would not think of marching on the right bank to Harper’s Ferry, exposed as my line would be for twenty miles to be cut at several points by the enemy 5 if not, to advance upon Winchester from this point or from Harper’s Ferry. I recommend this course if for no other reason than to keep the volunteers employed and out of settlements. From Harper’s Ferry at any time a force can be sent to you and to operate upon Winchester. I will remind the General-in-Chief that with the exception of one regiment (Connecticut) all this force will be entitled to discharge at the expiration of their three months, and I believe all but one regiment (the Wisconsin, an excellent one) will claim it. That force in Harper’s Ferry, open to the rear and fortified towards Winchester, can maintain itself. The railroad and canal will be reopened, and the people on the line encouraged to defend them.
I respectfully present the above to the consideration of the General-in-Chief, submitting to his superior judgment whatever his decision may be.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. PATTERSON, Major-General, Commanding.
Hagerstown, Md., June 18,1861.
General Simon Cameron:
Dear Sir : We are all here deeply disappointed. This entire command on Sunday was in admirable condition. It had dragoons, artillery, a good body of volunteer infantry, good spirits, plenty of provisions, and needing nothing but transportation, and this was being rapidly supplied. A large portion of General Cadwalader’s division was across the river at Williamsport, and in two days would have been in a reasonably intrenched camp, occupying a bend on the Virginia side of the river, with a good ford well defended behind. The residue of this corps was within reach, and in a very short time would have occupied Sharpsburg, Maryland Heights, Harper’s Ferry, Martinsburg, and would have been in good condition to strike at Winchester, or, by a temporary bridge at Harper’s Ferry, to have advanced via Frederick or Leesburg to Washington. General Patterson had around him a corps of very superior Regular Army officers, and it was apparent that the proposed work of this corps was advancing with certainty and force. In this condition of affairs comes an order for Burnside’s regiment with all the artillery in this army, leaving General Patterson without a gun. Then comes an order for all the regular troops, leaving us without dragoons or any regular infantry to give confidence to volunteers; and, what is worse than all, the regular officers, including Colonels Thomas and Miles, heads of brigades, and upon whom much reliance was placed, were taken away. This compelled a return to this side of the river and an abandonment of all aggressive plans. We had then a rumor that Johnston was again appearing in great force at Martinsburg. This led to a delay of Miles’ and Thomas’ movements, but as all General Patter-

son’s force is now on this side, able to repel attack, the orders of General Scott will be at once obeyed.
See what a position this will leave these volunteers in! They are now keen for a fight. They must now stand on the defensive. Their time of enlistment will melt away, and they go home having done nothing, and little likely to enlist again. The demoralization of this column, of which so much was expected, will be generally injurious. Pray think whether it is not better either to leave it in strength to carry out the original plan, or to call it to Washington, via Frederick, to join in your general movements.
Eemember, I write to you freely as an outsider, without presuming to criticise plans, and without knowledge of your precise condition. If you are in actual danger in Washington, we ought to be with you to share in it, or have strength to make a diversion in your favor.
Very respectfully, yours,
JOHN SHEEMAN.
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, June 18, 1861—9.15 p. m. General Patterson, Hagerstown:
I had expected you to recall the regulars on the reappearance on the Potomac of Johnston with a formidable body of troops, and to keep the former until the importance of that movement could be ascertained. I await information from you on that point. Keep the siege guns and the Perkins light battery.

Headquarters First Division,
Williamsport, June 18,1861.
Maj. F. J. Porter,
Asst Adjt. Gen., Hdqrs. Dept of Pennsylvania:
Major : Seven regiments of my division and the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry remained on the other side of the river all night, notwithstanding my positive orders to withdraw to this side. The only way I can account for this is by the supposition that the order may not have been properly communicated to them by the commanders of brigades. I must inquire into this.
Finding when the troops left here last night for Hagerstown that those expected did not arrive, I used every effort to communicate with their commanding officers without success, I having no mounted men at my disposal. One of those, named Downs, at the suggestion of Ward H. Lamon, U. S. marshal, now with a regiment here, was sent a mile and a half from here on the other side of the river. Expecting from time to time that our troops would come over, and hearing no firing on the other side, as it became late we concluded not to send more troops over, but to remain in a state of readiness to cover their retreat or to defend this position in case of our being attacked. We had a force ready at the ford and a regiment advanced up the river westwardly all night. We intended at daylight to cross the river if occasion should require it. I am happy now to report the safety of our forces on the other side in Virginia, and that we are withdrawing them as speedily as

﻿704	OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. YA. [Chap. IX.
we can without loss or injury to property. The ford is about four feet deep at present, and there are many large stones or rocks that are in the way and render us liable to accidents in crossing.
I am now endeavoring to reach the truth in relation to whether or not there is really a large force of rebels near to us, as is universally asserted here. I shall make another attempt to bring here George W. Curtis, who is referred to in the note I send. It was stated he saw the force; that he was confident that there could not have been less than 14,000 men, and that General Johnston was with them. How any plans are to be formed without knowing the truth of this report appears to me to be impossible, and it may be intended that he is to be ubiquitous, and that he is at one time to threaten Washington by uniting with the forces there, and at another to appear here or in the West, keeping our forces moving around the outside of a circle, whilst he is moving across the center. It may be that our movement on Sunday to the other side of the river has invited him to take up a position at Martinsburg to follow our rear, his position being stated to be two miles southeast of that place. General Johnston knew, no doubt, the number of our wagons, and that we would not have been prepared to subsist our column without receiving supplies from the rear, which he would have been in a position to cut off.
You will observe from Colonel Wallace’s letter that he thinks the troops went westward after abandoning Harper’s Ferry. He speaks of their attacking General Morris. Our movement over the river may have drawn them back. I send you the order which I sent over the river last night by the man who was shot, and which they did not receive. It was brought back to me this morning. As soon as we can ascertain with certainty the position of Johnston and his troops we will be able to know what to do. Two messengers have just come in, confirming accounts of large forces near Martinsburg and Darkesville. Major Sherman is here. I will write again.

mand of course operates greatly against any regular system of instruction. I, however, endeavor to visit the several stations twice a week, and hope that the benefits of my instruction are not entirely lost. The company guarding the canal is divided into two equal parts, and its future efficiency thereby much disturbed. As I do not see the necessity of keeping it there, I respectfully suggest the propriety of placing it either at headquarters or at Elk ton. I would likewise offer, very respectfully, the same suggestion respecting the occupation of Northeast and Charlestown. The bridges at Northeast and Charlestown are all of stone, and could not be materially injured before word would reach Perryville or Elkton. I would therefore suggest that two companies be kept at Elkton, two at Perryville, and the rest at this place and below—say two at Bush River and two at Gunpowder. This last place seems to me much more exposed than any other, and as demanding greater protection. I await your orders in these respects. I beg leave to add further that I have not felt easy without some means of constant communication with the other shore of the Susquehanna, and that I have accordingly chartered the steamer Fairy for thirty dollars per day, she finding coal.
In conclusion, I beg leave to present to the general, as the wish of the officers and men of this command (myself included), that it should be called into more active service at an early day. I would also say that the officers and men of this command have received at all hands the well-merited encomiums of all here, and at all the stations, for their genial society and good conduct. 1 regard the material favorable for a first-rate regiment.

at Washington as to prevent my being supplied. I also desire to call bis attention to the fact that I have great need of mounted men for outpost service and vedettes. A company or two would be of great service. I have as yet received no horses for my light battery. I have the harness and guns, and could provide the men if I had the horses.

Lieut. Gen. Winfield Scott,
Commander-in-Chief\ U. 8. Army:
Sir : I send you inclosed a memorandum * of information obtained by me from two deserters from Sewell’s Point, who escaped this morning in a boat. They are both Northern men, apparently frank and honest, and they have been sent North by me. They belonged to the Macon (Ga.) Volunteers. The general will see that we have an experimental gun on Fort Calhoun, of 24-pounder bore, carrying a 53-pound elongated shot, of Sawyer’s patent, by which we are enabled to strike the enemy’s battery with a great degree of accuracy. I think Sawyer’s shell is a success, and I have directed at the ordnance workshop two 6-pounder cannon to be rifled and perhaps one 12-pounder for field purposes, and I have also ordered a competent supply of shell for the same. I hope to have these orders filled within a week. It is among the possibilities, and perhaps the probabilities, that a concentration of troops may be made at Yorktown via James River, and an advance movement upon this post ensue. While waiting for the transportation and the further troops that have been promised me, I have turned my attention, with the aid of the Engineer officers who reported to me four days since, to strengthening my positions outside the walls of the fortress. Newport News, perhaps, can hold out with the three thousand men there against the attack of five thousand or six thousand men, but we have not, as yet, any field artillery here. To defend ourselves outside the fort, we have but about three thousand effective men, and some of them not the best troops. May I ask again for Cook’s battery and the Massachusetts troops which were promised me I The enemy are apparently i>Teparing for an advance movement from Yorktown. By the concentration of the Yorktown and Norfolk troops, should they attack, I should be, to say the least, largely outnumbered.
There are plenty of regiments, especially the Second Volunteer Regi-

ment in Massachusetts, and Major Cobb’s light battery, ready, waiting, and anxious to join me here if an order were only given, and there are ample means of transportation for this.
The General-in-Chief is thus possessed substantially with all the information I have, and it is for his better judgment to deal with the exigency. I will do the best my limited knowledge and experience will permit with the material I have. Perhaps the General would advise a joint land and sea attack upon the battery on Sewell’s Point. If there are any such numbers as are claimed at Norfolk, it will be seen that it would be impossible to hold the battery if it were taken.

Protect as much as in your power, consistent with the safety of your command, the people in your vicinity, and wherever your guards may be sent be cautious not to be entrapped so far to the left that any portion may be cut off. Be cautious and be sure that you receive no check or reverse. The commanding general has sent Lieutenant Smith, of the Topographical Engineers, to select a proper ground, and to locate your command for defensive purposes. Colonel Owen will follow you as soon as practicable, and you are directed immediately on arrival to report your proximity to General Cadwalader, and ask him to keep open communication.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I received express from Wallace stating lie bad at 1 p. m. yesterday started his baggage for Bedford, and was waiting to see and feel the enemy. JSo aid could be sent from here to do him any good. It was exposed to be cut by the enemy at many points. He was told if hard pressed at any time to fall back on Bedford, a-friendly county, where every one would turn out to aid a gallant band. Until last night at 12 o’clock I had no idea of danger to him, he having reported the day before that no enemy was near him or at Romney. If you receive information leading you to believe Wallace has retired on Bedford, and you can give him aid, please act upon your own good judgment.

Dear Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and regret to learn that any embarrassment to the successful movement of the forces under command of Major-General Patterson occurred in consequence of orders issued from here by the General-in-Chief.
It has been my aim and purpose to furnish General Patterson all the force and aid to enable him to accomplish a gloriously successful result, and to that end I ordered as many troops arriving at Harrisburg to follow in his train as I could, until the apparent change of circumstances at Harper’s Ferry and its neighborhood seemed to make it apparent that it was more important to increase our force here than there. It may be true that if the General-in-Chief had been on the spot and understood the condition of things there as they are now stated by you to have existed at the date of the order issued by him for the return of Burnside’s artillery to this place, he would not have issued it. Of that, of course, I cannot undertake to speak, and do not mean even to express an opinion. Certain it is, however, that this Department, and, indeed, the whole administration, has but one safe course before it in this emergency, and that is to be guided by the counsels of the General-

Colonel : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the telegram of the# General-in-Chief calling for a plan of operations with a portion of my force to sweep the enemy from Leesburg, &c. Inclosed is a copy of my telegraphic reply. The following is my plan more in detail:
To carry out the views of the General-in-Chief I propose—
First. To occupy the Maryland Heights with a brigade (2,100 men); fortify and arm with Doubleday’s artillery, and provision for twenty days, to secure against investment.
Second. To move all supplies to Frederick, and immediately thereafter abandon this line of operations; threaten with a force to open a route through Harper’s Ferry, this force to be the sustaining one for the command on Maryland Heights.
Third. To send everything else available (horse, foot, and artillery) to cross the Potomac near Point of Bocks, and unite with Colonel Stone at Leesburg. From that point I can operate as circumstances shall demand and your orders require. If no blow is to be struck here, I think this change of position important to keep alive the ardor of our men as well as to force an enemy.
The reasons for this change of depot will be so apparent to the General-in-Chief that I need not refer to them. By the employment of the local transportation of the country I can soon make the necessary changes, and will hasten to carry out your orders.
I have many reports in regard to the movements of the force opposite us in Virginia, and have reason to believe that when the regulars were withdrawn, General Johnston, with thirteen thousand men and twenty-two pieces of artillery, was marching to the attack, and that night posted his force, expecting from us an attack the following morning. I regret we did not meet the enemy, so confident am I that, with this well-appointed force, the result would have been favorable to us, and that this portion of Virginia would now be peaceably occupied.

The telegram of the General-in-Chief of yesterday was received at midnight. To carry out proposed plan I think involves a change of depot to Frederick and evacuation of Williamsport and Hagerstown. With an enemy close at hand, a move suddenly, with present amount of transportation, necessitates sending a large mass of stores back to Harrisburg or their abandonment.
Maryland Heights can be secured, and Frederick also, and a strong force of infantry, some cavalry, and artillery sent via Frederick to Leesburg to sweep the enemy from that point to Alexandria. If no blow is to be struck here, and this meets the views of the General-in-Chief, I will at once commence moving, and be in position to act at the earliest practicable moment. I send a regiment to-day to Frederick at the urgent solicitation of the governor. I shall write in full by mail. Reconnaissance of heights being made.

Sir : Reliable information has been received at this department, from various parts of this State, that large numbers of evil-minded persons have banded together in military organizations with intent to overthrow the government of the State, and for that purpose have called to their aid like-minded persons from other States, who, in pursuance of such call, have invaded this commonwealth. They are now making war on the loyal people of the State. They are pressing citizens against their consent into their military organizations, and seizing and appropriating their property to aid in the rebellion.
I have not at my command sufficient military force to suppress this rebellion and violence. The legislature cannot be convened in time to act in the premises. It therefore becomes my duty, as governor of this commonwealth, to call on the Government of the United States for aid to suppress such rebellion and violence. I therefore earnestly request that you will furnish a military force to aid in suppressing the rebellion and to protect the good people of this commonwealth from domestic violence.

Since I have been in my present position I have used every possible means to connect it with our present line of operations, and also with the probable movements of the enemy, and I am satisfied that to abandon it would be the greatest mistake we could commit, and for the fob lowing reasons:

## p. 714 (#730) ############################################

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA.
[Chap. IX.
1.	It is so situated as to give you the best possible position to observe the enemy and to obtain the very earliest possible information as to any movement he can make towards Washington.
2.	It is the strongest and most defensible military position, except that about Shooter’s Hill, that I have seen between Washington and four miles of Fairfax Court-House, and is so situated that it must be attacked and carried before it would be safe for any enemy to make any forward movement on Ball’s Cross-Roads or Bailey’s Cross-Roads, as a movement on Bailey’s Cross-Roads would expose the enemy to a flank attack from the troops situated at Falls Church and a movement on Ball’s Cross-Roads to a rear attack, and neither of these crossings is more than two and a half miles from Falls Church.
3.	As the enemy’s pickets before our arrival here were in possession of the ground in our front, I am satisfied the moment we leave the position it will be occupied, and, in connection with the possession of Vienna, will give him the possession of a line that it will cost us thousands of men to drive him from it, and we shall have to do it if he is strong enough to sustain an advance.
4.	A retrograde, if followed by the occupation of the Falls Church position, as it will be, will enable the enemy to control the entire valley of the Four Mile Run, from Vienna to within two miles of Roach’s Mills, and if they have twenty thousand men, everything else being equal, fifty thousand men cannot drive them out.
5.	A retrograde movement (I will not consider its effects on the country) will have a most injurious effect on the Union men in this vicinity (and they are in considerable numbers), and thus must necessarily leave with us or be killed.
The above, general, are only some of the reasons that present themselves to my mind in opposition to a retrograde movement, which I think can be prevented and our position here perfectly secured by posting three regiments at Ball’s Cross-Roads and as many at Bailey’s Cross-Roads, which will bring the whole front from Georgetown, Falls Church, and Alexandria within short supporting positions. With a single battery of light artillery and a couple of hundred of cavalry, with two Connecticut and the two Ohio regiments, I can hold our position at Falls Church for two hours against ten thousand men, counting time from the moment our pickets will notify us of the approach of the enemy, and that will give us time to be supported from Ball’s and Bailey’s Cross-Roads and the New Jersey regiments at Roach’s Mills, leaving the troops at Alexandria and those in the vicinity of Arlington, Georgetown, and Washington near enough to sustain us in case we should be overmatched, which I do not think we should be. At all events, we would give time enough for these troops to come to our relief.
Before a retrograde movement is made I would like to canvass this matter with yourself and General Scott. Since I came here my mind has been constantly occupied with the subject of my position here, and I think I understand as well as any engineer officer or officers who may come out here and pass half an hour examining it and then return to Washington with a report. I know that these things must be, but 1 must confess that I felt mortified that two gentlemen of the Engineers should come into my camp under instructions, as I now find, to examine and pass upon the most important military positions in our whole line, which had been selected by me, and not have the courtesy to invite my attendance or call my attention to the fact that they were on any official duty.

Sir : I have the honor to report that the regiment under my command, in pursuance to orders from headquarters of the U. S. Army, departed from Washington on Monday, June 10, for the purpose of joining the column of Major-General Patterson, then moving from Chambersburg upon Harper’s Ferry. The battery of artillery attached to the command, with the baggage, preceded the main body of the regiment twelve hours.
Early upon Monday morning we left camp, and, marching to the station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, entered the cars prepared for our transportation, and were carried to Baltimore. The command was composed of 1,128 men and 117 officers, accompanied by a long wagon train. The passage through Baltimore was peacefully made, and, taking the cars of the Northern Central Railroad, the entire regiment reached Chambersburg, Pa., on the morning of Tuesday, June 11, when I immediately reported to Major-General Patterson for duty. Still proceeding by rail, we reached Greencastle at noon, and encamped. The command remained in camp at Greencastle until Saturday morning, when, in conjunction with the First Brigade of Major-General Patterson’s column, under command of Colonel Thomas, the line of march was taken up for Williamsport, Md. That place was reached at noon, and occupied by the force of which this regiment formed a part.
On Sunday a portion of the battery of artillery was ordered across the Potomac to Falling Waters; but, in accordance with orders from Major-General Patterson, it was recalled on Monday, and the regiment, once more complete, commenced its march at an early hour for Frederick City. The route lay through Hagerstown, Boonsborough, and Middletown, and in these places the command was received with enthusiastic demonstrations of favor. The march continued through the entire day and a part of the following night, with an interval of three hours for rest at Boonsborough.
At 12.30 a. m. on Tuesday the regiment bivouacked in the immediate vicinity of Frederick, having accomplished a march of thirty-three miles.

At 7 p. m. we left Frederick by rail and proceeded to Washington, arriving at 6 o’clock on Wednesday morning, June 19. It gives me pleasure to assure the General-in-Chief of the gratification which I feel at the bearing and conduct of the command during this expedition. The fatigues of the way were endured with fortitude, and had any danger threatened I have no doubt that it would have been bravely met. As it is, I cannot avoid the expression of my satisfaction that the object of the expedition in which this regiment participated was attained in safety and without the loss of life.

Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th, and have given it due consideration. The experience of the Department of the operations of home-guard organizations in communities similar to that of Baltimore has been such as to lead to great doubts as to the propriety of them. The subject is, however, under consideration, and shall be fully examined before an adverse determination is arrived at.
In view of the necessity of having cavalry at your command, the forces organized by Colonel Chorman have been accepted with the design of co operating with the Maryland regiment, and they will be at once ordered to be mustered into service if ready. Your views in regard to making Baltimore the place for the instruction of our new levies impress me favorably.

Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen. U. 8. Army, Washington City:
Colonel : Up to the present instant I have received from Capt. J. Newton, Engineer Corps, only a report of a part of his reconnaissance of the Maryland Heights and the ground adjacent, made in compliance with the injunctions of the General-in-Chief. I hasten to give the result thus far, expecting to-morrow evening to present the whole.
Captain Newton approached the heights from this side, ascending over rough and steep roads difficult for artillery. The summit he found capable of defense of ample character by about five hundred men. The main difficulty to be overcome is the supply of water; the springs, which a week since afforded an ample supply, have become dry. He found no water within half a mile of the position selected on the heights for an intrenched camp. In Pleasant Valley, on the east, near the base of the mountain, springs are reported to abound; their character will be ascertained to-morrow. Water would have to be hauled from this valley, and he reports the ascent very difficult. In this valley I propose to place the force sustaining that on the heights. The whole command, if the location prove favorable, need not exceed two thousand five hundred men. That force would render the position safe; anything less would invite attack.
The following is what I have to report in relation to the enemy: Deserters from their ranks, some one or more of whom come in daily, all agree in saying the whole of the force originally at Harper’s Ferry (said to have been 25,000 men) is still between Williamsport and Winchester, about 8,000 coming this way on Friday at Martinsburg. The remainder are distributed in a semicircle, and on the route to Winchester, within four hours’ march of the advance. The advance is approaching Falling Waters under the command of General Jackson, who now commands the whole. The force under Jackson controls the people of Berkeley County, whom I believe are sorely oppressed and would welcome our approach. That force has become some little encouraged from our not advancing, and may soon annoy us. If so, I shall not avoid the contest they may invite—indeed, if it meet the approval of the General-in-Chief, I would march my whole force, as soon as the battery receives harness, upon the enemy, and drive him step by step to Winchester. I believe this force can in ten days rid the adjoining portion of Virginia of its oppressors. I may be forced to this course. My fear is that I may interfere with the general plan of the General-in-Chief and drive the enemy to the aid of the main body. They would, however, go as fugitives, to aid in its demoralization. My means of transportation are coming in rapidly.

Hdqrs. Department Northeastern Virginia,
Arlington, June 24, 1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters Army :
Colonel : I have the honor to submit the following, in answer to your letter of June 21, in reference to a column to cb-operate from this position with a movement to be made with a portion of Major-General Patterson’s command u to sweep the enemy from Leesburg towards Alexandria.” For a better understanding of what follows, I have the honor to transmit a map, which I have had prepared, showing the position of our troops and of that of the enemy in front of it. There is at Manassas Junction and the places in its front or immediate vicinity a force of from 23,000 to 25,000 infantry and about 2,000 cavalry and a supply of well-provided artillery. The advanced position of this force is at Centreville, Germantown, Fairfax Court-House, and Fairfax Station, the numbers and proportion at each varying from time to time. How much of a force is beyond Manassas Gap, in the valley, and could be brought within the operations here contemplated, I have no means of judging. There is nothing to hinder their coming, and unless they are kept engaged by our troops around Harper’s Ferry, re-enforcements, in case of serious operations from that section would have to be guarded against,, as would also those from places to the south of Manassas, on the line of the railroad to Eichmond or Lynchburg, which would be pressed forward whenever it should become known we were moving upon them or they upon us in any force.
I have not learned that the troops in our front are fully provided with transportation, though I am satisfied they are not so deficient*as we have supposed, and not as much so as we are at this time ourselves, for the Quartermaster-General, after supplying yesterday transportation for two regiments to move each about six miles, had but three horses left.
We have in this department, good, bad, and indifferent, twenty regiments of infantry, giving an aggregate of less than 14,000; four companies of cavalry, giving about 250; one battery of regular artillery of six rifled guns; one battery of volunteer artillery, smooth-bores—an excellent company, but not accustomed to their guns, and hardly fit for service in the field. There are three companies of regular artillery, but they are in the earthworks, and not available for field service. The General-in-Chief was pleased to say he wished I would fight this project of a combined movement to sweep away the enemy from Leesburg towards Alexandria with him step by step. I take advantage of this permission, if, indeed, I do not obey a command, to say that it seems to me the distance between General Patterson’s force and this one is so great, and the line of march each has to take is such (a flank exposed), that, in my view, the force to move from each position should be constituted without reference to material support from the other. I am thought by those for whose judgment I have great respect, and who have been on the ground, to hazard something in having my advanced position so near Falls Church, when it is thrown forward from the right of the line, Fort Corcoran, and there are means of re-enforcing it promptly by the Georgetown turnpike and the railroad to Alexandria.
What would be our position if a movement is made to the right, at this the right bank of the Potomac, towards Leesburg f In the first place, as we are for any such purpose without means of wagon transportation, we should be obliged to repair and use the railroad; but whether this was done or not, we should march with the left flank of

CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—UNION.
the column exposed to attack from their advanced positions, and on getting as far to the right as Vienna, have our line exposed to interruption, for Vienna is nearer to the enemy than it is to Falls Church or the camps on the Georgetown road.
To go farther to the right could not safely be done, even by a force superior to that the enemy can bring against us. I thinkfa glance at the map will show this. Any reverse happening to this raw force, pushed farther along, with the enemy on the flank and rear and an impassable river on the right, would be fatal. I do not think, therefore, it safe to risk anything from this position in the direction of Leesburg farther than Vienna, seven miles by the Leesburg turnpike from Falls Church, and even to go there the force should be large. Vienna could be supplied or re-enforced—
1st. By the Leesburg road from Falls Church.
2d. By the railroad from Alexandria.
3d. By the dirt road from BalPs Cross-Boads.
The first two are liable to interruption unless strongly guarded, and the third is an indifferent road and a long one. The force, then, to go as far as Vienna should be large enough to hold the position for several hours, and should be well supplied with artillery and cavalry and strengthened by such defenses as could be readily thrown up. Vienna being held in force, and offensively, would cover the country from the Difficult Creek well towards Goose Creek from any force of the enemy operating from Manassas Junction or its dependencies, and I have never heard of there being over 500 men, mostly local troops, at Leesburg. As it would be constantly liable to be attacked by all the available force of the enemy and is only a few hours7 march from him, it would be necessary to have strong reserves ready at either Falls Church or the camp of the Ohio brigade.
The force sufficient to hold Vienna cannot well be stated, because of the changes which are taking place in front of us. I do not think it prudent to go there with less than 8,000 infantry, a battery of field regular rifled artillery, with some guns in position, and six companies of cavalry, and the line from Fort Corcoran to General Tyler to be held as strong as at present, and a reserve on that line of 3,000 men $ some of the force to be organized into small field brigades, as heretofore proposed, under regular colonels.

[Chap. IX.
We cannot count on keeping secret our intention to overthrow this force. Even if the many parties intrusted with the knowledge of the plan should not disclose or discover it, the necessary preliminary measures for such an expedition would betray it; and they are alive and well informed as to every movement, however slight, we make. They have, moreover, been expecting us to attack their position, and have been preparing for it. When it becomes known positively we are about to march, and they learn in what strength, they will be obliged to call in their disposable forces from all quarters, for they will not be able, if closely pressed, to get away by railroad before we can reach them. If General J. E. Johnston’s force is kept engaged by Major-General Patterson, and Major-General Butler occupies the force now in his vicinity, I think they will not be able to bring up more than ten thousand men. So we must calculate on having to do with about thirty-five thousand men.
The objective point in our plan is the Manassas Junction. This is covered by the enemy’s troops stationed at Centreville, Germantown, Fairfax Court-House, Fairfax Station, a place between Fairfax Station and Sangster’s, and on the Occoquan. The position at Manassas may be reached by four routes : First, by the Leesburg stone road, Georgetown turnpike, and Loudoun and Hampshire Bailroad, via Falls Church and Vienna; second, by way of the Little Biver turnpike and Fairfax Court-House; third, by way of the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad; fourth, by way of the road south of the Orange and Alexandria road.
There is a fifth approach, from Dumfries or Evansport, by way of Brentsville, a march of about twenty-two miles, but the starting point is too far from the main direct approach to admit of its being used in the first instance without a superabundance of force. The country lying between the two armies is mostly thickly wooded, and the roads leading across it, except the turnpikes and railroads, are narrow, and in places sunken by the wear of travel and wash of rains. This makes it necessary to have the fewest possible number of carriages of any kind, and our forces, therefore, though the distance is short, will have to move over several lines of approach in order to get forward in time a sufficient body to operate with success. The Loudoun and Hampshire road is in working order as far as within five miles of Vienna, and no doubt could soon be repaired to that place. The Orange and Alexandria road, which I propose to look to as the main channel of supply, is now in working order some seven miles out of Alexandria, and from Manassas Junction to within fifteen miles of Alexandria. In the intermediate space the road has been destroyed as effectively as possible, and a long deep cut filled in wTith trees and earth. Nevertheless, all these obstacles can soon be removed with plenty of force and an adequate supply of proper materials.
Leaving small garrisons in the defensive works, I propose to move against Manassas with a force of thirty thousand of all arms, organized into three columns, with a reserve of ten thousand. One column to move from Falls Church or Vienna (preferably the latter), to go between Fairfax Court-House and Centreville, and, in connection with another column moving by the Little Biver turnpike, cut off or drive in (the former, if possible) the enemy’s advanced posts. The third column to move by the Orange and Alexandria Bailroad, and leaving as large a force as may be necessary to aid in rebuilding it, to push on with the remainder to join the first and second columns.
The enemy is said to have batteries in position at several places in his front, and defensive works on Bull Bun and Manassas Junction. I

do not propose that these batteries be attacked, for I think they may all be turned. Bull Bun, I am told, is fordable at almost any place. After uniting the columns this side of it, I propose to attack the main position by turning it, if possible, so as to cut off communications by rail with the South, or threaten to do so sufficiently to force the enemy to leave his intrenchments to guard them; if necessary, and I find it can be done with safety, to move a force as far as Bristoe, to destroy the bridge at that place.
I cannot learn that the enemy has any magazines at the Junction, and I am under the impression he receives his supplies, except fresh beef, from the south by the railroad. I am told that on most of the approaches abatis have been made and other preparations to obstruct the advance of our troops, and, as the roads are mostly through woods, and are narrow, it will be necessary the Army should go, in the first place, as free from baggage as x>ossible—no tents; provisions only in the haversack ; the only wagons being those necessary for carrying axes, spades, and picks, and ammunition for the infantry, and ambulances for the sick and wounded. A subsistence train should be ready in Alexandria to go by the Little Biver turnpike in case the Orange and Alexandria road cannot be repaired, and another should be ready at Vienna, under the guard to be left there, for the use of the column moving from that point, in case it should fail to reach in time the Orange and Alexandria road or the Little Biver turnpike, or the latter should not in time be cleared of the enemy.
Believing the chances are greatly in fa vor of the enemy’s accepting battle between this and the Junction, and that the consequences of that battle will be of the greatest importance to the country, as establishing the prestige in this contest on the one side or the other—the more so as the two sections will be fairly represented by regiments from almost every State—I think it of great consequence that, as for the most part our regiments are exceedingly raw and the best of them, with few exceptions, not over steady in line, they be organized into as many small fixed brigades as the number of regular colonels will admit, these colonels commanding brigades to be assisted by as many regular officers as can be collected for the purpose, so that the men may have as fair a chance as the nature of things and the comparative inexperience of most will allow.
If the three companies of artillery in this department are furnished with batteries, we shall have with the three regular and three volunteer batteries here and in Washington a sufficiency of artillery; though, if the nature of the country did not make it embarrassing, I would, on account of the confidence it gives new troops, have still more. Fortunately, the country is so wooded that, our deficiency in cavalry will be the less felt. We shall need all we have for the ordinary work of escorts, advance pickets, &c. I think every arrangement should be made, that when the columns take up their line of march no step be taken in retreat, but that they should press forward to the ultimate point steadily and determinedly. If they are well led I think they will do so, and with every chance of success.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
IBVI1N MCDOWELL, Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Hdqrs. Department Northeastern Virginia,
Arlington, June 25, 1861.
Lieut. Col. E. D. Townsend,
Asst. Adjt. Gen., Headquarters of Army:
Statement of Mr. J-----u, a man on whom I rely:
Arrived at Fairfax Court-House Thursday, 20th instant; found there Prince William company and the Bappahannock—about sixty-five in each company. Friday morning these companies went to Fairfax Station, leaving nobody in the town. Friday night the South Carolina regiments began to come, and Saturday night it was said there were three regiments at the Court-House and another coming; saw the three himself—amounting to about 3,000 men. Started for the Junction about 8.30; went by Germantown and Centreville. At Germantown saw Gregg’s South Carolina regiment—about 1,000. The road between Fairfax and Centreville much obstructed about one mile before you get to the Bald Hill, where there are five cannon planted.
At Centreville, Bonham, of South Carolina, was in command. He had other troops besides his own regiment and the artillery. At Bull Bun there was an entrenchment on the right bank—four guns. Two regiments of South Carolinians stationed there; they had been there but a short time. Bull Bun Crossing is five miles from Centreville and two from Manassas Junction. Arrived at Manassas Junction at 10 o’clock a. m.; saw General Beauregard; staid until 3 p. m.; returned the s^me way he went. On reaching Bull Bull, found the South Carolina regiments had struck their tents, had their wagons packed, and were moving in the direction of Centreville and Fairfax Court-House, taking their four cannon with them, occupying the road for about two miles. Had a difficulty in passing the column. The colonel asked if he had a pass; showed him one from General Beauregard; was then allowed to pass. He was cautioned by the colonel not to speak of movements of troops even to their own men. These regiments did not come to the Court-House. At Centreville things were not as they were when he went through first. At Germantown found Gregg’s regiment had broken up it's camp and moved to the Court-House, and was encamped near the Little Biver turnpike, about one-quarter mile from the Court-House. Learned that Gregg’s place at Germantown had been supplied by another regiment or regiments, and supposes it may have been by those he passed at Bull Bun and those which were on the march to the front.
At Fairfax Station there were about 800 men—Virginians. The South Carolina regiments were all (except one—Spratt’s) about 1,000 men each. Forty of Gregg’s regiment had the measles. The two regiments on the march from Bull Bun had about fifty wagons for their baggage and supplies, old road and farmers’ wagons, five to six horses each. Wagons well crammed up to the bows. The South Carolina regiments were the best armed and equipped and in high spirits, u freezing for a fight,” being much elated by the Vienna affair. Negroes with them as servants. Cavalry, estimated, all told, 1,500; 500 Louisianians and 1,000 Virginians; mounted so-so as to Virginians; those from Louisiana good. Virginia cavalry armed irregularly with double-barreled shot-guns, pistols, fowling-pieces, some carbines, and sabers. Horse furniture indifferent, made up of odds and ends. Louisiana cavalry better in all respects—men, horses, arms, and equipments. The total at the Junction and the places this side he estimated at 20,000, all told.

There are twenty Kentucky well-mounted guerrillas. Five of them took the Connecticut man prisoner. The Connecticut man seemed well pleased with being a prisoner. Subsistence, chiefly ship biscuit and fresh beef. Crops—wheat very fine 5 grass, corn, and oats indifferent. They seemed to be expecting an attack from us. Saw no guns at Germantown. Saw five guns harnessed at Court-House. Saw five guns at Centreville. Saw four guns at Bull Bun.

Hon. John S. Carlile, Wheeling, Ya.:
Sir : As the President has now been appealed to by his excellency Governor Peirpoint to aid in repelling the Southern marauders and their confederates from Virginia, you are requested to take your instructions from him in organizing forces in Virginia for that purpose, and the company and field officers of the troops now or hereafter to be organized will be commissioned by him.
Allow me to tender you my sincere thanks for the patriotism, intrepidity, and intelligence which have characterized your intercourse with this Department in the trying times during which you have aided its efforts.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SIMON CAMEBON,
Secretary of War.
Washington, June 25,1861.
Hon. Francis H. Peirpoint,
Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Wheeling:
Sir : In reply to your application of the 21st instant for the aid ot the Federal Government to repel from Virginia the lawless invaders now perpetrating every species of outrage upon persons and property throughout a large.portion of the State, the President directs me to say that a large additional force will soon be sent to your relief. The full extent of the conspiracy against popular rights which has culminated in the atrocities to which you refer was not known when its first outbreak took place at Charleston. It now appears that it was matured for many years by secret organizations throughout the country, especially in the slave States. By this means, when the President called upon Virginia in April for its quota of troops, then deemed necessary to put it down in the States in which it had shown itself in arms, the call was responded to by an order from the chief confederate in Virginia to his armed followers to seize the navy-yard at Gosport, and the authorities of the State, who had till then shown repugnance to the plot, found themselves stripped of all actual power, and afterwards were manifestly permitted to retain the empty forms of office only because they consented to use them at the bidding of the invaders.
The President, however, never supposed that a brave and free people, though surprised and unarmed, could long be subjugated by a class of political adventurers always adverse to them, and the fact that they have already rallied, reorganized their government, and checked the march of these invaders demonstrates how justly he appreciated them.

The failure hitherto of the State authorities, in consequence of the circumstances to which I have adverted, to organize its quota of troops called for by the President, imposed upon him the necessity of providing himself for their organization, and this has been done to some extent; but instructions have now been given to the agent of the Federal Government to proceed hereafter under your directions, and the company and field officers will be commissioned by you.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Washington, June 25,1861.
Maj. Gen. NT. P. Banks, U. S. A.,
Commanding Department of Annapolis, Fort McHenry, Md.:
Sir : The General-in-Chief has heard that on several occasions, when troops have arrived in Baltimore from the North, the police and others have interfered to prevent friendly persons from furnishing them with water at the depot. Two worthy Quakers, named William Bobinson and James D. Graham, have, it seems, been threatened with violence for no other cause than this. The General asks your attention to this matter, and suggests that by having a detachment of your troops at the depot at the proper time the regiments arriving might be duly supplied with water.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Hagerstown,, Md.j June 25,1861.
His Excellency A. G. Curtin,
Governor of Pennsylvania, Harrisburg, Pa.:
Governor : As in the course of the military operations of the command now in this department this force may be withdrawn from this vicinity and that of Frederick and Cumberland, leaving the frontier of Pennsylvania unprotected, I consider it my duty to notify you, that you may take such steps as may appear to you proper to be prepared to defend your State from encroachment should the offensive be assumed by the insurgents. As you now have a considerable force of reserve troops, which at any moment the General Government might wish to use for common defense, I trust you will pardon me for suggesting that they be posted at points on the frontier of Pennsylvania which to my mind are the most exposed, and from which at any moment, if the Government desired their services, they could be pushed as Federal troops into this State, or sent by rail to other threatened parts of our country. The places of importance in a military point of view are Bedford, Cham-bersburg, Hanover or Gettysburg, and York. State troops at these points would sustain IT. S. forces in Maryland, and check, in case of their being withdrawn, encroachments from Virginia. York has the additional advantage of supporting Hanover, and of being on an easy line of communication with Washington. At all of them a Federal officer, authorized by the Government, can speedily turn the State into Federal troops, and throw them where they may be required.

Major-General Patterson :
Sir : I have received your letters of the 22d and 23d instant.
As the enemy on breaking up at Harper’s Ferry did not abandon that district of country, but still continues in force between Winchester and the Potomac, observing that river from Harper’s Ferry to Williamsport, I deem it best that you should with your column remain in his front, and if, as is supposed, with superior or equal numbers, that you should cross the river and offer him battle; but if the enemy should retire upon his resources at Winchester it is not enjoined that you should pursue him to that distance from your base of operations without a well-grounded confidence in your continued superiority.
A secondary object to which your attention is invited is a combined operation upon Leesburg between a portion of your troops and the column of Colonel Stone, at and (possibly) above the Point of Rocks, in order to occupy and to hold that village, the center of a wealthy district, abounding in friends of the Union. As I write I learn from Colonel Stone that the enemy has just re-enforced Leesburg up to about 1,600 men, and may increase that number. Inquire.

WINFIELD SCOTT.
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Hagerstown, Md., June 27,1861.
Maj. Gen. George Cadwalader,
Commanding, Williamsport, Md.:
General : The commanding-general desires information of the location of the enemy on the opposite side of the river. To aid in obtaining it he sends Captain Simpson to you, and for the same purpose authorizes you to retain Captain Newton. This information is to determine the importance of crossing the river and offering battle or the possibility of cutting off any considerable body of their army. He purposes, with a part or all of his available force, to cross the river east of Falling Waters and to rout such portions of the enemy as may be near the point of crossing; to attack the force stationed near the junction of the Shep-herdstown road with that from Williamsport to Martin sburg; to turn upon the enemy stationed on the Neck, and recross at the ford near Williamsport. Though wishing specially the character and number of the, fords east of Williamsport, the same information of those west is important, in order to make a diversion, and perhaps his main attack on that side.
Lest a reconnaissance should draw the enemy in force from Bunker Hill in time to strengthen the body between this and Martinsburg, the general desires the information obtained as secretly as possible, employing spies to go into Virginia and testing the fords at night, by intelligent persons, swimming, &c. He designs to cross with a force which will render success certain. Other information may be obtained in seeking for that desired, which may tend to change this plan or to mature it, and therefore the general desires the officers not to confine themselves to this. As soon as possible, after sufficient information is obtained, the general wishes Captains Newton and Simpson to report to him. He only awaits the arrival of harness for Perkins7 battery and this information to act.
I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
F. J. POETEB, Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel : I have just received the inclosed letter from General Neg-ley, saying that he is informed the enemy are preparing to cross the river at Harper’s Ferry. I have no reason for doubting the fact, other than I think their main force is near Bunker Hill, say 7,000 or 8,000 men, and the remainder, with perhaps the greater part of the artillery and cavalry, south of Falling Waters, say perhaps 5,000 men. The artillery, said to be seventeen 6-pounders, are rifled brass pieces, as is said by an intelligent deserter here and confirmed by one other source.

Telegrams of 25th and 27th received. The enemy being superior in number, 15,000, with twenty-two guns, and having just assumed a threatening attitude and location, I would not be warranted under the orders of the General-in-Chief in crossing the river with my single battery, raw and immovable for want of harness. Send me the Ehode Island regiment and battery, or one or more batteries in condition for service, and I will cross on their arrival. If you will send regulars it will add to the obligation. Unless the force in front is dispersed or driven back, I cannot well carry out the judicious suggestionof moving on Leesburg.

General Jackson, and a reserve of 5,500 men under General Johnston near Bunker Hill. He also reports twenty to twenty-four guns and a large cavalry force with General Jackson, and thinks that General Neg-ley, whose brigade is on my left, near Sharpsburg, will be attacked—the river being fordable at almost every point. To meet this force of 15,000 men, with twenty-two guns, and nearly 1,000 cavalry, I have about 10,000 volunteer infantry, and 650 cavalry and artillery, the latter being nearly all recruits. The horses are untrained and we are still without harness for the battery.
I have repeatedly asked tor batteries, and ought to have one for each brigade, but have none. The only one fit for service sent me was the Bhode Island Battery, and that the General-in-Chief was compelled, by the necessities of his own position, to take from me when most wanted, and within a week after it joined me. I have neither cavalry nor artillery sufficient to defend the fords of the river between Harper’s Ferry and Hancock, but I would much rather attack than defend, and would have far more confidence in the result. While I will not on my own responsibility attack, without artillery, a superior force, I will do so cheerfully and promptly if the General-in-Chief will give me an explicit order to that effect.
To insure success, I respectfully, but earnestly, request that the troops taken from me when Washington was menaced be sent to me with all speed, with a number of field guns equal to those of the insurgents. I will then be enabled to choose my point of attack, offer battle to the enemy, and, I trust, drive them before me, clearing the valley in front, and taking such position as the General-in-Chief may indicate.
I respectfully suggest that Colonel Stone’s column be sent me, with other re-enforcements, and venture to add that the sooner I am reenforced with reliable troops and abundant field artillery the better. I am making arrangements for crossing the river, and will do so without waiting for orders or re-enforcements, if I find that the strength of the enemy has been overrated.
I beg to, remind the General-in-Chief that the period of service of nearly all the troops here will expire within a month, and that if we do not meet the enemy with them, we will be in no condition to do so for three months to come. The new regiments will not be fit for service before September, if then, and meanwhile this whole frontier will be exposed.
I have got my command into as good condition as I could expect in so short a time. Officers and men are anxious to be led against the insurgents, and if the General-in-Chief will give me a regiment of regulars and an adequate force of field artillery I will cross the river and attack the enemy, unless their forces are ascertained to be more than two to one.
I beg you to assure the General-in-Chief of my sincere desire to sustain him faithfully, and to promote, by all the resources at my command, the success of his general plan of operations.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

merits called for by bis excellency tbe President of tbe United States from tbe State of Virginia are now in tbe field under tbe direction of Major-General McClellan.
Tbe first regiment was of tbe three months’ volunteers. They have received guns, &c., but no tents. I think if they now bad tents, tbe most if not all of that regiment would enlist for three years.
The second regiment for three years is full, but they are without arms and equipments. A large number of this regiment are from the mountain region of Western Virginia. It is important to have them in the field as soon as possible, on account of their knowledge of the country. Permit me to urge the importance of sending arms, tents, and equipments immediately for this regiment. I would also observe that the First Regiment has yet no knapsacks.
1 have also two companies of cavalry, of one hundred men each, ready to muster into the service. They are much needed. They are also gathered from the mountain region 5 well acquainted with the country. You will please send arms for them. They are all marksmen, and have been accustomed to the use of the rifle.
It gives me great pleasure to assure you that our Union men are entering into the spirit of the work with great energy; and when they learn that our government is recognized at Washington, it will strengthen Union men and stop cavilers. Our people will give the United States all the aid they can spare from defending their families and property from their secession neighbors, many of whom have imbibed the spirit of their leaders.
I am in receipt of information from every part of Western Virginia, from the most intelligent and influential citizens, of their high approval of the action [of] our Convention and of their determination to sustain it.
I am, my dear sir, your obedient servant,

Commander-in- Chief Army of the United States:
Sir : I have the honor to call your attention to the present condition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway. By a written communication received to-night from the roadmaster, I am informed that parties of the enemy have recently examined the trestles, bridges, &c., with a view to further destruction. My informant asserts that he is threatened, if the slightest attempt is made to repair the trestles, greater injuries to the road will follow. The company, however, is prepared to reconstruct the road on our promise to protect it. The injured road being beyond the limits of this department, I can only say that 1 regard the reconstruction of it necessary to our operations here. There is a strong Union feeling along the route, especially in Hampshire and Morgan Counties, which only awaits protection to practically develop itself, companies in that vicinity being x>repared to muster into service. Under these circumstances, by ordering down the Pennsylvania troops, the war frontier would be moved towards the South, and our left flank be so protected that we could continue our operations of advance with greater alacrity, more expeditiously, extending them to the Kanawha.

The necessity of the continual detachment of bodies of troops to watch the enemy on the left being obviated, we could throw a greater force on the more prominent points of attack. The opening of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway, the protection of a Union sentiment wherever manifested, and the importance of guarding the base of our operations alike point to the apparent necessity of the measure indicated, which, I trust, will appear a sufficient excuse for presenting it to your attention.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hagerstown, Md., June 29,1861. Col. E. I). Townsend, Asst. Adjt. Gen.j Washington City:
Colonel : I inclose, for the information of the General-in-Chief, Captain Newton’s report of his examination of the Maryland Heights. The report is not as full as I desired it to be, due to its being rapidly made, in consequence of having to send him off suddenly. From conversation with him and information I gain from residents, I am convinced the occupation of the heights would be attended with great labor, and unless a strong force be placed in Pleasant Valley to keep open comm ideations with water, it cannot be held at this season by any command opposed.
I inclose also a communication from Captain Newton, relating to the reoccupation of these heights. I do not think the information reliable. Considerable force has been seen in the vicinity of Shepherdstown.
I arranged to-day to advance into Virginia on Monday. This is the earliest I can move with artillery, without which I deem it very imprudent to cross the river, with information of a large opposing force close at hand. I expect to drive the enemy from our vicinity, and, should it appear advisable, will push to Winchester. If the enemy have retired (which his demonstrations may have prepared for), you will next hear of my approach to you.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Hagerstown, Md., June 25,1861. Maj. F. J. Porter, Assistant Adjutant-General:
Sir : I have the honor to report the result of my examination of Maryland Heights (Elk Ridge).
I ascended first the western slope by the county road leading to Solomon’s Gap; thence I proceeded on the summit four miles to the southern extremity of the ridge. This road requires extensive repairs for heavy hauling for a distance of about four miles.
The top of the ridge is covered with a small growth of timber and brushwood, and is difficult of penetration. An easy defense could be made by cutting down the timber and brush across the summit for about two hundred yards in width, and forming behind this obstruction a light parapet, having the interior slope stockaded, the stockade to be high enough to protect the heads of the men when standing on the banquette, and to be loop-holed. Other stockaded parapets may be erected whenever a more minute examination may render it necessary and at

those points where the access up the sides of the mountain may be convenient to an enemy. The portion of the heights to be occupied by us should extend about one and three-fourths miles from the southern extremity of the ridge, with the object of protecting our supplies of water from the base of the mountain at the foot of the eastern slope and distant about one and one-quarter miles from the southern extremity of the ridge. Our principal defense should be felling trees, &c., on the sides and slopes of the mountain and on the summit wherever an approach would be practicable. We should also occupy below the base of the slope, where our supplies of water are to be drawn. The mountain affords capabilities for a strong defense, but from the extent of ground to be occupied, the condition of the roads, and the necessity of hauling water and stores up the mountain, much inconvenience may be experienced, and a certain amount of time also will be expended in completing the defenses.
The ascent of the eastern slope is through Solomon’s Gap, by a road larger and steeper than by the corresponding road from the western side, and also by a road constructed by the enemy and leading up from Sandy Hook. The latter road is not too steep, but is very rough, hav-iug large stones live or six feet long in many places directly in the road. The same is true in a measure of all other roads upon the mountain. The rocks are said by those who have made roads on the mountain to be generally detached, and not to form a part of a ledge.
It is impossible to state what amount of force could be detailed from the Army at this period, with the necessity also of watching closely the enemy, to construct the necessary defenses. My estimate is that two thousand men are necessary to occupy the mountain and the eastern slope, and it would require two thousand men to work about ten days in order to put everything in condition to make a vigorous defense.
The extent and rugged nature of the ground examined and the close growth of timber and brush rendered it impossible to take measures, and the distances are accordingly taken from maps, guides, and from personal observation, without the use of instruments.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

My Dear Major: From all the information as yet received the enemy has recrossed the river at Harper’s Ferry on flats and boats and occupied the Maryland Heights with two regiments—said to be the Kentucky and Mississippi—numbering together about two thousand men.
First. The express arrived at General Cadwalader’s at 3 a. m. from this camp. I considered it best at the time for me to come over here, and accordingly here I am.
Second. Is this movement made to mask Johnston’s retreat ?
Third. Is it to secure his flank while he marches against Stone ?
Fourth. Has he been re-enforced, as has been asserted, and is this the first offensive movement on his part? He is likewise said to have a number of rifled cannon, a deserter asserting that the balls are not round, but flat at one end and egg-shaped at the other.

Fifth. His position now threatening all communication with Stone, is it not necessary to effect this junction at all hazards ?
General Cadwalader thinks, and it may be the case, that the present movement is a feint, while the real point of attack is to be our right. Unless he (the enemy) is decidedly superior in force, such an intention would scatter his forces over too long a line. This is per contra to General Cadwalader’s opinion.
If General Negley is to maintain his present position it would be well to send to-day some crow-bars (20), 30 axes, 30 picks, and 40 shovels, consigned to the brigade quartermaster, with directions to him to receipt for them, and to use them for no other purpose except intrenching.
Very truly, &c.,

In reply I have to say that the only force (one regiment rifles and one infantry, with a section of artillery) of my command as yet armed and equipped has been pushed forward to the support of Colonel Wallace at Cumberland and for the protection of our border settlers in that direction ; the other regiments are without clothing, arms, or equipments still, notwithstanding my efforts to fit them for the field.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
Sir : I have the honor to report that yesterday my scouts captured an enemy’s picket about five miles from Newport News, and from letters found at their quarters it appears that General Magruder left Yorktown on Tuesday last with the intention of attacking the post at Newport News; that he advanced within three miles of the News without baggage, tents, or trains, and stopped overnight on the road near the site of Little Bethel, and in the midst of a drenching rain. He had with him two regiments of Carolina troops, a regiment of Louisiana zouaves, a howitzer battalion from Richmond, and some two hundred or two hundred and fifty horsemen. After advancing so as to be almost within reach of our pickets at Newport News he changed his course up the James River, and was yesterday encamped at Young’s Mills, between eleven and twelve miles from Newport News, near Mulberry Point.
Acting in consultation with my engineers, I have advanced the two

Massachusetts regiments into the town of Hampton, and directed [them] to extend their pickets as far as New Market Bridge, and to hold the road to Newport News, that being at the corner of the road, seven miles from that post, so as to be ready to act in conjunction with my forces there in case of an attack, and also to hold the peninsula of Elizabeth City County, in the neighborhood of Fort Monroe, thus keeping open communication to Newport News both by land and water. I have further to report the arrest of Colonel Allen, of the First New York Volunteers, under the following state of facts:
There was a wheat held of some twenty-five acres belonging to the Twine estate, owned by a widow and some minor heirs, as I am informed. The occupants had received a written safeguard upon taking the oath of allegiance and giving parole not in any way to aid, counsel, or advise the enemies of the United States. Colonel Allen, against express orders, crossed the creek near Hampton by the police guard there stationed. A small detachment of his men proceeded to the ground, arrested the parties for no other offense, as he states, save that they were getting the wheat, and sent them, six in number, to Fort Monroe and to my headquarters (which was also against orders), and ordered the wheat field to be set on fire, which was done, and the crop consumed. Upon report of these facts by General Pierce in the form of charges against Colonel Allen, and upon other charges affecting his personal habits, substantially verified by evidence, I caused him to be arrested and held for trial. I have caused enlisted men to be punished for the destruction of private property, and I believe this act of Colonel Allen was a most unnecessary, not to say wanton, destruction and waste. The place where it happened was wholly within our control, and if there had been any attempt at an improper use being made of the wheat, it might easily have been brought within our camp and served some good purpose at least. I trust that this action will receive the approbation of the General Commanding, because it has become necessary, in order to prevent such destruction and waste of the jiroperty of our enemies even as will disgrace us.
When I last had the pleasure and honor of an interview with the Lieutenant-General Commanding, I was assured that Major Mackall would be detailed as assistant adjutant-general as soon as he returned from the Pacific coast. I am now using the services (and necessarily) without compensation of the adjutant of this post. I pray leave to call the attention of the General to this fact, and to ask that Major Mackall, or some assistant adjutant-general, may be detailed here.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

I propose that we occupy Point Pleasant.
There are 3,500 secession troops at Charleston, fifty*two miles from Point Pleasant. Can we not take the regiment from Gallipolis and send him some other forces, and let them intrench themselves at Point Pleasant, if necessary ? I have received intelligence in the last few days that they can raise a regiment in that neighborhood of Virginia troops if they had a rallying point.
I have an offer of a regiment from Pittsburgh to come into the service, unconditionally, for three years. The gentleman offering says he can be ready in a week. We could place that regiment there. Can you not spare Captain Daum, who is here in camp yet, with his artillery, to join that movement ?
I can procure artillery and ammunition at Pittsburgh for Captain Daum, if you need what he has here, if you can do without the company.
My dear sir, I deem it a matter of great importance to commence a movement in that direction, even if we have to encamp them on the Ohio side until we get strong enough to take position on the Virginia.
Yours, in haste,

P. S.—My impression is that the object of Wise in his trip towards Parkersburg is to make a dash at the Northwestern Virginia Bailroad and burn up the bridges, by dashing at different points with his cavalry.

Col. H. H. Lockwood :
Sir : As a part of the command stationed on the line of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, we deem it but right and proper to make known to you the heroic conduct of the daughter of Mr. Bowman, the keeper of the bridge at this place, on the night of the burning of the bridge by Trimble and his men. From Mr. Smith, the master carpenter of the road, and others who were present on the occasion, we have learned the following particulars:
When the train bearing the bridge-burners had crossed the bridge, and Trimble had drawn his men in line immediately in front of Mr. Bowman’s house, the object of their coming was announced in the hearing of Miss Jane by Trimble himself. She pronounced him a coward, and in a loud voice called upon the men, who had been armed by the road and placed there to protect the bridge, to defend it, and when she saw these men throw away their arms, some of them taking to the woods and others hiding within her father’s house, she called upon them again not to run, but to stand fast and show themselves to be men. At this time, seeing one of the pistols lying upon the floor of the porch, which had been thrown away by one of the bridge-guards, she picked it up and ran with it. Meeting Mr. Smith she gave it to him, saying at the same time, “Use it; if you will not, I will.”
Another evidence of the wonderful courage and presence of mind of Miss Jane was shown in her anxiety for the safety of one of the men employed by her father to assist him in taking care of the bridge. This man was on the draw at the time the firing of the bridge commenced. Miss Jane was the first to think of him, and promptly called upon her father, or some one, to go for him in a boat, saying, “If no one else will go, I will.”
In conclusion, permit us to say that such heroism in a young lady as shown in the conduct of Miss Bowman on this occasion has rarely been met with anywhere, and, in our opinion, should not be suffered to go unrewarded.

Lieutenant-General Scott :
I have the honor to report that the term of enlistment of the Third and Fourth Massachusetts Regiments, three months’ men, expires by limitation to morrow, and I have made arrangements to have them sent to Boston as the place of rendezvous. I had some doubt whether, as they were mustered into the service of the United States at Fort Monroe, that might not be considered their place of rendezvous; but learning from the colonels that they claimed their rendezvous at Boston, and as it would at best make but two or three days’ difference in their term of service, and as there would be saved to the United States a very large amount of traveling fees over and above the cost of transportation, being, as near as I can reckon it, about twenty dollars per man, I have caused transportation and three days’ rations to be furnished them, in order that they may be mustered out of service at Boston.
These two regiments were armed with the improved rifle muskets, while most of my regiments are armed with the issue of 1844, altered to percussion. Believing that these arms were distributed to the States under the act of Congress only to be used in the service of the Union, I have supposed that it was competent, as it was certainly desirable, to have them kept here, and therefore I have directed that all rifled muskets that will pass inspection of the ordnance officer at this post in the hands of the three-months’ men be exchanged for the altered flint-lock muskets of 1844, and I propose to distribute these rifled muskets to the most deserving and best drilled troops. I also propose to have returned to my assistant quartermaster by the three-months’ men such tents and camp equipage as they have received from the United States, and allow them to take back with them such as has been furnished by the State of Massachusetts. I trust these dispositions will meet the approbation of the Commanding General.
It will be observed that by the return home of these men at least a thousand of the most effective of my troops are withdrawn from our forces, and I beg to call your attention to the fact that within fifteen days the First Vermont Regiment, three-months’ men, 750 strong, being one of the best regiments here, will be entitled to a discharge. I would respectfully ask if the exigencies of the service will not permit other regiments, now being raised in Massachusetts or elsewhere, to be ordered here to take the place of those withdrawn by the expiration of enlistment.
I have further the honor to report that in a skirmish between Newport News and Warwick, by a patroling party numbering twenty-five, of Colonel Hawkins’ regiment, under command of Captain Hammell, and a detachment of Louisiana volunteers, numbering one hundred and fifty, under the command of Colonel De Russy, late of the U. S. Army, Colonel De Russy and one other officer of the rank of captain, name unknown, were killed, and seven men wounded. No one was injured upon our side.
