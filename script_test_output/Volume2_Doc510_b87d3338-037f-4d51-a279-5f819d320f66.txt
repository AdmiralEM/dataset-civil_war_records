Col. Daniel Ruggles,
Provisional Army of Virginia, Fredericksburg, Va.:
Colonel : In carrying into effect Special Orders, No. 39, you are desired to use all the means in your power to advance the instruction and discipline of your command. For this purpose you will place the troops at or near points where they will probably be needed, and it is hoped, as it will be impossible to furnish tents at present, that you may procure buildings, or erect huts or plank sheds, for their protection, which will enable you to remove them from the towns, accustom them to the necessities of service, and enable them to prepare for it. You must establish rigid discipline, and endeavor to place with each command competent officers as instructors, though they may be of inferior rank to the respective commanders. I know that officers and men are in-

Lieut. Col. I>. A. Langhorne, Virginia Volunteers, Lynchburg, Va.:
Sir : The number of troops from Virginia now assembling at Lynchburg may become so large as to render it inconvenient for you to provide for them. You are therefore authorized to order to report to Colonel Cocke, at Culpeper Court-House, such companies from the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Roanpke, Botetourt, and Craig as may be organized and able to move, and to this city such from the remaining counties of your district as are similarly situated. Report these instructions to Colonel Early on his arrival.

Headquarters Cabell's Battery,
Gloucester Point, May 10 [?], 1861—9.30 a. m.
Col. J. B. Magruder :
Sir : Yesterday, about 1 o’clock p. m., an armed steamer approached our battery, coming within the range of two or three miles. We sprang to our guns, and were ready for action as soon as it was manifest that the steamer was coming up the river. We all expected an attack, but she turned and proceeded down the river, and dropped anchor near its mouth. Another ship or steamer was also in the distance. During the night there was a vigilant lookout. This morning four ships or steamers passed beyond the first steamer, proceeding rapidly from north to south. About 8 o’clock this morning the attacking steamer weighed anchor and left the river. You can draw your own conclusions as well as I can of the purpose of the enemy.
I regard this point as next in importance to Fortress Monroe. I hope I may say that I am acquainted at least with the commercial wants of the State. It is, in my opinion, invaluable, both for military defense and the commercial necessities of the State. Let its importance not be underrated. This point properly secured, and no effectual blockade can continue; no ships can pass up York River $ no attack can be made on Richmond, except by long land marches. If you could see the place, you would be satisfied of its great importance. To allow it to be lost would be a fatal error. The force here, consisting entirely of volunteers, are prepared to defend it to the last extremity. They are perfectly aware of the strangeness and peril of their situation, but though u there is plenty of danger, there is no fear.” But if I am correct in regard to the importance of retaining this position, though the necessities of the State would not permit more men to be sent for the support of the few here, yet that force should be promptly sent for the protection of the present and future fortifications here.

Lincoln and Cabinet appear to be, they must see the importance of taking this place. A land attack by a large force would probably do this. We would dispute every inch of ground with them; but however valiant our defense, it would not repay the loss of this place. I believe it can be easily defended from a land attack. Access from our rear is over ground perfectly level, and mostly open. The enemy must march through a space not over a mile or mile and a half wide. Defend this by a rude fort of logs even, and it would greatly contribute to our defense. It will require a much larger force to do this. But the plateau in the rear of this is the most beautiful as well as extensive field for drill I have ever seen. A brigade could well maneuver upon it. Send down, therefore, some of your raw troops of infantry, and let a school of instruction be placed here.
The Federal troops may land below, but they must pass through the level interval or over Sarah’s Creek. They cannot pass Sarah’s Creek without boats, and its defense is very easy. I have not time to say more.
Please submit this to General Lee and the governor and council. Let the public not hear of it till the plan is executed.
Excuse haste and the excitement of a camp life, and the errors of composition produced by constant interruptions and camp tables.

Headquarters Virginia Forges,
Richmond, Va., May 11, 1861. Maj. F. M. Boykin, Jr., Grafton, Va.:
Major: Your letter of the 7th has just been received, and I regret to learn that the prospect of assembling the Virginia forces at Grafton is so unfavorable. You must persevere, however, and call out companies from the well-affected counties, and march them to Grafton, or such other point in that vicinity as you may select. Four hundred rifles and some ammunition have been ordered from Staunton to Major Goff, Virginia Volunteers, at Beverly, Bandolph County, who has been directed to communicate their arrival to Colonel Porterfield, and take his directions as to their disposition. You can by this means arm certain companies and prepare them for service, preparatory to receiving those from Harper’s Ferry. I do not think it prudent to order companies from other parts of the State to Grafton, as it might irritate, instead of conciliating the population of that region. On Colonel Porterfield’s arrival at Grafton communicate this letter to him.
Very respectfully, &c.,
B. E. LEE,
Major-General, Commanding.
P. S.—Major Goff has been directed to assemble some troops in his vicinity for the protection of the arms and their safe conveyance to the point required.

from Keysville, on the Richmond and Danville Road, to Clarksville, on the Roanoke, whereby an additional railroad connection would be had between Richmond and States to the south of Yirginia. As a military road at this time, General Lee thinks it would be both desirable and important to have the road which you propose constructed, as it would afford not only an additional means of communication between Richmond and the South, but, in the event of obstruction on one road, the other might be kept open for travel and transportation. Contingencies might occur to render this a matter of the highest importance, and he would therefore be pleased to see the road made. But while he regards it as desirable, he thinks, from the information he has of the financial condition of the State, it would not be proper just now to divert the money required for the work from other objects.

ments and my own. My general line of operations is very much in the direction of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, while yours would be, in the present attitude of the enemy, through Aquia Creek to Dumfries and Occoquan. Our lines would thus converge upon Alexandria and the enemy’s position bey ond. The line of the Potomac to the mouth of the Aquia, flanking your line, as indicated, as well as mine, at least as far back as this point, it is exceedingly important that we should have strong outposts at Aquia, Dumfries, and Occoquan, at either of which places the enemy could enter and land by boats, and take me in flank and your own position in front. By establishing a strong force at these points indicated, we shall prevent surprise, hold the enemy in check along the Potomac, which flanks this line of operations from here to Alexandria, while we shall, at the same time, hold ourselves in position by a connected chain of posts for reciprocal support and intelligence and for prompt co-operation. In order to effect the objects indicated in general terms above, you will place at Dumfries a detachment, consisting, if practicable, or as soon as it may be practicable, of at least one battalion of infantry (rifles would be best), one section (two guns) of rifled cannon, Walker’s battery, and a troop or two of cavalry, while a similar force should be placed at Occoquan as soon as it may be practicable to do so.
I am well aware of the difficulties you may have in fulfilling literally these commands in this incipient stage of organization of your force. I must, therefore, trust to your discipline to do whatever may be practicable for the present, to be followed up as future circumstances may allow. The troops from Prince William, now at Dumfries and Occoquan, and any other troops that may be there, will remain at those posts, respectively, and be strengthened as circumstances will allow to do so, as above indicated. This post will be promptly put in connection with Occoquan by outposts, pickets, vedettes, and patrols, and it would be exceedingly desirable to establish a similar unbroken chain of communication between Occoquan, Dumfries, Aquia, and Fredericksburg.
Very truly, &e.,
PHILIP ST. GEO. COCKE.
Division Hdqrs., Harpers Ferry, Fu., May 11, 1861. Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee :
General: The precautions mentioned in your letter of the 6th instant have been under consideration for some time, and some of them have been taken 5 others are progressing as rapidly as the circumstances admit of. Arrangements are complete for a desperate defense at Point of Rocks. I have troops also at Berlin, Shepherdstown, and Martins-burg. Marylanders, with artillery, are opposite Shepherdstown, and have threatened us there to such an extent as to induce the officer stationed there to call on me for artillery; and though I can poorly spare it, yet, under the circumstances, I must comply. Previous to receiving your letter I had authorized the payment of $5 for the best arms, and graded pieces below that. My report for yesterday* will show the strength of the command. I can get enough volunteers from the counties named to swell the force to probably four thousand five hundred; but they are without arms, accouterments, and ammunition. Please send me five thousand good muskets and rifles, with complete equip-

ments. Also full equipments for three hundred cavalry, and an additional light battery more than those called for in my last. Make this the depot for the northwest. Grafton should be occupied at once. Col. J. M. Bennett will deliver this to you, and give important information respecting the northwest. The quartermaster, Mr. John A. Harman, of this post, should not be removed, if it can possibly,be avoided. Please have him appointed and retained, if practicable. I had difficulty in inducing him to remain; but, if the appointment be sent to him, I think he will continue here.
