repeated feints and skirmishes, on the afternoon of Thursday the 11th, turning the left flank of our position at Camp Garnett—in large force. He succeeded, after a protracted and, on our side, a desperate struggle, in seizing the summit of the mountain, which had been held by a small body of our troops. Camp Garnett was thereupon abandoned. A portion of the force, which had occupied it, attempting, by a flank movement, to join General Garnett, were intercepted, and, it is said, taken prisoners. Other parties, from the same command, succeeded in making their escape by mountain paths, and are daily coming into this camp. General Garnett, abandoning his position at Laurel Hill, retreated upon the road, towards Beverly, with the design of joining Colonel Scott. Finding this impracticable, he renewed his retreat, following the road to Saint. George, and intending to fall back through Petersburg and Franklin upon this point. The enemy, in superior force, with cavalry and flying artillery, pursued him, and on Saturday, in the vicinity of the left branch of Cheat River, attacked his rear, defended by the First Georgia Regiment. It is said that the enemy was at first repulsed, and repulsed three times, with great loss; but, while a portion of his infantry was scattered in the wood, his artillery was finally brought to bear successfully upon our column. It was during one of these engagements that General Garnett, proceeding in person to the rear, himself fell. Yesrerday, when I sent you a telegram, I was quite satisfied, from the reports of fugitives, and from the absence of all communication with his command, that it must have been disorganized. I have since been led to hope (through no official channel, however) that a considerable body of them, disencumbered by abandonment of their wagon train, succeeded in continuing an organized retreat, and were yesterday upon the eastern declivity of the Alleghany Mountain, some fifteen miles from Petersburg. If this be true, I look for their arrival at this point on Friday next.
Colonel Johnson, pursuing the turnpike road towards Huttonsville, had made a forced march on Saturday, to form a connection with Colonel Scott’s regiment, expecting to occupy Cheat Mountain. At Greenbrier River, however, some fifteen miles this side of the mountain stronghold, he met Colonel Scott in full retreat, was apprised of the retreat of General Garnett, and of the presence of the enemy, in large numbers, in the immediate vicinity. The troops having been wearied by long marches, &c., he felt too weak to continue his forward movement, and determined to fall back upon this point.
On Sunday morning I met him, and, after frank consultation, concerning some scruples, assumed command. My own judgment approving of what he had previously done, the backward march was continued to this place, for the purpose of relieving ourselves of heavy wagon trains, of forming a connection with the North Carolina Regiment, of resting and rallying the troops, and of holding them in readiness, either to resist the advance of the enemy on the Huttonsville road, or to move to the relief of General Garnett in the direction of Franklin and Petersburg. Hearing nothing from that direction, however, I was contemplating a renewed movement towards the Cheat Mountain, when I received intelligence yesterday of General Garnett’s death and the uncertain condition of his retreating column. This movement was contemplated, however, rather with a view to the moral effect to be produced by it, not simply at a distance, but upon the people of the intervening districts, who are really in a most pitiable state of panic, than with a hope of effectively preventing the enemy’s progress towards the east, should he propose to make it at once. You are, doubtless, already aware

that from Huttonsville, where he now is, there is a good road passing through Huntersville, and, by the Warm Springs, to the Central Bail-road, above Staunton.
I inclose herewith a rough sketch of the surrounding country, with its passes, roads, and distances, to which you may possibly have an occasion to refer.
I am impressed with the opinion that if the enemy advance farther it will be by the Huntersville and Warm Springs road. I have scouts, deemed to be reliable, put out upon that road to watch and report his movements; others upon the Huttonsville road and through the country towards Franklin and Petersburg for the same purpose, and to direct our scattered troops into this camp.
It is needless to add that we are encountering many difficulties and annoyances from the want of tents, blankets, clothing, &c., for the men who are coming in almost hourly, and even from their disorganized and depressed condition. However, I think I can report the command as being, on the whole, in fair condition, constantly increasing in numbers, and improving in every respect; the officers generally, and especially Colonel Johnson, energetic, and rendering cheerful and effective service. The returns indicate the presence of from three thousand to thirty-five hundred effective troops, among them two companies of cavalry. I have three pieces of artillery (6-pounders), with horses and ammunition, and I am organizing a company of officers and men, who are experienced, to a greater or less degree in the use of that arm, and will take them in charge. I would beg once again to urge the importance of our being speedily re-enforced, especially in artillery and engineers.
I am, very respectfully, vour obedient servant,

Sir : Inclosed herewith I have the honor to transmit copies of correspondence with Major-General McClellan, of the U. S. Army, which will explain themselves. Further information received has confirmed into assurance the hope expressed in my last letter that the retreat ing column of General Garnett had not been so wholly [dispersed] after his death as was first supposed. I have good reason to believe that by Friday next some twenty-five hundred or three thousand men connected with it will join me here.
I also learn that a company of artillery with four pieces, and capable of effective service, has escaped the disasters of the last week almost intact. With an Arkansas regiment, understood to be approaching from Staunton, this accession will raise my command to some seven thousand men. I have sent a courier to meet Colonel Bamsey, with a direction that the artillery and cavalry be advanced with all possible dispatch. So soon as I can control their services, I hope to occupy the stronghold of the Alleghany Mountains, which commands this road, the indications of yesterday having suggested that the enemy may conclude to advance by that route.
The work of reorganization is going on in this camp quite perceptibly, I think, but I have been somewhat alarmed by a notification from Major

Harman, quartermaster at Staunton, that within the next five days five thousand troops, whom I suppose to be the militia of the adjoining county, will be upon the march to join me here. It is questionable whether so large a body of wholly undisciplined men, however zealous and patriotic they may be, will be able to compensate, by service in the field, for the disorganization they must occasion in the camp, and for the labor of arming, transporting, and supplying them. Supposing that the death of General Garnett, and the relief of his command from immediate danger in removing the necessity for their services, may prevent their assemblage and forward movement, and exceedingly loth to interfere with any direction from the State authorities, I shall leave all communication with Major Harman upon this subject to the Com-mander-in-Chief.
Permit me again to reiterate that what we need upon this line is good engineers, artillery of a heavier caliber than we now have to meet such moving with the enemy, and mountain howitzers, which the character of this country would render eminently effective.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
HENRY R. JACKSON,
Brigadier-General, &c.

P. S.—Since writing the above I have received a note from Colonel Ramsey, a copy of which, together with a copy of my response thereto, I have deemed it proper to inclose to you. You will perceive that he contemplated moving his command in the direction of Staunton. While I had previously dispatched a courier with such instructions as would prevent such a result, and who had not reached Colonel Ramsey at the date of his note, and while I have no doubt that his column will now be moved to this point, nevertheless I have not felt authorized to withhold this information from the commanding general.
