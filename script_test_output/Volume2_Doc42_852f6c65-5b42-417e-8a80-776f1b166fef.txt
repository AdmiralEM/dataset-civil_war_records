Reports of Brig. Gen. M. L. Bonham) C. S. Army) commanding at Ma-

Manassas, Ya., May 21,1861.
By all accounts, the enemy crossed the river last night in large force. They stopped the Leesburg train six miles from Alexandria, a reliable man informs me, who saw them. They may be moving on Leesburg; possibly on us. I have just heard from Hunton. He has taken necessary measures to prevent surprise by rail, but they will not move that way. If they attack us, we will defend the place to the last; but our troops are badly armed and deficient in ammunition. They have captured Ball’s dragoons. Send the ablest engineer to be had.

Dispatch received.* Colonel Terrett says two troops of cavalry crossed the Chain Bridge about 12 o’clock in the night. I have ordered some dragoons of Captain Green’s company to burn the bridges as soon as practicable. Will immediately send your dispatch to Colonel Hunton, however, who I hope has already accomplished the object. If you can, send some good artillerist and an engineer.
M. L. BONHAM.
General Lee.
Manassas Junction, Ya., May 25,1861.
Colonel : Colonel Terrett, with as many of his troops as he could bring off with him, arrived at 11 o’clock, the enemy occupying Alexandria with one thousand troops, as is supposed by Colonel Terrett. If the enemy advance on this line it is manifest that a much larger force is necessary here. There are but six hundred infantry here, seven companies of Preston’s command having gone to Harper’s Ferry. We need artillery very much. There are four small pieces only here. I can order up the two companies of cavalry from Occoquan and Accotink. There is but one troop of cavalry here. With a good engineer I could get on better. Will do the best I can.
In haste, your obedient servant,
M. L. BONHAM.

﻿Chap.IX.1	UNION ARMY ADVANCES INTO VIRGINIA.	43
Manassas, Va., May 25,1861.
The information from trustworthy vedettes indicates the enemy at Falls Church and Ball’s Cross Boads not to exceed five or six hundred. A rumor that a large body was advancing towards Leesburg needs confirmation. As yet a number of our troops are destitute of camx> equipage and with but little ammunition, but exhibit admirable spirits.
M. L. BONHAM.
Major-General Lee.
Manassas, Va., May 25,1861.
According to the most reliable information from my vedettes, the enemy are not over five hundred strong at Falls Church and Ball’s Cross Boads each. No news of any attempt by Occoquan. Leesburg safe at 4 o’clock this morning. The Alexandria (Va.) troops are here, without cooking utensils, and many without arms. Please send to the quartermaster of this place cooking utensils and other camp equipage for six hundred men, as destitute men are hourly joining me. Caps, ammunition, and arrns greatly needed.
M. L. BONHAM.
General Lee.
