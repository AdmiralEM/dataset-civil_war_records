No. 9.
J	Washington, 1). (7., April 28, 1861.
Agreeably to Special Orders, No. 12, of the War Department, assigning me to the command of the Military Department of Washington, I hereby assume command of that department, and all reports and communications pertaining to my immediate command will be made to these headquarters.
JOS. K. F. MANSFIELD, Colonel, U. 8. Army, Commanding.
Washington, April 29,1861. Brigadier-General Butler, cfee., cfee., &e.:
Sir : I was happy to receive Colonel Butler last night, the bearer of your dispatches. The latter I have read with interest and a hearty approval.
I send herewith a copy of my letter of this date to Major-General Patterson. [Following.]
If Fort McHenry be not re-enforced, please send thither by some armed steamer from 250 to 500 men, with subsistence for at least sixty days.
I shall be glad to have your views on my proposed movement upon Baltimore, particularly on the part to be fitted out from Annapolis, and which you will probably be required to command.
Though you command a separate department and Major-General Patterson another, a free correspondence between you may be of mutual advantage.
I am sorry that the fleet of transports and provision ships sent from New York did not ascend the Potomac. Major Sibley, principal of the quartermaster’s department here, wishes some of those vessels with troops and supplies to be sent around to him, and has written accordingly. This river is yet unobstructed by hostile batteries afloat or ashore, and is likely to remain so.
A strong war vessel, to support Fort McHenry in case of an attack, is of great importance. If there be one not essential as a convoy to transports between Annapolis and the Susquehanna, send her to Fort McHenry.
If the cars promised from New York arrive, those you have ordered from Philadelphia may be unnecessary.
Having great confidence in your zeal, intelligence, and discretion, I remain, yours, truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
Washington, April 29,1861. Major-General Patterson, Commanding, &c.:
Sir : I wrote you by Major Porter on the 27th and also sent by him certain verbal messages. In that letter* I gave you the outline of my plan for taking and strongly occupying Baltimore, and I asked for your views on the subject. At present I suppose a column from this place of 3,000 men; another from York of 3,000; a third from Perry ville or Elkton by land or water, or both, of3,000, and a fourth from Annapolis by

water of 3,000 might suffice. But it may be, and many persons think it probable, that Baltimore, before we can get ready, will reopen the communication through that city and beyond each way for troops, army supplies, and travelers voluntarily.
When can we be ready for the movement upon Baltimore on this side? Colonel Mansfield has satisfied me that we want at least 10,000 additional troops here to give security to this capital, and as yet we have less than 10,000, including some very indifferent militia of the District, &c. With that addition we will be able, I think, to make the detachment for Baltimore.
The Secretary of War tells me that he has sent a party, not military, to repair the bridge and relay the Maryland part of the Harrisburg ancl Baltimore Railroad to a point near the city. This 1 am sure cannot be done without the protection of a military force. I wish you to lpok to this.
I am not sure that either you or Brigadier-General Butler has re-enforced Fort McHenry. I suppose 250 or 300 men to be wanted, if it be not already re-enforced. If with you, send Maj. W. W. Morris there to command. I shall ask General Butler to send up the men that may be yet needed.
I desire Major Porter, assistant adjutant-general, to obtain from you or the governor of Pennsylvania the means of breaking two bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, somewhere below Frederick, but pause a few days for further instructions, as we may want to use that road in taking possession of Harper’s Ferry.
We are in great want of camp equipage and accouterments at Annapolis, I believe, and certainly here, and we have occupied all the shelter for troops to be found here. Therefore please send no more troops this way without camp equipage.
The Cabinet have under consideration a plan for volunteers of long period of service. Please, therefore, to withdraw your request addressed to the governor of Pennsylvania to increase his quota of three months’ men.
Tell me what you can do, and when, towards seizing and occupying Baltimore.
The quartermaster in Philadelphia has two hundred wagons, and thinks he can obtain as many more in ten or fifteen days. Four locomotives and ten passenger cars have been ordered from New Nork for service on this side of Annapolis.
With respect, yours, very truly,
WINFIELD SCOTT.
P. S.—Occupy Havre de Grace at your discretion.

Major-General Patterson:
Dear Sir: In order that the line from here to Washington should work with the greatest efficiency, it is desirable that it should be under one head, that there may be no clashing of orders. Should the Government think it advisable that it should be so organized, I am ready to 39 R r—VOL II

organize and work it. I refer the matter to you to do with as you think best.
Yours, truly,

I have no control over the road beyond Havre de Grace. The Annapolis road is, I understand, managed by an able and efficient engineer, placed by the honorable Secretary of War. The ability to manage the two roads of the writer is undoubted, but the propriety of placing them both under him at this point distant from Washington is doubted.
Bespectfully referred to the headquarters of the Army.
B. PATTEBSON, Major-General, Commanding.
War Department, May 4,1861.
The Secretary of War deems it advisable to retain the management of Government lines at Washington. Would be glad to have Mr. Felton assume the management of his own road to Perryville, and control boats for passengers and mail service to and from Annapolis while the present route is used for that service.

Lieutenant-General Scott, Commanding Army, &c.:
Not having received any positive instructions through the brigade orders of General Butler, when leaving Annapolis, I beg leave to report to headquarters:
I have performed the required duty so far, and am now in complete possession of the entire line of railroad from the point nearest Annapolis to Paint Branch Bridge, with my headquarters at this point, which I reached last evening at 5.30 o’clock. During my march here I found a small detachment of the Fifth Begiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia at Patuxent Forge, three miles from here, and the officer in command, who announced himself as First Lieut. K. Stark, with twenty-seven rank and file, who said he was ordered to report to me for duty and orders on my arrival. I then commanded him to maintain the position he had, describing the duty as it was detailed to me by General Butler, and told him that when I reached my assigned headquarters I should send out a force to relieve his and take him to this place.
At 10.30 o’clock I took five of my engineer corps and proceeded by a hand car to make a tour of inspection of the road, and to visit the sentinels all along the worst considered portion of the road. On my arrival at the detachment commanded by Lieutenant Dufty, of my command, and consisting of eighteen rank and file, and some distance nearer to headquarters than Lieutenant Stark’s, I was surprised to learn that he had passed that point, stating that his orders were not to remain on guard of the road after night. I inquired the direction he had taken, and had no difficulty in finding the desired information, as he told sev-

eral on the road he was going to rest with his men at a given point. I followed up, and found them at a farmer’s house at least one mile from the railroad, and found them even there without guard or order or any military precaution to prevent surprise and capture.
Under the circumstances I ordered him to proceed to my headquarters, where, on his arrival, I placed him under arrest, and his command to do duty in connection with my own, until I received further orders. I would have ordered them back to their posts and placed them under the command of some of my own officers, but not knowing what might be the probable conduct of the men under such circumstances, I adopted the one which suggested itself to me as the safest; but I must say, from my inspection of them on this morning and the conversation I had with them in relation to the affair, that they are a reliable body of men, and had no participation in the affair, except of obedience to orders of a superior.
I beg leave to transmit a report of the strength of my command as reported to me on board the steamship from New York to Annapolis, and also a report of my strength at this point.* My entire command is in a healthy condition.
Bespectfully submitted.
