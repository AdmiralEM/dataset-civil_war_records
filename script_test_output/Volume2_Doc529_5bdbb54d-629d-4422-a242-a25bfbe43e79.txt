Brig. Gen. H. A. Wise, Lewisburg, Greenbrier County, Virginia:
Sir : Agreeably to wishes expressed in your letter of the 16th Instant, a field piece, with ammunition, has been forwarded your command. A company of artillery, with field pieces, it is understood, is now being enlisted here for your command, and if it is completed to the number required by law will be mustered into service, and, with its battery, be sent forward. Captain Cunningham’s Company (F) was ordered on the 8th instant to repair to this city and report to you. It has, however, but recently arrived here, under some misapprehension of the order by the captain, who reports that the company has never been mustered into service, and that the men will decline the muster if required to proceed under the orders so soon.
As Capt. H. M. Mathews can be spared from the duty in which he is at present engaged he will be ordered to report to you. Three other officers will be directed to join you.
I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston,
Commanding Harper's Ferry District:
General : Your communication of the 12th instant has been duly received. In relation to the two regiments sent you, one from Georgia and one from Tennessee, the commanding general instructs me to say that these two regiments were selected by the President to be added to your command because they were thought to be fully equipped and in a good state of discipline. They were sent from Lynchburg, and did not pass through this city. He is grieved at your report of the inefficient state of the Tennessee regiment, but trusts that ere this a better state of things has been inaugurated.

Richmond, June 22,1861.
General Joseph E. Johnston:
My Hear General : I congratulate you on the brilliant movement of Colonel Vaughn’s command. To break the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was essential to our operations, and if the bridge at Cheat River and the Grand Tunnel could be destroyed, so as to prevent the use of that railroad for the duration of the war, the effect upon public opinion in Western Virginia would doubtless be of immediate and great advantage to our cause.
If the enemy has withdrawn from your front to attack on the east side of the mountain, it may be that an attempt will be made to advance from Leesburg to seize the Manassas road and to turn Beauregard’s; position. The recent effort to repair the railroad from Alexandria to-Leesburg may have been with such intent. In that event, if your scouts* give you accurate and timely information, an opportunity will be offered you by the roads through the mountain passes to make a flank attack in conjunction with Beauregard’s column, and, with God’s blessing,, tu achieve a victory alike glorious and beneficial.
We continue to send forward re-enforcements to Manassas Junction.. On Monday and Tuesday a battalion of light artillery will go forward,, and every effort is made to reach a condition which will enable our forces* to shape the campaign by assuming the offensive.
I wish you would write whenever your convenience will permit,; and give me fully both information and suggestions. Colonel Thomas recently undertook to explain to me your wants as one authorized to speak for you, and to-day Mr. Staples communicated his impression of your views, necessities, and wishes. I am sure you cannot feel hesitation in writing to me freely, and trust your engagements will permit you to do so frequently.
With earnest wishes for your welfare and happiness, I am, very truly,, vour friend,

Magruder, Commanding, &c., Yorlclown, Fa. : General : I am instructed by General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, dated the 20th instant, reporting your movements from Great Bethel to Yorktown, under the supposition, from information derived from your vedettes, that the enemy had moved against the latter in force. The general suggests that you will employ none but the most reliable men for the delicate and important service of vedettes, so as to avoid the chances of false information in respect to the enemy, such as that which caused your sudden march on the 19th instant. The general also wishes you to provide always a sufficient number of wagons for the troops held in advanced positions, so that, in the event of a rapid movement, transportation may be at hand at any moment.

Governor Letcher, Richmond, Fa. ;
Sir : I am in receipt this morning of a letter from Colonel McKee, of the Louisville Courier, who has from time to time communicated such information as he thought would be of service to me, in which he incloses a letter from a friend of his in Cincinnati, dated June 19, in which he states as follows:
Two regiments of Indiana troops (the Eighth and Tenth) have just arrived here (Cincinnati) to-night en route for East Tennessee via Western Virginia. The information as to their destination I have confidentially from a colonel of one of the regiments I am well acquainted with, and believe this information, which I took some pains to pump from him, correct. The presence of the contemptible traitor seems to confirm it. I suppose you have means of communicating with the Tennessee leaders, and if, as I do, you consider the above item of any importance, by all means convey it to them as soon as possible. These men go to Marietta to-night, and to-morrow will be in Western Virginia. They, with several other regiments, are to co-operate with Brown-low and Johnson men. These two regiments are hardy-looking men and well armed.

Headquarters Army of the Potomac,
Manassas Junction, Fa., June 23, 1801. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to inform the Department that, in consequence of the large re-enforcements I have lately received, I have divided my forces into six brigades, as per inclosed statement,* and commenced a forward movement to protect my advanced position at Centreville, Fairfax Court-House, and Sangster’s Cross-Roads, and also to be within striking distance of the enemy, whose advance positions seem to be at and to the rear of Falls Church (seven -miles from Alexandria), where they have five regiments (First and Second Connecticut, First and Second Ohio, and Sixty-ninth New York), one troop of cavalry, and one light battery. They have also four companies at Annandale.
My advanced forces (three brigades of three regiments each) occupy the triangle represented by Mitchell’s Ford (Bull Run), one regiment; Centreville and a point half way to Germantown, one brigade; Germantown and Fairfax Court-House, one brigade; at the crossing of Brad-dock’s old road with the Fairfax Court-House and Fairfax Station roads, one regiment; at the latter station, one regiment and one battalion, and at Sangster’s Cross-Roads, one battalion. All these positions are in easy and short communication with each other and with these headquarters. Most of my cavalry is with the advance, scouting, reconnoitering, &c. One light battery is at Fairfax Court-House with General Bonham’s brigade, and another is to be sent to Centreville to act with Colonel Cocke’s brigade. I unfortunately have none to spare for my other brigades. I have thrown eight miles in advance of the latter town or village one battalion of infantry and two companies of cavalry to observe the country towards the Potomac and the movements of the enemy in that direction. As already reported to the Department, one regiment (Sloan’s South Carolina) has been ordered to Leesburg, to assist Col. E. Hunton in the defense of that important position. I regret much my inability to send him some artillery.
I must call the attention of the Department to the great deficiency of my command in ammunition, not averaging more than twenty rounds in all per man. If I were provided with the necessary materials, molds, &c., I think I could establish here a cartridge manufactory which could supply all our wants in that respect. Could not a similar arrangement be made at all hospital depots, State arsenals, penitentiaries, &c.! To go into battle each soldier ought to be provided with at least forty rounds of cartridges, and not less than sixty rounds in reserve.

This inquiry is now submitted to you for your reply at your earliest convenience. If certain allegations in respect to the general’s habits and daily condition, which have been made to General Lee, are correct, he certainly would not be a fit person for this responsible duty. In addition to this, also, it is believed that the population from which these regiments would be taken is by no means loyal to the cause of Virginia in the present state of affairs.

still occupying Hagerstown and Williamsport, the main body being in the former place, and six or eight thousand men under General Cad-walader in the latter.
He says that General Patterson has been corresponding with the authorities of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in relation to repairing the road, and talks of occupying Harper’s Ferry. Should he do so with less than ten or twelve thousand men, an equal force attacking him would have the advantage of ground.
Colonel Jackson, who is in the neighborhood of Martinsburg to supj>ort the cavalry which is observing the enemy, has, according to his instructions, destroyed all the rolling stock of the road within his reach. I have directed him to have such of the large stock of coal as the inhabitants require sold to them, and accounts to be kept of the sales, and the proceeds to be used in purchasing provisions in the neighborhood. I have had the pleasure to receive the order for Capt. W. E. James to report to me with his company of cavalry. We require three or four more companies of that arm from the great extent of country to be observed. Another officer capable of commanding a brigade and four or five competent to the duties of quartermasters and commissaries are greatly needed. In this connection I recommend the appointment of Lieutenants Davis and Morgan as assistant quartermasters. They have proved themselves competent to the discharge of the duties of that position.

You should therefore proceed with your company to Bichmond, armed with such arms as may have been furnished you, or as you may be able to procure, where you will be provided with such arms and equipments as are available. It is advisable, however, that you come as fully equipped as possible, as you will thereby hasten your preparation for the field.

Bruce, leave for your command via Staunton. They yvill take with them two 6-pounder iron guns, with ammunition, two hundred tents, and the following articles of clothing, viz, seven hundred and twenty overcoats, one thousand pairs of socks, and six hundred pairs of drawers. I am informed by the Quartermasters Department that at present there are no shirts on hand, but that the number called for in your requisition (five hundred) will be forwarded, together with the balance of the over-coats, as soon as made. By the Quartermaster’s statement it appears that six hundred and forty-nine blankets have been previously furnished the troops under your command, and that there is not now a single blanket in store. In addition to the two hundred tents mentioned above, the two companies belonging to the Twentieth Begiment, and before alluded to, take with them twenty-two tents on Colonel Gilliam’s requisition.

Brig. Gen. J. B. Magruder, Commanding, &c., YorTctown, Va.: General : Your communication of the 22d instant* has been duly received. The resignation of the five officers of the Zouave battalion therein mentioned, the dissatisfaction of the men, and the inability on the part of the officers to control in this battalion, as reported by you, have been sources of great regret to me. There are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the promotion of Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart, of the Fifteenth Regiment Virginia, to the command of the regiment you propose forming by the addition of two companies of Virginia volunteers to this battalion, nor is there any officer of the Army now available to be assigned to this command. I desire you to direct Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens to proceed to Richmond and report to me at these headquarters, and beg to be informed if there is no officer of the Zouave battalion, in your judgment, capable of commanding and managing it.

Hdqrs. Twenty-seventh Brigade Virginia Militia,
Raleigh Court-House, Va., June 25, 1861. General Wm. H. Richardson,
Adjutant-General Virginia Militia, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : I have the honor to report, through yourself, to his excellency the governor and commander-in-chief, that I have just reached home, after a visitation of the One hundred and twenty-sixth, One hundred and forty-second, One hundred and eighty-fourth, One hundred and ninetieth, One hundred and eighty-seventh, and One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiments of line, during which, in the unavoidable vacancy in the office of brigade-inspector (caused by Linkon’s assignment to volunteer service), I trained the officers, reviewed and drilled the six regiments. By my addresses to the several regiments, to the county courts, and to the people, wherever assembled, I have been most successful in getting up a patriotic union of men, hitherto of various shades of opinion, for the defense of Virginia, and also in promoting the formation of volunteer companies, some now in the field, and several to march in a few days.
Nicholas County, One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiment, two companies, one in camp; Fayette County, One hundred and forty-second Regiment, three companies, in the field; Raleigh County, One hundred and eighty-fourth Regiment, two companies, one already gone, and one to leave Monday; Wyoming County, One hundred and ninetieth Regiment, one company; Logan County, One hundred and twenty-ninth Regiment, two companies; Boone County, One hundred and eighty-seventh Regiment, two companies, another forming; one marches to-day; one in camp. In all, twelve companies.
Thus the governor will perceive that one brigadier of Virginia militia has attempted to fulfill his responsibilities, and is ready, whenever called upon, to take the field at the head of his brigade.
With respect to some partial, and, as it seems to me, irregular and
'Not found.

﻿952	OPERATIONS IN MP., PA., VA., AND W. VA. [Chap. IX.
impolitic orders, emanating from the lieutenant-colonel (McCausland) of the Kanawha Talley volunteer forces, it is my duty to complain to his excellency. These orders, in the name of the governor, call for drafting one or two hundred men in a county. This is unnecessary, and it harasses the people, because I find each county and regiment ready to furnish as many volunteers as it is prudent to take away from these western counties, in which there are many disaffected persons whom it is necessary to watch and restrain until our State can get rid of them or punish them. If the governor should require any number of men from my brigade to be drafted, I ask that I may execute the governor’s orders. Recently an irresponsible man, named Hutchinson, brought one of these little one hundred-men orders, and pretended he had authority to draft. These irregular attempts to draft I will oppose until the governor shall otherwise direct, with respect to drafting a company out of the One hundred and forty-second Fayette Regiment on any pretext such as that. The people of that gallant county will not volunteer. Their having three companies in the field for some time completely proves the injustice of these little irregular drafts. The truth is, these will greatly injure a general draft when required by the public exigencies, as may soon be.
With great respect, sir, your most obedient servant,
ALFRED BEOKLEY,
Brigadier-General, Commanding Twenty-seventh Brigade.
P. S.—The official return of brigade will be forwarded in a few days. Inclosed I send the certificate of election of a new company, formed last Saturday, of one hundred and thirteen men.
Headquarters, Romney, Va., June 25,1861.
Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : On the 5th instant I had the honor to receive at the hands of the President the commission of colonel of cavalry in the Army of the Confederate States, accompanied by an order to perform certain services therein specified. On the 7th instant I reported myself to General Johnston, and exhibited to him the order alluded to. He informed me that such were the exigencies of his command that he could not spare a single man. Without some organized force, around which to rally volunteers, it was evidently vain for me to move towards the point at which the service was to be rendered, as I would have been pleased to have done with even one company of cavalry. Therefore I lost no time in sending out agents in the valley and Piedmont, and have met with success far beyond my most sanguine expectations, as this bids fair to become a popular arm of the service.
On the 15th Capt. Turner Ashby, commanding a troop belonging to Colonel Hun ton’s regiment, reported that he had obtained from General Johnston permission to join his own regiment, and from Colonel Hun-ton he obtained permission to join my command on the 14th instant; therefore his troop joined me at Winchester. On the 17th Captain Gaither, with a troop of Marylanders, joined me at the same point, with most of his men mounted. On the same day I had ordered both of these tooops to march to this place, to leave Winchester in the afternoon. In the mean time I learned that General Johnston’s command was drawn up in line of battle, expecting an attack. This induced me to

﻿Chap. IX.] CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.—CONFEDERATE.	953
countermand the marching orders which I had given to Captains Ashby and Gaither, that my men should have their part in the expected engagement. On the morning of the 18th, having learned enough of the enemy’s position to convince me that there was no danger of an immediate attack, I ordered the above-named captains to move forward with their companies to this place. Since that time I have been joined by a full company of mounted men from Shenandoah County, commanded by Captain Myers, and another from the County of Page, commanded by Captain Jordan. Captain Bowen has tendered me another, expecting to join me here to-day or to-morrow with his company from Warren County. Captain Wingfield joined me with his company on day before yesterday. Captain Shands, from the county of Rockingham, joined on yesterday with twenty-five men, and expects the arrival of his recruiting agents in a day or so with men sufficient to fill up his company. Besides these, a full company, raised by Mr. Isbell from the county of Jefferson, report that they will join me in a few days. In addition to these organized companies I have with me volunteers from the States of Alabama, Kentucky, and Maryland, as well as from Hardy County, this State, under favorite leaders, in squads of from ten to thirty-five men, who wait to join their respective captains, now busily employed in raising full companies, though not yet reported as ready to join me. These different squads, for their more efficient service, I have temporarily attached to different companies already organized. Among these last-named men are some of the very best for the peculiar services of partisan and border war. That the organization of my command may be the more thorough and efficient, my plan is that the men of the different companies shall see some service under the officers now commanding them before they are fixed in their positions by election and commission. Further, it is my intention and the basis upon which I have thus far acted, although I can get from loyal and true citizens of the Confederate States as many horses, saddles, and bridles, &c., as I may need, for certificates of value, to be paid by our Government, yet have I deemed it both right and politic to exhaust the supply in the hands of positive traitors and submissionists, that they, in holding the Confederate States certificates, may become interested in the success of our revolution. What I remarked above as to horses, bridles, &c., for my command, I have but to say as to all the commissary supplies needed for our maintenance. In this connection I will draw your attention to the important fact that the saddles which I have picked up here and there in these mountains are totally unfit for my service, in that they both hurt the horses’ backs and afford no secure seats for the riders. I beg, therefore, that the saddles promised, as well as the articles mentioned in the inclosed requisition, may be forwarded to me at this point, in care of Mr. Thornton Pendleton and Major Fun-sten, who will bring them with them to this place, and upon the receipt of the better saddles, so indispensable to me, I will turn over to the proper department all those which may be unfit for ranger service, as well as all articles whose places may be better supplied under the requisition herewith inclosed. Of sabers I have but few, and wish none others, as I much prefer the hatchet, weighing about a half pound, in their stead.
The force above mentioned, in round numbers-----men, every day
increasing, I have had to quarter, mount (for some of them came without horses), feed, and arm upon the credit of the Confederate States, by me used under the commission received from our President. Whilst in Winchester in person, and enabled to sign requisitions and give receipts, I was supplied by General Johnston with such things as could

[Chap. IX.
be spared from the different departments. When I set out to join the command at this place I left in Winchester an acting quartermaster, Mr. Thornton Pendleton, who to-day has come up to inform me that the quartermasters department of General Johnston will not honor his requisitions for my command. I am obliged, therefore, to ask that in advance of the full organization of my regiment, Mr. Pendleton be authenticated as the quartermaster to my regiment, that Captain Turner Ashby be commissioned as lieutenant-colonel, and Dr. O. R. Funsten as major of my regiment. To the last-named gentleman I am much indebted for the energy, zeal, and untiring efforts in raising volunteers; and while he has not had a military education, I know him to be brave and indomitable, yielding to no man in his devotion to our cause, and I doubt not but that he will be fully equal to the requirements of his position. I cheerfully recommend him for major. As to Captain Ashby, I need not speak of his qualities, for already he is known as one of the best partisan leaders in the service. Himself a thorough soldier, he is eminently qualified to command. I sincerely trust that the commission asked for may issue to him. As soon as the requisite companies are filled, which I believe will be in a few days, I will send in to be commissioned the names of the company officers.
In order that the demoralizing influences of campaign life, particularly those which attach to a border war, may be counteracted as far as possible, the Rev. James B. Averitt, of the Episcopal Church, has been induced by me to accompany the command as the acting chaplain of the regiment. Already have I seen the good emanating from the regular services and prayers of this clergyman, as we have among us not a few communicants of the church, and I need not mention to you the good effect upon the popular mind here which the presence of one whose life is devoted to God and his country will have. I ask, therefore, that this gentleman may be appointed chaplain of my command, and that his commission may issue for the same. I am the more anxious for this last-mentioned appointment in that in having a fully commissioned and authenticated man of God with us, aside from the positive good to the command, the charges of land pirates and other unenviable sobriquets already preferred against us as parties to this partisan warfare may be the more fully met and refuted. For this gentleman, therefore, I ask this appointment.
Touching the services rendered by my command since we have been here, I will state that three spies have been captured—one of Virginia, the two others from Maryland. They are now in the jail of this county. I will send on in a day or so a detailed statement of the facts bearing upon their guilt, asking for instructions in their cases. My men keep the entire county of Hampshire thoroughly scouted, as well for the protection of the persons and property of loyal citizens as to watch the approach of hostile forces.
I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

the two 6*pounder iron guns intended for his command.

Will you investigate the matter, and if the ammunition has not already been sent, cause the same (four hundred rounds) to be shipped at once to General Garnett, to the care of Major Harman, at Staunton'?
Bespectfully,
E. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Camp Jackson, June 26,1861.
General S. Cooper :
My Dear Sir : I desire to furnish the President with some facts relative to the state of affairs in this region of the State, which it is important, in my judgment, he should understand. The remnant of the Union shriekers in this southwestern part of the State cannot relinquish the idea of building up a political power and party which will control affairs here and in the State generally. An important object with them is to get control of the military organization whenever they possibly can, and to prevent any where they cannot.
In the county of Washington, at Abingdon, a military depot was established by the direction of the governor for the reception of volunteers from the counties of Lee, Scott, Russell, and Washington. A good many men convened there, and after being mustered into the service of the State were sent to Richmond. After this a colonel appointed by the governor (Colonel Moore) was assigned to the command of the post. He is a worthy, brave, and excellent man, of the strongest secession opinions. A major was sent there with him.
Recently Mr. John A. Campbell, the present submission member of the Convention, from Washington County, has been parading the county with a view of raising what he calls “his regiment,” and left the impression that he had received the commission of colonel from the governor. There was convened about two hundred men under different captains at the Abingdon post, who refused to be mustered into the service, but who desired to stay in camp at public expense, under their own organization, awaiting the appointment of Mr. Campbell to a colonelcy, and in default of that determining to disband and go home. This is an expiring effort to keep alive the influence of the Union party in the county, and to extend it, if possible, to the surrounding ones. Colonel Moore refused to issue rations to these people unless they would muster into service, which they refused to do, and disbanded.
That little village is the seat of all Union-shrieking influences, and they are exerted to their utmost upon all volunteer companies that come there. I am sure the best thing that can be done is at once to order away all the companies now there to Richmond, and to break up the encampment. Lynchburg will answer every purpose now for a receiving depot for all the west, and Colonel Moore could be assigned to duty in the field, which he would be glad of. If Campbell is allowed to get the commission of colonel, and to establish himself at Abingdon, it will exert a very injurious influence in this section of the State, by encouraging the Union spirit, now struggling for life in the county of Washington, but which is in the ascendency in the adjoining counties of Carter and Johnson, in Tennessee. The brother-in-law of this man

Campbell is one of the prominent leaders of the Lincoln x>arty in Tennessee, a coadjutor of Johnson, Kelson, and Brownlow, and any exercise of military authority by his brother-in-law in Virginia would prove extremely baleful to the cause we have so much at heart.
I am afraid this long letter will worry you, but I know the facts and views it contains are important to this section of the country, and I did not feel at liberty to withhold them from the President.

Sir: I received yesterday your letter of the 24th instant,* and duly remarked the contents. I dispatched a steamer, with a flag, to Old Point yesterday, and sent a letter to General Butler, informing him I forwarded some persons (the captain and crew of a Prussian bark, wrecked on the coast-some ladies and children, &c.), whose private affairs required them to go Korth. He could not be found to receive the letter, and the boat was detained several hours, as it appears Major-General Butler had himself gone over to the Bipraps, and, while the flag of truce was flying in the roads, he was firing (seven shots) from Sawyer’s rifled-gun upon our works at Sewell’s Point. Kobody hurt.

Colonel : I have just had the honor to receive your letter of the 24th instant. You ask on the part of the governor if Brigadier-General Meem has been authorized by me to raise two regiments from the Third Division of Virginia Militia. I respectfully reply he was ordered to do so by me. Permit me to remind you that in calling out the militia I am compelled to use the officers set over them, and in the absence of any means of knowing their character must suppose that in times like these none but competent persons are left in high military places. If General Meem is such a person as you describe, let me suggest that the authorities in Bichmond hold the remedy in their own hands, not I. I think that the belief you express a that the population from which these regiments would be taken is by no means loyal” is erroneous. Your strictures upon my order to General Meem imply strong disapproval— I suppose that of General Lee. If I am correct in so understanding you, would it not be well to countermand the order in question at headquarters ?
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

Col. George Deas, Assistant Adjutant-General, Richmond:
Sir : I received information yesterday from Major Hood, operating below with three companies of cavalry and one piece of artillery, that a steamer, with troops on board, landed on the other side of the Po-quosin Eiver, in a large barge, one hundred men at Mesick’s Point, where we had a vedette. The movement was evidently one of reconnaissance. They staid about fifteen minutes, re-embarked, and returned to Port Monroe. The day before yesterday Major Hood scoured the country to within two miles of Newport News, passing across it to the Warwick road; then to John Sinclair’s farm and New Market Bridge, and by the way of Back Eiver road to his station, at Bartlett’s, on the Poquosin. He did not meet or see any trace of an enemy. Yesterday, about evening, he learned that some three companies of the enemy had marched on the Warwick road, and taken up their position at Whiting’s house, this side of New Market Bridge. He detached a party last night to surprise the enemy, but on their arrival found that the enemy had returned to Newport News. These operations will continue. The day before yesterday I mustered in five infantry companies of militia, averaging some two hundred men, and one of cavalry. The infantry companies I stationed near their own houses, to meet three times a week, and in the mean time to attend to their crops and families. The larger number came from the Poquosin, supposed heretofore to have been of doubtful patriotism; but I think a large majority are true. I sent through Gloucester and this county yesterday for spades, shovels, &c., and my quartermaster required them from Eichmond.
It is necessary to make intrenchments and place a gun, protected by some infantry, at three or four points on this side of the Poquosin Eiver; also to fortify Harrod’s Mills, on the York road, and Young’s Mills, on the Warwick road. This line, thus fortified, could not be turned easily. From this I can operate in front of Bethel, to the north of the enemy, and be in reach of re-enforcements when pressed. If operations with infantry are carried on below this line, they will certainly be disastrous in the end, for there is not a position lower down that cannot be turned by the enemy, and in much greater force than ourselves, and should a disaster occur it would be complete, and involve, as a consequence, the loss, probably, of this place.
I do not mean that we should not make a dash into them with infantry and then return to our intrenchments. We must not stay with infantry sufficiently long in any one place below to allow the enemy to take it in the rear, it being in his power to do so at any time, if he knew our position perfectly. The flanks of the line I propose now to occupy are reasonably secure. The right is at the place designated by me to you before, and the left is thrown back to avoid the landing on the other side of the Poquosin. If the enemy becomes bold, while we are preparing, he will soon be taught prudence.
A company of the Fifteenth Eegiment Virginia Militia, mustered at Williamsburg, about a week ago, and which refused to march under its captain, I have had disarmed, marched here, and the ringleaders are now being tried. I have the guard-house full of zouaves, who will also be tried at once, the courts sitting without regard to hours.
This will be taken up by Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens, whom I send to Eichmond in obedience to your orders. Lieutenant-Colonel Coppens appears devoted to his duties, and, from my own observations, though

I could not disband the Zouaves, but let the officers resign, if they chose. The officers are gallant fellows, too, and I had hoped to have been able to have preserved to the country the services of all.

Sir : If you deem the suggestions of Commander Lewis feasible, you are authorized to detail five hundred troops for the purpose of co-operating with him. In doing this it would be proper to select from the different regiments under your command.
If, however, you do not concur with Commander Lewis in the feasibility of the undertaking, it will be proper for you to send a detachment of troops to Cone Biver to support him in the event he should find it necessary to run in at that point.

Dear Sir : General Holmes suggests that instead of obtaining volunteers from him, you order the Tennessee regiment to the duty required in our joint machinations against the “ peace and dignity11 of Abraham and the Pawnee, and that a line from you to Colonel Bate would u enthuse v them, &c. Captain Maury calls on you, at my request, to attend to this. Our Commander Lewis, of the Navy, will command the party afloat, and will succeed.

Brig. Gen. T. H. Holmes,
Commanding, &e., Fredericksburg, Fa.:
General : In answer to your letter of the 27th instant* I have to state that it has always been intended to erect a battery at Mathias Point, with a view of commanding the navigation of the Potomac, and guns, &c., have been prepared for the purpose. Its construction has been postponed, from the fact that it would be vigorously resisted by the troops of the U. S. Government, and from its exposed position would require a larger force to protect and defend it than was available. The erection of the battery is still desired if it can be accomplished; but if the point at Evansport will accomplish the same end, as you think probable, and as it possesses advantages which you mention, it is preferable to construct the proposed battery at said point; but before this can be decided on you are desired, with the aid of the naval officers on the Potomac, to make an examination of the river at that point, to ascertain its condition and character, and you are requested to do so as soon as practicable. There are three 9-inch columbiads now here that were intended for Mathias Point and can be used at Evansport if that point be preferred. There are no rifled 32-pounders. I think no unnecessary demonstration should be made to attract the enemy’s attention, either at Evansport or at Mathias Point, which might disclose our purpose.
Respectfully, &c.,
R. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Headquarters, Brooke1 s Station, June 28,1861. Hon. L. P. Walker, Secretary of War:
Sir : Pursuant to your instructions, received last night, I dispatched Colonel Bate, with the effective force of his regiment present, to support Commander Lewis, C. S. Navy. I consider the command (about four hundred) unnecessarily strong, as Colonel Bate is positively ordered to take no part in the expedition on the water. I sincerely hope your excellency will not consider me extra cautious in this matter, for when we consider that an indispensable requisite to success would be the absolute concealment of three hundred or four hundred men on a comparatively small steamer, and those men untrained volunteers, and that this is only one of several other contingencies equally difficult to be reconciled, it seems to me that success would be miraculous.!

from the State to the Confederate authorities, I inquired of General Lee if this transfer involved the necessity of u mustering” the Virginia troops into the service of the Confederate States, but received no answer. Lieutenant Washington was desired to obtain an answer to this question when in Richmond recently, and brought an affirmative verbal one.
An order in relation to the muster of the Virginia troops at the end of June, which followed him from General Lee’s headquarters, contained nothing on the subject, so that I am still uncertain.
If this form is necessary, be so good as to give me instructions. I have had no official information of the transfer of the Virginia troops to the Confederate Government.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier-General, 0. 8. Army.
Headquarters,
Boring's Mill, Warwick Road, Fa., June 30, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to report that the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux, about eighteen hundred strong, arrived here yesterday at 3 p. m., after a most arduous march, without meeting with the enemy, although we sought him under the guns of his works at Newport News.
The command started at 11 o’clock at night on the 28th instant, under my immediate orders, and marched, in a drenching rain, to near the points where the enemy’s sentinels were reported to be posted. Before our arrival, however, at that point, I caused a thorough examination to be made of the bridge at New Market and its immediate vicinity, and could find no evidence of its being fortified or even occupied. One of the objects of this night march, as I wrote the commanding general, was to surprise the enemy at that point, if in occupation of it, and to drive him back into his works. Finding no enemy here, I determined to pass, by a private road, to within a mile or a mile and a half of Newport News, to conceal my cavalry in the wood which skirts the road leading from that place to Fort Monroe, to place my infantry in ambush on a parallel road and near enough to give support to the cavalry, and await daybreak and the passage of parties between the two posts. I proceeded to execute this plan, not without hope, from the extreme inclemency of the weather and the suddenness of our movement, of being able to surprise and capture the work itself, which, I am told, is garrisoned by at least four thousand men. We had arrived in the immediate vicinity of the post, when a musket was discharged by one of our own men, and two negroes were seen running towards the enemy, making it very improbable that we should be able to accomplish our purpose by surprise. We nevertheless continued our march, and learning from a negro that some two hundred men of the enemy were quartered in a house near the work, I determined to surround it. It was now daylight. I therefore sent the cavalry in front of the house, while the infantry filed through a road in its rear, but, upon examination, it was found the enemy did not occupy it that night, having perhaps been deterred from turning out of their work by the violent rain. I nevertheless concealed my men a§ much as possible, showing a few of the cavalry, in order to entice a portion of the garrison to come out. They, however, remained close, and as I intended to return to Yorktown by the Warwick road, I marched up to this point, where I am establishing a post, stopping, however, three hours in sight of Newport News, in order to rest the men. We visited

many houses, which the enemy had pillaged the day before, and captured some negroes. We found a most respectable man (Captain Smith) and his family still living on their place, but subject to the threats, annoyances, robberies, and abuses of these unprincipled foes, who threatened their lives, as well as to burn their property, on the ground of their being secessionists. After leaving his house I addressed a letter to Col. Phelps, in command at Newport News, calling his attention to this improper and uncivilized conduct, and stating to him that it was not to be expected that the courtesy and humanity that had characterized our treatment of those who had fallen into our hands would continue if such conduct on the part of his officers and men was longer tolerated. I am satisfied this savage and cruel course towards individuals is in pursuance of orders from Washington, and in most cases to the disgust of the respectable portion of the officers, who are obliged to carry them out.
I leave Lieutenant-Colonel Dreux, with his battalion, here, and Stan-ard?s battery, with instructions to fortify his flanks and front, and to hold this position. I am in hopes that the demonstration of force made on this road now will rid the inhabitants, at least for a time, of the presence of the enemy.
The traitors in the neighborhood of Fort Monroe, through which we were compelled to march, no doubt communicated the fact as soon as we passed, for about daylight signal-guns were fired from the fort to give warning to Newport News.

You will I>erceive, by my letter to you in reference to the erection of a battery, which you proposed at Evansport, that the establishment of one at Mathias Point cannot be decided on until you ascertain which point is the most preferable. I have, however, requested three 9-inch columbiads, with their carriages, ammunition, &c., to be forwarded to you, that you may have them in readiness for whichever point may be determined on. While this matter is undecided, I would recommend that you adopt such measures as may be in your power to allay the apprehensions of the enemy as to the occupation by us of either point. Before breaking ground at the point that you may select for the battery, it will be necessary to have everything in readiness for its speedy construction and a sufficient covering force prepared for its protection. I will endeavor to send you another regiment as soon as one is available, and have to request that you will endeavor to recruit your force from volunteers of the surrounding counties.

General : Your letter of the 23d instant, covering copy of dispatches received by you from Colonel Tompkins, has been duly received and laid before the Secretary of War.* In respect to so much of your letter as relates to the force under Colonel Tompkins, in companies, mustered into the State volunteer service, and which you ask to be mustered into your legion, I am instructed to say that as these companies, being within the district of your command, must necessarily come under your orders, they need not be mustered into the force authorized to be raised by you. If, however, any question should arise which might render it important to attach them by a special muster to your legion, you are fully authorized to cause them to be so mustered and attached.
Several companies, both horse and foot, have been sent to you from this quarter. Among them is a company of artillery, with a battery consisting of two 6-pounder guns and two 12-pounder howitzers, which with the two 6-pounders previously sent to you will complete the full battery originally intended for you.

The matter coming from the governor of Virginia in the form of an inquiry was submitted to you for reply, as none could be given from this office, and at that time it was not known that you had given any instructions on the subject.
