I. The Department of the Ohio is extended so as to embrace so much of Western Virginia and Pennsylvania as lies north of the Great Kanawha north and west of the Greenbrier, thence northward to the southwest corner of Maryland, thence along the Western Maryland line to the Pennsylvania line, and thence northerly to the northeast corner of McKean County, in Pennsylvania.
By order:
L. THOMAS,
Adjutant- General.
Washington, D. C., May 10,1861.
Brigadier-General Butler,
Commanding Department of Annapolis, Md.:
General : I am directed by the General-in-Chief to communicate to you the following decisions from the Secretary of War in reply to your highly interesting letter of May 8, 1861, in reference to affairs at Relay House, near Baltimore, Md.:
You are hereby directed to examine the baggage of passengers going west from Baltimore, seizing all caps and munitions of war; also to stop all provisions going west, returning them to the consignees. As to groceries you may permit them to pass if you deem it expedient. You will allow the volunteers referred to in your paper to pass unmolested, and give orders for the cattle at Bellaire to pass to Baltimore as suggested.
I need not add that your course is fully approved by the War Department.
I am, &c.,
E. D. TOWNSEND,
A ssistant A djiita nt- General.
Washington, May 11, 1861.
Brig. Gen. B. F. Butler,
Commanding Department of Annapolis :
General : General Scott is informed of certain reported irregularities committed by troops guarding road from Annapolis to Junction. It being represented to him that there are quartermaster horses at Annapolis or others available for such service, also saddles and bridles sufficient to mount fifty men, it has been suggested to him that if fifty mounted men could be posted at Millersville, half way from Annapolis to Junction, a guard of infantry at Annapolis depot, a guard at Beltsville

also of infantry, you would be able, by causing mounted patrols say of ten men each, passing from Millersville to Annapolis and from Millers-viile to Annapolis Junction, to secure tire police of the road, especially as it has to be passed over by working parties after each heavy train to repair breaks, ccc.—be enabled to concentrate at such points as you may deem expedient, say either the Junction or Annapolis, the small detachments of the Fifth New York, now strung along the road; by which means the discipline of the troops may be improved and the opportunities for irregularities lessened. These are only suggestions. General Scott does not desire horses to be purchased for this service, but if not already at Annapolis, horses may be expected to arrive from day to day, or the men attached to battery of Sixth and Eighth New York might be detailed for this service. The Chief of the QuartermasteFs Department sees no objection for this use of the number of horses specified from those of his department should they be on hand or arrive. The details of this arrangement, if it meet'with your approval, are left entirely to your discretion. This is a letter of suggestions, not orders, so far as relates to this matter.
The General-in-Chief desires you, as Baltimore is within your department, to issue an order to Lieut. Thomas Grey, Second Artillery, now discharging the duties of acting assistant commissary of subsistence at Baltimore, to perform the duties of acting assistant quartermaster at the same point.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SCHUYLEB HAMILTON, Lieutenant-Colonel and Military /Secretary.
Belay House, May 11, 1861.
The Secretary of War:
From the dispatch I received from Captain Hamilton I fear that in the haste to inform you of the capture of the steam gun I may have laid myself open to the censure of having claimed more credit than belonged, therefore beg leave to briefly state the facts, viz:
Yesterday I received information of the gun having left Baltimore. I immediately informed Colonel Lyons, who was left in command of the brigade by General Butler, of the rumor. He deemed it unreliable, and not worthy of notice. I did not have full confidence in the report, but still thought it of sufficient importance to be looked after. It was filially decided to send one company from Colonel Lyons7 regiment, one from my command, and two pieces from the light artillery. 1 arranged tor a train (by seizure), and had embarked the light artillery with their horses and the company from my command, and started the train. When the company from Colonel Lyons appeared I stopped the train, and they went aboard. B. B. Hare, esq., a gentleman connected with General Butler’s, staff, volunteered and went forward on horseback, and overtook the gun, which was in the charge of two men, and captured it alone, and with the assistance of the neighbors held it until the arrival of the train. It has been brought into camp, and I shall set some machinist at work to-day to get some knowledge of it.
Your obedient servant,
EDWABD F. JONES,
Colonel Sixth Massachusetts.

CORRESPONDENCE, ETC—UNION.
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, IY., Map 11, 1801.
Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, I). C.:
Sir: I forward for the information of the General-in-Chief, on a department return, a detailed statement of the regiments blustered into the service of the United States, which are or have been in the department, and the present condition of the equipments.* Eight regiments in excess in the Pennsylvania quota arises from troops having been mustered in at this place by authority and no attention taken of them at Harrisburg. 1 have urged and pressed the equipping of these regiments. The commander of Frankford Arsenal reports he cannot till, before the 2oth instant the orders now in his possession for twelve regiments, three of which are at Chambersburg and three at York. Ho requisition for ordnance equipments for General Hegley’s command has-been received, and Lieutenant Treadwell, the ordnance officer at the arsenal, is, by orders from Washington, providing only for twelve thousand four hundred men, the Pennsylvania quota. I am aware that Maryland has been invaded from Virginia at Harper’s Ferry, but in the present condition of my command am powerless.
I make the above statement that the General-in-Chief may not rely at present upon these regiments in his plan of attack upon Harper’s. Ferry. By Wednesday of the coming week one regiment at York and two in this city will be provided with accouterments. I request to be informed if troops from York are to march through or around Baltimore, and whether the regiments on that line are to be pushed to Washington. The railroad hence to Baltimore will be opened in a few days. I desire also to be informed if there is any objection to using; this route through Baltimore.
I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON,
Major- General, Comm anding.
Philadelphia, May 13,1861.
Hon. Simon Cameron, Washington :
Dear Sir: I called to-day on Mr. Thomson, as requested, but did not see him, as he is at home sick.
I have discharged a large number of firopellers, and will continue to rapidly reduce the number employed. I shall not, however, impair the efficiency of the route via Perryville and Annapolis until I receive further instructions. But as the route is now open between Philadelphia and Washington via Baltimore, and also between Harrisburg and Washington by the way of the Northern Central, I think the number of steamers plying between Perryville and Annapolis may be still further reduced, say to three or four, unless you wish to continue to make this line the chief route, about which I shall be glad to have your instructions.
I saw Mr. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, on Friday last. I am perfectly satisfied that he will now voluntarily and cheerfully make the road from Baltimore to Washington entirely subservient to the purposes of the Government. He thinks, and Mr. Felton concurs in the opinion, that the troops, &c., can pass through

Baltimore without any danger of an attack. This is the quickest route, of course. I think that both of these companies will reduce their regular charges thirty-three and a third per cent, for all Government purposes. I hope that the Camden and Amboy Company will consent to a similar reduction. If so, I am now inclined to think that this route will be the cheapest, and it will certainly be the most simple way of transacting the business.
I am acquiring information about iron propellers suitable for gunboats, about which I will report to-morrow or next day. Anything of the kind that is required can be built as quickly as it can be procured from England.
Knowing the value of your time, I shall make my communications as brief as possible.
I remain, dear sir, vours, verv respectfully,
JOHN TUCKER.
Headquarters Department of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, Pa., May 14, 1861. To the Assistant Adjutant-General,
Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C,:
Sir : A few minutes since I received a telegram from the commander at York stating General Butler, on Federal Hill, Baltimore, had sent a special messenger for re-enforcements. At the same time came another from Col. Andrew Porter stating the Northern Central Railroad was insecure and should be guarded by at least two regiments.
Lest the re-enforcements should be checked by an injury to the road I immediately, as I telegraphed you, changed the route of the command to leave to-day to the direct one, and have arranged for General Cad-walader to land at Locust Point to-morrow morning at daybreak.
General Keiin has been directed to secure to day the Northern Central Road, after which other troops, as they are prepared, will be pushed over the route. Two regiments will leave here on Thursday.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
R. PATTERSON,
Major General, Commanding.
