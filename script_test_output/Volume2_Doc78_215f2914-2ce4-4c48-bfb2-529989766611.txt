No. 4.
Report of Maj. M. G. Harman, Virginia Volunteers.
Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Staunton, Fa., June 6, 1861.
Sir : Inclosed is a copy of a letter that I have written to Colonel Porterfield, at Beverly. From this you will perceive that, while I have received no communication from Colonel Porterfield informing me of the wants of his command, learning of their great need of supplies of ammunition from private sources, I have dispatched an express to him with a supply. From all the information that I have received I am pained to have to express my conviction that Colonel Porterfield is entirely unequal to the position which he occupies. The affair at Philippi was a disgraceful surprise, occurring about daylight, there being no picket guard or guard of any kind on duty. The only wonder is that our men were not cut to pieces. They were all asleep, and were only aroused by the firing of the enemy. The safety of the Northwest and of our inexperienced soldiers depends upon an immediate change of commanders, and giving the command to a bold and experienced leader.
I start in the morning the expedition under Lieutenant-Colonel Heck, under escort of two companies of cavalry, three companies of infantry, and one artillery company, with a battery, if the Tennessee company arrives. I send a large supply of provisions, fifteen hundred muskets, clothing, and all the ammunition that I can raise. I have arranged to concentrate the militia on the route, which will join Colonel Heck, and will be armed by him as they come in. I have the arrangements in progress to start promptly the detachment, which, I am informed, will be sent up on Saturday to this point. We are sadly in want of ammunition, our whole supply being exhausted by this expedition. I hope you will have a sufficient supply forwarded as early as possible to this point.
I would again urge rapid re-enforcements to regain possession of the Northwest, and that I shall receive authority from you to call out and arm the companies from all the valley counties, and send them to that quarter, instead of their going, as heretofore directed, to their different rendezvous. Send up five thousand flint-lock muskets from Richmond and I will have them overhauled and put in order for use. We shall need these in addition to what we have.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. G. HARMAN,
Major, Commanding.
Maj. Gen. R. E. Lee, Richmondy Va.

Col. G. A. Porterfield,
Commanding Virginia Forces, Beverly, Va.:
Colonel : I send you a supply of ammunition by Messrs. Trotter and Crawford, an account of which is herewith inclosed.
To-morrow I shall send you a field battery, accompanied by cavalry and infantry, which will be joined by other troops on the way, and the whole force will report to you at Beverly. On the day following, from two to three thousand troops will be sent to you by President Davis from Bichmond. 1 have received a telegraphic dispatch from the commander-in-chief of our army, saying: u Send a messenger to Colonel Porterfield to be valiant and maintain his ground until relief reaches him. Send him supplies, if he wants them.”
Having received no official communication from you, but learning from private sources, since the disaster to our arms at Philippi, that you are almost without ammunition, I have determined to send you a supply by express. I inclose duplicate receipts for the munitions sent, which you will please sign and return to me. Please keep in daily communication with me by couriers until relief reaches you.
Very respectfully,
M. G. HABMANT,
Major, Commanding.

General Lee.
Headquarters of Virginia Forces,
Huttonsville, Va., June 9,1861.
Sir: I have the honor to address you as regards the state of my command. The force here now numbers about one thousand, of which one hundred and eighty are cavalry and the balance infantry. This force is not only deficient in drill, but ignorant, both officers and men, of the most ordinary duties of the soldier. With efficient drill officers they might be made effective; but I have to complain that the field officers sent to command these men are of no assistance to me, and are, for the most part, as ignorant of their duties as the company officers, and they as ignorant as the men. I hope, if I am continued in command, that good staff officers may be sent, to aid in organizing this raw force, than which there is none more so now in the service. I have not been able to even get proper returns made out to send to your headquarters, and my own reputation has been injured by the character of my command; in fact, if it had been intended to sa%rifice me, I could not have expected less support than I have had. If it is expected that the troops here should take the field effectively, it is necessary that at least five thousand well-drilled men should be sent at once, as the enemy’s army is being daily re-enforced $ and if aid is not soon sent, it will be impossible to keep the open field, even as a mere corps of observation, but will have to retire to the mountains, where it will be most difficult, if not impossible, to provision even this small force. I have been reliably in-

formed that two companies of negroes, armed and uniformed, have been seen at Fairmont. The country to the northwest is in a state of revolution, all law-abiding citizens being driven off by the traitors, assisted by Northern troops. The private property of secessionists, but otherwise inoffensive citizens, their cattle, young unbroken horses and colts, and the clothing of women and children, have been seized and taken off from citizens of Philippi. Captain Alexander will give verbally any additional information that may be desired as to the condition of this command.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO. A. PORTERFIELD,
Colonel of Volunteers, Commanding.
Col. R. S. Garnett,
Adjutant-General Virginia Forces, Richmond, Va.
Headquarters Virginia Forces, Randolph County, Va., June 11,1861.
Sir: I omitted to state in my last report that Lieut. Col. William L. Jackson, Virginia Volunteers, had reported to me for duty. He has been very active, and will become a most useful officer. Colonel Willey, who has also been very zealous and useful, was left sick in Philippi. 1 have assurance that he shall be well treated.
The enemy remains at Philippi, where they are reported to have about five thousand men, and are fortifying themselves. The same number are said to be at Grafton. From five hundred to one thousand are said to be at the Cheat River Bridge; but of this I have no reliable information. Other forces are stationed at different points on the railroads. I understand their object to be to occupy the western part of the State, to the Alleghanies or Blue Ridge, if possible. The greatest outrages have, in numerous cases, been perpetrated upon the private property of secessionists. Some militia companies have recently joined this command. A regiment from Tennessee is expected here to-morrow, having in charge, as I am informed, some pieces of heavy artillery. No pieces heavier than 6-pounders should be sent to this country, until some position is selected to be fortified and a strong and reliable infantry force sent to support it. I am not informed what quantity of ammunition is in Staunton. I have never received any other than the most limited supplies from that place. The percussion caps sent have nearly all been of small size for shot-guns and not large enough for muskets. As re-enforcements are now expected, and we shall have active service in this part of the State, I desire to be continued on duty here. It was not until after repeated calls for aid, aijd when left with a small militia force entirely unprepared for the field, that I asked for duty elsewhere. Beverly is now occupied by our cavalry.

GEO. A. PORTERFIELD, Colonel of Volunteers, Commanding.

preciate the difficulties you have had to encounter. General E. S. Garnett, 0. S. Army, has been sent to take command in the Northwest, with such a force as was disposable. It is hoped that he will soon reach the scene of action, that a more agreeable state of things will be inaugurated, and that loyal-spirited citizens of the country will be encouraged and enabled to put down the revolution which you mention. Your services will be very valuable to General Garnett, in giving him information as to the state of affairs in the country under his command, and in aiding him to achieve the object of his campaign.
