By command of the Secretary of War:
JNO. WITHERS, Assistant Adjutant-General.
Headquarters Department of Alexandria,
Gamp Pickens, June 5, 1861.
To the good People of the Counties of Loudoun, Fairfax, and Prince
William :
A reckless and unprincipled tyrant has invaded your soil. Abraham Lincoln, regardless of all moral, legal, and constitutional restraints, has thrown his abolition hosts among you, who are murdering and imprisoning your citizens, confiscating and destroying your property, and committing other acts of violence and outrage too shocking and revolting to humanity to be enumerated. All rules of civilized warfare are abandoned, and they proclaim by their acts, if not on their banners, that their war-cry is u Beauty and booty .” All that is dear to man, your honor, and that of your wives and daughters, your fortunes, and your lives, are involved in this momentous contest.
In the name, therefore, of the constituted authorities of the Confederate States, in the sacred cause of constitutional liberty and self-government, for which we are contending, in behalf of civilization and humanity itself, I, G. T. Beauregard, brigadier-general of the Confederate States, commanding at Camp Pickens, Manassas Junction, do make this ray proclamation, and invite and enjoin you by every consideration dear to the hearts of freemen and patriots, by the name and memory of your revolutionary fathers, and by the purity and sanctity of your domestic firesides, to rally to the standard of your State and country, and by every means in your power compatible with honorable warfare to drive back and expel the invaders from your land. I conjure you to be true and loyal to your country and her legal and constitutional authorities, and especially to be vigilant of the movements and acts of the enemy, so as to enable you to give the earliest authentic information to these headquarters or to the officers under my command. 1 desire to assure you that the utmost protection in my power will be extended to you all.
G. T. BEAUREGARD, Brigadier- General, Commanding.
Headquarters,
Harper’s Ferry, Fa., June 6,1861. General R. E. Lee, Commander-in-chief\ Richmond, Ya.:
General : I had the honor to receive your letter of the 3d instant by the last mail. My object in writing each of the several communications in relation to this command was to ascertain exactly the manner in which the Government wishes it to be used, no instructions having

been given to me. Do these troops constitute a garrison or a corps of observation ? If the former (which your letter of the 3d implies somewhat), it is to be considered that our only defensible position has a front of nearly two miles; that the supply of ammunition is not more than sufficient to repel one vigorous assault, and that the position could not then be evacuated, as the enemy would be nearer than ourselves to the only line of retreat—that through Loudoun. If as a corps of observation, it will have a task which the best troops would find difficult, for the enemy north of us can find crossing places too numerous for this force even to observe, and, while watching them, it is likely to be cut off by the troops from Ohio, who you know are commanded by a man of great ability. The operations of these troops and those from Pennsylvania will no doubt be combined. A retreat from the presence of an enemy is the most difficult of military operations to the best troops. To very new ones it is impossible. It would very soon become a flight.
You say that u the abandonment of Harper’s Ferry would be depressing to the cause of the South.” Would not the loss of five or six thousand men be more so ? And, if they remain here, they must be captured or destroyed very soon after General McClellan’s arrival in the valley. Might it not be better (after the troops here have delayed the enemy as long by their presence as they prudently can) to transfer them to some point where they may still be useful?
We have, according to the statement of the Master of Ordnance, about forty rounds of ammunition, besides eighty-two thousand five hundred cartridges, just received, which makes an addition of about four rounds, as there are with them but twenty-two thousand five hundred caps.
Notice of the arrival of the Tennessee regiment in Winchester is just received. The colonel informs me that they are without percussion caps.
Our troops are not equipped for a campaign. More than two regiments are without cartridge-boxes. Most of them having traveled by railroad, use trunks and valises, instead of knapsacks, and few are provided Avith shoes fit for marching.
With money I could have obtained more caps probably. I have not thought it worth while to provide a supply of provisions out of proportion to that of ammunition.
I offer these opinions for what they are worth, thinking it my duty to present them to you, and being anxious to conform closely to whatever general plan of operations has been determined upon. I beg you, therefore, to let me understand my position.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier-General, C. $. Army.
Adjutant and Inspector General’s Office,
Richmond, June 6, 1801. Brig. Gen. Henry A. Wise, Richmond, Va.:
Sir : Having been appointed brigadier-general of Provisional Forces, you will proceed, with the force placed at your disposal, by the most speedy route of communication, to the valley of the Kanawha. You will, by such means and agencies as may be within your control, rally the people of that valley and the adjoining counties to resist and repel

tlie invading army, which is reported to he on its march towards Lewis-burg, which may as probably be directed towards the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, by any of the various routes between that indicated in the valley of the Big Sandy River. You must needs rely upon the arms among the people to supply the requisite armament, and upon their valor and knowledge of the country as a substitute for organization and discipline. If there be any who have arms beyond their X)Ower or will to use, you can take them, with such arrangement as the case may indicate for future settlement. As your transportation will of course be very limited, and the service of such character as will indicate the lightest practicable train, the troops must be taught to rely upon the supplies of the country, but not be permitted to take them except through officers authorized for that purpose, and they should be instructed always to make prompt payment, or to give such receipts as will insure early and adequate remuneration. All officers commanding separate parties should be instructed to unite with the greatest vigilance and closest scrutiny the highest regard for the personal and j>roperty rights of all with whom they may come in contact, save the common enemy of the State, towards whom the rules of war, as known to civilized nations, will be applied.
The imperfect information possessed of the force and objects of the enemy do not permit sj)ecific instructions either as to your line of operations or the movements to be made. You must exercise a sound discretion, so that all your efforts may tend to the result of repelling the enemy if possible, and if not, of checking him as near the border of our territory as may be practicable. If the disparity of numbers should be very great, your defensive positions will for the present necessarily be retired to the mountain passes, and sorties against the enemy should always be so made as to embarrass and delay his movements without hazarding the loss of detachments from your command, teaching them to wait until you have the means to strike a blow which shall be effective. The several officers of experience who have been directed to report to you will be assigned by you to such duties as the necessities of the case may require.
General Flovd, who has been appointed a brigadier-general, has been specially charged with the protection of the line of the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. It may well occur that a junction of your forces may become desirable, in which event each should exhibit his letters of instructions to the other, so that you may cordially co-operate to attain the common object of both. In the event of such a junction, and whilst serving together, General Floyd, being senior by commission, will, according to the Rules and Articles of War, command the whole.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.
June 10, 1861.
P. S.—Such volunteers as may be engaged for your command and sent forward to Lewisburg within the next twenty days will be there mustered into service by companies and their transportation paid to that point, it being understood that these volunteers are not to betaken from any of the organized regiments or companies now in the service of the Confederate States.
S. COOPER,
Adjutant and Inspector General.

Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Va., June 7, 1861. Maj. M. G. Harman, Commanding at Staunton, Fa.;
Major : Your letter of June 6 has been received,# and I desite to express my approbation of your conduct in forwarding re-enforcements of men and supplies of arms, ammunition, provisions, and clothing to Colonel Porterfield, at Beverly.
Brig. Gen. B. S. Garnett has been appointed to the command of the troops at Beverly and in that region, and will proceed there at once. All the troops that can be spared from this point will be forwarded as last as practicable to General Garnett, and it is hoped that these, in addition to the forces now there and those which can be hereafter raised in that region, will form an adequate force for the protection of the northwestern part of the State.
I am, very respectfully, &c.,
E. E. LEE, General, Commanding.
Headquarters Virginia Forces,
Richmond, Fa., June 7,1861.
General Joseph E. Johnston,
Commanding, cfic., Harper’s Ferry, Fa.:
General: I have had the honor to receive your letter of the 6th instant. The importance of the subject has induced me to lay it before the President, that he may be informed of your views. He places great value upon our retention of the command of the Shenandoah Valley and the position at Harper’s Ferry. The evacuation of the latter would interrupt our communication with Maryland, and injure our cause in that State. He does not think it probable that there will be an immediate attack by troops from Ohio.
General K. S. Garnett, C. S. Army, with a command of four thousand men, has been directed to Beverly, to arrest the progress of troops towards the Shenandoah Valley. Col. Angus W. McDonald has also been sent to interrupt the passage of troops over the Baltimore and Ohio Bailroad. It is hoped by these means that you will be relieved from an attack in that direction, and will have merely to resist an attack in front from Pennsylvania.
An effort will be made to send you cartridge-boxes and knapsacks for the two regiments that are without them, and also an additional supply of ammunition. Greater mobility might be given to your forces by directing their surplus baggage, trunks, valises, &c., to be returned home or sent to some place of safety. Another regiment from Georgia has been ordered to report to you, viz, Colonel Gartrell’s. It is hoped that you will be able to be timely informed of the approach of troops against you, and retire, provided they cannot be successfully opposed. You must exercise your discretion and judgment in this respect, to insure, if possible, your safety. Precise instructions cannot be given you, but, being informed of the object of the campaign, you will be able to regulate its conduct to the best advantage.
I am, general, &c.,
B. E. LEE,
General, Commanding.

Maj. Gen. E. E. Lee, Commanding Forces of Virginia:
Sir: The great difficulty of communicating with and supplying our batteries on the Nansemond Kiver has retarded the work on them, and been of serious inconvenience to us. I determined to put a small steamer on the river, and on the night before last Capt. A. Sinclair took the small steamer Eoanoke, which Commodore Forrest had chartered and put at my disposal. Captain Sinclair ran her in very handsomely, without being discovered by the guard-boats of the enemy, and she is now on the river; and, in connection with the railroad to Suffolk, puts us in easy communication with all the batteries on the Nansemond Eiver.
