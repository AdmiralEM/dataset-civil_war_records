Headquarters Third Brigade,
Camp Pettus, August 3, 1861.
In obedience to instructions conveyed by circular of the 1st of August,, instant, I have the honor to submit the following report of my brigade,, at that time composed of the Fifth South Carolina Eegiment and Seventeenth and Eighteenth Eegiments of Mississippi Volunteers, for the 18th day of July, during the battle fought on that day at Blackburn’^ Ford, on Bull Bun:
My command was placed in position at McLean’s Ford, on Bull Bunr and did not participate in the engagement of that date. The enemy in some force occupied a position on Eocky Eun, about one mile and a half in front and to the left of my position, and were prevented from making a nearer reconnaissance of our lines by the vigilance of my pickets, which were kept well in advance.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Col. Thomas Jordan,
Act. Asst. Adjt. Gen., First Corps, Army of the Potomac.
