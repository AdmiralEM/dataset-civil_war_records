No. 10.
Report of Brig, Gen. Joseph E, Johnston, C. & Army.*
Headquarters, Darkesville, July 4,1861.
General : I respectfully transmit herewith Colonel Jackson’s report of his operations, including those of Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart’s Cavalry, on the 2d and 3d instants. This report gives most satisfactory evidence of the skill of these two officers and the efficiency of the troops under their command. Each of these two officers has, since the commencement of hostilities, been exercising the command corresponding to the next grade above the commission he holds, and proved himself fully competent to such command. I therefore respectfully recommend that Colonel Jackson be promoted without delay to the grade of brigadier-general, and Lieutenant-Colonel Stuart to that of colonel.
Most respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. E. JOHNSTON, Brigadier General, C. 8. Army.
General Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General.
