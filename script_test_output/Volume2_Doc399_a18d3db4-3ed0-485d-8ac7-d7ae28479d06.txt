Great credit is due Lieut. Col. C. W. Boberts, Maj. George Varney, and Adjutant Keynolds for their coolness and courage on the field under the heavy fire that was thinning our ranks.
Capt. E. N. Jones fell mortally wounded w hile exhibiting great courage in rallying his men to the charge. Sergeant William J. Dean fell severely wounded while nobly bearing the beautiful California stand of colors presented to the regiment the day before by the ladies of San Francisco formerly residents of Maine. The colors were lost, but regained. My thanks are due Capt. F. C. Foss, Sergeant Samuel Hinckley, of Company A, and Corporal Benjamin Smart, Company H, for important extra services rendered during the day; also to Sergeant G. W. Brown, Company F; A. J. Knowles and L. Carver, Company D; A. P. Jones and H. W. Wheeler, Company A; Peter Welch, Company I, for nobly volunteering to accompany me to remove the dead and wounded from the field under a very heavy fire of artillery and musketry.
I am, very respectfullv, your obedient servant,

Colonel Second Regiment Maine Volunteers.
