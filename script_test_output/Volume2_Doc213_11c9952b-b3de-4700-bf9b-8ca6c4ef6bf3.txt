Letter from Lieut Got John Pegram, C. S. Army.
Headquarters at Mr. Kittleâ€™s House,
Near Tygarfs Valley River, 0 Miles from Beverly, July 12,1861. Commanding Officer of Northern Forces, Beverly, Va. :
Sir : I write to state to you that I have, in consequence of the retreat of General Garnett, and the jaded and reduced condition of my command, most of them having been without food for two days, concluded, with the concurrence of a majority of my captains and field officers, to surrender my command to you to-morrow as prisoners of war. I have only to add, I trust they will only receive at your hands such treatment as has been invariably shown to the Northern prisoners by the South.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
JOHN PEGEAM,
Lieutenant-Colonel, P. A. G. 8., Commanding.
