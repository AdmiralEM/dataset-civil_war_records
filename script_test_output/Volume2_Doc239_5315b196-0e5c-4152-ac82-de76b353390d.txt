Report of First Lieut. Charles W. Statham, Lee Battery, 0. 8. Army, of the engagement at Rich Mountain.
Eich Mountain Pass, July 13,1861.
Sir : I have to report that on the 11th instant, by your order, I moved with one gun and a detachment of twenty-one men to occupy this pass in Eich Mountain. We took our position about 1 o’clock p. m. In less than two hours the enemy made their appearance in large column, six regiments strong, immediately on the hill south of the pass. We reversed our gun, which was pointed down the pass, and prepared to receive the enemy in the direction in which he was approaching. In a few minutes the sharpshooters of the enemy commenced a fire upon us from behind trees and rocks at a distance ranging from two to three hundred yards, the body of the enemy being still farther. We opened upon the main body with spherical shot, which I cut at first one second and a quarter, and could distinctly see them burst in their midst. I knew we did good execution, as I could distinctly hear their officers give vehement commands to close up ranks. After "firing this way some little time at the rate of near four shots per minute we forced the enemy to retire.
In about twenty minutes the enemy reappeared in a column of three regiments, advanced briskly upon us, when we moved our gun a little higher up the opposite hill and again opened upon them, and with our spherical shot cut as low as one second down to three-quarters. After

firing rapidly for some time the enemy again beat a hasty retreat, when my men, including the infantry not yet in action, rent the air with their shouts, confidently believing that we had gained the day. But in a short time the enemy again formed and renewed the attack with more swiftness than before, and soon played havoc with our horses. These, with the caisson, ran down the mountain, with drivers and all, leaving us with only the small amount of ammunition in our limber-box. We then limbered and moved our gun near a small log stable, behind which we placed our horses for protection. By this time our men were falling fast. Sergeant Turner, of the gun, had both legs broken and shot through the body; I. I. Mays had his left arm splintered with a musket ball ; Isaiah Ryder shot through the head, and died instantly; John A. Taylor had his thigh broken; E. H. Kersey, shot in the ankle; Lewis Going, wounded in the arm; William W. Stewart, badly wounded in the head and breast. This left me but few to man the gun. Captain De Lagnel, who was the commander of the post, having his horse shot under him and seeing our crippled condition, gallantly came and volunteered his valuable aid, and helped load and fire three or four times, when he was shot in the side, and, I think, in the hand. He then ordered us to make our escape, if we could, but the enemy was too close, and his fire too severe, to admit of safe retreat to many of us. I was shot through the right hand, and am now a prisoner, with the following of my men: Warren Currin, B. H. Davidson, James B. Creasey, William H. Broyles, and R. W. Walker. The rest of my command made their escape. I suppose we killed and wounded of the enemy some three hundred or more.
I take great pleasure in saying that my command in this fight, both those with guns and those in the artillery, acted heroically, and deserve the highest commendation. Private W. H. Broyles was the last to leave the gun, and pricked the last cartridge that we fired.

Report of Lieut. John R. Massey, Lee Battery, G. 8. Army, of the engagement at Rich Mountain.
Camp Alleghany,
Focahontas County, Fa., August 8, 1861.
Sir: On the morning of the 11th of July, 1861, I was stationed, with one gun and detachment under my command, in a gorge on the left of the front breastworks at Camp Garnett, near the Rich Mountain, in the county of Randolph, Ya.
On the morning of the 11th of July you notified me to hold myself in readiness for prompt action. Between 10 and 11 o’clock a. m. I was informed by Colonel Heck that it was your order that my gun should be moved to the top of the Stonecoal Hill, which was on the extreme left of the camp in front. I moved to that position thereafter. Discovering a number of the enemy’s cavalry on top of Rich Mountain, opposite Hart’s house, about one and a half miles in the rear of our breastworks, I requested Colonel Heck to inform Colonel Pegram.

OPERATIONS IN MD., PA., VA., AND W. VA.
[Chap. IX.
About 12h o’clock the firing of a gun at Hart’s Hill, on Rich Mountain, commenced. After the fire of that gun had continued for some time forty or fifty of the enemy’s infantry appeared on the turnpike road in front of our breastworks. I commenced firing on them as they retired. The fire on the Rich Mountain continued for some time—between two and three hours. Shortly after its cessation the enemy commenced chopping and working with picks on the ascent of the hill called the Sugar Hill, on my left. While this was going on we heard the noise of gun-carriages ascending the hill. The day had been cloudy and rainy. The appearance of the sun about thirty minutes discovered to me a large body of the enemy’s infantry marching along the side of Sugar Hill next to me. The sun was now about an hour high. I commenced firing upon them. The enemy were evidently thrown into confusion and retired.
The loss of the enemy, I have been informed, in killed and wounded, was twenty-seven. In my detachment there were none killed or wounded. The men under my command, non-commissioned officers and privates, all performed their duty promptly and efficiently.
Remaining at my position, between 2 and 3 o’clock a. m. July 12 I was ordered to spike my gun and retreat. The companies supporting my gun all retired from the hill. At length a man came up the hill and spiked the gun, being ordered to do so, as he said, by Colonel Pegram. I then returned to the camp, and found the companies in camp forming to retreat. Captain Anderson and Lieutenant Raine had gone with Colonel Pegram and a portion of his command to make a night attack upon the enemy, and had not returned. Lieutenant Statham had been wounded at Rich Mountain, and was a prisoner. The command of the company devolving upon me, I ordered the musketeers to get their guns. I marched them and the cannoneers down into the road, and finally effected our retreat with the loss of the prisoners taken at Rich Mountain and a few others, in all amounting to eighteen men.
