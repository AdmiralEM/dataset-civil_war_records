Report of Brig. Gen. G. W. Mill, Ohio Militia, of operations from July 4
to 19.
Headquarters U. S. Volunteers,
Grafton, Va.y July 22, 1861.
Sir : I have the honor to submit the following statement of facts, showing the operations of my command in attempting to intercept the retreat and to capture a portion of General Garnett’s army from Laurel Hill.
When I was first assigned to duty here, the Cheat Biver line was in the hands of Col. J. Irvine’s command (Sixteenth Ohio Begiment), and he continued in charge of the line until the night of the 15th instant. On the 1st instant I went over the line with Colonel Irvine from Bowles-burg to the Cheat Biver Bridge, five miles above, and there gave him in writing all of the instructions which I had received from the department headquarters touching that line. The instructions as given to me and thus imparted contemplated Bowlesburg as the point of support on the railroad, and West Union, distant thirteen miles, as the place for the advance guard to the eastward, with scouts farther east, and as soon as practicable an advance guard towards or at Saint George. Intermediate points were to be held, and for the whole, including the protection of the three bridges on the railroad, the garrison was to be increased early to 1,000 men. From the 4th to the 6th instant a minute reconnaissance of the line was carried on by my order by Col. Charles Whittlesey and Maj. J. B. Frothingham, engineers, and the conclusions arrived at reported on the 6th to department headquarters.
On the 7th instant twenty-five cavalry, to serve as vedettes, couriers, and pickets, were added to Colonel Irvine’s command, as had also been a 6-pounder field piece.
On the 12th instant six companies of the Eighth Ohio, under Colonel Depuy, had joined Colonel Irvine, moving in by way of Oakland and Chisholm’s mill; and the garrison at Bowlesburg and thence five miles up Cheat Biver was held by six companies of the Fifteenth Ohio, under Col. G. W. Andrews and two companies of the First Virginia.
On the 9th Colonel Irvine telegraphed as follows: aOur increased knowledge clearly indicates the occupancy of the junction (Bed House) as the proper position for our troops.” Beferring him to the instructions already given, and the views of Colonel Whittlesey and Major Frothingham, Colonel Irvine was informed on the same day that he “must act on his best judgment.”
On the 12th instant Colonel Irvine telegraphed me that he intended to move eastward along the northwest pike. He says: “My main force will be at the mill mentioned (Chisholm’s), eight miles from Oakland, with strong advance guard at the Bed House, say two hundred or three hundred men.” Our telegraphic correspondence was frequent each day, and conducted with a view to keep each other fully advised of all material facts.
On the 13th of July I was called in from Webster at about 11 a. m., and then I received a telegram from Maj. S. Williams, dated the 12th, at Beverly, and at Boaring Bun the 13th, saying:
General McClellan, having just learned that the rebel forces abandoned their positions at Laurel Hill last night, and are now making for Eastern Virginia, via the Louisville and Saint George pike, directs that you take the field at once, with all the force you can make available, to cut off their retreat. Two Pennsylvania regiments

at Cumberland have been directed to proceed forthwith to Rowlesburg by a special train and report to you. You can for the time being withdraw several companies from points on the railroad between Wheeling and Parkersburg, and concentrate them by special train. No time is to be lost. It is supposed you will be able to take the field with, sav, six thousand men, including Colonel Irvine’s command, and at least four guns. The rebel forces under Garnett are said to be to-night about six miles from Leadsville. Morris is following them up.
I immediately telegraphed Colonel Irvine:
The rebels are driven out of Laurel Hill, and in full retreat eastward on Saint George pike. Hold your position with firmness to the last man. I will re-enforce you in person and with all available forces as soon as possible.
It was not deemed safe to depend upon any of the Pennsylvania troops. (None came at any time or reported.)
The suggestion of six thousand troops and four guns was supposed to he an approximate rule. To comply with it near four thousand troops, in detachments scattered along the line of the two railroads to Parkersburg and Wheeling, would have to be gathered up, supplied with a reasonable amount of baggage, teams, forage, and six days’ rations, and horses and harnesses must be obtained for the three guns in battery at Grafton. Requisitions were therefore made, and by reaching to Parkersburg the figures were brought up to about 5,400 men, including detachments from the Fifth, Eighth, Thirteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Eighteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-second Ohio, with a few artillerists and cavalry, and detachments from the First and Second Virginia Regiments. These troops were almost entirely destitute of baggage wagons, and nearly all of those subsequently obtained, being otherwise appropriated, were to be got by force only.
The orders were all given and answers obtained, except as to baggage teams, by 3 m. of the 13th. The troops and three guns to be moved from Grafton were much delayed for the want of horses, harnesses, and wagons, and the first train, with four companies of infantry, was not able to leave for Oakland until after 4 p. m. I went in that train, and arrived in Oakland about 10 o’clock p. m. The second train from Grafton, with a few more infantry of the Twentieth, three guns, and twenty-five cavalry, came up soon after. For all on these two trains there was but one baggage wagon, and that belonged to Colonel Morton, of the Twentieth. As soon as the horses of myself and staff could be got off from the cars and a guide obtained, all of the infantry (three companies), not required for guard duty, were ordered forward to Chisholm’s Mill, with Major Walcutt and Captain Bond, of my staff, to report to Colonel Irvine. They arrived there at about 4 a. m. of the 14th. Found no troops there; and, leaving the three companies to rest, went on and reported in person to Colonel Irvine at West Union, at about 6 o’clock a. m., a few minutes before he received news that the rebels had already passed the Red House, at 5 a. m., eight miles farther east. Colonels Irvine and Depuy immediately called to arms and went in pursuit, Major Walcutt with them. Captain Bond returned to Oakland to notify me, but, owing to the fatigue of his horse, did not arrive until 9 a. m.
Anticipating the arrival during the night of several other trains, including that having the horses, wagons, and harnesses ordered to be taken and brought on, I had given orders for such as should come up to march at daylight, by way of Chisholm’s Mill, not then knowing any other way to reach the Red House Junction. Several trains were known to have been on the way in time to arrive at Oakland long before daylight. The train with the horses, wagons, and harnesses was reported to be at Rowlesburg before 12 the preceding night, and this property was separated, and portions of it were said to be at Cranberry Summit 15 R R—VOL II

the next morning at 9 o’clock. All the trains but the two first were equally and unaccountably delayed. From daylight till 9 o’clock my utmost efforts with the telegraph seemed to avail little or nothing. The regimental commanders, Colonels Dunning, Stanley, Morton, Smith, and Turley, were equally balked by railroad detentions. Without waiting further, the twenty-five cavalry and the few of Colonel Morton’s Twentieth Infantry had formed to move on, when Captain Bond arrived at 9 a. m. with news of the escape, as before stated.
Before this I had relied with entire confidence that the line was occupied as stated in Colonel Irvine’s telegraph of the 12th instant, instead of which it now appears that his troops were at West Union, eight miles west of the Bed House, where the Horseshoe Bun road, traveled by the rebels, intersects the Northwest pike; and it also appears by the statement of Lieut. H. A. Myers and Angier Dobbs, of the cavalry attached to Colonel Irvine’s command, that all scouts and pickets had been withdrawn, by Colonel Irvine’s order, from that road early on the 13th, and the road left entirely free all night long. On this subject see Colonel Irvine’s report, herewith presented.
As soon as possible after Captain Bond’s arrival at Oakland, the horses were taken from Colonel Morton’s baggage wagon and hitched to one of the guns, and, with the few of Colonel Morton’s infantry then arrived, started in the pursuit, while I moved on with as much dispatch as possible with my aid, Captain Bond, a guide, and twenty-five cavalry. At Bed House I found the gun sent to Colonel Irvine some days before, one company of his infantry, and a few prisoners captured that morning. Ordering forward all but eight of the cavalry, I stopped a few moments to gather information and make dispositions rendered necessary in consequence of the (since found to be erroneous) reports that there was a body of rebel troops yet to come up. I moved forward again with five of the cavalry, and soon overtook Colonels Irvine, Depuy, and their commands, which were halted about six miles east of the Bed House. A council was immediately called, including the field officers and captains of all the companies, in order to learn the actual condition of the men and all other facts that should govern the action of the command. A free interchange of facts and opinions occurred, when the facts found and opinions arrived at were, that the enemy had passed the Bed House, about three thousand strong, including from three to five guns and several hundred cavalry, before 5 o’clock in the morning, the artillery covering the rear.
That the very sparse settlements along the line of the march had been and were being so stripped of provisions by the enemy that no reliance could be placed upon getting any kind of supplies in their track.
That none of the companies that marched over the night before from Oakland had any supper, and that very few, if any, in the whole command had any breakfast, and the haversacks were almost entirely empty, and wholly so with the most of the men.
There did not appear to be on an average one day’s rations for the men then on the march drawn and unconsumed. For the whole but one wagon; and all there was in the way of means of transportation, provisions, camp equipage, and cooking utensils had been left in the rear and in camp.
The whole force then in the column, I think, did not exceed 1,300 men.
If the pursuit continued, the march for many miles must be over the ranges of the Alleghany Mountains, with no known possibility of cutting the enemy oft* or attacking him in flank, even though the pursuers could overtake the pursued. The mounted scouts, reconnoiter-

ing to the front, were sent out before my arrival, and did not report to me. I cannot, therefore, state from them the distance between the two armies before our return ; but Colonels Irvine and Depuy, in their reports, state the least distance to have been eight miles, and that while our command was halted the enemy had reached Stony Eiver.
Captain Keys, who, after overtaking Colonel Irvine, led the small detachment of cavalry, and serving as an advance guard, told me since our return that he saw none of the enemy, except a few stragglers a long distance off.
The fatigued condition of our men, and all of the matters above being considered in council (except the distance between forces, which was subject to speculation), a distinct vote was taken upon the question whether the command should then continue the pursuit or return, and every officer but three, in the whole numbering about twenty, was emphatic in opposition to further pursuit in the then condition of the command, and every officer voted against going forward except one—a major, who declined voting—and in that vote I fully concurred. What any one might have done under different circumstances and in the light of different facts it is idle now to speculate.
It is proper here to say, that on the march east from the Red House no prisoners were taken, nor were abandoned arms or articles of any importance found, so far as I have been able to learn.
To be in more convenient communication with the railroad at Oakland, and nearer to their camp equipage and supplies, the troops were marched back to Red House. On the way Colonel Morton’s infantry and one gun were met about two miles from the Red House. On arriving at Red House it was found that there were not provisions enough to give all of our troops there assembled one full meal without drawing from Oakland, and there being as yet no means of transportation, Colonel Morton’s companies and two companies of the Virginia troops marched back to Oakland to their dinners, suppers, and camp equipage, arriving there about 9 o’clock in the evening.
Late in the afternoon of the 14th, Col. T. R. Stanley and Lieutenant-Colonel Turley, of the Eighteenth and Twenty-second Ohio, from Clarksburg, had arrived at Oakland, and during that night Colonel Dunning, of the Fifth, also from Clarksburg, arrived at Oakland, as did Col. W. S. Smith, of the Thirteenth Regiment, at Grafton, from Parkersburg, each with his command, endeavoring to respond to my orders. In anticipation of a movement forward the next day, if meaus of transportation and horses and harnesses for the guns should be obtained, and information should come in indicating probable success in following the retreating enemy, orders were given that all of the troops at Red House and Oakland should be immediately provided with two days’ cooked rations, and be put in readiness to march. Such information did come about 2 p. m. of the 15th, and while it was being considered, and a plan of operations discussed with the commandants of regiments at Oakland, a dispatch from department headquarters at Huttonsville was received, dated the 14th, addressed to me, saying:
Garnett’s army completely routed yescerday, 13th, at 2 p. m., at Cheat River, on the Saint George road. Baggage captured; one gun taken; Garnett killed; his forces demoralized.
I charge you. to complete your operations by the capture of the remainder of his force. If you have but one regiment, attack and check them until others arrive. You may never have such another op portunity again. Do not throw it away. Conduct this movement in person, and /ollow them a Voutrance (to the utmost)!

Couriers by two different routes bad brought me intelligence that the enemy having burned the bridge at Stony River, on the Northwest pike, early in the afternoon of Sunday, had gone into camp a little east of Greenland, with intention to remain for several days, and had burned the bridge at the gap there, to protect them from a rear attack. Learning also that Stony River could be passed without serious delay; that the camp a little east of Greenland could be turned by a march from New Creek Station and also by a detour to the right in proceeding from the west by way of Greenland, and believing that a strong expedition moving with celerity might expect to reach the enemy at or before he would reach Petersburg and return in safety, I considered that such a movement would be within my discretion, and also within my instructions.
Accordingly, Colonel Stanley, with nearly 600 men of the Eighteenth Regiment, and Colonel Dunning, with 700 men of the Fifth Regiment, were ordered to move by the diagonal road from Oakland over the mountains to the bridge on the pike over the North Branch of the Potomac, there to be joined by eight companies of the Eighth Regiment, under Colonel Depuy; seven companies of the Sixteenth, under Colonel Irvine; six companies of the Fifteenth, under Col. G. W. Andrews, and two companies of the First Virginia Regiment, which were to move from Red House with the Ringgold Cavalry, Captain Keys, and two guns of Captain Damn’s battery; Colonel Morton, with six companies of the Twentieth Ohio and two Virginia companies, and Lieutenant-Colonel Turley, with five companies of the Twenty-second Ohio and two guns of Captain Damn’s battery, were ordered to proceed by railroad to New Creek Station, to attack the enemy from the north. The column to form its junction on the Northwest pike, at the North Branch of the Potomac, was to move towards Greenland, and leaving that on its left, press on to the intersection of roads leading to Petersburg and Moorefield, and to be followed by Col. Wo S. Smith, with the Thirteenth Regiment and a battery of two guns—he having been ordered up from Grafton, where he was waiting on the cars. The different columns were to, and did, keep up communication by couriers, and were to co-operate whenever the case required.
The column of Colonels Dunning and Stanley left Oakland with me at 5 p. m. on the 15th; was joined by Colonel Irvine’s column, as intended, and marched inside of the first twenty-four hours to Groves’, five miles beyond Greenland, the distance being estimated at thirty-five and a half miles from Oakland. The enemy broke up his camp near Greenland and retired as we approached that place, and reached Petersburg in the afternoon or evening of the 16th. That night we were but fourteen miles from the enemy, and scouts were sent towards Petersburg, as also towards Moorefield and Romney, to keep watch of the enemy’s movements in all directions. The column from the west, with the first division of one-third of the whole, made up of picked men, got off early the next morning, and after a four-mile march was stopped by a courier with a dispatch from Major-General McClellan, ordering the pursuit to be abandoned.
It was subsequently ascertained that the enemy had resumed his inarch in the direction of Staunton. The column would have abandoned the pursuit at any rate if the enemy could not have been reached at or in the immediate vicinity of Petersburg. The column marched back to Greenland, and there all the troops of the expedition were united, and remained for the night. The next day the entire body marched by the Northwest pike to the North Branch of the Potomac and encamped.

Sending the Eighth Regiment, Colonel Depuy, to the Red House, and the baggage around by the same route, the other troops marched to Oakland, arriving there about 10 a. m. Friday, the 19th instant. The march was certainly a very trying one, and brought out the good qualities of the officers and men to a remarkable degree. Too much could not be said in praise of the cheerful spirit and persevering fortitude of the command.
With the most active and thorough use of scouts, mounted men, and on foot, the country was ascertained to be so clear of the enemy in any force as to give no indications of his interrupting our movements during the period intended to be covered by the expedition.
Appended is a map, showing the topography of the country and the line of march. Copies of all the reports received from those constituting parts of the command are forwarded herewith. 1 regret the length of this report, but the unjust imputations cast upon me rendered it due to the service and to myself that the material facts should be stated.
They are respectfully submitted.
