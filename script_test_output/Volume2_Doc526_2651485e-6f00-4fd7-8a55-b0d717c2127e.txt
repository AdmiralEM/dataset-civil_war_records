Lynchburg, Va., June 8,18G1. Col. R. S. Garnett, Adjutant-General Virginia Forces:
Colonel : I received your dispatch to-day, and answered it in the same way, but imperfectly. There is no company of cavalry here fully armed. Two companies have double-barreled shot-guns, bought by their counties, but no sabers, and are but beginning to drill. There are two companies tolerably well drilled, with forty or fifty sabers each. One has no guns and the other a few. There are two other companies, one of which has about forty sabers and a few guns, just commencing to drill. There are about a hundred flint-lock pistols, which have been gathered from old companies. A number of sabers, of old patterns, have also been collected. All the companies want cartridge-boxes and cap-boxes. I have sent off to Henry County for some sabers and pistols which I am informed are there. All the companies here are well mounted, and would make fine companies if there were arms for them.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel Garnett :
Sir: I have the honor to report that I received official intelligence, on the Gth instant, from Major Montague, in command at this point, that this position, held by three companies Virginia volunteers, two howitzers, and two troops of cavalry, was about to be turned by a force from Newport News, as well as one up the Poquosin River. I ordered Colonel Stuart, in command of four companies of Virginia volunteers,

at that moment i)repared to march, to Blow’s Mill and Grove Landing, and Colonel Hill’s regiment of North Carolina volunteers to proceed at once to meet the enemy at the point threatened. This movement I intended to have made, at all events, on the following day. Colonel Hill met the command of Major Montague at the Half-way House, the latter having retreated, after consultation with his officers, from this position. Colonel Hill dispatched Major Montague’s command to guard the Po-quosin River, and proceeded with his regiment and two pieces of artillery to occupy and fortify this place. Colonel Stuart, in obedience to orders from me, proceeded to the bridge, on the Newport News road, which enters the York two miles above the Half-way House, and destroyed the bridge over the stream at that point, and blockaded all the country roads above it, thus rendering it almost impossible to1 turn this position without a march of at least twenty miles. On the same evening (the Gth) I inspected Colonel Stuart’s work, and slept at the Half-way House.
On the 7th I reconnoitered the Poquosin River and roads leading to it on this side, occupying the remainder of the day in devising means to supply the force here with provisions and forage.
The next day (yesterday) I arrived here, and found that the works under Colonel Hill had advanced very rapidly. In the course of these operations several collisions took place between our scouting parties and those of the enemy very creditable to our troops and citizens. Three of the latter, on horseback, met with nine of the enemy on foot, and an exchange of shots resulted in our killing one, wounding another, and taking a third prisoner. I remember the names of but two: Mr. Scott, of Texas, and Mr. Ben. Phillips, of Elizabeth City.
Previous to the arrival of Colonel Hill at this post, Captain Werth, of Virginia volunteers, then in command, proceeded to Newport News, with a small body of horsemen, for the purpose of reconnoitering. Being at the head of his men, he found himself in the enemy’s lines before he was aware of it, and, coming suddenly upon a working force, consisting of a commissioned officer and over twenty privates, he killed the commissioned officer and one private with his revolver, and the rest fled into camp, crying out, “The Virginia Horse! The Virginia Horse!” The troops encamped on the outside of the trenches rushed into them in confusion, amid which he retired to his command and returned home. Since then Newport News has been re-enforced by at least one thousand men.
Yesterday, at 1 o’clock, I received a note from Colonel Hill, stating that a considerable body of Federal troops were advancing towards his post. The cavalry having been temporarily withdrawn to the Half-way House for forage, I immediately dispatched the Hampton Troop, Captain Phillips, to report to Colonel Hill, and proceeded to this place in person. On my arrival here I found that Colouel Hill had disj>atched a portion of Company F, North Carolina regiment, under Lieutenant-Colonel Lee, and a howitzer, under Major Randolph, and another detachment of Company E, same regiment, under Major Lane, and one howitzer, under Lieutenant Wight, by different roads, to attack, and, if possible, cut off this party. The Federal troops were robbing a house when the detachment first named came in sight of them. They fled, about eighty in number. Our party gave chase. Not being able to overtake, Major Randolph discharged his howitzer into them, which appeared to take effect. They fled in great confusion, after having fired several shots, leaving one soldier, who was made prisoner, and who is now in camp. In the mean time, our other detachment, under Major Lane, met with a party of Federal troops, upon whom they fired, with what effect was not 58 r r—VOL h

known, and made one prisoner, who is also in our camp. Both of these belonged to the New York volunteers. In further explanation of this affair, I inclose an extract of a note just received from Captain Werth, on picket guard. He says:
The Rev. Mr. Adams came from Hampton last night. He saw one cart-load of wounded carried into Hampton last night, and two more carried in his buggy, which had been impressed for the occasion. A Colonel Pierce had command of the marauding party, three hundred strong. Mr. Adams learned in Hampton, from the officers, that Hampton was to be made a strong military post in one or two days. The enemy are much excited, and swear vengeance against the Virginians for their impudence.
I inclose a note in pencil from a perfectly reliable source. I omitted to state that, in place of Colonel Stuart’s, I ordered Colonel August’s whole regiment to proceed to Grove Landing, and to fortify at once strongly, in such a way as to protect his musketry and make a landing extremely difficult. Several regiments of troops ought to be in that neighborhood immediately. Grove Wharf is held ready to be destroyed, but it will take some time to effect it thoroughly. In mean time I would respectfully suggest that several steamers, loaded with provisions, wagons, harness, mules, ammunition, and men, be ordered to that point and landed, and that Mr. Haskins, who 1 believe is the owner of many steamboats, be directed to have one far down the river, to watch the enemy while these operations are being effected, and that as soon as they are concluded orders direct from headquarters be sent to Colonel August to burn the wharf immediately and effectually.
This command has been on the point of starvation here, on account of want of transportation. The means of transportation are absolutely necessary to enable me to keep the field. I can scarcely support this small command, and am exceedingly anxious to have the Louisiana and Georgia regiments in a similar position to this on the Warwick road. During last night I had a bridge built and thrown over Back Biver, to enable me to get at the enemy more easily. I hope to have another one in front of Hampton in a few nights. Both to be destroyed as.occasion may require.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDEK, Colonel, Commanding Southeastern Department.

Winder’s, Ya., June 9, 1861.
Colonel Maortjder:
I did not return from Hampton last night till after 11 o’clock. From all I could learn, I am satisfied that Hampton is within a few days to be occupied as a military post by the Federal troops. Probably the affair of yesterday may hasten this event. That the town is strongly guarded every night, and that during the night all is quiet, but during the day, particularly yesterday, all sorts of plundering was going on, both in town and country ; that Colonel Duryea has been superseded by Brigadier-General Pierce; that no protection or right of ingress or egress, in relation to Hampton, would be allowed to any but those who would take the oath of allegiance to the United States. This, in a nut shell, is about the amount of the information I gained. I learned also from a Captain Wilson that it was in contemplation soon to attack Yorktown with forty thousand men. I could ascertain no suspicion of a military position below Yorktown. I heard nothing of a naval attack at York.
